European stocks  closed little
changed, trimming earlier gains, as companies from Danone to  TNT (TNTE) 
Express NV reported results.  Danone, the owner of Evian bottled water and Activia
yogurt, climbed 3.2 percent as sales growth topped estimates.
Elan Corp. rose 3.7 percent after agreeing to be bought for $8.6
billion. TNT slumped the most in six months as the Dutch
package-delivery company posted a loss. Banca Popolare di Milano
Scrl led financial companies lower, retreating 5.9 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added less than 0.1 percent to
299.06 at the close of trading, having earlier climbed as much
as 0.7 percent. The gauge slipped 0.3 percent last week as
earnings from BASF SE and ABB Ltd. missed estimates while a
survey of purchasing managers showed euro-area manufacturing
unexpectedly expanded in July for the first time in two years.  “European equity markets are still holding up well on the
back of last week’s PMI numbers, which hints that growth in
Europe will advance in the coming quarters,” said Mark Andersen, who helps oversee $1.7 trillion as head of asset
allocation at UBS AG in Zurich. “Earnings still need to come in
stronger to support equity markets.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18
western-European markets today.  Germany ’s  DAX (DAX)  rose 0.2 percent,
while  France ’s CAC 40 and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 were little
changed. The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600
companies was 25 percent lower than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Monthly Advance  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 4.9 percent in July, the biggest
monthly gain since October 2011, as the Federal Reserve said it
remains flexible on the pace of asset purchases. Fed policy
makers begin a two-day meeting tomorrow.  U.S. gross domestic product probably rose 1 percent on an
annualized basis in the second quarter, after gaining 1.8
percent in the previous period, data will show on Wednesday,
according to a separate survey of economists. Payrolls increased
by 185,000 after a 195,000 gain in June, and the jobless rate
fell to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent, according to the median
forecast of economists before Labor Department data on Friday.  Danone (BN)  rose 3.2 percent to 59.27 euros. Second-quarter
revenue growth topped analyst estimates as the company sold more
baby-nutrition products in  China  and dairy sales climbed more
than forecast.  Elan Deal  Elan increased 3.7 percent to 11.55 euros after the Irish
drug company agreed to be bought by Perrigo Co., a U.S. maker of
over-the-counter medicines.  Royal KPN NV (KPN)  rallied 4.6 percent to 1.98 euros. Billionaire
 Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB ended an agreement with KPN that
capped the Mexican company’s stake in the Dutch phone carrier at
about 30 percent. If America Movil raises its stake above that
threshold, it would have to bid for all of KPN’s shares,
according to Dutch law.  Essilor International SA (EI)  climbed 6.2 percent to 85.62 euros
as the world’s biggest maker of eyeglass lenses agreed to buy
full control of its Transitions Optical venture from PPG
Industries Inc. for $1.73 billion to strengthen its tinted-products line.  TNT declined 4.6 percent to 5.86 euros, the largest drop
since January. The company reported a second-quarter loss of 304
million euros ($403 million), after a profit of 39 million euros
last year.  Banks Drop  A  gauge of banks  in the benchmark Stoxx 600 posted the
biggest retreat among 19 industry groups. Popolare di Milano,
 Italy ’s oldest cooperative bank, dropped 5.9 percent to 36.9
euro cents and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA lost 4.6
percent to 21 cents.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  fell 3.5 percent to 309.05 pence as  Britain’s
second-largest bank by assets  considers selling shares or
contingent convertible bonds.  The London-based lender favors issuing cheaper CoCos
instead of new stock to boost capital, according to two people
with knowledge of the talks who asked not to be identified
because no decision has been reached. The bank said it has held
talks with the Prudential Regulation Authority and will update
the market when it reports earnings tomorrow.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Europe’s biggest discount airline,
slipped 2.8 percent to 6.97 euros as first-quarter earnings
dropped 21 percent on higher fuel costs and an early Easter
travel season.  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  closed little changed, after earlier
surging as much as 6.6 percent to a 13-year high. The Paris-based firm and Omnicom Group Inc. agreed to merge in an all-stock transaction to create the word’s largest advertising
company, with $23 billion in revenue.  Havas SA, a rival French ad firm, rallied 4.7 percent to
5.66 euros, the highest price in 11 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
