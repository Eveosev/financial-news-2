CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
television network, renewed the summer hit “Under the Dome”
from novelist Stephen King for a second season, Chief Executive
Officer  Leslie Moonves  said.  King will write the first episode of the new season,
Moonves said today at an event hosted by the Television Critics
Association in Beverly Hills, California.  CBS makes online episodes of “Under the Dome” available
exclusively for Amazon Prime members four days after they are
broadcast. The show represents “a new model” for television,
Moonves said.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  hasn’t disclosed viewing numbers,
he said.  Separately, New York-based CBS is still negotiating a deal
to continue offering its programming through Time Warner Cable
Inc., Moonves said. He said he hopes to avoid a blackout by the
deadline at 5 p.m. New York time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
