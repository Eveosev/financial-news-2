Power-station coal in  China  fell to
a four-year low as industrial demand declined amid evidence the
economy is slowing.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram
at Qinhuangdao, the country’s biggest shipping port for the
fuel, slid to a range of 560  yuan  ($91.34) to 575 yuan a metric
ton as of yesterday, the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association reported today. That’s the lowest since July 27,
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices have
decreased the past six weeks.  A preliminary index of manufacturing from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics last week trailed estimates and would be
the lowest in 11 months if confirmed in the final report on Aug.
1. The economy is forecast to advance by a median 7.5 percent
this year, according to 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg this
month. Last month’s projection was 7.7 percent.  “We see weak demand from industrial users in the first
half-year, especially from heavy industrial sectors, who are
major coal users,”  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by phone. “As the economy further weakens,
we expect coal prices could go as down as 550 yuan a ton for the
second half-year.”  China’s  coal demand  rose 1.8 percent in the first six
months of 2013 to 1.93 billion tons, the China National Coal
Association said in a statement on July 18. The gain was 1
percentage point down from the same period last year and 7.6
points lower than in 2011.  Mining, Construction  Power use in secondary industries, which include energy-intensive mining, manufacturing and construction companies,
climbed 4.9 percent in the first half-year, the China
Electricity Council said in a  statement  on July 26. The
nationwide average is 5.1 percent.  Gross domestic product increased 7.5 percent in April-to-June from a year earlier, down from 7.7 percent in the first
quarter. Growth was the slowest in three periods and extended
the longest streak of sub-8 percent expansion in at least two
decades.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
