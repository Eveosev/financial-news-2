South Africa  will appoint a
presidential task team to focus on accelerating growth in
Africa’s largest economy, Gwede Mantashe, secretary-general of
the ruling  African National Congress , said.  Members of the task team will probably be announced after a
cabinet planning meeting that’s due to take place in the middle
of August, Mantashe told reporters in Johannesburg today.  “We will appoint a task team to consult on how the
bottlenecks to growth can be addressed,” he said.  The economy is set to expand at its slowest pace since a
2009 recession this year as a recession in Europe and mining
strikes curb exports. The central bank has cut its forecast for
economic growth for this year to 2 percent from 2.4 percent.
That’s less than half the rate of expansion the government says
is necessary to reach a goal of creating 5 million jobs by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
