Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) , the most
indebted U.S. real-estate services company, will seek to
negotiate a lower  interest rate  on its most senior debt
obligations next year.  The firm is planning to reduce how much it pays on a $1.9
billion term loan that it repriced in February, according to
Anthony Hull, the chief financial officer. It currently pays 3.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
with a 1 percent minimum on the benchmark, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  A recovery in the housing market, which has led to
Realogy’s first profitable quarter in three years, will allow
the Madison, New Jersey-based company to continue cutting its
debt costs, Hull said in a July 24 telephone interview. Realogy
has decreased its total interest expense to $255 million from
$672 million a year ago, he said.  “We can reprice our  term loan  next March, so we’d probably
look at that opportunity to reduce our overall interest costs at
that point,” Hull said.  Realogy’s $325 million of 9 percent notes due January 2020
were quoted at 114.8 cents on the dollar to yield 6.18 percent
today, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Home Sales  New home  sales  gained 8.3 percent to an annualized pace of
497,000 in June, the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce
Department said July 24. Existing home  sales  fell 1.2 percent in
June to a 5.08 million annualized rate, a level 15.2 percent
higher than a year ago, the National Association of Realtors
reported July 22.  Realogy’s  net income  increased to $84 million in the three
months ended June 30, the first time it’s reported a profit
since the second quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data show. The real-estate brokerage raised $1.08 billion in an initial public
offering in October, using the proceeds to help reduce debt.  Realogy’s total obligations relative to its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to 16 times
in 2011, Bloomberg data show. Moody’s Investors Service
increased the company’s rating to B3 in December, citing
leverage that is making progress to fall below 7 times in the
next 18 months, according to a Dec. 10 report.  The company is seeking to reduce its  leverage ratio  to as
little as 3 times and use free  cash flow  to retire more debt and
to increase Ebitda to $1 billion from  $523 million  in 2012, Hull
said. Realogy may reach $915.5 million in annual Ebitda by the
end of 2014, according to the  median  of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Projected Earnings  “It really depends what happens to existing home sales and
prices over the next 12-36 months as to how fast our Ebitda gets
to those levels,” said Hull.  Realogy may repay its $700 million of 7.875 percent notes
when they become callable at 103.9 cents on the dollar in
February 2015, Hull said. Those securities were quoted at 109.1
cents on July 26, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Leon Black ’s  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  took Realogy
private in April 2007 with $920 million of its own money as part
of an $8.3 billion leveraged buyout, just before the housing
downturn. Apollo returned twice its investment on the six-year-old transaction after selling 25.1 million shares in the company
for $47.57 a share, or $1.2 billion, in a secondary public
offering July 16, Realogy said in a July 18 regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
