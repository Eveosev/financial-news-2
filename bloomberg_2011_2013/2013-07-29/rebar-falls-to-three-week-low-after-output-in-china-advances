Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell to the lowest level in almost three weeks after
crude steel production in  China  rose.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to 3,627 yuan ($592) a
metric ton, the lowest since July 10, and was at 3,645 yuan at
11:14 a.m. local time.  Daily crude steel output nationwide in mid-July rose 2.3
percent to 2.13 million tons from the first 10 days of the
months, according to Shanghai-based Xiben New Line, citing data
from the China Iron & Steel Association.  “Producers may increase output as their profit margin
returns, and that has cooled traders’ bullishness,” Dang Man,
analyst at Maike Futures Co., said from Xi’an.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 0.4
percent to $132.60 a ton on July 26, the highest since April 30,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. The average  spot price  for
rebar was unchanged at 3,470  yuan  on the same day, the highest
since May, according to data from Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
