South African yellow corn futures
fell to the lowest level in more than three months, tracking
prices in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer.  Yellow corn for delivery in September, the most active
contract, fell 0.2 percent to 2,114 rand a metric ton by the
midday close in Johannesburg, the lowest closing level since
April 24. The white variety for December delivery gained 0.2
percent to 2,306 rand a ton.  Corn fell for a sixth day on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending a slide to a 33-month low as temperatures in central
 Iowa  and  Illinois , the top two growing states, were forecast to
remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) through
at least tomorrow, according to National Weather Service data.  “The lower American price from the midday close on Friday
and today’s continuation led to our yellow maize being low,”
Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based
Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also called maize. Meal from the white grain is a staple food
and the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.4 percent to 3,273
rand a ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
