Arthur Samberg , the founder of
Pequot Capital Management Inc., and  Mario Gabelli , chairman of
 Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL) , pledged a combined $40 million to Columbia
Business School to help fund a new campus.  Samberg will donate $25 million and Gabelli will give $15
million, according to an e-mailed statement from the school in
New York. Samberg and Gabelli both graduated from  Columbia
Business School  in 1967.  The new business school facility is expected to cost about
$600 million, of which $500 million has been raised, said
Christopher Cashman, a spokesman. Scheduled to open in 2018, it
will be part of Columbia University’s Manhattanville complex in
upper Manhattan.  Henry Kravis , co-founder of private equity firm
KKR & Co., and Ron Perelman, billionaire investor in Revlon and
other companies, have each donated $100 million to the school
and will have buildings named after them.  “I am extraordinarily grateful to accept these generous
pledges,”  Glenn Hubbard , dean of the business school, said in
the statement. “Thanks to their support, our new Manhattanville
campus will feature classrooms of tomorrow and other cutting-edge innovations.”  Part of the 17-acre Manhattanville campus, located about 10
blocks north of Columbia’s Morningside Heights base, is
scheduled to open in 2016 with a nine-story science center.
Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties Inc., pledged
$200 million to endow a center for neuroscience research which
will be located there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
