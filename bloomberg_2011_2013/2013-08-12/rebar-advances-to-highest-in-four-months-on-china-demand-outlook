Steel  reinforcement-bar  futures in
 Shanghai  rose for a ninth day to a four-month high on optimism
that demand will pick up in  China , the world’s largest producer
and consumer.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 3,773  yuan  ($617) a metric ton,
the highest level for a most-active contract since April 17, and
was at 3,766 yuan at 10:56 a.m. local time.  ArcelorMittal raised its outlook for China’s steel
consumption growth to 5.8 percent for this year, CEO Lakshmi
Niwas Mittal said in an earnings call last week.  Iron ore  for
immediate delivery rose for a fourth day on Aug. 7, adding 1.3
percent to $133.10 a dry ton, the highest since April 30,
according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “Prices remain strong after last week’s rally because
demand is seen improving in September and October,” said Wu Jingchen, an analyst at Capital Futures Co. “Market sentiment
is very bullish now.”  Rebar  inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell for an 18th week on Aug. 9, declining 1.9
percent to 6.67 million tons, the lowest since January.  The average spot price of rebar advanced for a fifth day on
Aug. 9, adding 0.5 percent to 3,517 yuan a ton, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
