Mexico ’s peso headed to its
strongest level in three weeks as President Enrique Pena Nieto
prepares to present a proposal today for boosting private
investment in the energy industry.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 12.593 per U.S.
dollar at 8:49 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The peso has advanced 2.3 percent this year, the
best performance among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Pena Nieto is scheduled at 11 a.m. local time to release
his plan to open the state-owned oil industry to more private
investment in a bid to bolster Mexican growth, which the central
bank says may slow to as low as 2 percent this year from 3.9
percent last year. Cesar Camacho, the head of Pena Nieto’s
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, said in an interview
on Aug. 6 that the president will propose changing the
constitution to allow production-sharing contracts.  “It’s a very significant motor for the country’s growth,”
 Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander
Mexico SAB, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.  Yields on Mexican government peso bonds maturing in 2024
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.73
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
