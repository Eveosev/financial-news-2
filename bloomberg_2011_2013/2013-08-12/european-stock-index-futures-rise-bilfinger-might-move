European stocks  closed little
changed at a 10-week high as a rally in mining companies offset
slower-than-forecast economic growth in Japan.  Fresnillo Plc soared 6.6 percent to a two-month high as
precious metals gained. Prudential Plc climbed to the highest in
more than two decades after posting a 22 percent jump in profit.
 Telekom Austria  AG dropped 1.6 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ projections.  Ladbrokes
Plc (LAD)  slid 2.6 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the U.K.
gambling company.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased less than 0.1 percent
to 306.08 at the close of trading, having earlier risen as much
as 0.2 percent ad declined 0.6 percent. The benchmark gauge
added 0.6 percent last week as better-than-forecast economic
data in Europe and  China  outweighed concern that the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce the pace of its bond-purchase program. The
measure has  rallied 9.4 percent  this year.  “Japan has delivered some conflicting data recently, but
market participants are in a positive mood and see the economy
is not on a bad road,” said Christian Zogg, who manages about
$540 million as head of equity and fixed income at LLB Asset
Management AG in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. “Stocks are still the
better bet as opposed to bonds, which should lead some large
institutional investors to rethink their investments, and that
should continue to support shares in the mid-term.”  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 33 percent lower than the average of the last 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japanese Economy  Japan ’s Topix lost 0.6 percent on a report that showed the
nation’s economy expanded an annualized 2.6 percent in the
second quarter, slowing from a revised 3.8 percent in the
previous three months. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 3.6 percent growth.  Still, the German Economy Ministry is predicting that
growth in the second quarter was about 0.75 percent, according
to a person familiar with the forecast, who asked not to be
identified because the projection is confidential. That exceeds
the 0.6 percent median of 46 economist estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The Federal Statistics Office will release the data
on Wednesday.  Euro-area stocks have risen half as much as global
benchmarks this year, leaving them cheaper than equities in the
U.S. and  Asia  as the region’s economy starts to recover from the
longest recession on record.  European Valuations  After a 7.2 percent gain in 2013 through last week, the
Euro Stoxx 50 Index trades at 12.5 times projected earnings, 6.7
percent less than in 2009, the last time the euro area was in
the final quarter of a contraction, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the U.S., where the economy is in its 10th straight
quarter of growth, the  S&P 500  is valued at 15.3 times estimated
profit and Japan’s Topix trades at 14.1 times income after Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to end two decades of deflation.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX added 0.3 percent, while
 France ’s CAC 40 and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1 percent.  Fresnillo, the world’s biggest primary silver producer,
rallied 6.6 percent to 1,103 pence, leading a gauge of mining
shares to the best performance among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600. Randgold Resources Ltd. advanced 2.5 percent to 4,841
pence. Gold and silver climbed for a fourth day.  Prudential Earnings  Prudential, the U.K.’s biggest insurer by market value,
rose 4.1 percent to 1,232 pence, the highest price since at
least September 1988. Operating profit climbed to 1.42 billion
pounds ($2.2 billion) in the first half from 1.16 billion pounds
a year earlier. That beat the 1.3 billion-pound estimate of 17
analysts provided by the company.  Catlin Group Ltd. (CGL)  rose 1.1 percent to 495.4 pence as HSBC
Holdings Plc raised the second-largest Lloyd’s of  London  insurer
by market value to overweight from neutral, meaning investors
should buy the shares.  ‘‘Catlin is the largest syndicate at Lloyd’s,” HSBC said.
“We believe that this is putting it in a very strong position
at a time when the smaller players may be challenged by the
setting up of broker facilities.”  Roche Holding AG  added 1.5 percent to 239.60 Swiss francs.
NZZ am Sonntag said the Swiss drugmaker is distancing itself
from a possible takeover of Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
without saying where it got the information. Roche was said to
have informally approached Alexion in July about a deal.  Opap SA gained 4 percent to 7.49 euros after Emma Delta, a
Cyprus-based fund, signed a contract to buy a 33 percent stake
in the Greek gambling company.  Telekom Austria  Telekom Austria (TKA)  slid 1.6 percent to 5.63 euros. Second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell to 330.3 million euros ($439 million) from
364.8 million euros a year earlier. That compared with the
average 332.7 million-euro analyst estimate.  Ladbrokes declined 2.6 percent to 193.9 pence as JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut the stock to underweight from neutral, meaning
investors should sell the shares. The brokerage cited the weak
outlook for U.K. retail and limited revenue growth in an
increasingly competitive online market.  Deutsche Boerse AG lost 2.7 percent to 53.94 euros. Equinet
Bank AG trimmed its rating on the operator of the Frankfurt
stocks exchange to sell from hold, citing the risk of consensus
earnings downgrades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
