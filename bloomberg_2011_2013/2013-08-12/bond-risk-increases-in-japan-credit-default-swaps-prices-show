The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in  Japan  rose, according to credit-default swap
traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 1 basis point to 94
basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure is set for its first increase in three trading
days after touching an almost three-week low on Aug. 9,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 118
basis points as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge last closed lower at 115.9 on Aug.
6, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 142 as of
8:45 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The benchmark, which recorded its first weekly
decrease in three in the period through Aug. 9, has ranged from
99.5 and 177.8 this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
