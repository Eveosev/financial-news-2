(Corrects to cite June in third paragraph.)  Sugar rose to the highest in six
weeks after cold weather curtailed output in  Brazil , the world’s
biggest producer. Coffee and cocoa gained while orange juice
fell.  In the second half of July, output in Brazil’s Center
South, the top sugar-growing region, fell 15 percent to 2.53
million metric tons from a year earlier amid freezing
temperatures, Unica, an industry group, said on Aug. 9. The
domestic price rose to a premium of 0.05 cent a pound to
futures, Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting said.  “People are turning bullish on stronger cash values, after
the rain delays in June and July and after frost hit some cane
areas,” James Cassidy, the head of the sugar trading desk at
Newedge Group in New York, said by telephone.  Raw sugar for delivery in October advanced 1.1 percent to
settle at 17.16 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York  after reaching 17.23 cents, the highest since June 27.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in December gained 0.4
percent to $1.261 a pound on ICE. Cocoa futures for December
delivery rose 0.8 percent to $2,499 a ton.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery lost 2.6
percent to $1.3075 a pound in New York, the fifth straight
decline, and the longest slump since June 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
