BRF SA (BRFS3) , the world’s largest meat
processor by market value, plans to appoint Claudio Galeazzi as
chief executive officer in billionaire Abilio Diniz’s first
management change since becoming chairman in April.  Galeazzi, a former CEO of the  Cia. Brasileira de
Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar  supermarket chain founded by
Diniz, will replace Jose Antonio Fay, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter who can’t be named because the
changes aren’t public. Jose Eduardo Cabral, BRF’s vice-president
for the domestic market, and Wilson Newton de Mello Neto, vice-president of institutional affairs, are leaving the company, the
person said.  Diniz, 76, is seeking to cut costs and lead the company’s
international expansion since taking over as chairman on April
9. BRF rose 1.2 percent to 51.10 reais at 12:51 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , heading to its highest close since the start of trading
in 1997.  Fay, at the helm since October 2008, will work with
Galeazzi until the end of the year, the person said. BRF’s press
office declined to comment on the management chances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
