Mozambique ’s central bank reduced
its benchmark  interest rate  to the lowest on record as inflation
decelerated.  The permanent lending facility was cut by 25 basis points,
or 0.25 percentage point, to 8.75 percent, the lowest since
December 2008 when the rate was introduced, the Maputo-based
Banco de Mocambique said in a statement posted on its  website 
today.  Mozambique has cut the rate by 6 percentage points since
last year to stimulate the economy of the southern African
nation, site of the world’s largest discovery of natural gas in
the past decade. The committee said the annual inflation rate
declined to 4.58 percent in July.  The committee “noted the slowdown observed in the behavior
of domestic inflation, as well as its improving prospects,” it
said.  The bank kept lenders’ compulsory reserves ratio at 8
percent and cut the deposit rate by 25 basis points to 1.5
percent, it said.  The Monetary Policy Committee will make its next rate
decision on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
