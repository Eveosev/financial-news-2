The biggest advance since 2010 in
the price of secondhand commodity carriers is boosting ship
owners from  Golden Ocean Group Ltd. (GOGL)  to  D/S Norden A/S (DNORD)  on
mounting confidence the industry’s worst-ever slump is ending.  The value of five-year-old Capesizes, the largest iron-ore
carriers, rose 5.7 percent to $31.4 million this year, while
Panamaxes, the biggest to navigate the Panama Canal, climbed 16
percent to $21.2 million, according to the Baltic Exchange.
Investors should buy Golden Ocean and Norden because the shares
don’t fully reflect the gains, said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an
analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo whose recommendations
on shipping companies returned 75 percent in three years.  Rising secondhand values are a sign that some investors are
getting more bullish on the outlook for shipping rates, which
tumbled as much as 95 percent from their peak in 2008. The
Baltic Dry Index, a measure of earnings across four vessel
classes, rebounded 42 percent this year as fleet growth slowed
and seaborne trade in everything from iron ore and coal to
soybeans and fertilizers expanded to a record.  “People are buying ships because they think we’re past the
bottom,” said Stavseth, who predicts that shares of Golden
Ocean will advance 7.1 percent in a year and Norden will gain 25
percent. “Rising ship prices tell us that the market is moving
in the right direction and earnings are expected to increase.”  Break Even  The Baltic Dry Index reached an 18-month high on July 1 as
rates rose for every vessel class in the gauge, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange, which publishes shipping costs
along more than 50 maritime routes. Capesize earnings more than
doubled this year and those for Panamaxes jumped 35 percent.
Both are still below the amount that owners need to break even
once financing costs are taken into account.  Capesize earnings will average $16,000 a day next year, the
average of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.
That’s more than the $14,458 anticipated in freight swaps that
traders use to bet on future transport prices, Baltic Exchange
data show. Owners need $14,500 to break even, according to RS
Platou Markets AS, an investment bank in Oslo.  Shares of Hellerup, Denmark-based Norden, with a fleet of
217 ships, rose 25 percent to 203.5 kroner this year in
Copenhagen trading. Stavseth is anticipating 255 kroner in 12
months. Stock in Hamilton, Bermuda-based Golden Ocean, led by
billionaire John Fredriksen, jumped 78 percent to 7 kroner in
Oslo in 2013 and will reach 7.50 kroner in a year, Stavseth
says.  Largest Shipbroker  The combined capacity of the dry-bulk fleet will expand 7
percent this year, the least since 2008, according to London-based  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest shipbroker. Rates plunged after
owners ordered too many new vessels just before the global
recession. The fleet grew 63 percent since 2008 as seaborne
trade in commodities advanced 24 percent.  While rates are surging this year, they are still far below
the peaks reached before the five-year slump. Capesizes earned
as much as $234,000 a day in 2008, compared with $10,550 now.
Panamax rates that last priced at $7,481 rose as high as $94,977
in 2007, Baltic Exchange data show. Panamaxes, each capable of
hauling about 75,000 metric tons of cargo, need about $11,000 to
break even, Platou says.  Vessel values are also still below their record highs. A
five-year-old Capesize sold for as much as $153.8 million in
2008 and Panamaxes were trading as high as $90.72 million in
2007. The combined market capitalization of the world’s 75
largest publicly traded shipping companies came to $118.5
billion at the end of July, from as high as $260 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Iron Ore  The rally in freight rates and vessel values is most at
risk from a slowing Chinese economy, which consumes more iron
ore, coal and metals than any other nation. The world’s second-biggest economy will expand 7.5 percent this year and next, the
weakest growth since 1990, according to the medians of 57
economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese factory production expanded at a better-than-expected 9.7 percent in July from a year ago, government data
showed Aug. 9. Gauges of manufacturing and service industries
also improved and  iron-ore imports  rose to a record last month.
Iron ore is the second-biggest seaborne commodity cargo after
oil.  The capacity glut in dry-bulk ships extends across most of
the merchant fleet. The ClarkSea Index measuring earnings for
all vessel types is poised for its lowest annual average since
at least 1990, according to Clarkson. Daily rates for very large
crude carriers, each hauling 2 million barrels of oil, are 97
percent below the record $229,000 reached in 2007.  Dry Ships  Analysts are anticipating gains in dry-bulk shipping
earnings as orders for new vessels dwindle and trade expands.
Cargo shipments will expand 5 percent to 4.28 billion tons this
year, a fourth consecutive advance, Clarkson data show. Orders
for Capesizes at shipyards now equal 16 percent of existing
capacity, from more than 99 percent in 2008, according to data
from IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon, England-based research company.  Eight out of 12 companies in the Bloomberg Dry Ships Index
will narrow losses or report a profit this year, analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Golden Ocean will report net income of $43.3 million this
year, from $11.6 million in 2012, according to the mean of 13
estimates. The analysts were anticipating as little as $30
million as recently as mid-April. Norden will report a loss of
$34.5 million, compared with $278.8 million last year, the mean
of 11 predictions shows. The company should return to profit in
2014, according to the estimates.  Norden said in May it would add $445 million of new vessels
to its fleet, the same month in which Golden Ocean also said it
would expand capacity.  “Ship owners are buying into the sector because they are
seeing a pickup in earnings in the future,” said Rune Sand, an
analyst at Carnegie SA in Oslo. “Ship values increase, and then
the share values for shipping companies also increase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
