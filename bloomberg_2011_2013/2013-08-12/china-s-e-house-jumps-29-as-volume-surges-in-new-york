E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a real-estate brokerage based in  Shanghai , surged the most in eight
months in U.S. trading as volume soared.  Its American depositary shares jumped 29 percent to $6 in
New York, the highest close since May 2012. Trading volume was
almost nine times the daily average over the past three months,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. E-house has jumped 46 percent
this year.  Analysts at Zheshang Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd. said  China ’s regulators were moving toward easing
curbs on real estate fundraising, after an Aug. 9 statement
issued by the nation’s securities regulator elaborated on
conditions for allowing financing by developers. The Financial
News daily, controlled by the central bank, published an article
today saying the nation may adjust property financing policies.  “Developers in China are being allowed to raise funds
again, adding another positive sign to the industry’s growth
outlook,” Ella Ji, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York,
said by e-mail today. “We anticipate EJ will report solid 2Q
results on Friday. In addition, its peer company SouFun had a
great run recently. It’s possible that EJ is catching up.”  E-House is  scheduled  to report its second-quarter results
before U.S. markets open on Aug. 16. Sales may increase 20
percent from a year earlier, according to the  average projection 
of two analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) ,
China’s biggest real estate information website, has surged 50
percent in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
