Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) 
rose in Mumbai trading, poised for the biggest gain in four
years, after profit, excluding a one-time charge, surged on
higher demand for its antibiotic and cancer drugs in the U.S.  The  shares  rose as much as 9.2 percent, headed for the
biggest increase since May 2009, to 552.10 rupees, before
trading at 541.55 rupees as of 12:53 p.m. local time.  India ’s
markets were closed for a holiday Aug. 9, when Sun Pharma
reported earnings.  Finished dosage sales in the U.S., the Mumbai-based
company’s biggest market, grew 28 percent to $364 million,
driven by demand for the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate and the
cancer drug Lipodox, Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Fortune Equity
Brokers (India) Ltd., wrote in a note to clients on Aug. 10.  The stock was the  second-biggest gainer  on the S&P BSE
Sensex Index, which rose 0.8 percent.  Sun Pharma reported a 56 percent increase in first-quarter
profit, excluding a $550 million one-time payment to settle
patent litigation with Pfizer Inc. Profit rose to 12.4 billion
rupees ($204 million) from 7.96 billion rupees a year earlier,
the drugmaker said in a statement Aug. 9.  Sun Pharma was allowed to import Lipodox, a generic version
of the Johnson & Johnson cancer drug Doxil, to help ease a
shortage of the drug, the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said
in February 2012. Sun Pharma won approval for the drug this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
