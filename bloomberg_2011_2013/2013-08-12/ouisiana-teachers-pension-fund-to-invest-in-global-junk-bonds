The Teachers’ Retirement System of
Louisiana, the manager of $14.7 billion in public employee
pension funds, hired  AllianceBernstein LP (AB)  last week to invest
$325 million in global high-yield debt.  The retirement fund reallocated the money, it’s first foray
into overseas speculative-grade bonds, to get higher returns in
Europe and Asia than are available in the U.S., according to
Dana Brown, the system’s director of public markets.  Money mangers are looking further down the rating spectrum
and to non-U.S. assets for extra yield as the  Federal Reserve 
has suppressed  interest rates  in an effort to boost economic
growth. The average yield investors demand to hold euro-denominated high-yield notes rather than  government securities 
was 490 basis points Aug. 8, 10 basis points higher than spreads
on U.S. junk debt, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  “If rates are extremely low in the U.S., and there is some
disconnect in credit opportunities in Europe and places in Asia,
now is the time to branch out to see what is available,” Brown
said. “We’re broadening our diversification.”  AllianceBernstein will be allowed to include senior  bank
loans  in the high-yield investments if the firm “views that is
prudent,” Brown said in an Aug. 7 telephone interview.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and less than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
