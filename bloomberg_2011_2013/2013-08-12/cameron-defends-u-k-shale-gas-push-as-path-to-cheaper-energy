U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said shale gas will bring down power bills for Britons, writing
to defend his push to kick-start the industry in the country.  Cameron, whose Conservative party government has pledged to
create the world’s most generous tax system for shale, wrote in
the Daily Telegraph newspaper that the industry will also create
jobs and bring money to local neighborhoods.  He said it’s a myth that fracking, the technique that
blasts rock with water, sand and chemicals to release fuel, is
unsafe and will damage the countryside.  Fracking has sparked protests and caused drilling delays
for Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. in Balcombe, a West Sussex town in
southern  England . Demonstrators have also targeted drilling
sites in Lancashire in the north of the country.  “Fracking has become a national debate in Britain -- and
it’s one that I’m determined to win,” he wrote in the
newspaper. “If we don’t back this technology, we will miss a
massive opportunity to help families with their bills and make
our country more competitive.”  Cameron’s comments come after  Michael Fallon , the energy
minister with responsibility for fracking, said earlier this
month that shale reserves may be exploited in southern England.  Tim Farron, president of the Liberal Democrat party in
coalition government with Cameron’s Conservatives, was quoted in
the Sunday Telegraph newspaper as saying fracking may damage
rural areas for decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
