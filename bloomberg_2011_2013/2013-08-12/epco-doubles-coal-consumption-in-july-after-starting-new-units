Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ,  Japan ’s
biggest power company by generation capacity, nearly doubled its
coal consumption in July from a year earlier after starting new
units that use the cheaper fuel.  The utility, known as Tepco, used 745,000 metric tons of
coal last month, the most since at least  April 2003 , the
earliest data available on the company’s website. Crude and fuel
oil consumption fell by about 18 percent and 30 percent,
respectively, the figures show.  Tepco has been increasing its use of coal since it began
test operations of two coal-fired units, with a combined
capacity of 1,600 megawatts, in April. All of the company’s 13
nuclear reactors have been shut after the 2011 Fukushima atomic
disaster, forcing it to rely on coal, oil and natural gas to
meet demand.  Coal-fired power generation  cost  9.5 yen (10 cents) per
kilowatt hour, while liquefied natural gas and oil cost 10.7 yen
and 36 yen, respectively, a government panel said in December
2011.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal for July. Fuel oil and crude
volumes are in kiloliters, while LNG and coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
