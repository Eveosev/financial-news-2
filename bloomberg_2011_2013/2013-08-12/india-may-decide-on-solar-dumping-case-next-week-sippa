India  may decide next week whether
to impose duties on imports of solar equipment, according to the
country’s Solar Independent Power Producers Association lobby.  A deadline for submissions to a government study on imports
was extended to today, said Jagdish Agarwal, secretary of the
group representing project developers opposed to tariffs that
would raise building costs. The original deadline was July 25.  J.S. Deepak, the Commerce Ministry official overseeing the
case, didn’t respond to a call and e-mail seeking confirmation.  Indosolar Ltd. (ISLR) , Jupiter Solar Power Ltd. and Websol Energy
System Ltd., Indian producers of photovoltaic cells and modules,
pushed for the government investigation after saying foreign
competitors from the U.S.,  China , Taiwan and Malaysia had sold
products at below cost in India. Last month, they petitioned to
expand the probe to imports from the European Union and Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
