KfW Group, a German development
bank, is financing a 42-megawatt wind-farm project by  France ’s
Akuo Energy SAS in Uruguay.  KfW’s IPEX export bank is providing a long-term loan of as
much as $79.5 million for the Minas project in Uruguay’s
Lavalleja region, the lender said today in an e-mailed
statement. Eighty percent of the loan is covered by a guarantee
from Danish export credit insurer Eksport Kredit Fonden.  The wind farm will use 14 turbines made by  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  and produce enough energy for about 40,000
households, KfW said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
