Bilfinger SE (GBF) ,  Germany ’s second-largest builder, predicts the second half of the year will be
“significantly stronger” on rising demand in the U.S. The
stock gained as much as 3 percent.  “Further recovery of the U.S. domestic economy is expected
for the second half of 2013,” Mannheim, Germany-based Bilfinger
said in a statement. “In  Europe , it can be assumed that the
situation of the crisis countries will continue to stabilize as
the year progresses.”  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s third-largest maker of
cement, posted profit in the second-quarter that exceeded
analysts’ expectations as sales in  North America  and the
recovering U.K. market offset declines elsewhere in Europe.
Bilfinger Chief Executive Officer  Roland Koch  plans to focus on
deals outside Europe, particularly in the U.S., with the 850
million euros ($1.1 billion) he has available.  The shares gained as much as 2.14 euros to 74.23 euros and
were up 2.8 percent as of 10:25 a.m. in Frankfurt trading,
valuing Bilfinger at 3.3 billion euros. Before today, the stock
had dropped 1.3 percent while the DAX benchmark index had risen
10 percent.  Second-quarter net profit fell 39 percent from a year
earlier to 47 million euros as declines in the facilities and
construction units outweighed increases at the industrial and
power divisions. That was in line with the average estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Output volume was steady at
2.17 billion euros while orders increased 2.6 percent to 2
billion euros.  Service Push  Acquisitions lie at the core of Koch’s strategy to turn
Bilfinger from a construction company into a services provider
with net income of about 400 million euros in 2016. Part of the
plan is to reduce exposure to higher-risk, lower-margin
construction projects.  Koch, the former prime minister of the state of Hesse, is
planning deals in the 300 million euros to 400 million euros
range, with the energy sector and industrial services high
priorities.  Bilfinger reiterated its full-year forecast for an
improving Ebita and adjusted net profit from the 2012 levels of
378 million euros and 231 million euros respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
