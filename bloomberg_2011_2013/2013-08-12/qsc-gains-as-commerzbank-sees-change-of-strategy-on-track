QSC AG (QSC)  rose to a 2 1/2-year high
after Commerzbank AG said the German company’s second-quarter
earnings indicate that a strategy shift to providing information
technology from operating telecommunications is still on track.  QSC  increased  as much as 11 percent to 3.35 euros, the
highest intraday price since January 2011, and traded up 10
percent at 12:58 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 412
million euros ($548 million). Volume was almost quadruple the
three-month daily average.  Second-quarter  earnings , before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 6.1 percent from a year
earlier to 19.2 million euros, the Cologne-based company said in
a statement today, reiterating its forecasts for 2013. That beat
the 18.7 million-euro average of six analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. New orders at the direct-sales unit jumped 2.5
times to 30.5 million euros.  The figures “indicate sound execution of QSC’s transition
path” to information communications technology, Heike Pauls, a
Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank, said in a report today.
“Taken together with a sound order entry, results seem to
support our view of returning headline growth as of next year”
after revenue  fell  in the first two quarters of 2013. She
recommends buying the stock, and estimates the share price will
reach 3.40 euros.  QSC  bought  German companies IP Partner AG and INFO AG in
2011 to help with its strategy move to activities including
cloud-computing services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
