(Corrects team name in headline.)  The Baltimore Ravens agreed in
principle on a contract with former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas
Clark after losing Dennis Pitta and Ed Dickson to injuries.  Clark, 34, spent nine of his 10 National Football League
seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, where he was a favorite
target of quarterback Peyton Manning. While in Indianapolis, he
also played under former Colts coach Jim Caldwell, who is now
the Ravensâ€™ offensive coordinator.  Clark spent last season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
catching 47 passes for 435 yards and four touchdowns. He had a
career-high 100 receptions for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns for
the Colts during the 2009 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
