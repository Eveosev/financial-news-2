Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC) , the Calgary-based oil producer with most of its operations in Colombia, rose
the most in eight weeks after saying it was able to produce oil
from a test well.  The shares advanced 10 percent to 11,280 pesos at 1:17 p.m.
in Bogota, set for the biggest gain since June 18. It was the
biggest advance on the Colcap equity index, which was little
changed.  Petrominerales said in a statement today that a test of its
Taya-1 well produced 5,218 barrels of oil per day.  The oil explorer has lost 23 percent this year, the biggest
decline on the Colcap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
