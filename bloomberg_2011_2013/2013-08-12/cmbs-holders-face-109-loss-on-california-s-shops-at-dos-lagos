Losses on soured debt linked to a
 California  shopping center that was foreclosed on more than
three years ago surpassed 100 percent, spurring ratings cuts on
one of the last bond deals before the property-market collapse.  The Shops at Dos Lagos was sold for $30 million last month,
prompting  Fitch Ratings  to downgrade almost a quarter of the
original $1.16 billion commercial-mortgage backed securities
offering from JPMorgan Chase & Co. in 2008, the rating company
said in an Aug. 9 report. The Corona, California, property was
valued at $170 million in April of that year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The mortgage on the 351,000 square-foot retail outlet went
bad seven months after it was sold to investors as part of
JPMorgan’s $1.16 billion transaction, sending bond buyers
fleeing from the $550 billion market on concern that the loan
portended a surge in defaults on boom-era deals. Late payments
reached a record 9.01 percent in July 2011, according to Fitch.  Delinquencies on commercial-mortgages contained in bonds
are declining, falling 40 basis points to 6.78 percent last
month, according to Fitch. The rate on transactions sold in
2007, when  Wall Street  arranged a record $232 billion of the
bonds, is 13.7 percent, Wells Fargo & Co. analysts led by
Marielle Jan De Beur said in a July 31 report.  Limited History  The outstanding loan on the Riverside County property was
$124 million, accounting for 12.4 percent of the JPMorgan bond
offering, Credit Suisse analysts led by Roger Lehman said in a
report today. The building’s sale will lead to a 109 percent
loss after fees and other expenses, according to Fitch.  The shopping center, constructed in 2006 and 2007, had a
limited history when the mortgage was taken out and was financed
assuming revenues would rise. So-called pro-forma lending was
common during the property-market boom.  The retail property was part of a two-stage development
that included a residential section, golf course, hotel and a
135-acre wildlife preserve, according to Fitch. The loan was
sent to a servicer that deals with troubled mortgages in
November 2008 when the borrower indicated that the housing
crisis in  Southern California  had slowed the development’s
progress and eroded revenues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
