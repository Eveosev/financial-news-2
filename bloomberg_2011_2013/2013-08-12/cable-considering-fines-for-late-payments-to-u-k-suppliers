U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
is in talks with small and medium-sized companies about how to
make their customers pay their bills promptly.  Cable has yet to make a decision on the best way to help
small firms and is considering a fine for late payments as one
option, a spokeswoman for his department said on condition of
anonymity in line with government rules. An announcement is due
toward the end of the year.  Cable is concerned that late payment is creating cash-flow
difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
