The Financial Stability Board said
an extended version of its guidance on the resolution of
systemically important banks will apply to non-bank financial
institutions, such as  Allianz SE (ALV)  and other large insurers.  The Basel, Switzerland-based body set up by the Group of 20
nations has developed “annexes” to its advice for local
regulators of financial institutions that aren’t lenders,
according to an e-mailed statement today. The FSB asked for
responses from market participants by Oct. 15.  The FSB, led by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, is
coordinating the global regulatory response to the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression to prevent a repeat
of the turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and bailout of American International Group Inc.  “The standards as originally conceived were meant to cover
all types of systemic institutions,” Eva Huepkes, a Basel-based
adviser to the FSB secretary, said in a telephone interview.
While the FSB originally focused on the biggest banks, “today’s
consultation sets out how the resolution standards apply
specifically to non-banks,” she said.  Last month, the FSB published a list of nine too-big-to-fail insurers, including Allianz,  American International Group
Inc. (AIG) ,  MetLife Inc. (MET) ,  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  Axa SA. (CS)   The FSB “set out the core elements considered necessary to
make feasible the resolution of financial institutions without
severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to
losses,” it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
