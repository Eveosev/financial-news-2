Japanese  shares  fell, amid the
thinnest trading volume on the  Topix (TPX)  index this year, as gross
domestic product missed estimates and developers led losses
among the gauge’s 33 subsectors.  Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,  Japan ’s third-biggest
property company, sank 6.1 percent as the Topix Real Estate
Index declined. Yokogawa Electric Corp., which makes electronic
components, fell the most on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after
earnings slipped. Bridgestone Corp., Japan’s No. 1 tiremaker,
advanced 2.8 percent after raising its full-year profit
forecast. Citizen Holdings Co. surged the most in 37 years after
the watchmaker boosted its net-income outlook.  The Topix lost 0.6 percent to 1,134.62 at the close in
 Tokyo  after climbing as much as 0.2 percent. Volume was 34
percent below the 30-day average as about 1.8 billion shares
 changed hands , the fewest since December. The  Nikkei 225  slipped
0.7 percent to 13,519.43. The Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index
of smaller companies tumbled 7.2 percent.  “As investors digest the GDP numbers, the drop in the
market for start-up companies is spreading to larger stocks,”
said Toshikazu Horiuchi, a market analyst at Iwai Cosmo Holdings
Inc. in Tokyo. “With Japan’s vacation season in full swing,
there are hardly any buy-and-sell orders, and even one small
sell can affect the market.”  Japan’s gross domestic product expanded at an annualized
2.6 percent in the second quarter, from a revised 3.8 percent
gain in the previous three months, the Cabinet Office reported
today in Tokyo. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 3.6 percent growth.  GDP Deflator  “Headline GDP was poor but consumption is higher and
deflation is becoming less of a problem,” said Stuart Beavis,
head of institutional equity derivatives at Vantage Capital
Markets in  Hong Kong .  The GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices across the
economy, fell 0.3 percent in the three months ended June from a
year before, the smallest drop since the third quarter of 2009,
today’s report showed. A separate  gauge of corporate-goods
prices  released by the BOJ today showed an increase of 2.2
percent, the biggest since August 2011.  Consumer spending , which accounts for about 60 percent of
the economy, contributed 1.9 percentage points to the annualized
real growth rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted
1.1 percentage points as companies drew down stocks of unsold
goods at the fastest pace since 2011.  The yen touched 95.93 per dollar today before reversing its
gain and falling 0.5 percent against the greenback. The Japanese
currency reached 95.81 on Aug. 8, the strongest since June 19.  Largest Declines  Japanese equities posted the biggest drops among major
developed markets last week, with the Topix sinking 4.6 percent,
the most since June 7. After falling for the past three months,
the Topix is still up about 32 percent this year.  Real-estate shares led declines and exerted the biggest
drag on the Topix today. Sumitomo Realty slumped 6.1 percent to
4,030 yen. Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s biggest developer by
market value, dropped 2.6 percent to 2,485 yen.  Hulic Co. (3003)  slid
6.8 percent to 1,122 yen.  Yokogawa Electric sank 9.2 percent to 1,229 yen, the most
since November. The Tokyo-based company reported on Aug. 9 that
first-quarter net income dropped 63 percent to 1.5 billion yen.
It also kept its 13.5 billion yen full-year forecast unchanged,
missing the median  analyst estimate  of 17.4 billion yen.  Bridgestone, Citizen  Among stocks that rose, Bridgestone advanced 2.8 percent to
3,445 yen, as the Topix Rubber Products Index rose the most
among the broader gauge’s groups. The tiremaker raised its net-income forecast to 246 billion yen from 235 billion yen, while
boosting its outlook for operating profit to 400 billion yen
from 382 billion yen.  Citizen Holdings surged 17 percent to 640 yen, the most
since 1976. The  producer  of watches and machine tools boosted
its full-year profit forecast 5 percent to 10.5 billion yen
after net income jumped 31 percent to 2.6 billion yen.  With almost all Nikkei 225 companies having already
reported earnings, profit surged 103 percent and beat analysts’
estimates by 16 percent, the most in two years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income for Topix companies
jumped 93 percent in the period, the data show.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. The measure lost 0.4 percent on Aug. 9, capping its
biggest weekly loss since June, as investors pulled money from
exchange-traded funds and weighed growing signs the  Federal
Reserve  will cut stimulus this year.  The Topix traded at 1.19 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.71 for the Stoxx Europe 600
