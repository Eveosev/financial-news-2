Canadian  stocks  rose after three
weeks of losses as China boosted purchases of precious metals
and  BlackBerry (BB)  Ltd.’s board said it is considering selling the
company.  BlackBerry jumped 10 percent, the most since March, as it
announced it will form a special board committee to consider
options for the company including joint ventures and
partnerships. Barrick Gold Corp. and Eldorado Gold Corp. surged
at least 4.1 percent as the metal capped the longest rally in
four weeks. Silvercorp Metals Inc. and Silver Wheaton Corp.
advanced more than 5.2 percent as silver prices gained.  Alliance
Grain Traders Inc. (AGT) , a seller of specialty crops such as lentils,
gained 5.1 percent after reporting better-than-estimated
earnings.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 52.14
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,594.27 at 4 p.m. in Toronto.
Trading volume was 8.3 percent higher than the 30-day average at
this time of the day.  “You’re starting to see a bit of outperformance in the TSX
on the back of strength in  China ,” said Brian Huen, managing
partner with Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in Toronto. His
firm manages C$220 million ($214 million). “The Chinese are
aggressively buying precious metals, so gold import numbers were
quite healthy and that’s leading to a rally in materials.”  China’s domestic purchases of gold jumped 54 percent to
706.4 metric tons in the first half of 2013, compared with a
year earlier, the China Gold Association said in a report today.
Buying of gold-bar purchases surged 87 percent and jewelry
demand increased 44 percent.  Gold Surges  Barrick Gold advanced 4.1 percent to C$18.74 and Eldorado
Gold surged 7.6 percent to C$8.76 as all 24 companies in the
S&P/TSX Gold Index advanced. The gauge jumped 5.8 percent to
1,649.24, its highest close since July 23. Gold prices rose 1.7
percent to settle at $1,334.20 an ounce in New York. Gold
climbed for a fourth straight day, the longest rally since July
11.  Silvercorp Metals (SVM)  jumped 10 percent to C$3.52 and Silver
Wheaton added 5.2 percent to C$25.26. Silver for September
delivery soared to a seven-week high.  Torex Gold Resources Inc. (TXG)  surged 12 percent to C$1.57.
Killian Charles, an analyst at Industrial Alliance Securities
Inc., began coverage of the stock today with a buy  rating  and a
price target of C$1.80.  The company’s Morelos gold mine in  Mexico  is expected to
begin production in 2015 and “will work in any gold price
environment,” Charles said in a note to clients.  Strategic Alternatives  BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, rose 10 percent to
C$11.10, the biggest gain since March 13. The announcement today
builds on a move last year when BlackBerry hired JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and RBC Capital Markets to advise the company on strategic
alternatives. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said a sale wasn’t the “main direction” he was
considering. Prospects have worsened since then, with the new
BlackBerry 10 -- the linchpin of a turnaround strategy --
meeting scant demand.  Aimia Inc. (AIM)  climbed 4.1 percent to C$15.93, the highest
close in three months. The loyalty program manager said today
Toronto-Dominion Bank will become the primary credit-card issuer
for its Aeroplan loyalty cards.  The deal ends a 22-year allegiance between Aimia and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. CIBC didn’t match TD Bank’s
June conditional agreement with Aimia by an Aug. 9 deadline and
is now negotiating a sale of half its Aerogold credit-card
portfolio to the other bank.  CIBC gained 2 percent to C$78.47 while TD Bank slipped 0.3
percent to C$86.41.  Alliance Grain Traders increased 5.1 percent to C$16.48,
the most in three months. The Regina, Saskatchewan-based
company, which buys, processes and sells food ingredients
including pasta and rice, reported second-quarter adjusted
earnings of 24 Canadian cents a share, ahead of analysts’
estimates for 16 cents. The company said it is “optimistic” as
it heads into the North American harvest period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
