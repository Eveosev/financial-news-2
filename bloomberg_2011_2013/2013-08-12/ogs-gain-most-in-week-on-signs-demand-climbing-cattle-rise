Hog futures climbed, heading for the
biggest gain in a week, on speculation that U.S. grocers are
increasing purchases before the Labor Day holiday. Cattle prices
also rose.  Wholesale-pork prices added 1.4 percent last week, the
third straight weekly gain, government data show. Grocers tend
to buy more before the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2, when people
usually barbecue and meat demand rises.  “You should have some buying interest coming in from Labor
Day weekend,” Mark Schultz, a chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co., said in a telephone interview from
 Minneapolis . There’s “pretty good movement, too, for the
pork,” he said.  Hog futures for October settlement gained 1.6 percent to
86.35 cents a pound at 9:48 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest increase for the most-active
contract since Aug. 5.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.27425 a pound on the CME. Prices added 1.9 percent last week.  The commodity surged the most in six months on Aug. 8 after
 Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the biggest U.S. meat processor, said that it
would ban purchases of cattle fed Zilmax, a feed supplement made
by Merck & Co., effective Sept. 6. Prices will go higher if
other processors ban the use of the drug, meaning fewer cattle
coming to market, Schultz said. Cargill Inc. said that it plans
to keep buying animals fed additives.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement advanced 0.4
percent to $1.5805 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
