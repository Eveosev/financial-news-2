China Hongqiao Group Ltd. (1378) , the
nation’s largest non-state aluminum producer, is accelerating
expansion to take advantage of low raw material prices, even as
the government seeks to trim capacity amid a global glut.  “The government wants to shut down outdated capacity while
Hongqiao is a good company that has the best equipment and
efficient energy consumption,” Chief Executive Zhang Bo told
reporters in Hong Kong today. “Good companies will keep
expanding and gaining market share, forcing those with outdated
capacity out of the market.”  Hongqiao expects to have nearly 3 million metric tons of
capacity by the end of this year, up from 2.46 million tons
currently, as the company builds new facilities while prices of
raw materials such as steel and cement are low, Zhang said.
 China ’s Premier Li Keqiang wants to bring forward to the end of
2014 a target to eliminate outdated capacity in industries
including aluminum.  Hongqiao’s previous target was to lift capacity to 2.7
million tons by the end of next year. The company on Aug. 9
posted a 1.1 percent drop in first-half net income to 2.81
billion  yuan .  In July, the company said it will boost production by about
10 percent to 2 million tons this year, even as top global
producers including Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,  United Co.
Rusal (486)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  cut output due to worldwide oversupply.  Shares of Hongqiao gained 2.4 percent to HK$4.30 as of 2:09
p.m. in Hong Kong trading. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
was up 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
