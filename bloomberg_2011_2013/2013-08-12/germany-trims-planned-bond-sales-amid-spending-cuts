German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government expects to cut planned 2014 bond sales, predicting
increased tax collections and reduced spending will help keep
its budget balanced, a draft federal spending plan shows.  Germany plans to sell 216.5 billion euros ($287 billion) of
bonds in 2014 compared with 240 billion euros this year, the
3,358-page document shows. That includes 107.6 billion euros of
bonds with a maturity of at least four years, compared with
114.5 billion euros this year, the provisional plan shows.  Sales of debt with a maturity less than four years,
including bills, will be cut to 108.9 billion euros from 125.6
billion euros, according to the draft, a copy of which was
obtained by  Bloomberg News . The provisional sales program was
compiled the  Finance Ministry  for the 2014 budget, which sets a
spending ceiling of 295.4 billion euros against expected outlays
this year of 310 billion euros.  Finance Ministry spokesman  Bertrand Benoit  said in a
telephone interview today that he was not immediately able to
comment on the budget draft, which was distributed to lawmakers
in Berlin today.  Tax-revenue growth and spending curbs will narrow the gap
that Merkel has to close with net new credit next year. Revenue
from taxes and fees will add up to about 288 billion euros or
6.1 billion euros less than spending, the draft shows. The gap
will be closed by tapping bond sales equal to that amount.  Fitch Ratings  last week affirmed Germany’s long-term
foreign and euro default ratings at AAA with its outlook stable.
“The government has overachieved on some key fiscal targets,”
Fitch said in an e-mail. Federal debt climbed to 1.29 trillion
euros  by  March 31, compared with the 636.5 billion euros owed by
the states.  Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  have pledged to cut taxes if
she wins a third term in Sept. 22 elections. Merkel’s
challenger, Social Democrat Peer Steinbrueck aims to raise
income taxes if elected. Steinbrueck’s SPD plan to lift the top
 tax rate  to 49 percent from 42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
