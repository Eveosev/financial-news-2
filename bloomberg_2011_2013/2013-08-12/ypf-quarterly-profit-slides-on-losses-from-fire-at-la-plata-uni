YPF SA (YPF) ,  Argentina ’s largest oil
company, said second-quarter profit slid 36 percent after losses
from a fire at the country’s largest refinery.  Net income dropped to 535 million pesos ($97 million), or
1.36 pesos a share, from 833 million pesos, or 2.12 pesos, a
year earlier, Buenos Aires-based YPF said in a regulatory filing
today.  YPF had said it would have to spend an extra $400 million
to import fuel to supply its gas stations after output was
reduced by a flood and fire April 2 at its La Plata refinery.
The refinery cut daily output of 28,500 cubic meters (180,000
barrels) by 15 percent until at least the end of this year, the
company said April 8.  “Activities in the second quarter were affected by
unprecedented storms impacting the La Plata refinery,” YPF said
in the filing. “This event not only caused physical damage to
certain assets of the company but also impacted on operating
margins.”  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government
seized a 51 percent YPF stake from  Spain ’s Repsol SA in April
2012 to stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion in 2011
and cost the country $10 billion in 2012. Chevron Corp. signed a
$1.24 billion accord July 16 to help YPF develop the Vaca Muerta
shale formation and is seeking more partners for a $37 billion
5-year expansion plan at the world’s second-largest shale gas
deposit and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir.  YPF is scheduled to have an earnings conference call with
investors at 12 p.m.  New York  time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
