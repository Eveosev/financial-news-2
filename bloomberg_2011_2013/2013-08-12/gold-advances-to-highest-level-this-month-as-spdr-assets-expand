Gold futures rose, capping the
longest rally in four weeks, as demand surged in  China , the
world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal last year. Silver
jumped to a seven-week high.  The China Gold Association said today that purchases rose
54 percent to 706.4 metric tons in the first half from a year
earlier. Demand surged 87 percent for bars and 44 percent for
jewelry demand. Last month, futures in  New York  jumped 7.3
percent, the most since January 2012.  “Physical demand, especially out of China, continues to
support prices,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures &
Options in  Port St. Lucie ,  Florida , said in a telephone
interview. “The sentiment is bullish today.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.7 percent to
settle at $1,334.20 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal climbed for the fourth straight session, the
longest rally since July 11. Earlier, the price reached
$1,343.70, the highest for a most-active contract since July 24.  This year, China may overtake  India  as the top consumer.  On Aug. 9, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded  product  backed by the metal, rose 0.2 percent to
911.13 tons, the first increase in 60 days, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Assets have tumbled 33 percent this year as some
investors lost faith in the commodity as a store of value amid a
U.S. equity rally and low inflation.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 4.6 percent
to $21.339 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$21.395, the highest since June 19. The metal advanced for the
third straight session, the longest rally since July 11.  This year, silver has slumped 29 percent, and gold has
dropped 20 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,498.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$737.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
