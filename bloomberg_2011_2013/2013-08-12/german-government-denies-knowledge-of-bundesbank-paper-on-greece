The German Finance Ministry
dismissed a report that Europe may need to provide more aid for
Greece as soon as this year, saying that the Greek government is
making good progress in meeting the terms of its bailout.  Der Spiegel magazine reported in this week’s edition that
 Germany ’s Bundesbank said in an internal document sent to the
Finance Ministry that Europe will probably have to agree on new
aid program for Greece by the beginning of 2014 at the latest.
Risks to the current program remain “extraordinarily high,”
the Bundesbank said, according to Spiegel.  “It’s extremely hard to say 13 days after the latest aid
tranche was paid out what will or won’t happen in the future,”
Martin Kotthaus, Finance Ministry spokesman, told reporters at a
regular government press conference in Berlin today. He said he
was unaware of the Bundesbank document referred to in the
report.  The group of euro region finance ministers said in December
that it will assess whether the program terms were fulfilled and
whether  Greece  has a primary surplus in 2014, Kotthaus said.
“If we establish that more money is needed, then we’ll talk
about it, see what’s to do, what’s necessary,” he said. “One
thing is clear, a second debt writedown is ruled out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
