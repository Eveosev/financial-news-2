South African police said they are
investigating a murder near a mine shaft owned by  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ,
the world’s third-biggest platinum producer.  “There is a murder that took place today,” Thulani
Ngubane, a spokesman for the police in the platinum-rich North
West province, where the mine is located, said by phone. “The
scene is still fresh, police officers working on the case are
still trying to get more details.”  Lonmin and its employees are commemorating a year since 44
people died around its Marikana complex, including 34 killed by
police on Aug. 16, in the deadliest police action since whites-only rule ended in 1994. A female shop-steward for the  National
Union of Mineworkers  was shot at Lonmin’s Rowland shaft at
Marikana this morning, spokesman  Lesiba Seshoka  said in a text
message. A worker was fatally shot at Wonderkop village today,
spokeswoman Sue Vey said in a text message.  Police haven’t confirmed the victim’s union affiliation or
any other details, Ngubane said.  The stock declined for the first time in three days, losing
2.4 percent to 342.10 pence by 1:28 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
