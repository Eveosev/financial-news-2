U.S. wheat production in the year
that started June 1 will be little changed from last monthâ€™s
forecast, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today, after
rainfall kept output stable.  Farmers will gather 2.114 billion bushels (57.5 million
metric tons), the same as predicted in July, the USDA today in a
 monthly report . Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast 2.12
billion bushels.  Spring-wheat output will total 511.3 million bushels down
from 513 million last month, and growers will harvest 60.2
million bushels of durum varieties compared with 57.5 million
forecast in July, according to the USDA.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade through Aug. 9
plunged 17 percent this year, partly on speculation that global
production would rise.  Global wheat stockpiles will total 172.99 million tons, up
from 172.38 million forecast last month, according to the USDA
report. Analysts expected 171.1 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
