Australia needs 299 runs to win the
fourth Ashes cricket Test after  Ryan Harris  took seven wickets
to limit host England to 330 all out at Chester-le-Street.  James Anderson  was out without scoring to leave England 298
runs ahead just before lunch on day four.  Tim Bresnan ’s 45 and
Graeme Swann’s 30 not out helped push England close to a lead of
300 at the end of its innings. Ian Bell topscored with 113 runs
before being bowled by Harris, who took 7-117.  The hosts started the day with a 202-run lead as they
seek the draw needed to win the series.  Ian Bell resumed on 105 and Bresnan was on four. Bell faced
210 balls and hit 11 boundaries.  Yesterday, Australia resumed on 222-5 and added 48 runs to
reach 270 in response to England’s 238, a lead of 32 runs.  Stuart Broad finished with 5-71, while Swann and Anderson
took two wickets each yesterday. Australia’s top scorer,  Chris
Rogers , was dismissed by Swann on 110, his first Test century.  England retained the Ashes trophy with a draw in the third
Test after wins in the first two games of the five-match
contest. The best Australia can now do is draw the series 2-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
