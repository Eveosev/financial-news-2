Toronto-Dominion Bank’s Jason Bilodeau and Doug Young, both financial-services research
analysts, have left the lender, a spokesman said.  Bilodeau covered Canada’s eight biggest banks for the
company’s TD Securities unit, while Young followed insurers and
asset managers. Wojtek Dabrowski, a spokesman for the Toronto-based firm, didn’t say who was replacing them.  Their departures are the latest among Canadian financial-services equity analysts.  Mario Mendonca , a bank and insurance
analyst for  Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) ’s capital-markets unit,
left on Aug. 9, the Toronto-based company said.  Mendonca declined to comment, while Bilodeau and Young
didn’t immediately return phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
