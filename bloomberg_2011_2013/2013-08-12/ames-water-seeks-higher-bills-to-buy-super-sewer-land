Thames Water Utilities Ltd.,
Britain’s biggest water and waste company, wants to increase
customer bills by about 8 percent to help buy land to build
 London ’s “super-sewer” project.  Thames Water asked Ofwat, the U.K. industry regulator, if
it can charge customers an extra 29 pounds ($45) in 2014-2015,
the London-based utility said today in a  statement  on its
website. To avoid a spike in bills, it’s recommending the “one-off” cost be spread over more than a year. The  regulator 
expects to make a decision by November.  The money will help the utility buy land to build its 4.1
billion-pound Thames Tideway tunnel, a sewer project that would
follow the course of the capital’s river. It expects to spend
about 273 million pounds purchasing the land, it said in the
statement. It also needs the funds to service a rise in bad debt
and to cover an increase in Environmental Agency charges.  The U.K. government is reviewing water-bill legislation
that if passed aims to spur competition in the retail market for
non-household customers by allowing businesses to choose their
supplier. It’s also introduced  social tariffs  that offer rebates
to low-income households in areas of high water charges.  Thames said the new application would add a further 8
percent, or about 29 pounds, to the average household bill. The
average annual Thames Water bill is about 354 pounds, which it
says is among the lowest in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
