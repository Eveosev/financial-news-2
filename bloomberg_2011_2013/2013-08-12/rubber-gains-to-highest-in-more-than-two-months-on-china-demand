Rubber rallied to the highest level
in more than two months on optimism that  China ’s stabilizing
economy would lead to higher demand from the top consumer of the
commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in January on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange rose as much as 1.9 percent to 266.3 yen a kilogram
($2,769 a metric ton), the highest level for the most-active
contract since May 29. Futures traded at 263.2 yen at 10:14 a.m.
Singapore time after gaining 5.3 percent last week, the most
since the five days to July 19.  China’s exports, imports and industrial output rose more
than estimated in July, adding to signs the economy is
stabilizing, data showed last week. Natural rubber purchases
gained 16 percent in July from a month earlier to 150,000 tons,
the government said Aug. 8.  The “jump in natural rubber imports in July means that
China’s demand in the second half will be better than the first
half of this year,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co. The Chinese government “may make some
positive financial policy just to push up demand,” he said by
phone from Tokyo today.  Prices may climb to 275 yen by the end of this year, Gu
said. Rubber imports by China may rise 6.6 percent to 3.59
million tons in 2013, the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries said on Aug. 2.  Rubber for delivery in January gained 0.5 percent to 19,435
 yuan  ($3,176) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 1.3 percent to 79.50 baht
($2.54) a kilogram on Aug. 9, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  Natural-rubber inventories climbed 275 tons to 118,188 tons,
based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, according to the Shanghai Futures
Exchange last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
