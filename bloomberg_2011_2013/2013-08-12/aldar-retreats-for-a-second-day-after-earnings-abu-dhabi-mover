Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  had the
biggest two-day drop since June as Abu Dhabi’s largest developer
reported a drop in revenue and after the stock surged in July.  The shares fell 2.1 percent to 2.75 dirhams at the close in
Abu Dhabi today, bringing the two-day retreat to 4.2 percent,
the worst since June 24. Aldar  surged  24 percent last month,
almost three times as fast as  Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index , which
lost 0.6 percent today.  Aldar had a one-time gain of 2.6 billion dirhams ($708
million) from its merger with Sorouh Real Estate Co. as it
posted second-quarter earnings on Aug. 7, the first day markets
in the  United Arab Emirates  closed for an Islamic holiday. The
company said revenue dropped 73 percent to 1.26 billion dirhams.  “It’s a realistic correction based on people realizing
that 2.6 billion dirhams of profits came from the revaluation of
assets post-merger with Sorouh and won’t be a recurring item.”
Mohammed Ali Yasin, managing editor of  Abu Dhabi  Financial
Service Co., said by phone.  Abu Dhabi’s government backed the combination of the two
developers, which are both part of the state’s drive to
diversify its oil-based economy through office and leisure
projects. Aldar received more than $9.8 billion in bailouts from
the government in 2011.  One  analyst  recommends investors sell the shares, while
five say hold and two advise buying the stock, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
