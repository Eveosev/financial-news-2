More than 25 years after opening, “ The Phantom of the Opera ” still has the power to separate tourists from their cash.  Produced by Cameron Mackintosh and composer  Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s Really Useful Theatre Co., the musical sold $1.2 million of tickets last week in  New York . That was its best showing in four months and third-best week of 2013, according to figures from the  Broadway League , the association of producers and theater owners.  In 2013, “Phantom” attendance is up 6 percent while grosses are up 16 percent, said a spokesman, Mark Thibodeau.  While the current leads aren’t well-known -- Peter Joback in the title role and Marni Raab and Mary Michael Patterson alternating as Christine -- “Phantom” shows that familiar titles remain sales leaders.  “The  Lion King ” sold $2.1 million last week, “The Book of Mormon” did $1.7 million and “Wicked” sold $2.1 million over 9 performances (instead of the standard eight). Broadway sales rose 1 percent to $23.3 million for the week.  Relative newbies also did well. “Matilda” set a new record, $1.3 million, while “Motown” at $1.5 million and “Kinky Boots” at $1.6 million were near records.  Unlikely to run 25 years, the revival of “Annie” slid 4 percent to $907,000, its lowest in two months. “Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark” also sank to a two-month low, $1.1 million.  While Julie White is winning over audiences as an insecure movie star in the role originated by  Sigourney Weaver , “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” also fell to the lowest since June 9. It sold $556,000.  The Beatles tribute “Let It Be” had its worst week since beginning previews last month, $366,000.  In its final week on Broadway, “The Nance” with  Nathan Lane  had its best showing since mid-June, selling $445,000.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and Hamptons  Scene .
