Jason Dufner’s victory in the PGA
Championship boosted television ratings in the biggest U.S.
markets by 13 percent for CBS.  The  CBS Corp. (CBS)  unit said yesterday’s telecast drew a 4.4
overnight rating in major markets, compared with 3.9 for Rory
McIlroy’s victory last year in the final major tournament of the
men’s golf season.  Top-ranked Tiger Woods and No. 2-ranked Phil Mickelson
played earlier in the day after poor showings in the first three
rounds. Dufner won his first major title by two strokes over  Jim
Furyk  at Oak Hill Country Club near Rochester, New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
