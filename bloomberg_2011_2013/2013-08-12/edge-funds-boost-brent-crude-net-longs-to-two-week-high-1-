Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to the highest level in two
weeks, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 188,789 lots in
the week ended Aug. 6, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The increase of 7,454
contracts brings net-longs, which fell the previous week, to
their highest since July 23.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 394,676, an
increase of 4.1 percent that brings their net-short position to
the largest since July 16.  Brent advanced 1.2 percent in the week to Aug. 6 to $108.18
a barrel and traded at $106.20 as of 12 p.m. local time.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers  bolstered net-long positions for the first
time in five weeks, by 1 percent to 232,355. In the previous
week their net-long position had slumped to the lowest since
April 23.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
fell for a second week, slipping by 4.1 percent to 59,050
contracts in their biggest drop since June 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
