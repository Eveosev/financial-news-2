Ten workers at the wrecked Fukushima
nuclear plant were exposed to radiation from contaminated mist
used to cool temperatures near a quake-proof building, plant
operator  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  said.  The workers were waiting for a bus when they were sprayed,
according to Tepco, as the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant’s operator
is known. It was unknown how the mist became contaminated, Tepco
said in an e-mailed statement.  The workers’ exposure above the neck was found to be as
much as 10 becquerels per square centimeter. They were ordered
to receive full body scans, which can detect exposure to their
inner organs.  The contamination is the latest complication to arise as
part of the cleanup of the Dai-Ichi plant, which suffered
meltdowns as a result of the March 11, 2011 earthquake and
subsequent tsunami. Government officials said last week that at
least 300 tons of radiated water was flowing from the plant into
the ocean each day.  The workers’ exposure was detected by a radiation monitor,
according to Tepco. The mist was turned off and workers at the
building were prohibited from using tap water, which comes from
the same source as the mist.  Earlier today, Tepco reported that an alarm sounded at a
dust monitor near the building, indicating high concentrations
of radioactivity. No significant changes to other plant readings
were found, Tepco said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
