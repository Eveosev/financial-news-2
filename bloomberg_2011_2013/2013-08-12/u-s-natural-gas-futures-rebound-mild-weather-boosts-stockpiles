Natural gas futures rose the most in
more than three weeks in New York on forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather that would spur fuel demand from  power plants .  Gas climbed 2.5 percent, the biggest daily gain since July
18, as MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said
temperatures may be higher than usual in the northern tier of
the U.S. from Aug. 17 through Aug. 26. The futures dropped 3.5
percent last week to a five-month low amid forecasts that showed
normal or cooler-than-average weather in the region.  “We have more warmth coming into the equation and that’s
supporting prices,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We were getting ahead of
ourselves on the downside.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 8 cents to settle
at $3.31 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 42 percent above the
100-day average at 2:44 p.m. Prices are up 19 percent from a
year ago.  The discount of September to October futures narrowed 0.2
cent to 2.5 cents. October gas traded 40.1 cents below the
January contract, compared with 40.7 cents on Aug. 9.  September $3 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 1 cent lower at 0.8 cent per
million Btu on volume of 482 at 2:44 p.m. Puts accounted for 52
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in September was 32.95 percent at 2:45 p.m.,
compared with 32 percent on Aug. 9.  CFTC Report  Net-long wagers on four U.S. natural gas contracts declined
9.2 percent, dropping 24,693 futures equivalents to 244,135 in
the week ended Aug. 6, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data released Aug. 9. It was the lowest level since
the week ended March 5.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  The high in New York on Aug. 22 may be 92 degrees
Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), 10 more than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Temperatures in
 Boston  may reach 89 degrees, also 10 higher than average.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the EIA the Energy Department’s statistical
arm.  Supply Surplus  Gas stockpiles totaled 2.941 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 2, 0.7 percent above the five-year average,
rising to a  surplus  for the first time since March. Inventories
were 9.2 percent below year-earlier supplies.  The U.S. gas market is the most oversupplied since 2011,
Soozhana Choi, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in  Washington ,
said in a note to clients today.  “We see a low likelihood for improvement in the next two
weeks,” Choi said.  The expanding supply surplus is bearish for gas prices,
Adam Longson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in  New York , said in
an e-mailed report to clients today.  Prices will remain “under pressure” in August and
September amid waning cooling demand and robust production,
Longson said.  The U.S. said in an Aug. 6 report that 2013 marketed gas
production would average 69.89 billion cubic feet a day, down
from last month’s forecast of 69.96 billion. Output would be up
1 percent from a year ago at a record as onshore supplies climb.  Stockpiles may total 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 130 billion below last year’s peak, the EIA said.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
