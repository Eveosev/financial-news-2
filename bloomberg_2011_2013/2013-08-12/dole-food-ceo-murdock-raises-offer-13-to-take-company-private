Dole Food Co. (DOLE)  agreed to a higher
takeover offer from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Murdock in a deal that values the fresh fruit and vegetable
producer and marketer at $1.21 billion.  Murdock raised his offer to $13.50 a share in cash, the
 Westlake Village , California based company said in a statement
today. That’s a 13 percent boost from the $12 a share Murdock,
90, offered in June for the 60 percent of the company not
already owned by him or his family.  Murdock, who served as CEO between 1985 and 2007, returned
to the role in February. He took the company private once
before, in 2003, and has said he wants to do so again to remove
“the concern that a public company must have for the investing
public’s short-term expectations.”  Dole has been unprofitable in two of the last three years
and according to one analyst’s estimate it’s forecast to lose
$11.3 million in 2013. Sales declined in 2012 after the company
divested European businesses and as banana prices fell in  North
America .  The transaction will be paid for with cash and equity
contributed by Murdock as well as financing from  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and the  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  The deal,
expected to close during the fourth quarter, includes a 30-day
“go-shop” period during which the board may consider alternate
proposals.  Breakup Fee  Dole will pay a $15 million breakup fee if it accepts an
alternative takeover. Murdock will pay $50 million if he fails
to complete the transaction under certain circumstances.  Shareholders sued the company in June, alleging the board
was violating its legal duty to get the best price by accepting
Murdock’s bid.  Dole rose 5.3 percent to $13.49 at the close in  New York 
the biggest rise in two months and its highest price since Oct.
4. The shares have gained 32 percent since Murdock’s initial
offer was announced this year.  The company was founded 162 years ago and operates in more
than 90 countries, producing bananas, pineapples and lettuce in
Latin America and southeast Asia, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
