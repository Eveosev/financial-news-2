San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the largest
Philippine company, posted its first quarterly loss since the
period ended December 2008 as a weaker peso led to a foreign-exchange deficit.  Net loss was 6.6 billion pesos ($151 million) in the second
quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of 5.65 billion
pesos a year earlier, according to figures derived from first-half results announced today by the Manila-based company. Sales
fell 4.4 percent to 179.2 billion pesos.  The strengthening of the dollar against the local currency
resulted in an “unrealized” foreign-exchange loss in the first
half, the company said today in a statement. The company and its
units have 243 billion pesos of  debt  due by 2018, about 149
billion pesos of which are denominated in dollars, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It could only be the debt,” said Astro del Castillo,
managing director at Manila-based First Grade Holdings Inc.
“The company needs to re-strategize to address that debt
issue.”  San Miguel   shares  fell 0.5 percent to 84 pesos at the close
in Manila, before the results were released. The shares have
fallen 20 percent this year, compared with the benchmark
Philippine stock index’s 11 percent gain. San Miguel is the
second-worst performer among 30 companies in the Philippine
Stock Exchange Index this year.  Falling Peso  The peso has fallen 6 percent this year and is the worst-performing currency in the region after the yen and the Indian
rupee. It fell 5.5 percent in the three months ended June,
halting five quarters of gains, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The drop last quarter was the most in five years.  First-half loss was 2.4 billion pesos on sales of 357.5
billion pesos, San Miguel said in its statement today, without
giving year-earlier numbers. First-half profit last year was
13.89 billion pesos on sales of 329.5 billion pesos, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Excluding foreign-exchange losses, recurring net income was
“sustained” at 7.8 billion pesos in the first half, the
company said. Operating income increased 19 percent to 28.9
billion pesos, it said.  “Forex losses mask the solid performance we had in our
business,” Chairman Eduardo Cojuangco said in the statement.
“We remain bullish about our underlying performance.”  San Miguel, which started as a brewer more than a century
ago, has made more than $5.6 billion worth of purchases since
2008 as it expanded into industries such as airlines, oil and
power to triple the return it used to get from food and drinks.  The Southeast Asian nation’s most acquisitive company plans
to raise about $4 billion by selling power assets, to help fund
its transformation from a brewer and foodmaker into an investor
in energy, mining, airlines and roads, President Ramon Ang said
in a July 12 interview.  The company is seeking to increase revenue to $50 billion
pesos in five years after last year’s 30 percent gain to $16
billion, missing a $20 billion goal.  The sale of 64.3 million  Manila  Electric shares last month
resulted in a gain of 9.6 billion pesos, San Miguel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
