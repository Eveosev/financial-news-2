Brazil ’s swap rates rose for the
first time in four sessions on speculation a weakening currency
may fuel faster inflation and prompt the central bank to quicken
the pace of borrowing cost increases.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.61 percent at 9:58
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.2746
per dollar.  The real weakened along with most emerging-market
currencies after Japanese economic growth trailed analysts’
estimates in the second quarter. Brazil’s currency has lost 11
percent in the past three months, the most among its developing-market counterparts, boosting the price of imports and
threatening to further fuel inflation.  “The external market is negative and with that the dollar
started rising again, which affects swap rates,” Flavio Serrano, a senior economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimentos, said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “The numbers from
 Japan  were bad.”  Gross domestic product in Japan grew an annualized 2.6
percent last quarter, a government report showed, less than the
3.6 percent median projection in a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2.21 percent
this year and 2.50 percent next year, down from the previous
week’s estimates of 2.24 percent and 2.60 percent respectively,
according to an Aug. 9 central bank survey of about 100 analysts
published today. Economists have cut their prediction for GDP
growth this year in 12 out of the past 13 weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
