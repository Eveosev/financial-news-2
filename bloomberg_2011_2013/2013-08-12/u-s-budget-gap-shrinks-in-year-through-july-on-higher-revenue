The U.S. government posted a 38
percent smaller budget  deficit  in the 10 months through July
than a year earlier, even as the shortfall last month was wider
than economists forecast, the Treasury Department said.  Outlays exceeded receipts by $97.6 billion last month,
compared with a $69.6 billion shortfall in July 2012, the
Treasury said today in Washington. The result, partly reflecting
a difference in the timing of payments in July last year versus
this year, compared with the $96 billion median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 27 economists.  In the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, the Obama
administration projects the federal deficit will shrink to $759
billion, the smallest gap in five years as a stronger economy
bolsters revenue. Increased tax collections and payments to the
Treasury from  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  as housing improves are
taking the pressure off of Congress and the White House to
achieve an agreement on dealing with spending, deficits or
automatic budget cuts.  With stronger economic growth and rising revenue, “we’re
on a much better path than we were a year ago,” said Chris Krueger, a senior policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC in
Washington.  Spending Jump  For the first 10 months of the 2013 financial year that
began Oct. 1, the nation’s deficit narrowed to $607.4 billion
compared with a $973.8 billion shortfall over the same period
from a year before.  Today’s report showed revenue rose 8.4 percent in July to
$200 billion from the same month a year earlier. Spending
totaled $297.6 billion compared with $254.2 billion a year
earlier, it showed.  The U.S.’s AA+ credit-rating outlook was increased in June
to stable from negative by  Standard & Poor’s  based on receding
fiscal risks, less than two years after the company stripped the
world’s largest economy of its top ranking.  American employers added 162,000 workers in July, according
to a Labor Department report Aug. 2. The jobless rate fell to
7.4 percent last month from 7.6 percent in June and was down
from 8.2 percent a year earlier.  The  Congressional Budget Office  said Aug. 7 that last
month’s budget figures were “distorted by quirks of the
calendar” such as July 1, 2012, falling on a Sunday, requiring
government payments to be made in the previous month. Without
that shift this year, the July 2013 deficit would have been $10
billion smaller than it was a year earlier, the CBO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
