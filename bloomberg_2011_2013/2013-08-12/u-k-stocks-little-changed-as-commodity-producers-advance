U.K. stocks  were little changed,
after declining last week, as commodity producers such as
Polymetal International Plc gained, while Ladbrokes Plc fell.  Polymetal and Fresnillo Plc each advanced more than 1.5
percent, as a gauge of London-listed commodity producers climbed
in line with gold prices. Ladbrokes slid after JPMorgan Chase &
Co. cut its recommendation on the shares.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  gained 9.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,593.15 at 8:59 a.m. in London. The gauge has rallied 9.4
percent from a low on June 24 as the U.S. Federal Reserve said
it remains flexible on the pace of bond buying and the  European
Central Bank  and the Bank of England signaled  interest rates 
will remain low for an extended period. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.2 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ
Index increased 0.4 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 today was 30 percent lower than the average of the past
30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
