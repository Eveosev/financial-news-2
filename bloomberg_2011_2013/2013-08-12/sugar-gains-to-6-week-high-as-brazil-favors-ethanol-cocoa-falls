Sugar climbed to a six-week high in
New York on signs  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, is
favoring ethanol production over the the sweetener. Cocoa fell.  Millers in Brazil’s center south, the country’s main
producing region, used 55 percent of sugar cane processed in the
second-half of July to make ethanol, up from 49.4 percent a year
earlier, industry group Unica in  Sao Paulo  said Aug. 9. The
amount of cane crushed fell 4.4 percent in the period to 44.3
million metric tons, Unica data showed.  “The market took these figures as slightly bullish,”
Robin Shaw, analyst at futures and options broker Marex Spectron
Group in London, said in a report e-mailed today. “These show
that the crush was reasonable, that mills continued to favor
ethanol over sugar production.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October rose 0.4 percent to 17.05
cents a pound by 5:13 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York and
earlier today jumped to 17.1 cents, the highest since June 28.
The sweetener climbed the past four weeks, the longest winning
streak since July 2012. White sugar for October delivery rose
0.2 percent to $499 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Brazilian raw sugar is trading at a premium of 0.05 cent a
pound to the futures price in  New York , according to Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting. That compares with a discount of 0.1
cent a pound, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at the
consultancy, said in a report e-mailed Aug. 10.  “The mood is slowly changing,” Correa said. “The first
sign of recovery, as it usually happens to commodities, is when
premiums start to appreciate.”  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $2,476 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for September delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
1,646 pounds ($2,547) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica coffee for September delivery was little changed at
$1.2295 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November declined 0.5 percent to $1,940 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
