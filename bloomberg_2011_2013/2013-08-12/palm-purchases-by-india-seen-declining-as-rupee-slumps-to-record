Palm oil  imports by  India , the
world’s largest buyer, probably declined for the first time in
three months as the local currency dropped to a record,
prompting importers to scale back purchases.  Inbound  shipments  fell 8.2 percent to 550,000 metric tons
in July from 599,128 tons a year earlier, according to the
median of estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. The Solvent Extractors’  Association  of India will
release the data this week. Total vegetable oil imports,
including for industrial use, dropped 2.3 percent to 850,000
tons from 870,328 tons, the survey showed.  A decline in purchases may boost stockpiles in  Malaysia ,
the largest producer after  Indonesia , just as the country starts
its high-output cycle, pressuring futures in  Kuala Lumpur . The
rupee slumped to an all-time low this month on concern that the
current-account deficit will widen from a record in the year
ended March. The gap is the biggest risk to the $1.9 trillion
economy, according to the central bank.  “The volatility was hurting importers,” said Pradip Desai, managing director of broker Palmtrade Services Pvt.
“They’ve been cautious and scaling back purchases. We need more
imports but are getting less. If imports do not pick up in
August, then availability may be tight in September.”  Consumption of oils usually rises during the festival
season, which lasts from this month through November. India, the
biggest user after  China , meets more than half its demand from
imports. The country buys palm from Indonesia and Malaysia and
 soybean oil  from the U.S.,  Brazil  and  Argentina .  Indian Stockpiles  Vegetable oil purchases  in the eight months through June
rose 12 percent to 7.15 million tons, association data show.
Cooking oil demand may jump to 23 million tons by 2020 from 17.5
million tons and imports will grow significantly, says the Food
Ministry. The rupee fell to 61.8050 per dollar on Aug. 6.  Palm for delivery in October climbed 2 percent to 2,250
ringgit ($692) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
yesterday. Prices slumped 22 percent in the past year.  Output in Malaysia probably expanded more slowly than a
year earlier in July, keeping inventories at the lowest in more
than two years, a Bloomberg survey showed on Aug. 6. Production
rose 10 percent to 1.56 million tons in July from a month
earlier, while reserves held at 1.65 million tons, it showed.  Inventories in India, including those at ports and in the
pipeline, were probably 2 million tons at the start of August
from 2.06 million tons in July, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer of Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group.  “With the festival season starting soon these stocks
should come down,” he said. “Consumers have been mostly
protected from the impact of the depreciating rupee as overseas
prices are weak.”  Crude soybean oil imports  probably jumped to 230,000 tons
in July from 156,720 tons a year earlier, while  sunflower oil 
purchases may have declined to 60,000 tons from 80,101 tons, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
