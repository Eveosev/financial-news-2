Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that the lowest prices for the biofuel
in almost 14 months will spur demand.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 0.69 cent to
75.63 cents a gallon at 11:05 a.m. New York time as futures
dropped 22 percent from their 2013 high of $2.744 in May. An
Agriculture Department report scheduled for release at noon in
 Washington  is expected to show farmers this year will harvest
14.036 billion bushels of corn, the main component of ethanol,
up 30 percent from a year earlier, according to a survey
conducted by Bloomberg.  “I don’t know how much further” ethanol might fall, said
Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“It’s been taking a beating for a month. It’s a buying
opportunity now.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery dropped 1.2 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.133 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would be the lowest settlement
since June 22, 2012. Futures have declined 2.6 percent this
year.  Gasoline for September delivery decreased 1.89 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.8893 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
Farmers planted the most acres since 1936 after last summer’s
drought devastated crops.  Corn for September delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $4.6325 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively traded
December contract slid 1.25 cents to $4.52. One bushel of the
grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of renewable fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 45 cents, unchanged from Aug. 9, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
