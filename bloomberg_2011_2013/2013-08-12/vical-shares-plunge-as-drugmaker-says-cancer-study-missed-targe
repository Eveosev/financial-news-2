Vical Inc. (VICL) , the maker of
experimental cancer drugs, fell the most in 20 years after
saying its melanoma medicine failed to help patients in a
clinical trial.  Shares of Vical plunged 57 percent to $1.53 at the close in
 New York , the biggest one-day drop since March 1993 when the San
Diego-based company initially offered shares to the public.
Vical said in a statement that it was ending studies of the
drug, Allovectin, and would shift its focus toward infectious
disease treatments.  Chief Executive Officer Vijay Samant said Allovectin failed
to show “statistically significant improvement” in the study
of 390 patients with metastatic melanoma. The company had cash
and investments of $70 million as of June 30, enough to meet its
needs through the end of next year, according to the statement.  “In the coming weeks, we will make the necessary changes
to focus resources on our infectious disease vaccine programs
and reduce expenses to conserve  cash ,” Samant said in the
statement.  Vical shares had risen 23 percent this year through Aug. 9.  While the company is testing other drugs, it faces “a lack
of confidence in Vical’s pipeline candidates and a frustration
with the slow pace at which Vical’s DNA-based gene delivery
platform has advanced,”  Eric Schmidt , a Cowen & Co. analyst in
New York, said today in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
