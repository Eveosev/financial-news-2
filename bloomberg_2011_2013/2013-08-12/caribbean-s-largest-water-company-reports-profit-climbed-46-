Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) , the largest
seawater desalination plant operator in the Caribbean, said
second-quarter profit climbed 46 percent to $2.85 million from a
year earlier. The shares rose today to a one-month high.  The stock has surged 48 percent the past year. The
Georgetown, Cayman Islands-based company is expanding with
projects that include a water-purifying desalination plant and
pipeline in  Baja California , Mexico, and commissioned 250,000
gallons a day of capacity using seawater reverse-osmosis for a
resort in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian island of Bali.  Consolidated Water operates production and
distribution facilities in the Caymans, Bahamas, Belize and the
British Virgin Islands. Profit this year has been aided by a
settlement over water delivered to the British Virgin
Island government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
