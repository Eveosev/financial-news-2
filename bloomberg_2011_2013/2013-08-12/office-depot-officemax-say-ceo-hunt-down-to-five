Office Depot Inc. (ODP)  and OfficeMax
Inc., which agreed to merge in February, narrowed the field of
candidates to be the combined company’s chief executive officer
down to five and plan to pick one by September.  More than 100 candidates have been reviewed and eight have
been interviewed, the companies said today in a statement,
without naming the remaining five. The search is being conducted
by  Korn/Ferry International (KFY)  and a committee co-chaired by
OfficeMax director Jim Marino and Office Depot director Nigel Travis.  Office Depot and OfficeMax, the second- and third-largest
U.S. office-supply chains, agreed to combine in a $1.17 billion
deal after losing sales to larger rival  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  and online
competitors. The retailers said at the time that they would
create a board with equal representation from each company while
searching for a new CEO.  Neil Austrian, Office Depot’s 73-year-old chairman and CEO,
and Ravi Saligram, OfficeMax’s 57-year-old president and CEO,
both would be considered as candidates, the companies said in
February.  Office Depot, based in  Boca Raton , Florida, rose 3.3
percent to $4.37 at the close in New York. OfficeMax, based in
Naperville, Illinois, gained 2.9 percent to $11.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
