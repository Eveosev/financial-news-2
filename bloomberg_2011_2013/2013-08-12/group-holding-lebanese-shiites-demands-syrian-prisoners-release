The Syrian rebel group holding nine
Lebanese men said it will not free them unless the government of
President Bashar al-Assad releases 127 female prisoners.  The Shiite Muslim Lebanese, kidnapped last year by the
rebel Northern Storm Brigade, have become part of a bigger web
of hostage-takings on the margins of the Syrian civil war. A
Lebanese Shiite group abducted two Turkish Airlines pilots in
 Beirut  last week as bargaining chips to try to secure their
release.  “There’s nothing to negotiate over before the female
prisoners are released,” the Northern Storm Brigade said on its
website yesterday. The rebel group said it had originally sought
the release of 500 women prisoners before moderating  its
demands.  The Turkish pilots, kidnapped in a Beirut neighborhood
controlled by the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, have
become pawns in the battle between Assad and rebels who have
been trying to topple him for more than two years. Turkey has
supported the rebels while Hezbollah backs the Syrian president
and has sent its men to fight alongside his troops.  The families of the nine Lebanese Shiite captives have said
they were not involved in the kidnapping of the Turkish pilots.
They say  Turkey  has influence with the rebels and has not
pressed them enough to free the hostages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
