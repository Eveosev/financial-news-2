Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI)  fell
the most in three months after saying that  Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)  ended development of a depression drug under partnership.  Albany Molecular declined 10 percent to $11.31 at the close
in New York, the biggest single-day drop since May 7. Shares of
the Albany, New York-based company have more than doubled this
year.  Bristol-Myers is ending testing on BMS-820836, an
experimental depression treatment, after the medicine failed to
meet its goals in clinical studies, Albany Molecular said today
in a regulatory filing. The two companies will have “continued
discussions” about the compound’s future and plans for other
medicines, according to the filing.  Albany Molecular said the end of the drug’s development
wouldn’t affect the forecast for the 2013 third-quarter and full
year. The company said Aug. 6 that it  expects  earnings excluding
some items of 9 cents to 12 cents a share for the quarter and 54
cents to 65 cents for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
