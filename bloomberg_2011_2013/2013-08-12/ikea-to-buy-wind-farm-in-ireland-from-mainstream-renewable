Ikea Group, the world’s biggest
home-furnishings retailer, plans to buy a wind farm in Ireland
from Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. as part of plans to invest
1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in wind and solar by 2015.  Mainstream is building the 7.65-megawatt project in Leitrim
in northwest Ireland, Dublin-based Mainstream said today in an
e-mailed statement. It’s expected to start operating early next
year, at which point Ikea will buy the plant, Mainstream said.  “Our investments in renewable energy not only help to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions from our operations in Ireland,
but also, together with our energy-efficiency efforts, help to
control our electricity costs so we can pass any benefits to our
customers,” Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability at Ikea U.K.,
said in the statement.  Ikea plans to invest 1.5 billion pounds in wind and solar
energy to help become energy independent by 2020. It now owns
137 wind turbines, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
