U.S. sugar stockpiles will be 0.6
percent higher than the government forecast last month on
stronger imports, the Department of Agriculture said today.  In the year ending Sept. 30, 2014, inventories will be
2.025 million short tons, compared with 2.013 million projected
in July, the agency said in a report. Imports will be 3.23
million tons, from 3.12 million tons estimated a month earlier.  U.S. output may be 8.45 million short tons compared with
8.64 million last month, the agency said. For the 12 months that
end Sept. 30, sugar production was estimated at 9.015 million
tons, up 6.2 percent from a year earlier.  Through Aug. 9, the domestic raw-sugar price slumped 31
percent in the past 12 months on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  as
output climbed and imports gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
