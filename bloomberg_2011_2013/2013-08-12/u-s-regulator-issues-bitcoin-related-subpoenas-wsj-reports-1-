New York’s banking regulator issued
subpoenas to about two dozen companies associated with bitcoin
as it looks into the virtual-currency industry, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The subpoenas, issued by the  Department of Financial
Services , seek information on topics including antimoney-laundering, consumer protection and investment strategies,
according to the report, which didn’t identify the people. The
subpoenas were issued late last week, the Journal said.  The department is considering setting new guidelines aimed
at virtual currencies, the newspaper reported, citing a memo
from  Benjamin Lawsky , the agency’s head. The memo, which the
regulator plans to issue today, expresses concern that virtual-currency companies aren’t complying with the state’s money-transmission laws, according to the report.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency created four years ago that
can be used to buy and sell a broad array of items, from
electronics to illegal narcotics.  Coinsetter LLC, one of the companies cited in the report as
having been issued a subpoena, said the dialogue with the
regulator will have a positive effect on the industry, according
to Chief Executive Officer Jaron Lukasiewicz. Lukasiewicz said
there had been no misbehavior toward consumers by the leading
bitcoin companies.  “U.S.-based Bitcoin companies are taking regulation very
seriously, and each company is closely working with legal
advisers to form and follow plans that adhere to it,”
Lukasiewicz said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
