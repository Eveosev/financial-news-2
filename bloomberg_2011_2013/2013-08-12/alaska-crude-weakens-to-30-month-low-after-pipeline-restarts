Alaska  North Slope crude on the spot
market weakened to the lowest premium to West Texas Intermediate
in more than 30 months as a pipeline to the Valdez Marine
Terminal reopened after maintenance.  Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. restarted the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System early today after closing it yesterday to test
valves along the mainline, Michelle Egan, a spokeswoman, said by
e-mail. The shutdown was originally planned for Aug. 9 and was
delayed because of strong winds.  The 800-mile-long pipeline carries crude to Valdez, on the
state’s southern coast, from Alaska’s North Slope. Output
dropped from 475,090 barrels on Aug. 8 to 202,522 barrels
yesterday during the shutdown, according to the  state’s
Department of Revenue .  ANS, a medium, sour crude used by refiners on the U.S. West
coast, weakened by 50 cents to a premium of $3.50 a barrel more
than WTI at 1:55 p.m.  New York  time, the lowest level since
January 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ANS prices have declined from a premium of $18.75 to WTI as
the spread between Brent and WTI has narrowed and as shippers
have begun transporting cheaper Bakken crude by rail to West
Coast refineries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
