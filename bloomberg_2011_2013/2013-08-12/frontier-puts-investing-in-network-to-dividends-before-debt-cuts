Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR) , the
least indebted broadband and telecommunications company among
peers, is forgoing  debt  reduction in favor of investing in
infrastructure and maintaining its dividend to shareholders.  The communications services provider has enough cash to
repay the $402 million of debt that matures through 2015,
according to Chief Financial Officer John Jureller. The
 Stamford , Connecticut-based company will only pay down
additional debt beyond near-term maturities after it spends  free
cash flow  on improving its fiber-to-home broadband network and
paying its annual 40 cent  dividend , Jureller said.  “We are very comfortable in our liquidity profile and
servicing our debt. That is not a concern to us,” Jureller said
in a telephone interview on Aug. 8. “Our priority today is to
appropriately fund our operations to keep the network and
customer acquisition and retention networks strong.”  Frontier will use cash to repay at maturity $200 million of
8.25 percent bonds due May 2014, as well as $105.1 million of
6.625 percent notes due March 2015 and $96.9 million of 7.875
percent bonds due April 2015  The company is expected to pay about $400 million in a cash
dividend from its estimated $760.6 million in free  cash flow  in
2013, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. That would
leave it with more than $300 million in cash to, in order of
priority, reinvest in the company, take further shareholder
action and potentially reduce debt, Jureller said.  Frontier has a long-term target of reducing its leverage,
or the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, to 2.5 from 3.65 times, Jureller
said. That’s the lowest ratio among peers with revenue between
$2 billion and $10 billion, Bloomberg data show. The company is
rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BB- by  Standard &
Poor’s , the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
