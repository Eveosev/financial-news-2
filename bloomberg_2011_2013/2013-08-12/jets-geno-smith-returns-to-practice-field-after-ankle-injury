(Corrects Jets next preseason opponent in last paragraph.)  New York  Jets rookie quarterback
Geno Smith was back at practice yesterday, two days after
injuring his ankle in a preseason loss to the Detroit Lions.  Smith, a second-round pick of the Jets in this year’s
 National Football League  draft, is competing with  Mark Sanchez 
for the team’s starting job. He left during the third quarter of
the Jets’ 26-17 loss to the Lions on Aug. 9 after an undisclosed
injury to his right ankle.  “The ankle isn’t full strength right now, but I felt
pretty good out there,” Smith said after yesterday’s practice.
“I was limping a little bit. It’s just something that you’ve
got to work past, you’ve got to get through.”  Smith, who completed six of seven passes for 47 yards
against the Lions, said he felt it was important to get back on
the practice field with his teammates.  “I pride myself on being out there at all times and one
little ankle injury wasn’t going to keep me from practicing and
competing,” Smith told reporters.  The Jets’ next preseason game is Aug. 17 against the
 Jacksonville Jaguars .  To contact the reporter on this story:
