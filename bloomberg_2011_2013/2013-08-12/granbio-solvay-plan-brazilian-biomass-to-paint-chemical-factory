GranBio Investimentos SA, a
Brazilian biotechnology company, plans to build a plant with
 Solvay SA (SOLB)  that will process sugar-cane residues into a chemical
used in paints.  The factory will produce so-called n-butanol and is
expected to come online in 2015, Sao Paulo-based Granbio said
today in a  statement . The project still requires approval from
both companies’ boards and clearance from Brazil’s antitrust
agency Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica.  Solvay is a Brussels-based chemicals and plastic maker.  GranBio is controlled by Gran Investimentos, a holding
company for the Gradin family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
