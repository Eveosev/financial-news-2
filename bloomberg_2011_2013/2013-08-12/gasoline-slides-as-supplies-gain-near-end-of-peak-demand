Gasoline slid on concern the highest
 seasonal inventories  in more than two decades will exceed demand
for the motor fuel as summer driving season nears an end.  Futures retreated as much as 0.9 percent after supplies
rose to  223.6 million  in the seven days ended Aug. 2, the
highest level for this time of year in weekly data going back to
1990, according to Energy Information Administration data. Crack
spreads declined.  “Gasoline inventories are much higher than previous years
and as we move into the end of summer driving season, we’re
going to see gas prices come under pressure,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC, who is based in Houston.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.97 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8885 a gallon at 9:59 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was 25 percent lower than the 100-day average.  Supplies of motor fuel  in PADD 1B, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point for gasoline futures, were 30.4
million barrels, the highest level since July 5, according to
Energy Information Administration data.  Nationwide demand for the fuel was 9.25 million barrels a
day last week, according to EIA data.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate oil
slipped 15 cents to $16.02 a barrel, while the fuel’s premium
over Brent crude on ICE Futures Europe declined 40 cents to
$13.52.  Growing Inventories  With “demand stagnant and inventories growing, crack
spreads should continue to narrow in the near term,” Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group Ltd., said by phone
from Jupiter,  Florida .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September fell 0.43 cent to
$2.9892 a gallon on volume that was 36 percent below the 100-day
average.  ULSD’s crack spread  versus WTI crude widened 50 cents
to $20.26 a barrel, and the premium over Brent increased 26
cents to $17.77.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.6 cent to
$3.549 a gallon, the 11th consecutive decline and lowest level
since July 10, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its
website. Prices are 13.6 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
