JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired Natalia Corfield from Deutsche Bank AG to join its emerging-market
corporate credit research group, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Corfield, who was with Deutsche Bank since May 2012, will
be based in New York and report to Jacob Steinfeld, JPMorgan’s
head of Latin American corporate research, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because she hasn’t started working
yet at JPMorgan.  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, Adrian Garcia-Aranyos, a spokesman for JPMorgan, and Corfield all
declined to comment on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
