Wine growers in  California  are
facing a threat to their grapes from Stinkwort, an invasive
weed which is spreading along roadways in  Napa Valley  and other
areas of the state, the Sacramento Bee said on its website.  While the weed has yet to become a problem at any
vineyard, its turpentine-like odor may pose a danger if it
penetrates grapes growing nearby, the Bee cited John Roncoroni,
a science adviser for Napa County, as saying. The plant,
resembling tumbleweed and with small, yellow flowers, made its
first appearance in California in 1994, the Bee reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
