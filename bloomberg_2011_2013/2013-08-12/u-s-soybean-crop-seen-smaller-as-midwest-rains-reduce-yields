Soybean production in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer and shipper, will be smaller than the
government forecast last month after excessive rain in May and
June reduced planted acreage and damaged yields.  U.S. farmers will  harvest  3.26 billion bushels this year,
compared with 3.42 billion (93.01 million metric tons) estimated
in July and last year’s drought-damaged crop of 3.015 billion,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a  report  after
completing its first surveys of farmers and fields. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected 3.357 billion.  Harvested acreage will fall to 76.4 million acres, compared
with 76.9 million estimated in July and up from 76.1 million a
year earlier, the agency said. Yields were forecast at 42.6
bushels an acre compared with 43.7 bushels expected by analysts.
Last month, the government said yields would rise to a record
44.5 bushels, up from 39.6 bushels a year earlier.   Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 220 million bushels,
up from this year’s projection of 125 million, the  agency  said.
The average estimate of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
262 million bushels.  Global  output  in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will be
281.72 million tons, down from 285.89 million forecast last
month, the USDA said. Worldwide  inventories  at the end of the
marketing year will be 72.27 million tons, down from 74.12
million predicted in July, the USDA said. Traders expected
reserves to rise to 74.39 million, on average.  Through Aug. 9, soybean futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade tumbled 28 percent in the past year to $11.8225 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
