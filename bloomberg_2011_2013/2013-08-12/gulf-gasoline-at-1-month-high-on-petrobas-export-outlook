U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened to the narrowest discount in two months relative to
 New York  futures after Petroleo Brasileiro SA said it expects
imports to rise because of refinery work in Brazil.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  gained 1.75 cents to 10.5
cents below New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:18 p.m.,
the smallest differential since June 14. Conventional, 85-octane
gasoline, or CBOB, increased by 0.5 cent to a discount of 20.25
cents a gallon against futures.  Spot prices rose after Petrobas said gasoline imports would
rise in the second half of the year after falling to 81,000
barrels a day in the second quarter. The company said today on
an earnings call that itâ€™s scheduled to carry out maintenance at
the Gabriel Passos refinery and Henrique Lage plant, both in
 Brazil , in the later half of 2013.  The two plants have a combined capacity of 403,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S.  exported 3.1 million barrels  of oil products to
Brazil in May, the latest month for which data is available,
according to the Energy Information Administration.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast was unchanged at
a discount of 3.63 cents a gallon versus futures. The  3-2-1
crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of refining margins
for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, widened 55 cents to $11.60 a barrel while the
same spread based on Light  Louisiana  Sweet oil widened by 10
cents to $6.35.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is returning units to planned rates at
the St. Charles, Louisiana, refinery following a  power failure 
on Aug. 9, while  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed planned work at the
Borger, Texas, refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
