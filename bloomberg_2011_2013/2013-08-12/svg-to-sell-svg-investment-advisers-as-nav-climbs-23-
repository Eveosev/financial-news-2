SVG Capital Plc (SVI) , the biggest backer
of private-equity firm Permira Advisers LLP, agreed to sell SVG
Investment Managers as it posted 23 percent increase in the
value of its assets in the first half of the year.  Hansa AG, a Basel-based investment company, will buy the
unit, which buys minority stakes in publicly traded companies,
for an undisclosed sum, London-based SVG said in a statement
today. The stock rose as much as 7.2 percent in London trading.  Chief Executive Officer Lynn Fordham has been overhauling
the investment firm after it was forced to cut its commitment in
Permira’s latest fund by half during the financial crisis. SVG
has since sought to broaden its range of investments and pledged
in February to return 300 million pounds ($464 million) to
investors. It also sold a controlling stake in SVG Advisers, its
funds-of-private-equity-funds unit, to Aberdeen Asset Management
Plc.  “We have a portfolio of high-quality assets that continue
to report good revenue and earnings growth,” Fordham said in
the statement. “We are confident that the high quality
management teams at the portfolio companies will continue to
deliver growth for investors.”  Net asset value a share climbed to 480.4 pence as of June
30 from with 391.2 pence at the end of December, buoyed by the
firm’s holdings in German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG
and fashion label  Hugo Boss AG (BOSS) , according to the statement.  The stock climbed 27.9 pence to 418 pence as of 8:07 a.m.
in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
