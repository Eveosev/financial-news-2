Peru ’s armed forces probably killed
three senior members of the Maoist Shining Path guerilla group
in the country’s largest coca-producing region, President
 Ollanta Humala  said.  The men were killed in a shootout last night in an area of
jungle in Ayacucho in the south of the country, Humala said in
an interview with state television station TV Peru.  The victims are thought to include Alejandro Borda
Casafranco, who led the guerilla group in the valley of the
Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, or VRAEM, Humala said. Martin
Quispe Palomino, the second in command, and a third fighter
known as Camarada Alfonso were probably the other victims. DNA
tests will be carried to confirm their identities, Humala said.  The deaths “of very important terrorists is a serious,
irreversible blow to the structure of the Shining Path remnants
in the VRAEM,” said Humala, who fought the group as an army
captain in the 1990s.  The guerrillas protect the production of coca leaf, the
main ingredient for cocaine, and drug transit routes in the
VRAEM.  Peru’s coca output has increased for six straight years,
according to the  United Nations . The Latin American country is
the second largest coca grower and the biggest potential
producer of cocaine, according to the U.S. government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
