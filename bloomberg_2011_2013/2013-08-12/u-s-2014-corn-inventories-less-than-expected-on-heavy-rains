Corn futures rebounded in  Chicago 
and soybeans posted the biggest gain in 13 months after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said unusually heavy rains will mean
smaller harvests than the records forecast last month.  U.S. farmers, the world’s largest corn growers, will
collect 13.763 billion bushels, less than the 13.95 billion
forecast in July and below the 14.036 billion forecast by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey, a USDA report today showed. The
department predicted soybean output will be 3.255 billion
bushels, down from 3.42 billion expected last month and 3.357
billion forecast by analysts.  Prices for both crops slid into bear markets this year,
reducing costs for buyers including  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) 
and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , on expectations that record harvests would
bolster global inventories eroded by a U.S. drought in 2012.
Heavy rains in the Midwest during May and June delayed corn and
soybean planting, and cool, dry weather during the past month
slowed crop development.  “Cool weather in July hurt yield potential more than
expected, and now the markets are adding a weather-risk
premium,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for
AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois . “The smaller U.S. corn
and soybean crops were a surprise and will increase the
importance for an extended growing season.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.4 percent to
close at $4.64 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest advance since July 9. Before the USDA report,
corn reached $4.465, the lowest for a most-active contract since
September 2010. Prices have tumbled 43 percent in the past 12
months.  Soybean futures for November delivery rallied 3.6 percent
to $12.2525 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 2012. The price touched $11.625 on
Aug. 7, the lowest in 18 months.  Record Crops  Even with reduced yield prospects, domestic corn output
will be a record, reducing average cash prices to $4.90, down 30
percent from $6.95 forecast in the year that ends Aug. 31, the
USDA said. Cash-soybean prices may average $11.35, down 21
percent from $14.40 forecast this year, as U.S. production jumps
8 percent to the second-highest ever, the agency said.  World corn production this year will rise 12 percent to
957.1 million metric tons from 858.8 million last year, the USDA
said. Reserve inventories before the 2014 harvest will jump 22
percent to 150.17 million, from 123.11 million estimated on Oct.
1 this year, the biggest jump in nine years. World soybean
inventories next year will rise 16 percent to a record 72.27
million tons, the government forecast.  “There is still a burdensome supply of grain developing
this year,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.
“Rallies may be limited because U.S. supplies will need to stay
competitive to boost demand.”  Reduced Costs  ADM, the grain processor that makes  animal feed , sweeteners
and ethanol, is “optimistic” about margins in 2014 and 2015
because of rising corn supply, Chief Operating Officer Juan Luciano said on a conference call Aug. 6. Shares of the Decatur,
Illinois-based company are up 41 percent this year.  Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat processor, will report a
37 percent gain in profit to $797.6 million this year according
to the mean of eight analysts  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Shares of the Springdale, Arkansas-based company rallied 61
percent this year. Tyson handled an average of 41.4 million
chickens, 403,000 hogs and 132,000 head of cattle last year,
data on its website show.  Crop Yields  Average corn yields this year may reach 154.4 bushels an
acre, down from 156.5 estimated in July and up from 123.4 in
2012. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 158 bushels, on
average. Harvested acreage was forecast at 89.1 million acres
this year, unchanged from last month, the USDA said.  Domestic  reserves  of corn on Aug. 31, 2014, before next
year’s harvest, will total 1.837 billion bushels, down from
1.959 billion (49.77 million metric tons) forecast in July, the
USDA said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting 2.013
billion, on average. Inventories before the start of this year’s
harvest will total 719 million bushels, compared with 729
million forecast a month earlier and 989 million last year.  Wheat futures for December delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
$6.49 a bushel on the CBOT. Prices rallied as much as 1.7
percent after the report and dropped 0.7 percent before it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
