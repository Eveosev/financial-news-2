In the U.S.,  retail sales  probably
rose for a fourth straight month and industrial production
climbed for a second month in July. The euro-area is likely to
have exited a recession in the second quarter after a record six
quarters of contraction, data may show.  Investors in SAC Capital Advisers LP face a deadline to
redeem money for the third quarter from founder  Steven Cohen â€™s
hedge fund, which has been indicted for perpetrating what the
U.S. calls an unprecedented insider-trading scheme.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB)  will be among companies releasing results.  MONDAY, AUG. 12  To contact the reporters on this story:
