     Aug. 12 (Bloomberg) -- South Korea ’s government bond futures
gained as overseas funds bought more contracts than they sold on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will refrain from raising
interest rates until 2015. The won fell.  Global investors were  net buyers  of three-year futures for
a third day, exchange data show. Foreign funds bought more South
Korean stocks and bonds than they sold in July after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  quelled concern that a
reduction of U.S. stimulus was imminent, the Financial
Supervisory Service said last week. The nation’s economy is
growing “moderately,” led mainly by exports,  Bank of Korea 
said last week after keeping borrowing costs unchanged.  Three-year futures rose 0.05 to 105.72 as of 3:31 p.m. in
 Seoul , after reaching 105.76 earlier, the highest since July 23,
exchange data show. The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign
bonds due June 2016 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 2.9 percent, the lowest level since July 24, according
to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  “Foreign investors are buying bond futures, especially the
short-term ones, as they believe the Fed may not raise  interest
rates  until 2015,” said Lee Jung Bum, a fixed-income analyst at
Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “South Korea’s
fundamentals are relatively reliable. It remains to be seen
whether appetite for longer-term bonds returns.”  Won Declines  South Korea sold 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) of five-year securities today at 3.21 percent with a bid-to-cover ratio
of 4.35 times, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said on its
website. That compares with 3.04 times at the last such auction
in July, which was the lowest since February 2011, Bloomberg
data show. The government will offer 1.8 trillion won of 10-year
notes next week.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,113.53 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, halting a two-day advance. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 29 basis points to
6.57 percent.  “Importers bought dollars today as the currency snapped
its gains,” said Jung Sung Yoon, a currency trader at Korea
Exchange Bank in Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
