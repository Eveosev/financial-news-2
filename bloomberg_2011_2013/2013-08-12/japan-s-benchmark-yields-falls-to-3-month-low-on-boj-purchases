Japanese government bonds rallied,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to the lowest level in three
months, after the central bank offered to buy the debt from the
market for the fourth time this month.  Bond futures rose to the highest in three months as the
Bank of  Japan  offered to purchase 450 billion yen ($4.7 billion)
of paper maturing in five to 10 years, and 200 billion yen of
bonds due in more than 10 years. Japan’s economy grew less than
economists forecast in the second quarter, government data
released in  Tokyo  today showed.  “Although the market is still cautious, the demand-supply
balance for JGBs is favorable,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , the
Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one
of the 23 primary dealers obliged to bid at government auctions.
“The BOJ is likely to conduct two purchase operations this
week.”  Japan’s 10-year yields slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.745 percent, at 2:07 p.m. in Tokyo,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co. That was the  least  since May
13. The price of the 0.8 percent note due June 2023 added 0.092
yen to 100.5 yen.  Lead 10-year bond futures for September delivery reached
144.13 in Tokyo, the most since May 10, before trading at
144.08. The Topix index of shares fell 0.6 percent. The 30-year
bond yield fell two basis points to 1.775 percent, the lowest
since June 10, while the 20-year yield touched 1.655 percent, a
level unseen since June 13.  Ten-year yields have swung from an all-time low of 0.315
percent to as much as 1 percent since the BOJ announced on April
4 that it would double monthly bond purchases to more than 7
trillion yen as it targets 2 percent inflation in two years.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  expanded an annualized 2.6
percent in the second quarter, compared with a revised 3.8
percent increase in the first, Cabinet Office data showed.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast 3.6 percent
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
