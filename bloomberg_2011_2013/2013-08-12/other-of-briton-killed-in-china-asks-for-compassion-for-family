The mother of a British businessman
whose murder led to the ouster of Politburo member Bo Xilai
urged the government to show compassion to his children, who
have no “financial provision for their future,” the Wall
Street Journal reported.  Ann Heywood, the mother of Neil Heywood, said she was
“surprised and disappointed” that Chinese authorities hadn’t
responded in a substantive way despite “repeated discreet
approaches,” the Journal reported, citing a  statement  she gave
the newspaper yesterday. The statement didn’t say what Ann
Heywood was asking for.  Neil Heywood was found dead in the southwest city of
Chongqing in November 2011, and Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, was later
convicted of poisoning him. Bo is awaiting trial on corruption
and abuse of power charges in a case that has posed the
Communist Party’s biggest political crisis since the 1989
Tiananmen Square protests.  Heywood’s children, who are 8 and 12 years old, are
vulnerable to uncertainty and insecurity, Ann Heywood said in
the statement, according to the Journal. Citing friends it
didn’t identify, The Journal said his widow and their two
children live in Beijing.  “I hope and trust that the leaders of this great nation,
which Neil loved and respected, will now show decisiveness and
compassion, so as to mitigate the consequences of a terrible
crime and to enable my family finally to achieve some kind of
closure to our ongoing nightmare,” she said.  A phone call to the news office of  China ’s Foreign Ministry
rang unanswered today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
