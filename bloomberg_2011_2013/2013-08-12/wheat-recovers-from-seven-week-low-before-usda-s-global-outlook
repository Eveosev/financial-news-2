Soybeans rallied to a one-week high
after  China , the world’s largest buyer, made the sixth-biggest
purchase ever from the U.S. Wheat fell for a fourth straight
session, and corn was little changed.  Exporters sold 713,000 metric tons of soybeans to China for
delivery in the 12 months starting Sept. 1, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said today. China imported a record 7.2 million
tons in July, customs figures show, and the USDA predicts the
country will import 69 million tons next year, up from 59
million forecast in the year that ends Sept. 30.  “Big Chinese purchases are providing support to the
soybean market,” Jim Gerlach, the president of A/C Trading Co.
in Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview today. “U.S.
soybeans are competitive, and China is buying ahead to lock in
import needs.”  Soybean futures for delivery in November climbed 1.9
percent to $12.0525 a bushel at 9:48 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade, after touching $12.07, the highest since Aug. 2.
Prices as of Aug. 9 dropped 16 percent this year, the sixth-largest decline among 24 commodities tracked by the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Soybeans also rose on speculation that U.S. production will
be smaller than the government predicted in July, Gerlach said.
The USDA is scheduled to update its forecasts at noon today in
 Washington .  Traders predicted the USDA will cut its soybean forecast by
1.8 percent to 3.357 billion bushels from 3.42 billion expected
in July, a Bloomberg survey showed. Inventories before the 2014
harvest may be cut 11 percent from 295 million bushels
anticipated in July, according to a Bloomberg survey  Wheat futures for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to
$6.4575 a bushel on the CBOT. On Aug. 9, prices reached $6.435,
the lowest for a most-active contract since June 18, 2012.  France ’s wheat harvest, the European Union’s biggest, will
climb 1.7 percent to 36.1 million tons from 2012, the
Agriculture Ministry forecast, raising its outlook from 35.9
million tons a month ago on better-than-expected yields.  Corn futures for delivery in December was up 0.1 percent at
$4.5375 a bushel in Chicago, after fluctuating between gains and
losses. Earlier, the price touched $4.515, the lowest for a
most-active contract since September 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
