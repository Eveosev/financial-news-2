Sonda SA (SONDA) ,  Chile ’s largest
information technology services provider, fell on concern the
Panamanian government may cancel one of its contracts.  Sonda retreated 0.7 percent to 1,359.60 pesos at the close
of trading in Santiago, snapping two days of gains. The IPSA
benchmark index advanced 0.2 percent.  Panama’s government may cancel the company’s contract to
operate the system of prepaid fare cards used in the country’s
Mi Bus system because of deficient services, President Ricardo Martinelli said Aug. 9 in a televised interview in  TVN Noticias .  “We expect Sonda’s stock to soften due to this news,”
Francisco Errandonea and Valder Nogueira, analysts at Banco
Santander SA, said in an e-mailed note today. The company may
seek to negotiate with the Panamanian government to improve
services and avoid losing the concession, they said.  The contract is for $150 million for 15 years, or less than
1 percent of Sonda’s monthly revenue, Santander said.  A Sonda press official, who asked not to be identified
because of company policy, declined to comment. Phone calls and
an e-mail to a press official at  Panama ’s Office of the
President weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
