Smiles SA (SMLE3) , the frequent-flier unit
of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, is posting the biggest
two-day rally since first selling shares in April after earnings
beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares surged 7.1 percent to 27.75 reais at 12:42 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , pushing gains in the past two sessions to 14
percent. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  stock benchmark climbed 2.2 percent today.  Smiles reported adjusted net income of 48.3 million reais
($21.3 million) in the second quarter, compared with an average
estimate for profit of 38.9 million reais, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The “strong” second-quarter results at
the Sao Paulo-based company boost the outlook for the rest of
the year,  Rafael Frade and Carlos Firetti, analysts at Banco
Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit, wrote in a note to clients today.  “We expect the company to post strong growth in the coming
quarters,” they wrote.  Smiles rose 6.1 percent on Aug. 9 as competitor  Multiplus
SA (MPLU3) , which reported results for the three months ended in June on
Aug. 8 after the market close, beat estimates for the first time
in three quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Smiles has nine buy recommendations and two sells,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Multiplus has six buys,
eight holds and one sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
