Norway ’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said tax cuts proposed by opposition leader Erna Solberg would increase inequality in Scandinavia’s richest
nation.  “If some party promises something between 25 billion
kroner ($4.3 billion) and 100 billion kroner in lower taxes, it
will mean less for the most important challenges in society,”
Stoltenberg, who is trailing behind Conservative Party leader
Solberg in the polls, said in a debate on state broadcaster NRK
late yesterday.  Stoltenberg, who has headed a Labor-led coalition for eight
years, said he would prioritize research and education if re-elected. He’s also pledged to extend Norway’s welfare model,
which is financed by the nation’s oil wealth. Yet most polls
show the Conservatives are poised to win Sept. 9 elections after
promising voters tax cuts and spending on roads, railways and
education.  “There’s no reason for Norwegians to fear us,” Solberg
said. “Today’s government has run out of ideas -- we know that
we can reduce the wait for health care, increase knowledge in
the schools and build roads faster.”  Support for Stoltenberg’s  Labor Party  fell 1.5 percentage
points to 28.6 percent, according to a TNS Gallup poll published
by TV2 today. The Conservatives were little changed at 31.6
percent and the Progress Party’s support rose 0.4 percentage
point to 14.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
