Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking service, agreed to acquire Mobile
Technologies, a developer of speech-recognition tools.  The Pittsburgh-based  company  will help  Facebook  improve
products as voice technology becomes an increasingly important
way for people to navigate the Web, Tom Stocky, a product-management director at Facebook,  said  on the company’s website
today. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “Although more than a billion people around the world
already use Facebook every month, we are always looking for ways
to help connect the rest of the world as well,” Stocky wrote.
“This acquisition is an investment in our long-term product
road map as we continue toward our company’s mission.”  Facebook is bolstering efforts to keep users engaged with
its services, adding new features that help people more easily
communicate and share information. The company reached 1.15
billion users during the second quarter.  Mobile Technologies, founded in 2001, developed Jibbigo, a
a speech-to-speech translator application for phones, according
to the company’s website. Mobile Technologies also provides an
automatic interpretation service for lectures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
