Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed the most in a
month as drugmakers rallied on higher earnings and metal
companies advanced. The government will release data on consumer
prices and factory output later today.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , India’s biggest
drugmaker, jumped the most since 2009 after posting a 56 percent
gain in net income before a one-time charge.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) 
paced advances for metal shares.  State Bank of India  led
declines for lenders as policy makers announced steps to drain
cash from the financial system to boost the rupee.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 1.3 percent to 19,038.82 at 2 p.m.
in Mumbai. Earnings and economic data are setting the tone for
the market along with concern about the rupee, said Alex Mathews, head of research at  Geojit BNP Paribas Financial
Services Ltd. (GBNP)  The government may announce measures to boost the
currency today such as higher  import duties , CNBC-TV18 reported,
without saying where it got the information.  “A rally in drugmakers is overshadowing the decline in
bank stocks,” Mathews said by telephone from the southern city
of Kochi. “Investors are also buying beaten-down sectors like
metals.”  Sun Pharmaceutical surged 7.2 percent to 542.6 rupees, the
most since May 2009. The exporter’s profit jumped after sales of
its generic drugs in the U.S. climbed. Cipla jumped 2.3 percent
to 418.75 rupees after its first-quarter earnings beat analyst
estimates.  Earnings Outlook  Tata Steel, which is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow,
soared 8.7 percent to 237.8 rupees amid speculation lower raw
material costs will boost profit. The company will benefit from
a fall in contract prices of  iron ore  and coking coal, said
Giriraj Daga, an analyst at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  advanced 7 percent to 222 rupees.
 Sterlite Industries (STLT)  (India) Ltd. increased 4.7 percent to 79.8
rupees. The S&P BSE Metal Index rallied 3.4 percent, extending
last week’s 5.3 percent surge.  About 43 percent of Sensex companies that have reported
earnings so far for the June quarter missed analyst estimates.
That compares with 27 percent companies that missed forecasts
for the March quarter and 43 percent in the three months through
December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has retreated 1.9 percent this year and  trades 
at 13.4 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s multiple of 10.  Weak Rupee  The  Reserve Bank of India  said on Aug. 8 that it will sell
cash management bills every Monday, stepping up efforts to
bolster the rupee by curbing supply of the currency.  The RBI plans to sell 220 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) of
cash management bills each week, according to an e-mailed
statement. The measure, which follows a review of the impact of
earlier measures to steady the currency, is for “effective
liquidity management,” it said.  The Indian currency fell to an all-time low of 61.805 per
dollar on Aug. 6. The rupee has slumped about 12 percent against
the dollar in the past six months even as the monetary authority
restricted banks’ access to cash, curbed trading in currency
derivatives and raised two  interest rates .  State Bank of India (SBIN)  tumbled 2.8 percent to 1,618.3 rupees.
The nation’s biggest lender may say profit declined to 34.2
billion rupees in the quarter ended June, compared with 37.5
billion rupees a year ago, according to the median of 42 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  HDFC Bank (HDFCB)  fell 0.6 percent to
607 rupees. The S&P BSE Bankex fell 1.1 percent to the lowest
level since June 2012.  India will release industrial production data for June at
5:30 p.m. in New Delhi. Factory output probably dropped 1.1
percent, a second straight month of declines, according to the
median of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Consumer price inflation probably slowed to 9.7 percent in
July from 9.87 percent the previous month, according to the
median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange gained
1.2 percent to 5,633.25. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, fell 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
