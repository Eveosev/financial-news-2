Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
which manages pension funds for the western Canadian province,
would consider an investment in  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  if the
smartphone maker went private.  “It’s early days,” AIMCo Chief Executive Officer Leo De Bever said today in a telephone interview. “No one has
approached us with anything that is baked.”  If BlackBerry went private and AIMCo was approached by a
lead investor, the Edmonton-based firm would consider it, he
said.  The  fund manager  had assets of C$68.6 billion ($66.6
billion) at the end of last year.  Mark Wiseman , CEO of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,
the second-largest pension fund manager in the country, said in
an interview Aug. 9 he would weigh an investment in BlackBerry
should the company decide to go private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
