Desert locust infestations are
likely to increase after rain improved conditions for the plague
insects in summer breeding areas in  Sudan  as well as West
 Africa , the United Nations reported.  Parts of  central Sudan  had “unusually heavy” rain in
August’s first 10 days, the UN’s Rome-based Food & Agriculture
Organization wrote on its  Locust Watch  website today. Rain also
fell in breeding areas in the northern Sahel region of Africa,
according to the agency.  “Once floodwaters recede, ecological conditions are likely
to remain favorable for breeding for several months,” the FAO
wrote of Sudan. “Small-scale breeding is likely to be in
progress and will cause locust numbers to increase.”  Countries in northern and eastern Africa should carry out
regular surveys to monitor locust conditions in the next few
months, according to the FAO. A swarm of the insects covering a
square kilometer (0.4 square mile) can eat between 80 and 160
metric tons of crops a day, based on calculations using data
from the agency.  An adult desert locust can eat its own weight of about 2
grams (0.07 ounce) daily, and swarms can cover several hundred
square kilometers, with 40 million to 80 million of the insects
per square kilometer, according to the FAO.  Desert-locust distribution can extend over 60 countries
during plague years,  covering  about 29 million square
kilometers, according to the UN agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
