Hajime Kitano, the only Japan-based
equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  MUFG Securities Co., left
last week after just over three months on the job.  Tokyo-based Morgan Stanley spokesman Natsuo Nishio
confirmed the departure and that Kitano was the bank’s sole
stocks strategist in Japan. Kitano started at the investment
firm on May 1. Before that, he worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co.
from 2006 until 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The departure leaves Morgan Stanley with nobody in the
equity-strategy role in  Tokyo  as Japanese stocks post the
biggest rally this year among developed markets. Kitano was
ranked Japan’s top equity strategist in 2013 by Institutional
Investor, claiming the No. 1 position for the third time since
2007, according to the magazine’s  website .  Morgan Stanley will provide coverage of Japan strategy
through its regional team in  Hong Kong  led by  Jonathan Garner ,
the firm’s chief Asian and global emerging market equity
strategist, Nishio said in an e-mail.  Garner wrote the bank’s reports on Japan from Hong Kong
between the July 2011 departure of Tokyo-based Alexander Kinmont
and Kitano’s arrival in May.  An email to Kitano’s personal address was not immediately
answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
