Anglo American Plc (AAL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Cutifani  said he will update investors in December
on the outcome of a review of the mining company’s operations to
identify cost savings.  Cutifani, who started as CEO in April, is working his way
around the London-based company’s operations and said the review
will be finished by next month.  In December “we will tell people how we are doing against
our major cost reduction program, which is eliminating
duplication, how we’re doing on our major projects to improve
the business,” Cutifani told reporters today in Montreal after
a speech at the World Mining Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
