Copper fell after the best weekly
gain in almost 11 months as  Japan ’s economy grew less than
expected. Aluminum, zinc and lead declined.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped as much as 0.8 percent to $7,220 a metric ton
and was at $7,229 at 11:09 a.m. in  Seoul . The metal is down 8.9
percent this year. The contract for delivery in September fell
0.5 percent at $3.29 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  Second-quarter gross domestic product rose an annualized
2.6 percent in Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy, after
gaining 3.8 percent the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office
reported today. That compares with the median estimate of a 3.6
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The weak Japan GDP number is weighing on the market,”
said Park Jong Beom, a senior trader at Tong Yang Securities Inc.
in Seoul. “The data probably provided some investors with a
good excuse to take profits after the recent rally.”  Copper rose 3.9 percent last week as a jump in industrial
output added to signs of economic optimism in China, the biggest
user. Metal for delivery in November rose 0.8 percent to 51,950
 yuan  ($8,486) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, nickel advanced as tin fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
