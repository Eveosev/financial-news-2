A case of 1998 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild sold for 5,800 pounds ($9,000) on Liv-ex in the past
week, matching its mid-March level and outperforming the four
percent drop in the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index over the period.  The transaction on Aug. 7 was the fourth sale at that level
out of seven trades in Lafite ’98 since the start of last month
and the seventh since the beginning of June, according to data
on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The regularity of trading in Lafite ’98 at that price is a
barometer of stability in demand for older vintages from leading
Bordeaux growers after market volatility earlier in the year
during the sales campaign for the region’s 2012 wines. Lafite, a
first-growth wine estate in the Pauillac region north of the
city, is one of the highest-priced producers of the Medoc with
 Chateau Latour , Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and  Chateau Margaux .  “The market has moved away from ‘commodity claret,’ and
intrinsic, rather than speculative, value is what is driving
demand,” London wine merchant  Fine+Rare  wrote in its July
market report on its website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 has declined since March 15, paring
an eight percent gain made in the previous 10 weeks. While
Lafite ’98 has established stability around the 5,800 pound
level over the past five months, it touched a high for 2013 of
5,910 pounds last month and was trading as low as 5,100 pounds
in January.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The 1998 Lafite is the estate’s seventh-most expensive of
the past 20 years, according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex. It was rated 98 on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting it among the vineyard’s top six of the past 15
years.  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has more than 100 hectares (247
acres) planted with red-grape vines.  Cabernet Sauvignon 
typically makes up from 80 percent to 95 percent of its wine,
with Merlot from 5 percent to 20 percent, and smaller quantities
of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyard, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and ranked
among the Bordeaux first-growth estates in the Medoc
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  Its vineyards date back at least to the 17th century and
the estate has been under the control of the Rothschild family
since being acquired by Baron James de Rothschild, then head of
its French branch, in August 1868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
