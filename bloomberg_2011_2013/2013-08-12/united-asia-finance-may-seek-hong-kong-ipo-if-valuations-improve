United Asia Finance Ltd. , a
consumer-finance arm of Sun Hung Kai & Co. that’s expanding in
China, may sell shares in  Hong Kong  to fund its growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  United  Asia  expanded lending on the mainland last year by
more than 60 percent to more than 2 billion  yuan  ($327 million),
compared with 10 percent growth in its Hong Kong loan book,
which totaled HK$8.3 billion ($1.1 billion), Chief Executive
Officer Akihiro Nagahara said in an interview on Aug. 9. The
company has invested more than 4 billion yuan in its China
operations.  “Listing will improve our transparency and help us get
capital for expansion,” Nagahara said. “If the market
improves, with better price-to-valuation, I’d like UA Finance to
list on Hong Kong’s main board.” The company has no listing
plans for now, he said.  China  is boosting lending to smaller entrepreneurs to
bolster economic growth, creating opportunities for companies
like UA Finance, which ran 94 mainland China outlets as of the
end of June. The 22-year-old company seeks to add 30 to 40
outlets each year to offer unsecured lending to small and
medium-sized companies and individuals, Nagahara said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
