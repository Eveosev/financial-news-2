Societe Generale  said today it’s
closing spread trades on Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean
futures, after the bets on narrowing spreads reached the bank’s
targets.  In corn, the bank said it will exit a position recommended
May 30 to short September futures and go long in the December
contract. Since then, the spread has narrowed to 10 cents a
bushel from 29 cents, Chris Narayanan, a Societe Generale
analyst in  New York , said in an e-mailed report. The spread was
as wide as 46.75 cents on July 19, the most since August 2012.  “We recommended this trade on the premise that part of the
new and large crop should be available in September or in the
coming weeks after as harvest progresses north,” Narayanan said
in the report. “The need to pay a premium for immediate
delivery would lessen. In recent days, this spread has
collapsed, hitting our target.”  Corn futures for September delivery settled today at $4.72
a bushel, while the December contract was at $4.64.  Societe Generale also said it closed its soybean spread
trade in which it recommended selling September futures and
buying the November contract. Narayanan said he recommended the
trade in June when the spread between the contracts was at 44.5
cents a bushel. Today, the price gap settled at 31.25 cents,
after last week moving as low as 24.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
