South African yellow-corn futures
declined to the lowest level in nearly three months after the
Crop Estimates Committee increased its forecast for the grain
last month.  “Yellow will be lower as the Crop Estimate Committee
increased the yellow maize for  South Africa  by 2.9 percent,”
Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader for Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  The most active yellow corn contract for delivery in
September, dropped 0.8 percent to 2,109 rand ($214) a metric
ton, the lowest since May 13, by the close in Johannesburg on
the South African Futures Exchange. The white variety for
delivery in December fell 0.8 percent to 2,303 rand a ton.  The Crop Estimates Committee raised its forecast for yellow
corn production by 2.9 percent to 5.65 million tons, it said in
a July 25 report. Exports of the grain since the season began on
April 27 were 58 percent higher than for the whole of the prior
marketing year, according to the Grain Information Service.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. Yellow corn, also called maize, is mainly used as  animal
feed , while the white variety is used to make one of the
nation’s staple foods.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to 3,323
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
