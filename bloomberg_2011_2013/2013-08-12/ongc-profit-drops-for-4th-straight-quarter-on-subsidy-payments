Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , India’s
biggest energy explorer, reported a fourth consecutive quarter
of lower profit after it sold crude to state-run refiners at
steeper discounts.  Net income  fell 34 percent to 40.2 billion rupees ($659
million) in the three months ended June 30 from 60.8 billion
rupees a year earlier, according to a stock exchange filing
today. That missed the 49.3 billion rupee median  estimate  of 36
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.3 percent to 192.2
billion rupees.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government is asking state-controlled oil explorers ONGC and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  to bear a
larger portion of the revenue losses state-run refiners incur on
selling fuels below the cost of production to help curb
inflation. The higher subsidy is cutting the cash reserves of
the explorers and putting pressure on capital expenditure plans,
according to Oil India Finance Director T.K. Ananth Kumar.  Total cost surged 21 percent to 147 billion rupees, while
other expenses increased 44 percent to 45.8 billion rupees,
according to the filing. The total tax expenditure declined 38
percent to 17.68 billion rupees.  ONGC rose 1.8 percent to 278.10 rupees in Mumbai. The
 shares  have gained 3.8 percent this year, compared with a 2.5
percent drop in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index. The earnings
were announced after trading ended.  Higher Discounts  The explorer gave 126.2 billion rupees of discounts to
refiners including  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  in the quarter, compared
with 123.5 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Lower  oil prices  in the quarter also eroded earnings. The
price of  Brent crude , a benchmark for more than half of the
world’s oil, fell 5 percent to an average $103.35 in the quarter,
compared with a year earlier.  ONGC plans to spend 11 trillion rupees by 2030 to raise
production and add reserves in India and overseas. Expenditure
in the year through March 31, 2014 is expected to be 350 billion
rupees, according to Finance Director Aloke Kumar Banerjee. The
company spent 295 billion rupees in the last financial year,
less than the planned 335 billion rupees.  The government in June allowed producers including ONGC and
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  to raise natural gas prices starting
April 1.  Rates will be set according to a 12-month weighted average
of gas prices in the U.S. and U.K. and the import prices for
Japan, an Asian benchmark, and India. This may increase local
prices by about 90 percent from $4.2 per million British thermal
units, according to oil secretary Vivek Rae.  An increase of $1 in local gas prices will boost ONGC’s
annual profit by 20 billion rupees, Banerjee said June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
