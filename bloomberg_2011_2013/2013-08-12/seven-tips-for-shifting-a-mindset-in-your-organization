We're all fascinated by new ideas and how they can grab hold of us, influencing how we think and affecting how we take action. How does Atul Gawande (the  checklist  doctor) get inside my head, when others don't? Why does  Gwyneth Paltrow  make me adjust my behaviors, when others can't? In business, especially, we're inundated with new ideas—so many we can hardly process or evaluate them.  If you have tried introducing a new idea into your organization or community—especially if it's an abstract idea like sustainability, diversity, or innovativeness—you know it's tough. People may ignore your idea, pooh-pooh it, or just steal it. You put your energy, your reputation, and maybe your future, on the line. Still, when you have an idea you think is valuable and could change things for the better, some inexplicable force may compel you to "go public" with it. You want to change a prevailing mindset and you're willing to stick your neck out, at least a little, to do it. The question is how, especially when you're not Gawande or Paltrow, to change an organization from the inside when you don't necessarily have a ton of formal authority on your side. Take a look at what the " idea entrepreneur " does. This is the new type of cultural player—idea-driven people like Gawande and Paltrow, Michael Pollan (food), Cesar Millan (dogs), Blake Mycoskie (business = philanthropy), and many others—who reach large audiences and gain widespread influence. These are independent operators. They're wealthy and famous. They publish books and appear on TV. But do their methods of idea-spreading apply to the office-dweller, the organizational citizen, the manager or executive? The answer is  yes, with some modifications . To illustrate, let me introduce Samantha Joseph, who works for  Iron Mountain Incorporated , a leader in records storage and information management services. Sam is young, ambitious, and idea-driven: she believes that for-profit companies can drive significant business value when they take a strategic approach to social and environmental sustainability. After earning her MBA from MIT in 2009, Sam could not find a position in sustainability, so she joined Iron Mountain as a manager in strategy, knowing the company had no sustainability function and hoping to build it.  Sam saw opportunity. She plunged into the strategy job, but also began to work on bringing the idea of sustainability to Iron Mountain—an exciting if daunting task, considering the number of employees, locations, facilities, trucks, and other real assets involved.  Here are some of the things that big-time idea entrepreneurs do that Sam adapted for her quest:
 Each path to influence, and each change of mindset, looks different. Within two years, Iron Mountain had reduced its carbon footprint, helped archive the blueprints of some of the world's most historic sites, and donated 65,000 volunteer hours to community efforts, among other initiatives. And today, corporate responsibility activities are started and driven by employees all over the country.  Sam most directly knows the idea has gained influence when someone says to her:  I'm so proud of what we're doing.  One-on-one validation is a powerful metric.
