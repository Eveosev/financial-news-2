The Ibovespa rose the most among
major equity gauges in the Americas after Petroleo Brasileiro
SA’s profit exceeded analysts’ forecasts, boosting the outlook
for Brazilian corporate earnings.  Petrobras, as the state-controlled oil producer is also
known, contributed the most to the index’s advance. Mining
company Vale SA rallied for a fourth day.  PDG Realty SA
Empreendimentos & Participacoes (PDGR3)  led a rally by homebuilders.
Tobacco company  Souza Cruz SA (CRUZ3)  gained after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised its recommendation to the equivalent of buy.  The Ibovespa added 2.5 percent to 51,107.98 at 11:30 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Sixty-nine stocks rose on the index while two
fell. The real was little changed at 2.2723 per dollar.
Petrobras reported adjusted earnings of 48 centavos per share,
compared with an average  estimate  of 45 centavos among 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Petrobras and Vale’s earnings might be a signal that at
least things are not as bad as some people thought,” Fabio Cardoso, a partner at Rio de Janeiro-based equity advisory firm
Adinvest Consultoria, said in a phone interview. “The Ibovespa
may be capable of sustaining gains for a while from now on.”  Petrobras climbed 3 percent to 17.60 reais. While 19 of 35
companies on the Ibovespa that have already disclosed second-quarter  earnings  missed estimates, Petrobras and Vale exceeded
forecasts. Vale, the world’s largest iron ore producer, reported
adjusted earnings of 1.04 reais per share on Aug. 7, compared
with an average estimate of 1.02 reais among analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Its shares gained 1.8 percent to 31.47 reais
today.  PDG Realty rose 7.8 percent to 1.94 reais. Competitor
 Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  climbed 5.8 percent to 3.08 reais.  2013 Slump  The Ibovespa slumped 18 percent this year through Aug. 9,
wiping out $222 billion from the  value  of Brazilian stocks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazil ’s benchmark
equity gauge trades at 12.4 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.5 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.99 billion
reais on Aug. 9, compared with a daily average of 7.58 billion
