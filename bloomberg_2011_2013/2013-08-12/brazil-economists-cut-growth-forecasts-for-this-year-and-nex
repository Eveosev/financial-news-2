Economists covering  Brazil  lowered
their growth forecasts for 2013 and 2014, as the government
struggles to revive expansion in the world’s second-biggest
emerging market.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2.21 percent
this year and 2.50 percent next year, down from the previous
week’s estimates of 2.24 percent and 2.60 percent respectively,
according to an Aug. 9 central bank survey of about 100 analysts
published today. Economists have cut their prediction for GDP
growth this year in 12 out of the last 13 weeks.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
steer Brazil out of a period of high inflation and slow growth.
While monthly inflation in July was the slowest in three years,
a 9.7 percent depreciation in the real so far this year puts
pressure on prices as the cost of imports rises. Central bankers
have raised the key rate by 125 basis points since April and
signaled they may extend increases to ensure inflation doesn’t
hurt demand and investments.  Prices as measured by the IPCA index rose 0.03 percent in
July from the month prior, the slowest increase in three years,
as food and transportation costs eased.  Annual inflation  slowed
to 6.27 percent from 6.70 percent in June, according to the
national statistics agency.  Under Control  The July result shows that Brazil’s inflation is under
control, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said Aug. 7. The central
bank targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Economists in the survey lowered their forecast for 2013
inflation to 5.75 percent from 5.74 percent, and cut their
estimate for inflation next year to 5.85 percent from 5.87
percent.  Recent statistics indicate Brazil continues to experience
uneven growth. While industrial output in June was higher than
economists’ forecasts,  economic activity  in May fell the most
since December 2008.  Consumer confidence   plunged  in July to the
lowest level since May 2009, according to a survey from the
Fundacao Getulio Vargas.  Latin America ’s largest economy will expand by 3 percent
this year, Mantega said on July 22. That compares with 0.9
percent growth last year and 2.7 percent growth in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
