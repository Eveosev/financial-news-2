Wall Street’s self-regulator is
looking into whether research analysts are participating in
pitches to win business underwriting initial public offerings,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has requested
information from several firms, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the probe may not result in a formal
investigation. The person didn’t say which firms were queried.  Since the dot-com bust a decade ago, investment bankers
have been restricted from arranging communications between
analysts, who provide recommendations to investors, and the
companies they seek business from. The JOBS Act, passed last
year, loosens those regulations when banks are dealing with
companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue.  The rules were imposed in 2003 by regulators and by a
settlement between then-New York Attorney General  Eliot Spitzer 
and 10 firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. Spitzer forced the banks to change their practices
after his office obtained internal e-mails from Merrill Lynch &
Co. analysts who privately called dot-com stocks they had
recommended “dogs” and “crap.”  The New York Times reported the Finra inquiry yesterday.
The newspaper said that companies now often interview analysts
when picking banks to underwrite their IPOs, citing people it
didn’t identify. The analysts are supposed to limit the talks to
trends and avoid discussing the company that’s going public,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
