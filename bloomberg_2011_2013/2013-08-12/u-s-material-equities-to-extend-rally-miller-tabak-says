Investors may rotate into  raw-material stocks  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after a gauge
of commodity producers hit a “bottom” relative to the broader
measure, according to  Miller Tabak  & Co.’s Jonathan Krinsky.  The  relative strength  of the  S&P 500 (SPX)  Materials Index to the
 S&P 500  reached 0.1496 on July 5, near the 0.1489 level reached
in November 2008. This created a “very long-term double
bottom” in the ratio of the two indexes, according to Krinsky,
the chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak.  The ratio “recently found support at the exact same
level” as in 2008, New York-based Krinsky wrote in a note
today. “If the relative strength of the S&P 500 Materials
versus the S&P 500 makes a new low below 0.15, then all bets are
off. Otherwise, we think the underperformance of materials may
have put in a low and would look for continued rotation into
year end.”  Since the relative strength’s low on July 5, the gauge of
commodity producers has climbed 6.7 percent and the S&P 500 has
added 3.4 percent. The S&P 500 Materials Index rose 0.9 percent
last week, the only gain of the 10 industry groups in the wider
equity benchmark. The broader index slid 1.1 percent over the
same period, its biggest weekly drop since June.  So far this
year , commodity stocks have risen less than eight other groups.  Unlike the S&P 500, the materials index has failed to
exceed the record it set in May 2008 of 285.91. The gauge closed
last week at 260.74, or 8.8 percent below its all-time high. The
S&P 500 ended last week at 1,691.42, or 1.1 percent from its
record of 1,709.67 reached earlier this month.  Krinsky identified the next resistance level for the ratio
of the two indexes as the high reached in April 2011. The
Materials Index traded at 0.19 times versus the broader measure
at the time.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
