BP Plc (BP/)  failed to buy North Sea
Forties blend at a lower price than a previous trade. Eni SpA
sold Russian Urals at a smaller premium than the last bid.  Vitol Group offered four West African grades for loading
next month. Caspian Pipeline Consortium will cut daily crude
shipments from the Black Sea to an eight-month low in September,
a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  BP was unable to buy Forties for Sept. 2 to Sept. 6 loading
at $1.15 a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. This compares with plus $1.30 for the last trade
on Aug. 8.  Eni didn’t manage to sell Forties for Aug. 23 to Aug. 25 at
$1.10 more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $108.09 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.36 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $106.77, a discount of $1.32 cents to September.  Ekofisk crude supply was affected by a compressor halt at
the Ula platform, Jan Erik Geirmo, a BP press spokesman in
Stavanger,  Norway , said in an e-mailed response.  “Gas turbine powering a compressor at Ula had a breakdown
as of Wednesday evening August 7th 2013,” he said. Ula was
unable to handle output from the Tambar, Blane, Oselvar fields,
which feed into Ekofisk, according to BP.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals to Statoil ASA at 65
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent for loading Sept. 1 to
Sept. 5 on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed.
That is 15 cents less than a bid on Aug. 9.  CPC will ship 2.35 million tons next month, compared with
2.87 million tons in August, according to the schedule. That’s
equal to 602,268 barrels a day, versus 719,226 barrels this
month. That’s the least since January.  The September program comprises six cargoes of 134,000 to
135,500 tons each and 18 consignments of 80,000 to 90,000 tons.  Libya’s biggest oil export terminal,  Es Sider , shut today
after opening yesterday, hampering the nation’s ability to sell
its most valuable commodity.  The brief opening allowed two tankers to berth at the
facility and they may be turned away tonight if no crude
loadings occur, the port coordinator, Captain Abu Ejela Al
Zanati, said today by phone from Es Sider. Another six vessels
are anchored outside the port.  The Kirkuk crude pipeline resumed at 8 p.m. local time
yesterday at Turkish port Ceyhan, according to Turkish port
agent Boutros Maritime & Transport SA.  Pumping stopped today at 7 a.m. due to low production. This
is not unusual because flows normally occur during evening, the
agent said in an e-mailed note. Vessels arrived yesterday are
expected to wait for 10 days for loading and about 950,000
barrels are available for loading, it said.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply full volumes in September
to customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to
two refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  West Africa  Vitol was unable to sell Nigeria’s benchmark Qua Iboe grade
at $5.10 a barrel more than Dated Brent for Sept. 10 to Sept. 15
delivery to Rotterdam or Lavera in  France  and also offered
Escravos for Sept 5 to Sept. 10 delivery at a premium of $5.30,
the survey showed.  The company failed to sell Nigerian Brass River and Angolan
Saxi blends for Sept. 1 to Sept. 5 delivery to Rotterdam or
Lavera. Brass River and Saxi were offered at plus $4.70 and
$3.20 a barrel, respectively to Dated Brent.  A decline in demand cut freight rates for very large crude
carriers from West Africa to China to the lowest since July 1,
according to shipbroker Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd.  “In West Africa, Asian demand has been weak, particularly
for Angolan crude from Chinese buyers,” the shipbroker said in
an e-mailed statement.  Angola ’s crude loading program for October is expected to
be released later this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
