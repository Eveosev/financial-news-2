Higher-than-normal temperatures in
the second half of August may spur an increase in energy demand
across the northern U.S., according to MDA Weather Services.  The Northeast and Midwest are expected to have temperatures
3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) above the norm
from Aug. 22-26, said  MDA , based in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Ontario,  Quebec  and the Canadian Maritime provinces may reach 8
degrees above normal.  While highs will be well below the peaks earlier in the
summer, much of the hotter weather will be “focused across many
of the key demand centers of the north,” MDA said.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in the large cities of the
eastern U.S. and Canada tend to increase energy consumption
because more people seek air conditioning.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Aug 22 is
75 degrees, according to the  National Weather Service . In Boston
and Chicago it’s 72; in  St. Louis , 78; Dallas, 85; and in
Seattle, 66, according to the weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
