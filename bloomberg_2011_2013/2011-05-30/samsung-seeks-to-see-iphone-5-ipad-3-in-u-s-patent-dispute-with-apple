Samsung Electronics Co. sought a
court order to force  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to disclose iPhone and iPad
models under development, claiming it needs the information to
defend against allegations of copying.  Samsung must see the final versions of the iPhone and iPad
to “evaluate whether a likelihood of confusion exists” between
Samsung and Apple products likely go on sale about the same time,
according to documents filed May 27 by Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung in  San Jose , California, federal court. Samsung is
asking Apple to turn over the samples by June 13.  The move comes a month after Apple asked the court to order
the South Korean company to disclose unreleased Samsung products,
according to the filing. Samsung’s request is part of a legal
dispute between the two companies, which began in April when
Apple claimed Samsung’s Galaxy products “slavishly” copied
iPad and iPhone technology and design.  Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment.  Following Apple’s lawsuit, Samsung, which supplies chips to
the iPhone maker, countersued the Cupertino, California-based
company in Seoul, Tokyo, Mannheim, Germany and the U.S.  The South Korean company must be able to compare its
devices in development to those of Apple as the iPad maker will
probably seek a court order barring Samsung from selling future
products, Samsung said in the court papers.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. 11-cv-
01846. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
 California  (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
