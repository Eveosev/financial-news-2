Georgian authorities said a group of
anti-government protesters detained last week are suspected of
organizing a military uprising led by Temur Khachishvili, a
former interior minister who now lives in  Russia .  As many as 24 detainees were charged being part of the plot
after anti-government protests in the capital last week turned
violent. Several exiled former government officials were also
charged, including the husband of opposition leader Nino Burjanadze, Shota Khizanishvili, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry, said by phone today in Tbilisi.  "These people from Moscow planned a military uprising and a
series of violent acts in connection with the recent anti-
government rallies," Khizanishvili said, adding that authorities
released taped conversations and confessions today.  Five days of rallies in Tbilisi led by opposition leader
Burjadze ended with the death of one demonstrator and a police
officer, while at least 19 people were injured on May 26, when
police used water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse protesters. As many as 90 people were arrested, the
Interior Ministry said.  The Georgian opposition has repeatedly called on President
Mikheil Saakashvili, 43, to resign and call presidential and
parliamentary elections. They accused him of rigging elections,
repressing dissenters and failing to raise  living standards .  Last weekâ€™s protests were sparked by rising food and energy
costs, threatening a return of violence that led the government
to declare a state of emergency in 2007, which was criticized by
NATO and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
