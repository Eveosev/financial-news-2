Thailand ’s baht advanced for a third
day as economists predicted the central bank will raise
borrowing costs for a fourth time this year to tame inflationary
pressures.  The baht reached a one-week high before a report on June 1
that will show consumer prices climbed 4.3 percent in May from a
year earlier, the most since September 2008, according to the
median estimate of economists in Bloomberg survey. The Bank of
Thailand will lift the one-day bond repurchase rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 3 percent the same day, according to
all 16 economists in a separate Bloomberg survey.  “Inflation remains on an uptrend in  Asia  due in part to
solid growth,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “For Thailand, speculation of
rate hikes will grow toward the policy meeting and that will put
appreciation pressure on the baht this week.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 30.32 per dollar as of 8:10
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 30.25 earlier, the strongest level since May
20. It may appreciate to around 30.10 this week, Hayashi said.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, added 5.5 basis points, or
0.055 percentage point, to 3.115 percent. The yield on the 3.125
percent bond due December 2015 was unchanged at 3.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
