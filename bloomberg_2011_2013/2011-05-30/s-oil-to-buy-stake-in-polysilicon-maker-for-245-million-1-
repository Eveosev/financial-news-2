S-Oil Corp. (010950) ,  South Korea ’s third-
biggest oil refiner, agreed to buy a stake in Hankook Silicon Co.
for 265 billion won ($245 million), marking its first investment
in renewable energy.  Shares of S-Oil rose after the Seoul-based refiner said it
will acquire a 33.4 percent stake in the South Korean maker of
polysilicon, used in solar cells.  S-Oil, 35 percent owned by  Saudi Aramco , will become
Hankook’s second-largest shareholder after the purchase is
completed in June. The polysilicon maker plans to expand its
annual capacity to 12,000 metric tons by 2012 from 3,500 tons
currently, according to the refiner.  “This investment in renewable energy will become the
future growth engine of S-Oil,” Chief Executive Officer Ahmed A. Subaey said in an e-mailed statement today.  Shares of S-Oil gained 2.4 percent to close at 149,500 won
on the Korea Exchange, the highest since May 2. The benchmark
Kospi index dropped 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
