Deposits at Greek banks in Cyprus
fell 5.9 percent to 8 billion euros ($11.4 billion) in the first
four months of the year, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said.  Deposits at all banks rose 1.2 percent in the same period
to 70.8 billion euros, the central bank said in a  statement  on
its website today.  The drop in deposits at Greek banks was mainly the result
of a 10 percent decrease in deposits at National Bank of Greece
(Cyprus) Ltd., a unit of Greeceâ€™s largest lender, to less than 1
billion euros, and a 6.9 percent decline at Alpha Bank Cyprus
Ltd. to 3.3 billion euros, the central bank reported.  Deposits at Eurobank EFG Cyprus Ltd. fell 3.2 percent to
2.4 billion euros and at Piraeus Bank (Cyprus) Ltd. 1.3 percent
to 1 billion euros. Deposits at Emporiki Bank-Cyprus Ltd. fell
14 percent to 315.8 million euros.  Deposits at Greek banks on the island last year rose 30
percent as Greek depositors transferred money to Cyprus on
concerns  Greece  would default, restructure its debt or abandon
the euro and impose restrictions on capital flows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
