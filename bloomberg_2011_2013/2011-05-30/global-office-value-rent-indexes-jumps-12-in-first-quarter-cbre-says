An index of global office values
jumped 12 percent in the first quarter of 2011 from a year ago
while a rent index rose 4.3 percent, real estate services firm
CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. said in a report.  “The fact that capital values have rebounded ahead of
rents reflects several factors, including the deeper integration
of commercial real estate into the global capital markets,”
Raymond Torto, CBRE’s global chief economist, said in an e-
mailed release. The pricing of real estate relative to other
assets and the availability of favorable financing in the U.S.
have also contributed to the recovery, he said.  Rents in the Asia-Pacific region jumped 11.3 percent, while
those in  Europe , the  Middle East  and Africa also had gains, CBRE
said. While U.S. rents were flat from a year ago, values added 9
percent, the group said.  With limited construction of new office space, particularly
in Europe and the Americas, rents are expected to continue
rising modestly through the rest of this year, CBRE said. CBRE’s
rent index, which fell 17 percent from its peak of 119 in mid-
2008, is now at 104, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
