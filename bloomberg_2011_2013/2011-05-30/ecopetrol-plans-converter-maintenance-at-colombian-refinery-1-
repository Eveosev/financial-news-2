Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s largest oil
company, plans to stop work at a fluid catalytic converter unit
at its second-largest refinery for maintenance in August.  The stoppage at a converter unit at Ecopetrol’s Refineria
de Cartagena SA will last 40 days, according to an e-mailed
response today to questions by an official at the refinery, who
can’t be identified because of company policy.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol is investing in its Colombian
refineries as it embarks on an $80 billion plan to more than
double its crude output this decade and sell cleaner fuels.  The refinery on Colombia’s northern coast has the capacity
to process 80,000 barrels a day of crude and mainly exports to
the U.S. and the Caribbean, according to Ecopetrol’s  website .  State-controlled Ecopetrol in 2009 purchased the stake it
didn’t own in the refinery from Glencore International AG for
$545 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
