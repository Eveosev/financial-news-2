German 10-year government bond yields
were within two basis points of the lowest in four months, amid
concern the euro area will struggle to resolve its debt crisis,
boosting demand for the region’s benchmark securities.  The yield difference, or spread, between German 10-year
bunds and Portuguese securities of a similar maturity widened to
a record. The European Union may withhold the next tranche of
credit to  Greece  after a report by an international panel of
inspectors concluded that the debt-laden country has missed the
fiscal targets agreed in its rescue plan,  Der Spiegel  reported
yesterday. Italy sold 8.3 billion euros ($11.9 billion) of
securities maturing in 2014, 2018 and 2021.  “There is huge uncertainty regarding Greece and whether
the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  will disburse the
money and whether Greece will achieve its fiscal targets,” said
 Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit
SpA in Milan. “This is pushing investors toward the safest
possible choice, which is to buy bunds.”  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.98 percent
as of 3:52 p.m. in  London . It reached 2.97 percent on May 27,
the lowest level since Jan. 12. The 3.25 percent security due in
July 2021 rose 0.03, or 30 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 102.285. Yields on two-year notes were two basis
points higher at 1.59 percent. Earlier, they dropped to 1.56
percent, the least since March 18.  Greek Cuts  Greek 10-year note yields were two basis points higher at
16.44 percent, while the nation’s two-year note yields fell 3
basis points to 25.31 percent. Italy’s 10-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield up six basis points to 4.81 percent.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  has announced a
fifth round of deficit cuts to meet EU demands and prevent the
region’s first default.  Portugal  followed Greece and Ireland on
April 6, to become the third euro-region nation to ask for
international aid to finance its debt burden.  The yield difference between German 10-year bunds and
Portuguese securities of a similar maturity widened to 683 basis
points, the most since at least 1997, when Bloomberg began
collecting the data.  Yields on Portugal’s 10-year bonds rose 17 basis points to
9.76 percent. The two-year note yields were 8 basis points
higher at 11.38 percent.  Italy, Ireland  Italian bonds stayed lower as the nation sold 3.5 billion
euros of 3 percent bonds maturing in 2014 at an average yield of
3.43 percent, compared with 3.45 percent the last time similar
securities were sold, on April 28. Investors bid for 1.34 times
the number of securities on offer, down from 1.58 times at the
previous sale. The nation also sold 2.95 billion euros of 4.75
percent securities maturing in 2021 and 1.83 billion euros of
floating rate 2018 bonds.  Ireland’s 10-year bonds rose for the first time in eight
days as the nation’s Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said
that the bank has contingency plans for everything. Yields on
the 10-year security fell two basis points to 11.07 percent. The
two-year note yield fell one basis point to 12.24 percent.  There has been a “spillover” effect on the markets for
Irish debt from discussions on Greece, Honohan told a press
conference in Dublin today. He said market conditions are now
worse than when Ireland sought a bailout last year.  German  government bonds  have returned 0.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have returned a gain of 2.6 percent. Italian bonds have returned
2.1 percent and Greek bonds have lost 13.2 percent, the indexes
show.  Markets in the U.K. are shut for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
