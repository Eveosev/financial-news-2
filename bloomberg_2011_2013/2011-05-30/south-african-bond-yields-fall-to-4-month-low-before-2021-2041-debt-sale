South African 10-year bond yields
dropped to the lowest in more than four months before tomorrow’s
debt auction on speculation a recovery in  Africa ’s biggest
economy is faltering.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is offering 2.1 billion
rand ($302.6 million) of bonds maturing in 2021 and 2041 at its
weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. The secondary
market yield on the 2021 bonds fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 8.26 percent at 5:28 p.m. in Johannesburg,
the lowest since Jan. 11 and 18 basis points less than at the
previous auction on May 17.  Gross domestic product expanded an annualized 4.2 percent,
down from 4.4 percent in the final quarter of 2010, according to
the median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Statistics  South Africa  will publish the data at 11:30 a.m. in
Pretoria tomorrow.  “Any weakness in the growth numbers would likely add to
the rally in South African rates,” Shireen Darmalingam and Vuyo
Guma, analysts at Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
said in a research note.  Consumer inflation was 4.2 percent in April, less than the
4.4 percent median estimate by economists, according to figures
from the statistics office on May 17 and a Bloomberg survey.
Retail sales growth slowed for the third consecutive month, a
separate, May 17 report showed, fueling bets the central bank
will keep its benchmark rate on hold. Foreign investors have
been net buyers of 20.7 billion rand of South African bonds this
year, according to data from JSE Ltd., which manages the
nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  The secondary market yield on the 2041 bonds dropped four
basis points to 8.73 percent, the lowest since April 8 and eight
basis points lower than at the previous auction on May 9.  Tomorrow’s bond auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results
will be announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
