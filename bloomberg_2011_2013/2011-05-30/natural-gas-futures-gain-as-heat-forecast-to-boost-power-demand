Natural gas futures rose amid
speculation that hot weather in the U.S. East and South will
boost demand for gas-generated electricity.  Temperatures in  New York  will touch 90 degrees Fahrenheit
(32 Celsius) today, 15 degrees higher than normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Atlanta will have a high of 96 degrees June 1,
13 above normal, according to the forecasting company based in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  “It’s more like a mid-July cooling load,” said  Martin King , senior commodities analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in
Calgary. “It looks like some of this heat might stick around
for a while.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 5.1 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $4.569 per million British thermal units in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Floor
