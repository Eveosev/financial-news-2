China  National Gold Group Corp., the
state-owned company that controls the nation’s largest gold
deposits, wants to invest in projects in  Africa  as it expects
bullion to trade near record levels for the next three years.  “We aim at large-scale mines with good potential in
countries that have close ties with China and domestic
stability,” President Sun Zhaoxue, 48, said in an interview in
Shanghai. “Gold prices will foreseeably fluctuate at
historically high levels for another three years.”  Gold jumped to a record $1,577.57 an ounce this month,
helping make this year among the busiest for gold deals since
2006. Citic Group, China’s biggest state-owned investment
company, and partners agreed this month to buy Gold One
International Ltd. for about A$444 million ($469 million) to
gain assets in  South Africa .  The value of announced gold deals so far this year stands
at $16.8 billion, more than the totals for the entire year in
2009 and 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China National, owner of the Yangshan deposit in  Gansu
province , may also invest in  Southeast Asia  and Central Asia,
Sun said. It currently doesn’t operate any mines outside China.  The company is also reviving mines that were uneconomical
in China’s western provinces as record prices make it profitable
to mine them, Sun said, adding that it’s also increasingly
exploiting lower grade deposits near existing mines because of
higher prices.  Production Boost  China National Gold had a pretax profit of 3.2 billion yuan
last year, after boosting reserves to 1,300 metric tons at the
end of 2010, the company said on Jan. 9. Production was 32 tons
in 2010.  The extra production may boost China’s output to 400 tons
in three years, Sun said May 27 at a conference in  Shanghai .  China National Gold is also diversifying into copper and
molybdenum production. Copper concentrate output will reach
80,000 tons next year and 100,000 tons in 2013, Sun said.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest copper miner, produces about
200,000 tons of concentrates a year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
