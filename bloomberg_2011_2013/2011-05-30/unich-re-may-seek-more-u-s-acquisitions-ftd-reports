Munich Re  may seek more acquisitions
in the U.S., Financial Times Deutschland said, citing management
board member Torsten Jeworrek.  The German reinsurer is underrepresented in the U.S. and
would be inclined to buy companies that insure industry or are
active in niches, the newspaper quoted Jeworrek as saying in
excerpts from an interview to be published tomorrow.  Asia  and
 Latin America  are also growth markets, he was quoted as saying.  The article didnâ€™t cite any specific acquisition targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
