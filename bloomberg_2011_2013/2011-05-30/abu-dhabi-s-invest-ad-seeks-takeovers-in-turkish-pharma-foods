Invest AD, an Abu Dhabi government-
owned  money manager , said it aims to acquire Turkish companies
this year in areas such as drug making, food and household goods,
and manufacturing.  An investment “probably will come within the next three or
four months,” Samir Assaad, head of the company’s private equity
team, said in an interview today in  Seoul , where he is attending
a forum. “Top sectors we are targeting are pharmaceuticals, food
and consumer goods, and industrial manufacturing.”  Turkey is promising for private equity because it has a
shortage of capital and a diversified economy, Assaad said. He
said he met potential South Korean strategic partners today that
could provide industry expertise.  Invest AD  agreed to form a $100 million fund with Japanese
financial services provider SBI Holdings Inc. to invest in
unlisted Turkish companies, according to a statement released
last week. The unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Council made its
first private-equity investment in  Turkey  in late 2009, buying a
stake in supply-chain manager EKOL Logistics.  As well as SBI Holdings, Invest AD’s business partners
include German private bank BHF-Bank AG,  Korea Development Bank 
and Hong Kong-listed financial services company Quam Ltd.,
according to Abu Dhabi Investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
