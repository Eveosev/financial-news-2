The former governor of Argentina’s
central bank, Mario I. Blejer, said the  European Central Bank 
will probably “make a U-turn” on its opposition to  Greece 
defaulting on its debts.  In an op-ed article today for Bloomberg View, Blejer called
the ECB’s threats not to accept defaulted Greek debt as
collateral “very dangerous.” He said the Frankfurt-based
central bank would ultimately be forced to accept a form of debt
relief for Greece.  Blejer was governor of Argentina’s central bank during the
country’s debt crisis in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
