Peermont Global, a South African
hotel and casino company, may list its shares on the
 Johannesburg Stock Exchange  after reorganizing its debt,
Business Day said, citing Chief Executive Officer Anthony Puttergill.  The company plans to convert a 3.3 billion rand ($476
million) shareholder loan into equity, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. Peermont has debt of about 406 million euro
($579 million) after a 2007 bond program, it said.  Peermont reported revenue growth of 0.4 percent in the
three months to March 31 and a net loss of 208 million rand in
the quarter, Business Day said. The company operates hotels and
casinos in  South Africa  and neighboring Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
