Daimler AG (DAI)  Chief Executive Officer
Dieter Zetsche said  Germany  will fail to reach a goal of putting
one million electric vehicles on Germany’s roads by 2021 if the
government doesn’t offer subsidies for the cars,  Bild  newspaper
said, citing an interview with the manager.  Germany will have 500,000 electric cars by that time “at
the most” without incentives, Zetsche was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
