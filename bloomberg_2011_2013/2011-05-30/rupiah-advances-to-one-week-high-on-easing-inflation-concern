Indonesia ’s rupiah rose to a one-week
high before a report this week that economists predict will show
inflation eased for a fourth month in May.  Consumer prices gained 5.94 percent this month from a year
earlier, compared with an increase of 6.16 percent in April,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 19 economists ahead of
data due June 1. The rupiah gained for a third day and has
appreciated 0.2 percent this month, the second best performance
among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, as
foreign funds boosted holdings of the nation’s debt.  “Inflation will continue to be manageable and that will
give investors confidence,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “ Bank Indonesia 
will also continue to use the currency to combat imported
inflation.”  The rupiah advanced 0.3 percent to 8,548 per dollar as of
4:49 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the strongest level since May 23.  Prices may rise 5.8 percent to 5.9 percent in May from a
year earlier, Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told
reporters May 27.  Overseas funds boosted  holdings  of Indonesia’s government
bonds by 2 percent to 225.9 trillion rupiah ($26.4 billion) this
month through May 26, according to data from the debt management
office.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose for a fourth day. The yield
on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 slipped two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.38 percent, prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
