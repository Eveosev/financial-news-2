Silver futures gained and gold may
extend its two-week rally as  Europe ’s debt crisis and
accelerating inflation draw investors seeking to protect their
wealth. Gold priced in yuan rose to a record.  Silver for July delivery jumped as much as 1.4 percent to
$38.395 an ounce, extending last week’s 7.9 percent gain, in
electronic trading on the Comex in  New York , and reached $38.09,
a 0.6 percent gain, by 1:15 p.m. Immediate-delivery gold was
little changed at $1,538.45 an ounce, while bullion for August
delivery was 0.2 percent higher at $1,539.80 an ounce on the
Comex. Gold in  Shanghai  rose to an all-time high of 319.92 yuan
($49.34) a gram today. U.K. and U.S. exchanges were closed for
holidays, and today’s trades will be counted in tomorrow’s
pricing.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he’ll press
ahead with new austerity measures even as he failed to win
backing from opposition parties. Commodities, measured by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 futures, rallied for a third
week last week after the Group of Eight leaders said the global
economy is strengthening.  “Gold’s uptrend remains in place, with people being
fidgety about Europe’s debt crisis,” said Chae Un Soo, Seoul-
based trader with KEB Futures Co. “The metal is going to
approach a record this week where it also could face heavy sell-
offs to moderate rapid gains in prices.”  Bullion is extending a 10-year winning streak, touching a
record $1,577.57 an ounce in  London  on May 2, as European policy
makers seek ways to restore investor confidence amid increasing
concern that  Greece  won’t be able to repay its debts after last
year’s 110 billion euro ($157 billion) bailout.  ‘ Bull Market ’  Seventeen of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg said bullion will rise this week, while one saw a
decline and one was neutral. Assets held in exchange-traded
products, or ETPs, stood at 2,057.679 metric tons as of May 27,
compared with a record holdings 2,114.6011 tons in December,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There is “a bull market that has years to go and would
ultimately carry gold and silver prices to multiples of their
recent highs,” Jeffrey Nichols, managing director at
AmericanPrecious Metals Advisors, wrote in a note.  China  National Gold Group Corp., the state-owned company
that controls the nation’s largest gold deposits, wants to
invest in projects in  Africa  as it expects bullion to trade near
record levels for the next three years.  “We aim at large-scale mines with good potential in
countries that have close ties with China and domestic
stability,” President Sun Zhaoxue, 48, said in an interview in
Shanghai. “Gold prices will foreseeably fluctuate at
historically high levels for another three years.”  Silver for immediate-delivery rose 0.4 percent to $38.155
an ounce. Spot palladium was little changed at $760.75 an ounce,
as was platinum for immediate delivery, at $1,800.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
