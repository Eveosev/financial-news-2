Iran â€™s  Central Bank  plans to increase
 interest rates  for deposits in a bid to control fluctuations in
the gold and foreign-currency markets,  Hamshahri  reported.  A report by the bank to increase deposit rates will be
submitted to the High Council of Money and Credit, the Tehran-
based newspaper said, citing central bank governor Mahmoud
Bahmani.  A higher rate will attract liquidity to banks, Bahmani told
the newspaper. He added that a large portion of the $300 billion
in liquidity will be directed toward different parts of the
economy without an increase in inflation, the newspaper said.  For the current Iranian calendar year starting March 21,
the three-month deposit rate is 6 percent, the 9-month rate is 8
percent, and rate for less than a year is 10 percent, the
newspaper said.  The rates for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year deposits are 12.5
percent, 13 percent, 13.5 percent, 14 percent and 15 percent
respectively, Hamshahri reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
