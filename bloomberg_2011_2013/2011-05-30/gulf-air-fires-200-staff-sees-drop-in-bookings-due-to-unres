Gulf Air, Bahrainâ€™s state-owned
carrier, fired 200 employees and reported a 25 percent drop in
bookings in the first five months of the year because of unrest
in the  Middle East .  After staff were laid off, an internal committee was set
up, with 100 people appealing the decision and 11 getting their
jobs back, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
layoffs took place over the past six weeks.  Bahrain declared a three-month state of emergency ending
June 1 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states
arrived to help quell a month of protests driven by majority
Shiites, calling for democracy and civil rights.  Gulf Air had canceled flights on the back of the unrest,
including to Iran and  Iraq . Since the beginning of May, the
airline saw "an upturn in reservations" and expects the trend to
continue with summer bookings, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
