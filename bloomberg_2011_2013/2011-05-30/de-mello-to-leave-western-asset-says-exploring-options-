Rajeev De Mello, head of investments
and operations in  Singapore  at Western Asset Management Co.,
will leave the firm next month.  De Mello, 45, said in a telephone interview he has resigned
from Western Asset and is currently “exploring options.” He
said he will stay with the company until June 10 and go for a
short vacation before returning to Singapore.  He joined Western Asset, part of Baltimore-based Legg Mason
Inc., in July 2007. Previously, he oversaw Asian debt in
Singapore for Pictet Asset Management, a unit of  Switzerland ’s
largest privately held bank for the wealthy.  Western Asset’s Asian Opportunities Fund, one of those that
De Mello manages, returned 14.4 percent in the past year,
beating 81 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
