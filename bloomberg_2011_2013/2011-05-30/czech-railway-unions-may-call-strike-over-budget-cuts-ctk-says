Czech unions may call a strike in
railway transportation if the Cabinet proceeds with plans to
overhaul public finances with measures including a value-added
tax increase, newswire  CTK  reported, citing a union leader.  The Association of Independent Unions will call the strike
if the government doesn’t accept its demands by June 10, CTK
cited the association’s Chairman Bohumir Dufek as saying. The
unions also oppose a plan to allow people to redirect part of
their compulsory pension payments into personal accounts as the
Cabinet tries to boost private savings for retirement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
