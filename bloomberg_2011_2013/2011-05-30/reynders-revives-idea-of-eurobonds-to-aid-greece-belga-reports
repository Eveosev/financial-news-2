Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  revived the idea of issuing euro-area bonds to help
 Greece , Belga newswire reported.  Reynders prefers a “real European solution” to the Greek
debt crisis instead of the recently reported scenarios of Greece
possibly leaving the euro area or of a “severe” restructuring
of the nation’s debt, both of which should be “absolutely
avoided,” Belga cited the minister as saying yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
