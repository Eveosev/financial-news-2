Chile’s peso weakened as the price of
copper, the country’s main export, declined and European debt
concerns eroded demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 467.43 per U.S. dollar at 1:29
p.m. New York time, from 466.90 on May 27.  “The euro is falling slightly as well as copper, and that
is affecting the  exchange rate ,” said Matias Madrid, an
economist at Banco Penta in Santiago.  The euro weakened as much as 0.4 percent against the dollar
on concern that  Greece  may struggle to reach approval of
austerity measures, while copper lost as much as 1.2 percent
before reports this week that may show the  U.S. economy  is
slowing.  Chile’s industrial production increased a less-than-
estimated 9.5 percent in April from the previous year, the
national statistics institute reported today. The median
estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 9.8
percent increase.  One-year breakeven inflation, which reflects views of
average price increases, fell 2 basis points or 0.02 percentage
points to 3.62 percent.  The central bank paid an average 467.73 per  U.S. dollar  for
$50 million today as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the
peso’s gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
