Navin Fluorine International Ltd. (NFIL) ,
owner of  India ’s third most-lucrative emissions reduction
project, was poised for a four-month high after winning an
additional 1.8 million carbon credits from the United Nations.  The United Nations Clean Development Mechanism, the world’s
second-biggest greenhouse gas market, issued 1.8 million credits
to the Mumbai-based company for a project that limits emissions
of a potent greenhouse gas called hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs at
a plant in western Gujarat state, according to its  website . HFCs
are used in refrigerators and air-conditioners.  The stock was up 3.3 percent at 11:12 a.m. in Mumbai
trading after surging as much as 5.6 percent to the highest
since Jan. 25. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index
advanced 0.3 percent.  The UN program awards credits to projects that reduce
greenhouse gases in developing countries. Project owners can
sell those credits to factories and refineries in  Europe  and
elsewhere where they are used to offset excess emissions in
order to comply with local pollution rules.  Navin Fluorine’s plant has earned 10.2 million UN credits
to date, the most in India after two other HFC projects
belonging to  SRF Ltd. (SRF)  and Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
