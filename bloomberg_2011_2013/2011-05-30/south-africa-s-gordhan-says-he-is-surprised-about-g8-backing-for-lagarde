South African Finance Minister  Pravin
Gordhan  said European countries conspired “behind closed
doors” to impose  Christine Lagarde  as the next managing
director of the International Monetary Fund.  “Well before nominations closed on the 10th of June, we
already see the traditional deals being made around tables at
which even the major emerging-market economies were not
present,” Gordhan said today in an interview broadcast on
Johannesburg-based SAFM radio. “Europe shot off ahead of
everybody else, with virtually no decorum. You don’t want deals
behind closed doors that exclude developing countries.”  Group of Eight countries unanimously backed French Finance
Minister Lagarde, Alain Juppe, the country’s foreign minister
said in an interview with  Canal+  yesterday. The IMF wants to
find a new head by the end of next month, after incumbent
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn  stepped down to defend charges of
attempted rape.  Emerging-market nations have been “hard at work” to unite
behind a candidate from developing countries, Gordhan said.
Meanwhile, China and Brazil, the two largest emerging economies,
may also back Lagarde over the candidacy of Mexican central bank
governor, Agustin Carstens. South African Planning Minister
 Trevor Manuel , who has been named as a potential candidate, has
called for a more open appointment process.  -- Editors: Ana Monteiro, Karl Maier  To contact the reporter on this story:
