UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s board approved a plan
to renegotiate 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of convertible
bonds known as CASHES so they can continue to be considered as
core capital under the new Basel III rules.  UniCredit issued the Convertible and Subordinated Hybrid
Equity-Linked Securities, or CASHES, in February 2009 and the
plan would allow the bank to make the CASHES count as common
equity under Basel III for the entire amount.  The restructuring is based on the assumption that
authorities “confirm their views as to the non-computability of
the shares as core tier 1” capital and is subject to Mediobanca
SpA’s consent as counterparty of the contract, UniCredit said.  UniCredit is the only Italian bank facing a second round of
stress tests that hasn’t announced a share sale to boost capital
before the implementation of stricter rules. Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  is working on a new business plan,
expected by the end of the year, to increase profitability and
strengthen finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
