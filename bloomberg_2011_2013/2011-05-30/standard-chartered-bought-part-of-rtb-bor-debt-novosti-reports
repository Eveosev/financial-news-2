(Corrects name of bank in headline, first paragraph in
story published May 30.)  Standard Bank  bought 134 million
euros ($191 million) of debt of RTB Bor, a Serbian state-run
copper miner and smelter,  Vecernje Novosti  newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Standard expects RTB Bor to start repaying the principle
after it upgrades facilities in 2013, the newspaper reported.  The U.K. lender may write off as much as half of the debt
if an agreement is reached or seek a 15 percent to 25 percent
stake in the company after its expected restructuring by the
Serbian government, the newspaper said.  RTB Borâ€™s total debt is around 500 million euros, mostly to
other state-owned companies in  Serbia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
