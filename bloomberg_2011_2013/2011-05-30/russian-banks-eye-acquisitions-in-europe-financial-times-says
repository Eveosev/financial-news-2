Russian banks are taking advantage of
the capital weakness of some western financial institutions to
target acquisitions in Eastern and  Central Europe , the Financial
Times reported, citing  Andrei Kostin , chief executive officer of
VTB,  Russia ’s second largest bank.  Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, has considered acquiring
banks in  Austria  because of their weak capital and extensive
networks in Eastern Europe, the newspaper said.  In addition to considering acquiring Volksbank
International, Sberbank is looking at a possible capital
injection into Raiffeisen Bank International and at banks in the
Baltics and  Kazakhstan , the newspaper said.  Sberbank and VTB bank are both majority owned by the
Russian government, an element that might hamper their
ambitions, the FT said.  Eastern European banks owned by Western parents that ran
into problems during the financial crisis are also potential
candidates for acquisitions, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
