Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki declared
a drought affecting various parts of the East African country a
national disaster and ordered immediate steps be taken to help
affected people and livestock.  The Treasury was ordered to facilitate “urgent” imports
of corn to boost the country’s strategic grain reserves, while
1.6 billion shillings ($18.6 million) was allocated to the water
and irrigation and livestock ministries, Kibaki said in an e-
mailed statement today from Nairobi, the capital.  “The president directed all relevant ministries involved
to expedite their operation and ensure that affected citizens
were cushioned from needless suffering,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
