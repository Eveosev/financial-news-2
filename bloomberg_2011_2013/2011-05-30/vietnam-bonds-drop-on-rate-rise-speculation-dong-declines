Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
dropped, pushing yields to the highest level since November 2008,
on speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates 
further to curb surging inflation. The dong fell.  The State Bank of Vietnam boosted the repurchase rate to 15
percent on May 17, the sixth increase this year. Prices rose
19.78 percent in May from a year earlier, the most since
December 2008.  “Vietnam’s inflation hasn’t peaked and inflation pressures
will continue in the months ahead,” Hai Pham, a Singapore-based
analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., wrote in
a research note dated May 27. “We expect the central bank to
increase its key interest rates further.”  Yields on the five-year debt rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 12.85 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong weakened 0.3 percent
to 20,610 per dollar as of 2:28 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,643, compared with 20,653 on May 27, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
