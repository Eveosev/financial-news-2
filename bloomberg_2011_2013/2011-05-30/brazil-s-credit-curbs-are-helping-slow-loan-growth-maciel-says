Brazil ’s measures to slow credit
expansion helped reduce loan growth to a “moderate” pace in
April and rising default rates are partly seasonal, Tulio
Maciel, head of the central bank’s economic research department,
told reporters in Brasilia.  Brazil’s development bank, known as BNDES, was forced to
slow loan growth more than other credit segments, he said.  -- With assistance by Alexander Ragir in Rio de Janeiro.
