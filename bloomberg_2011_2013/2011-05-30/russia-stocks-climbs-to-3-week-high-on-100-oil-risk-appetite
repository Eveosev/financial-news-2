Russian stocks rose to the strongest
in almost three weeks as oil traded above $100 a barrel and
higher earnings stoked appetite for emerging-market assets.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks gained 0.4 percent to 1,644.99

power holding company reported a return to a profit last year.
The dollar-denominated RTS Index rose 0.4 percent to 1,865.74.  Emerging-market stocks climbed for a third day as corporate
profits helped offset concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow the
global economic recovery. Crude, Russia’s main export earner,
traded down 24 cents at $100.35 a barrel after climbing as high
as $100.80.  “Commodity prices are stabilizing at current levels, which
is helping Russian equities,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of research
at Metropol IFC in Moscow, said by phone today.  Silver for July delivery jumped as much as 1.4 percent to
$38.395 an ounce, extending last week’s 7.9 percent advance. OAO

p.m. close in Moscow, erasing earlier gains. The currency

leaving it down 0.2 percent at 33.4876 versus the central bank’s
