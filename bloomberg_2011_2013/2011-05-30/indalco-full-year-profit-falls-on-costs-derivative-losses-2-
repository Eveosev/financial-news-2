Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,  India â€™s
largest aluminum maker, posted a worse-than-expected 37 percent
drop in full-year group profit because of losses incurred on
hedging contracts and higher input costs.  Net income, including that of unit Novelis Inc., fell to
24.6 billion rupees ($546 million), or 12.83 rupees a share, in
the year ended March 31 from 39.3 billion rupees, or 22.16
rupees, a year ago, Hindalco said today in a statement. The
average profit estimate of 27 analysts Bloomberg surveyed was
30.5 billion rupees. Sales at the Mumbai-based company, which
also produces copper, rose 19 percent to 718 billion rupees.  The price of coal, used to produce electricity and
accounting for almost 40 percent of aluminum costs, rose 37
percent to an average $107 a metric ton in the last fiscal year,
according to market researcher McCloskey Group Ltd. Hindalco
also incurred losses after metal prices fell below the price
committed in forward contracts.  Raw material costs surged 24 percent to 474 billion rupees,
compared with 381 billion rupees the previous year. The loss on
hedges was 2.9 billion rupees, compared with a gain of 27.4
billion rupees the year earlier.  Hindalco shares fell as 2.3 percent to 193.05 rupees in
Mumbai trading. The shares have fallen 22 percent this year,
compared to an 11 percent drop in the key Sensitive Index of the
Bombay Stock Exchange.  Rising Prices  The average price of aluminum, a lightweight metal used in
aircraft, cars and power plants, gained 15 percent to $2,530 a
ton on London Metal Exchange last quarter. The price rose 1
percent to $2,588 a ton on May 27.  The price will be maintained and global aluminum demand is
expected to increase as much 10 percent in the year ending March
31, Managing Director Debu Bhattacharya said today at a media
conference in Mumbai. The company plans to make products that
fetch higher profits, he said.  Hindalco, which has a capital expenditure plan of 100
billion rupees for this fiscal year, aims to raise 80 billion
rupees for expansion, Bhattacharya said. The fundraising will
start in the year ending March 31, he said.  The company restarted the Mount Gordon copper mine in
 Australia  last month, Bhattacharya said. Aditya Birla Minerals
Ltd., the Australian unit of Hindalco, had halted work at the
mine because of damage from heavy rains.  The average price of copper rose 33 percent on the London
Metal Exchange last year.  Unit Aditya Birla, which is considering acquisition options,
is looking for copper mines in  Latin America , Bhattacharya said.
