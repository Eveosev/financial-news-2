Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic will be extradited to The Hague within the next four days
to stand trial on war-crimes and genocide charges, government
spokesman Slobodan Homen said.  “It is absolutely certain that the extradition will take
place in the next two to four days,” Homen told Radio B92
today. He spoke after about 5,000 people rallied last night to
protest against Mladic’s arrest. Some 180 people were arrested
after clashing with police in central Belgrade after the rally.  The extradition order can only be signed after an appeal by
Mladic arrives, Homen, who is also the state secretary at the
Justice Ministry, said. Mladic has a deadline of today for an
appeal to be filed.  Mladic’s arrest and extradition were on the list of
conditions to convince the European Union that  Serbia  is ready
to become a candidate and get a date for the start of membership
talks by the end of this year. His lawyer and family insist the
health condition of the 69-year-old former Bosnian Serb general
is poor and that he may not live through a trial.  Mladic, who was indicted for his alleged role in the siege
of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre by the United Nations
War Crimes Tribunal for the former  Yugoslavia , was arrested on
May 26 after evading capture for 16 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
