Germany â€™s opposition Social Democrats
will press Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to let the upper house vote
on her plan to phase out nuclear power, Handelsblatt said,
citing Rhineland-Palatinate state premier Kurt Beck.  Beck called for an irreversible phase-out of German atomic
power plants and a binding plan to promote renewable energy, the
Dusseldorf-based  newspaper  quoted the Social Democratic
politician as saying in an e-mailed advance of an article to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
