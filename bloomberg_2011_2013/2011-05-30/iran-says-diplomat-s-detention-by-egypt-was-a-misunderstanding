Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said the detention of an Iranian diplomat in Egypt over
spying allegations was a misunderstanding and the man was freed
after two hours, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported.  The diplomat left Egypt today and headed to Dubai, Egypt’s
state-run Middle East News Agency said, without saying where it
got the information. His departure came after “preliminary
investigations” showed he was “gathering intelligence” about
Egypt and sending it to Tehran’s intelligence services, the
Cairo-based news agency said.  Egyptian authorities arrested Qasim al-Hosseini, who worked
at the Iranian interests section in Cairo, on charges of spying
in order to harm Egypt’s interests,  Agence France-Presse 
reported yesterday.  Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil el-Arabi said in March his
country was ready to “open a new page” with Iran. The two
nations haven’t had full diplomatic relations since 1979, when
former Egyptian President  Anwar Sadat  gave refuge to the deposed
Iranian shah, Reza Pahlavi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
