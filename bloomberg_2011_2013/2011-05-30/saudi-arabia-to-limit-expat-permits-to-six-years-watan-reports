Saudi Arabia  will soon bar foreigners
who have lived in the kingdom for six years from renewing their
work permits,  Al Watan  reported, citing Labor Minister Adel
Faqih.  Companies will be given five months to adjust their
positions after the start of the program, which aims to cut
unemployment among Saudi nationals, the newspaper said.  Around half a million Saudi nationals are unemployed, the
newspaper said, citing recent statistics.  The eight million expatriates in the kingdom annually send
an estimated 100 billion riyals ($26.6 billion) home in
remittances, Faqih told  Al Watan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
