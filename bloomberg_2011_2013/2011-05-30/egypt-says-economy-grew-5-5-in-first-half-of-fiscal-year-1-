Egypt ’s economy grew 5.5 percent in
the first half of the fiscal year that ends June 30 compared
with 4.8 percent in the same period the previous year, the
Finance Ministry said.  The budget deficit from July to April was 7.2 percent
compared with 7 percent in the same period the previous year,
the Cairo-based ministry said on its website today.  The turmoil that accompanied the revolt that toppled
President  Hosni Mubarak  in February has hurt the economy,
keeping tourists away, hitting factory output and lowering the
country’s credit ratings. The ministry said it has not yet
determined the effects of the uprising on the economy.  The average maturity of local currency debt rose to 1.7
years at the end of December 2010 compared with 1.6 years a year
earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said. The average yield on that
debt rose 5 basis points to 10.38 percent over the same period,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
