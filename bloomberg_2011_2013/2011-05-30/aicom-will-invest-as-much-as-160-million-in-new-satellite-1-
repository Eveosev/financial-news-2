Thaicom Pcl (THCOM) , a Thai satellite
monopoly, said its board approved a plan to invest as much as
$160 million in a new satellite, Thaicom 6.  Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB)  will build the medium-sized
satellite and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. will be
responsible for the launch, which is expected around the second
quarter of 2013, according to the filing to the Thai exchange
today.  The satellite will help increase Thaicomâ€™s competitiveness
and future revenue as demand for broadcasting in Asia is rising,
Chief Executive Officer Arak Chonlatanon told a news conference
today. The company said May 12 it expected to return to profit
in the fourth quarter as it generates revenue from its services
in  Australia . Thaicom recorded 167.1 million baht ($5.5 million)
in losses in the first three months of 2011.  Thaicom will use loans and cash flow to fund its investment,
Arak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
