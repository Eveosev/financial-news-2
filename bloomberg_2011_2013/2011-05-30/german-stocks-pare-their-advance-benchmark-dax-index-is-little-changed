German stocks pared gains, with the
benchmark DAX Index climbing 0.1 percent to 7,168.14 as of 3:59
p.m. in  Frankfurt . The gauge earlier advanced as much as 0.6
percent.  EON AG and RWE AG,  Germany â€™s biggest utilities, retreated
more than 2 percent as the government said it will keep a tax on
atomic plants as it phases out nuclear power by 2022. Bayer AG
and BASF SE led rising shares, both adding more than 1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
