Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  jumped
the most since the Czech bookmaker listed its shares last year
after a court sent its competitor Sazka AS into bankruptcy.  Fortuna rose 6.3 percent to 137.1 koruna by the 4:24 p.m.
close in  Prague , its biggest advance and the highest closing
level since the stock started trading in October 2010. More than
636,000 shares changed hands, or seven times the three-month
daily average.  The Prague Municipal Court declared Sazka bankrupt after a
meeting with creditors of the Czech Republic’s dominant lottery
operator, CTK news agency reported late on May 27. Penta
Investments Ltd., a private-equity company that owns Fortuna,
will bid as much as 2 billion koruna ($117 million) for the
Sazka’s lottery business, Penta spokesman Martin Danko said on
May 29 in a talkshow on public broadcaster Czech Television.  Sazka’s “continuing problems should keep having a positive
influence on Fortuna’s shares,” analyst Ondrej Moravansky at
Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report
today. “A takeover of Sazka’s assets by Penta seems unlikely,
as we believe the antimonopoly office would prevent that.”  Fortuna has gained 25 percent so far this month after
saying on May 5 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose an annual 44 percent in the first quarter.
The sports-betting agency said it will debut lottery operations
in July as Sazka’s insolvency has given it an opportunity to
claim a large portion of the Czech gaming market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
