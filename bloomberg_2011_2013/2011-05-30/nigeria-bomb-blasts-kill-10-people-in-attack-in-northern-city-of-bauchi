At least 10 people were killed in
 Nigeria  in three bomb blasts set off in a military base in the
northern city of Bauchi yesterday, health and emergency
officials said.  “There are 10 dead and 13 people are receiving treatment
for injuries,” Ahmed Mustapha, a medical doctor at the Bauchi
Specialist Hospital, where most of the victims were taken, said
by phone yesterday from the city.  Apart from the blasts in Bauchi, there was another bomb
attack yesterday in the town of Zuba, just outside the Nigerian
capital, Abuja, which injured three people, said Yushau Shuaib,
the spokesman for the  National Emergency Management Agency .  Authorities in Nigeria’s north have blamed a radical
Islamic sect, Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and
killings targeting government officials and the security forces
since last year.  The attacks were carried out on the day President  Goodluck Jonathan  took the oath of office for a four-year term as leader
of  Africa ’s most populous country and top oil producer,
following his victory in elections held in April.  At least 800 people were killed in the vote’s aftermath as
protests by supporters of the main opposition candidate,
 Muhammadu Buhari , a northern Muslim and a former military ruler,
triggered violence between Muslim and Christian ethnic groups,
according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.  Jonathan won overwhelmingly in the country’s mainly
Christian center and south, while Buhari won in the
predominantly Muslim areas of the north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
