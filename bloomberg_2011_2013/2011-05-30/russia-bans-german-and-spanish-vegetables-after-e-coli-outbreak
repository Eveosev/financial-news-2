Russia  is banning the importation of
German and Spanish vegetables following a deadly outbreak of
E.coli in  Europe , according to a statement from the country’s
consumer-safety watchdog.  Russia is suspending the importation of German and Spanish
tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers from today until further notice,
 Gennady Onishchenko , said in a statement on the federal agency’s
website.  The move follows the outbreak in Germany of the acute
intestinal infection caused by E. coli (EHEC), the statement
said.  The Robert Koch Institute, the German government’s disease-
control agency, today confirmed three deaths from E.coli, while
Deutsche Presse Agentur reported that 14 people had died,
without saying where it got the information. The source of the
outbreak hasn’t been confirmed, German Health Minister Daniel
Bahr said at a news conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
