Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  plans
began marketing a sale of Samurai bonds to investors and may
price the notes as early as this week, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the transaction.  The company is marketing five-year, fixed-rate bonds at a
spread of 27 basis points to 33 basis points more than the yen
swap rate and five-year floating rate notes at a spread of 42
basis points to 48 basis points over three-month benchmark
rates, the person said, asking not to be identified as details
are private.  The lender hired Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.,
Mizuho Securities Co. and Nomura Securities Co. to arrange the
sale, the person said. Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes
sold in  Japan  by overseas borrowers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
