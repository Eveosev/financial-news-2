The number of young Londoners
struggling with debt has increased by 75 percent in the past
three years, according to a report by the  London  Debt Strategy
Group.  In London, average debt levels among 17-to-24-year-olds
since 2008 have risen from 3,500 pounds ($5,762) to more than
5,500 pounds, the report said. A total of 13 percent of
Londoners were in arrears with their debts as compared with the
national average of 10 percent, said the report.  There are more people in arrears with their debts in London
than in any other region even though London does not have the
highest level of JobSeekersâ€™ Allowance claimants among its
workforce.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
