Telkom South  Africa  Ltd., Africa’s
largest fixed-line operator, plans to offer more voluntary
severance packages after losing more than 1,650 employees in a
previous round, Solidarity said.  In the first round of wage talks held last week, Telkom
sought to include a mechanism for the packages, the Pretoria-
based labor union said in an e-mailed statement today.
Solidarity wants a two-year moratorium on job cuts, it said.  Workers are demanding pay increases of 12 percent. Telkom
offered 4.5 percent, plus 0.5 percent to employees who exceed
their productivity targets, Meshack Dlamini, Telkom’s executive
for employee relations, said in an e-mailed statement in
response to questions. The company won’t cut jobs if unions
accept the offer, Dlamini said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
