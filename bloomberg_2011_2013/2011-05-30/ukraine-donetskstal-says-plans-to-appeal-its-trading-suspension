PrAO Donetskstal, a Ukrainian metal
producer, said it will appeal a decision by the Securities and
Stock Market State Commission to suspend trading of its
securities.  The company, based in the eastern Ukrainian city of
Donetsk, said the regulator “had no grounds” for the decision,
according to a statement on Donetskstal’s  website .  The commission suspended trading in Donetskstal securities
as well as other units on May 20 for up to a year to “protect
rights of shareholders and to prevent corporate conflict
widening,” said the commission on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
