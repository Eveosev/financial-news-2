Hungary’s government is considering
extending a tax break to lenders on a special financial industry
levy in exchange for banks boosting  mortgage loans  and small-and
medium-sized company financing,  Nepszabadsag  said,  citing
Economy Ministry State Secretary Andras Karman.  The discount, which may be “reflected in the base of the
bank tax,” won’t cut budget revenue significantly before 2013,
Karman said according to the daily.  The government is committed to ending all special industry
levies after 2012, with the exception of the bank tax, which the
Cabinet plans to halve from 2013, Nepszabadsag said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
