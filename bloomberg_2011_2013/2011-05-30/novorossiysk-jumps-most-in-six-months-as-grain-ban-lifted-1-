Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port
jumped the most in more than six months after Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  said Russia will lift a ban on grain exports.  The shares climbed 5.4 percent to 3.4998 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest advance since Nov. 18.  The restrictions contributed to a 4.1 percent drop in cargo
volumes in the first quarter, the company said April 11. The ban
will be lifted on July 1, Putin said at a meeting outside Moscow
on May 28.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
