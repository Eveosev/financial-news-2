Norinchukin Bank,  Japan ’s largest
lender for farmers and fishermen, said it almost doubled its
deposit increase in April compared with a year earlier as
customers were paid insurance claims after a record earthquake.  Norinchukin added 624.2 billion yen ($7.7 billion) to its
deposit balance in April to 86.44 trillion yen, compared with a
326.2 billion yen increase to 84.8 trillion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based bank said in a statement on its website today.  “Deposits increased in the month as mutual aid money was
paid in areas devastated by the earthquake,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
