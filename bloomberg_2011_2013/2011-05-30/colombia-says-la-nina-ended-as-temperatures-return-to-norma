Colombia , the world’s second-largest
grower of arabica coffee, said the La Nina weather pattern that
triggered storms and floods this year came to an end.  Colombia’s Andean region including Antioquia, the largest
coffee-growing province, will continue to have rainfall until
mid-June, the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and
Environmental Studies, known as IDEAM, said on its  web site .  The next rainy season in the South American country will
begin in September and end in December, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
