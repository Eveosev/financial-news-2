The European Union ended six-year-old
tariffs on polyester fibers from  China , facilitating EU market
access for Chinese exporters such as Far Eastern Polychem
Industries Ltd.  The EU decided to remove the duties as high as 49.7 percent
on imports from China of polyester staple fibers, which are used
in clothes, bed linen and furniture fillings. The levies
punished Chinese exporters for selling the material in the EU
below cost, a practice known as  dumping .  The EU imposed the anti-dumping duties against China in
March 2005, when the bloc also applied similar levies on the
fibers from  South Korea  and  Saudi Arabia  to curb import
competition for European manufacturers including Trevira GmbH.
The EU let the levies against  Korea  and Saudi Arabia lapse on
schedule in March 2010 while opting to keep the measures against
China in place during a probe into whether to renew them.  “The present proceeding should be terminated since the
investigation had not brought to light any considerations
showing that its termination would not be in the union
interest,” the 27-nation EU said in a decision today in
Brussels. The repeal of the duties will take effect after the
decision is published in the EU  Official Journal  by June 16.  A producers’ group called the  European Man-Made Fibres
Association , which in December 2009 requested a renewal of the
duties against China, withdrew its request two months ago as the
EU was wrapping up its probe, according to the bloc. Such a step
prevents the details of an EU anti-dumping investigation that
may be heading to an unfavorable outcome for European producers
from being published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
