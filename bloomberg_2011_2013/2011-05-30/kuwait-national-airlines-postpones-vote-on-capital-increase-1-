Kuwait National Airlines Co. (KNA)  K.S.C.
shareholders voted to postpone a vote on raising the company’s
capital to 65 million dinars ($236.2 million), a step which may
pave the way for the company’s return.  Kuwait National Airlines, which halted operations on March
16, will use the increase of 15 million dinars “to repay
immediate liabilities and the remainder will be available for if
shareholders decided to resume operations,” Chairman Abdul
Salam al-Bahar told investors attending the annual general
meeting today.  Shareholders will decide on the capital raise depending on
whether the company’s board reaches an agreement with Alafco
Aviation Lease & Finance Co. to scale back its demands. Alafco,
the Kuwaiti company that leases planes to airlines, said April 3
it is demanding $70 million from Wataniya Airways, owned by
Kuwait National Airlines Co., for the remaining period of an
aircraft leasing deal.  “We are in the final phases of the negotiations with
Alafco to reduce their demands,” al-Bahar said. “They are
responsive but there is nothing official yet.” The negotiations
will be completed within ten days, he said. “Whether we come
back or not depends on the settlement we reach with Alafco.”  Kuwait National Airlines owes banks as much as 22 million
dinars, and is 15 million dinars in debt to other creditors, al-
Bahar said. “If Kuwait National Airlines is to re-operate,
it’ll be through a different approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
