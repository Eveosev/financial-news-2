Canadian stocks erased gains as
financial and power companies slumped, offsetting an advance by
energy shares as natural gas rallied.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-biggest lender by
assets, slipped 0.7 percent amid concern European governments
will struggle to resolve their debt crisis.  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the
world’s largest uranium producer, lost 3.4 percent after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition endorsed a plan to close
all atomic-power plants by 2022. Power producer Fortis Inc. lost
2.1 percent after agreeing to buy Central Vermont Public Service
Corp.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  gained 1 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 11.53
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,809.12 at 3:47 p.m. in Toronto
after advancing as much as 0.4 percent. Trading volume for
companies in the measure totaled 144.9 million shares, or 49
percent less than at the same time a week earlier, as U.S.
markets were closed for the Memorial Day holiday.  “It’s a thin market, so you get more forced selling than
there’s forced buying,” said  Greg Taylor , a  money manager  at
Aurion Capital Management in Toronto, which oversees C$5 billion
($5.1 billion). “Anytime there’s something perceived as
negative, it can outweigh in thin trading.”  The S&P/TSX rose 3.1 percent in the two weeks that ended
May 27 for the biggest two-week gain since Feb. 4. Raw-materials
stocks surged 7 percent and energy companies gained 4.1 percent
as analysts at banks including Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecast a rebound in
commodity prices and gold, copper, corn, wheat and natural gas
advanced. The resources industry makes up 49 percent of Canadian
stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.  Weekly Drop  The index of S&P/TSX lenders fell after dropping the most
in six months last week, when  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , TD and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported earnings that missed
analyst estimates. Financial stocks declined worldwide after
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he’ll press ahead
with new austerity measures after failing to win backing from
the main opposition parties as he races to keep bailout
funds flowing and avoid default.  TD lost 0.7 percent to C$82.99. Royal Bank, Canada’s
largest lender by assets, slipped 0.5 percent to C$57.08.  Bank
of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the country’s No. 3 lender, decreased 0.4
percent to C$58.76 before the release of its second-quarter
financial results.  Green Party   Cameco lost 3.4 percent to C$27.33.  Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a
mining company controlled by Moscow-based ARMZ Uranium Holding
Co., slipped 3.2 percent to C$3.68. Merkel promised when re-
elected in 2009 to extend the life of nuclear reactors. After
 Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami in March caused the worst nuclear
crisis since 1986, Merkel’s party finished behind the Green
Party in a state election for the first time.  The S&P/TSX Utilities Index fell as much as 1.3 percent,
the most intraday since March 15. The index closed at the
highest level since June 18 on May 27 and the highest relative
to forecast earnings since 2006.  “Utilities are such an expensive sector right now,”
Taylor said.  Fortis declined 2.1 percent to C$32.94 after agreeing to
buy Central Vermont Public Service for about $470 million,
paying a 44 percent premium, to enter the U.S. regulated
 electricity market . Fortis, Canada’s largest publicly traded
power producer, also said it will sell 9.1 million shares for
C$33 each.  Canadian Utilities Ltd. (CU) , the owner of the Atco family of
companies, lost 2.7 percent to C$57.79 after losing as much as 3
percent, the most intraday since August.  Two-Month Surge  Juan Plessis, an analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., cut
his rating on the shares to “hold” from “buy” in a note
dated May 27. Plessis cited the stock’s 21 percent surge from
March 14 to May 26.  Energy shares gained after natural gas climbed 1.1 percent,
adding to last week’s 6.8 percent surge, amid forecasts for
warmer U.S. weather.  Canadian Natural, the country’s second-largest energy
company by market value, rose 1 percent to C$41.98.  Suncor
Energy Inc. (SU) , the country’s biggest energy company, gained 0.5
percent to C$40.96.  Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s largest natural gas
producer, advanced 0.6 percent to C$33.40.  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , the copper producer that Barrick
Gold Corp. has agreed to buy, advanced 4.2 percent to C$7.92 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares plunged to C$7.60, from
C$8.09 the prior day, on May 27 after Barrick said talks with
the Zambian government on the takeover are continuing. The
African country’s competition agency had said it conditionally
approved the purchase.  Teck, Semafo  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, increased 1.2 percent to C$51 as copper climbed in
 Shanghai  for a fourth day.  Semafo Inc. (SMF) , which mines gold in  Africa , climbed for an
eighth day, soaring 4.9 percent to C$8.97 before the release of
its first-quarter earnings.  “We see a lot of room for further appreciation as the
company continues to provide updates on its underground
development program and regional exploration updates,” Stuart McDougall, an analyst at Jennings Capital Inc., said in a note
to clients.  S&P/TSX fertilizer producers climbed for a fifth day after
23 of 29 traders in a Bloomberg survey forecast corn prices will
rise this week. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s
largest fertilizer producer, increased 0.7 percent to C$55.07.
 Agrium Inc. (AGU)  gained 1.2 percent to C$85.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
