Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS) ,  South Africa ’s
largest food company, said acquisitions in Nigeria and  Ethiopia 
will add 500 million rand ($72 million) to sales as it seeks to
expand on the rest of the continent.  “The company continues to pursue value-enhancing
opportunities which will further increase its manufacturing and
distribution footprint outside of South Africa,” Johannesburg-
based Tiger Brands said in a statement today.  Tiger Brands in April completed the takeover of Deli Foods
Nigeria Ltd. and the purchase of a 51 percent stake in the East
Africa Group of Companies of Ethiopia for a combined 388.6
million rand. The acquisitions will boost sales by 500 million
rand in their first full year of operating, it said.  The company earlier this month also completed a 417.2
million rand transaction to buy UAC of Nigeria Plc, which had
sales equivalent to 477 million rand in the year through
December. The purchase of Johannesburg-based powdered seasoning
and beverages group Davita Trading Ltd. for 1.5 billion rand
becomes effective from tomorrow and will immediately start
adding to earnings, Tiger Brands said.  The stock fell 0.8 percent to 187.03 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of 35.6
billion rand.  Tiger Brands reported net income of 1.19 billion rand in
the six months through March 31 compared with 1.05 billion rand
a year earlier. Sales in the fiscal first-half increased 1
percent to 10.45 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
