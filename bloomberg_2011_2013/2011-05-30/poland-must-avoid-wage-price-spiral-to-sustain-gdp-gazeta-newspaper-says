Poland can sustain economic growth
near current levels if policy makers prevent inflation from
setting off a wage-price spiral, which would force the central
bank to tighten rates and choke off investment, Andrzej Raczko,
a member of the Polish central bank’s management board, was
quoted today as saying by  Gazeta Wyborcza .  The Finance Ministry’s sales of euros on the  currency
market  are helping reduce excess liquidity of Polish banks and
are “indirectly” helping curb inflation, Raczko told the
newspaper. Such purchases “cannot be treated as a substitute”
for standard central bank tools such as interest rates in
curbing inflation, Raczko said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
