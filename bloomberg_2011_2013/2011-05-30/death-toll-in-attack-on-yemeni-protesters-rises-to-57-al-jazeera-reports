The death toll from an attack on
protestors by Yemeni security forces rose to 57, with more than
1,000 in the city of Taiz injured, al-Jazeera television
reported.  Casualties included disabled people burned inside tents,
Shawki al-Kadhi, a Yemeni lawmaker, told the network. He called
the attack “a massacre” carried out by forces loyal to
President Ali Saleh.  Security forces destroyed three hospitals in Taiz, said
Mahmoud Al Aqlani, a doctor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
