European retail sales contracted in
May to the lowest level since October 2010, driven by a “sharp
drop” in  Italy , Markit Economics said.  A gauge of euro-area retail sales fell to 48.8 from 52.2 in
April, London-based Markit Economics said today in a statement.
The index is based on a survey of more than 1,000 executives and
a reading above 50 indicates month-on-month expansion.  Italian retail sales declined at the fastest pace in 11
months in May, while monthly increases in Germany and  France ,
the euro area’s largest economies, were the weakest in seven and
three months, respectively, Markit said.  Data for the first two months of the second quarter
“suggest a steep slowdown in growth of  consumer spending  in the
single-currency area,” Trevor Balchin, a senior Markit
economist, said in today’s report. “As a result of elevated
cost pressures and falling sales, retailers’ gross margins
deteriorated to the greatest extent for a year,”  The euro trimmed losses after the data were released,
trading at $1.4287 at 10:58 a.m. in Brussels, down 0.2 percent.  Euro-area retail trade declined 1 percent in March from a
month earlier, the biggest drop since April 2010, on higher oil
prices and government austerity measures, the European Union’s
statistics service in Luxembourg said on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
