The University of Virginia defeated
Atlantic Coast Conference rival the University of Maryland 9-7
to win college lacrosse’s national men’s tournament.  Colin Briggs scored a career-high five goals as the
Cavaliers recorded their fifth National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament win and first since 2006.  It was the first NCAA final between ACC teams since North
Carolina beat Virginia 10-9 in overtime in 1986.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
