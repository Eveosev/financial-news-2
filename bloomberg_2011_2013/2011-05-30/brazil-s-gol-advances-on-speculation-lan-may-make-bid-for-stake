Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s biggest airline by market share, rose the most in a
month on speculation  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  may bid for a stake in the
company.  Gol jumped 3.2 percent to 20.14 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m., the biggest gain since April 20.  Lan may seek a deal with Gol should its takeover of  Tam SA (TAMM4) 
fail, Santiago-based newspaper El Mercurio reported, citing an
interview with Ignacio Cueto, the Chilean airline’s chief
executive officer.  The report “was enough to boost the shares,” Gilberto Coelho, an analyst for brokerage XP Investimentos, said in a
phone interview.  Chile’s antitrust tribunal said in January it’s reviewing
Lan’s $3.9 billion takeover bid for Tam after a request from a
consumer group.  Lan’s press office didn’t respond to an e-mail from
Bloomberg News seeking comment. An official with an external
public relations firm that represents Gol declined to comment.  Tam’s shares slid 0.4 percent to 34.51 reais in  Sao Paulo .
Lan fell 0.3 percent in Santiago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
