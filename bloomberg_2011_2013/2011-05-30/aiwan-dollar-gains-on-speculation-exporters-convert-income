Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to its
strongest level in two weeks on speculation exporters took
advantage of recent declines in the currency to convert income
at a more-favorable  exchange rate .  The local dollar dropped 0.4 percent last week, the most
since the five days ended March 12, as global funds sold $1
billion more Taiwanese stocks than they bought during the period,
according to exchange data.  “Some exporters were selling the greenback,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union Bank
of Taiwan. “Most investors are sitting on the sidelines,
waiting for a clearer direction.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.830
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$28.750
earlier, the strongest level since May 16.  Government bonds  dropped. The yield on the 1.375 percent
security due March 2021, the most-traded government debt,
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.445
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
