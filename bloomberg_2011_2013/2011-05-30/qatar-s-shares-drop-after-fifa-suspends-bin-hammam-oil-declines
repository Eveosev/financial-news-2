Qatari shares dropped for a second
day after soccer’s governing body suspended Mohamed  Bin Hammam 
pending an investigation into bribery allegations, trimming
appetite for assets of the 2022 World Cup host.  Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQK) , the nation’s second-largest bank
by assets, decreased 1.1 percent.  Barwa Real Estate Co. (BRES) , the
Qatar-based property developer, fell to the lowest level since
March. The  QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.2 percent to 8,354.61 at the
1:15 p.m. close in Doha, the lowest since May 25. The  Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  declined 0.1 percent.  “The FIFA news flow is a sentiment dampener,” said Sachin Mohindra, a fund manager at Abu Dhabi-based Invest AD.
“Uncertainty over progress on revising foreign ownership limits
is also encouraging a cautious stance with investors” as the
country seeks an upgrade to emerging market status at  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
later this month, he said.  The Persian Gulf country may be reclassified from frontier
market status at MSCI on June 21. Foreign-ownership limits on
stocks and “efficiency” are some issues that both Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates face, Manuel Rensink, head of  Middle
East  and North Africa at MSCI, said May 3.  Qatar’s Bin Hammam, who’s responsible for the sport in
Asia, and the North and Central American soccer head Jack Warner
were suspended amid an investigation into allegations that they
paid bribes to solicit votes for  FIFA’s presidency . The
organization had already been trying to fend off allegations of
improper conduct by its decision-making body during the bidding
process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.  Growing Economy  “Nothing has changed at the fundamental level,” Invest
AD’s Mohindra said.  Qatar’s economy is forecast to grow 20 percent this year,
the world’s fastest, from 16.3 percent in 2010, the Washington-
based IMF said in its Regional Economic Outlook report published
in April. The government forecasts a budget surplus of 22.3
billion riyals ($6.1 billion) in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the
Qatar News Agency said March 31.  The country will invest about $88 billion in infrastructure
for the World Cup,  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) ’s Assistant General
Manager Enrico Grino, who oversees project finance, said May 16.  Commercial Bank decreased to 72.2 riyals, the lowest level
since April 27. Barwa Real Estate declined 1 percent to 28.95
riyals, the lowest since March 7.  Crude for July delivery declined as much as 1 percent to
$99.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a fifth of the
world’s oil.  Dubai’s benchmark index declined 0.6 percent and Bahrain’s
BB All Share Index lost 0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 0.3 percent. Abu Dhabi’s measure increased 0.5
percent,  Kuwait ’s SE Price Index rose 0.3 percent and Oman’s
gauge advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
