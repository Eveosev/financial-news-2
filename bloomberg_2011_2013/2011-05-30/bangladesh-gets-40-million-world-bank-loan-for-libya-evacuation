Bangladesh signed an agreement with
the  World Bank  for a $40 million loan to help fund the
evacuation of its citizens from  Libya .  “The emergency operation will finance the repatriation of
Bangladeshi migrant workers escaping the conflict in Libya,”
the lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  The three-month Libyan conflict between troops loyal to
 Muammar Qaddafi  and rebels opposing his four-decade rule has
curbed the country’s oil exports, led to a  North Atlantic
Treaty Organization air campaign against pro-government forces
and killed at least 15,000 people.  As many as 35,000 of an estimated 80,000 Bangladeshi
migrants working in the North African nation have returned home,
the Washington D.C.-based lender said. Part of the loan money
will be used to provide a cash grant of 50,000 taka ($681) to
the returnees, said Mehrin A. Mahbub, a spokeswoman for the
 World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
