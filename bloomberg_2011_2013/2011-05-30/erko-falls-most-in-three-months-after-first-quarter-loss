AS Merko Ehitus (MRK1T) , the largest listed
Baltic builder, fell the most in more than three months in
Tallinn trading after the company reported a first-quarter loss.  The stock declined 7.9 percent to 7.78 euros at 11:46 a.m.
in Tallinn, the biggest fall since Feb. 22. Merko has lost 14
percent this year, compared with a 3 percent decline for the
Nasdaq OMX Tallinn index. Merko’s Eastern European construction
and materials’ peers have shed 12 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg data.  Merko reported after the end of trade on Friday a net loss
of 4.1 million euros ($5.8 million) for the three months to
March 31, citing lower demand and rising raw material prices. It
had a profit of 1.1 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
