Italian 10-year bond yields rose to a
three-day high as the nation sold 8.3 billion euros ($11.9
billion) of securities maturing in 2014, 2018 and 2021.  Spain  is
set to sell debt due 2014 and 2015 on June 2.  Italy ,  Europe ’s second-biggest debtor in nominal terms
after  Germany , typically holds four to five debt auctions every
month. The nation sold 3.5 billion euros of 3 percent bonds
maturing in 2014 at an average yield of 3.43 percent, compared
with 3.45 percent the last time similar securities were sold, on
April 28. Investors bid for 1.34 times the number of securities
on offer, down from 1.58 times at the previous sale. Italy also
sold 2.95 billion euros of 4.75 percent securities maturing in
2021 and 1.83 billion euros of floating rate 2018 bonds.  “The bid to cover was a bit on the low side but I don’t
see a fundamental issue with the auction or with Italy,” said
 Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Italy is
still not really in the focus of the market, like Greece and
Ireland and Portugal.”  Italy’s 10-year yield was five basis points higher at 4.80
percent as of 11:23 a.m. in London. Two-year note yields were
also seven basis points higher at 3.06 percent. Spanish 10-year
yields were five basis points higher at 5.37 percent.  Italy and Spain have fared better than their so-called
peripheral peers as sentiment soured toward the euro-region’s
heavily indebted nations. Investors charge Italy 4.04 percent to
borrow for five years, compared with 4.68 percent for Spain,
11.60 percent for Portugal and 17.14 percent for  Greece .  ‘Better Shape’  “Italy and Spain are in much better shape than Greece,
Ireland and Portugal, due to their better fundamental position.
But you cannot fully exclude the links yet,” said Michael Kruse, a fixed-income analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in
Zurich.  The yield difference, or spread, between benchmark German
10-year bunds and similar-maturity Spanish securities widened
three basis points to 2.38 percentage points.  Italian bonds have handed investors 2.1 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Spanish bonds
have returned 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  Markets in the U.K. are shut for a public holiday today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
