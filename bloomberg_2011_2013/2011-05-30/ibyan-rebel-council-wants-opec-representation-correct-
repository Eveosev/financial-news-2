The Libyan rebels’ leadership council
says they should have a representative at OPEC.  “We would like to have a representative at OPEC, we still
don’t know who will represent  Libya , but there will be certainly
one from the National Council of Transition,” Mahmoud Shammam,
a spokesman for the rebels, said at a press conference today in
 Rome .  Shammam said that the rebels are still waiting to receive
funds that have been pledged by international donors to their
cause.  To contact the reporter on this story:
