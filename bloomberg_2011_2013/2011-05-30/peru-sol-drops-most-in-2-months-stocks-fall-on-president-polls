Peru’s sol dropped the most in two
months and the nation’s benchmark stock index fell as traders
bet former army renegade Ollanta Humala may win a presidential
runoff and curtail foreign investment.  The sol weakened 0.6 percent to 2.7720 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:50 p.m. in  New York , from 2.7542 on May 27. That’s the
currency’s steepest intraday fall since March 28.  The Lima General Index dropped 4.6 percent to 21,339.53,
the most in six weeks.  Presidential polls published yesterday showed support for
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori fell, narrowing her lead over
Humala before the June 5 vote. Fujimori led by 4.1 percentage
points in a poll by Datum Internacional compared with 5.1
percentage points in a May 26 poll. A survey by Ipsos Apoyo
showed the candidates in a statistical tie.  Humala pledges to revise Peru’s free trade agreements and
change the constitution to strengthen the state’s role in the
economy.  “Keiko’s lead was wider last week and the market thought
it was more likely she would win,” said Antonio Diaz, a
currency trader at Banco Internacional del  Peru , the nation’s
fourth-largest lender. “After the latest polls, things are
looking very tight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
