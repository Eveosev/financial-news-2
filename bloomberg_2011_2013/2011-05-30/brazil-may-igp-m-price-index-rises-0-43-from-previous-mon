Brazil ’s inflation rate, as measured
by the IGP-M  price index , slowed more than economists expected
in May to the lowest level in almost a year.  Consumer, construction and wholesale prices rose 0.43
percent in May, down from a 0.45 percent increase in April, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation said today on its website. That’s the
slowest since July, when prices rose 0.15 percent, and less than
all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts whose median
estimate was for 0.60 percent increase in prices.  To slow inflation, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration is relying on a mix of higher  interest rates ,
spending cuts and other measures to curb credit growth. Policy
makers will push the overnight Selic rate up 50 basis points to
12.50 percent by year-end, according to a central bank survey of
about 100 economists published May 23.  Today’s IGP-M reading may bolster policy makers’ claims
that inflation may slow in the coming months.  From a year ago, prices rose 9.77 percent, less than the
10.60 percent posted in the year through April.  Wholesale Prices  Wholesale prices, which have a 60 percent weighting in the
IGP-M index and jumped 11.35 percent over the past year, rose
0.03 percent in May, led by a 28 percent decline in cotton
prices.  Consumer prices rose 0.9 percent, more than 0.78 percent
gain in April, as fuel prices jumped 4.08 percent. Construction
prices, which have a 10 percent weighting in the index, jumped
2.03 percent in the month because of higher costs for
bricklayers and engineers.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012 was unchanged on March 27 at 12.34 percent. The
real strengthened 1.3 percent to 1.5945 per  U.S. dollar .  Consumer prices rose 6.51 percent through mid-May, above
the upper limit of the bank’s target range for the first time
since 2005.  Brazilian economists in the bank survey published May 23
cut their estimates for 2011 inflation for a third straight week
as food price increases eased, while raising their 2012
inflation forecasts.  Consumer prices will rise 6.27 percent this year, according
to the May 23 survey, down from a 6.31 percent forecast in the
previous week’s survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
