U.K.  house prices  will start to rise
at the end of this year and increase through 2015, the  Centre
for Economics & Business Research  said.  House prices will rise 16 percent over the next four years
after slipping 1.4 percent in 2011, the CEBR said. Household
consumption will decline 0.8 percent this year before resuming
growth at a “relatively low average rate” of 2 percent a year,
the group predicted.  U.K. consumer spending slumped in the first quarter as the
economy’s expansion barely made up for a drop in the last three
months of 2010.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King , who has
kept the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent
for more than two years, said May 11 that the economy faces a
“difficult time ahead.”  “We still believe house prices will fall this year,
although there are signs that prices will stabilize over the
second half of the year,” CEBR Chief Executive Officer Douglas McWilliams said in a statement. “The market is currently close
to the bottom for the U.K. as a whole.”  U.K. house prices fell the most in seven months in April,
Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s Halifax division reported May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
