Roth & Rau AG (R8R) , the German
manufacturer that’s trading above its agreed takeover bid price,
climbed the most in seven days in Frankfurt after Gutekunst
Holding increased its stake to 15.1 percent.  The maker of factory equipment for producing solar cells
rose as much as 1.9 percent and traded up 1.5 percent at 23.30
euros as of 12:09 p.m. local time. The stock has traded above
the 22-euro-a-share takeover price since a bid by  Switzerland ’s
 Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  was announced on April 11.  Earlier this month, Roth & Rau’s third-biggest shareholder,
KLK Holdings Ltd. of Cyprus, increased its stake to at least 10
percent and said it wasn’t convinced the takeover price was
attractive enough.  A Meyer Burger spokesman didn’t answer telephone calls
seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
