Yildirim Holding AS, a Turkish
container port operator that bought 20 percent of  France ’s CMA
CGM SA for $500 million last year, agreed to buy CMA CGM’s 50
percent stake in Malta Freeport terminal for 200 million
euros, Yildirim’s chief financial officer Evren Ozturk said.  Istanbul-based Yildirim will finance about 80 percent of
the acquisition by borrowing from Turkish banks, Ozturk said
