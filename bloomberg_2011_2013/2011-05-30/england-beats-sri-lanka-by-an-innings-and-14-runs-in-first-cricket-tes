England bowled  Sri Lanka  out for 82
to win the rain-shortened first cricket Test by an innings and
14 runs.  England forced Sri Lanka to bat on the final day at Sophia
Gardens in Cardiff after declaring on 496-5 for a 96-run lead.  Chris Tremlett  and Graeme Swann each took four wickets and
 Stuart Broad  snagged two batsmen as Sri Lanka tied its fourth-
lowest score in a Test innings.  “I don’t think any of us thought it was hugely possible to
get this result,” England captain Andrew Strauss told Sky Sports.
“There was some outstanding bowling from Chris Tremlett
with the new ball, Stuart Broad as well, with Graeme Swann
backing them up.”  Sri Lanka lost eight wickets for 49 runs in 12 overs after
the tea interval and its second innings, which began at 3 p.m.
local time, lasted 24.4 overs.  Thisara Perera top-scored for the visitors with 20 runs,
while Tharanga Paranavitana, Thilan Samaraweera, Farveez Maharoof and Suranga Lakmal failed to score.  Jonathan Trott  earlier reached 203 for England, supported
by Alastair Cook’s 133 and Ian Bell’s unbeaten 103. Eoin Morgan
was on 14 when England declared.  To contact the reporter on this story:
