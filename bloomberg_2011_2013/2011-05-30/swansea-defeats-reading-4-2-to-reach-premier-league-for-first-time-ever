Scott Sinclair scored a hat trick to
lead Swansea to a 4-2 victory over Reading in the Championship
playoffs, putting the Welsh club into the Premier League for the
first time.  Sinclair scored on penalties in the 21st and 80th minutes
as well as from open play in the 22nd. Stephen Dobbie scored in
the 40th minute for Swansea.  Reading tried to claw back into the final, with Noel Hunt
scoring four minutes into the second half, and Matt Mills adding
one in the 57th minute.  Swansea hasn’t been in  England ’s top division for 30 years,
before the Premier League was formed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
