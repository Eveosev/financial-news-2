Japan ’s government needs to raise the
nation’s 5 percent consumption tax “in stages” to avoid
disrupting economic growth, according to a report compiled by
members of a government advisory panel.  “If the  tax rate  is raised substantially at once, it could
amplify economic fluctuations,” said a report written by
private sector members who submitted their recommendations to a
group discussing social security and tax policy headed by Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  in Tokyo today. “It would be desirable to
raise it in stages.”  Kan’s administration is weighing how to improve tax and
social welfare programs to support an aging society while
managing a growing public debt burden. The economy slid into a
recession the last time the government increased the levy from 3
percent in 1997. The panel said the need to raise the tax has
risen “considerably” since then because of the increasing debt.  Japan’s government debt is projected to reach 219 percent
of gross domestic product in 2012, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said. An increase in the  sales tax 
rate by 5 percentage points or more could destabilize growth,
today’s report said, citing projections by the Cabinet Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
