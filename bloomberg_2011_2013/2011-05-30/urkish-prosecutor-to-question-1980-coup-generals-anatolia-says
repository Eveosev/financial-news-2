Turkey ’s chief prosecutor’s office
requested to question two generals in connection with the
country’s last military coup, according to state-run news agency
Anatolia.  Huseyin Gorusen, chief prosecuting attorney for terrorism
and organized crime, called then Chief of Staff Kenan Evren and
Tahsin Sahinkaya, head of the  Air Force  at the time, and asked
them to testify as suspects, Anatolia reported. The retired
generals are being investigated for executing a coup on Sept.
12, 1980, and using force to change the constitutional system.  Attorneys for Evren asked today that Gorusen take the
testimony at the former chief of staff’s Ankara residence,
citing health problems and age, Anatolia said. The prosecutor’s
office is reviewing the request and will decide how to carry out
Evren’s questioning and that of Sahinkaya, who resides in
Istanbul.  Constitutional changes approved last year in a nationwide
referendum allow for the prosecution of those responsible for
planning and executing the coup. Evren, who was chief of the
armed forces, became president in 1982 and served for seven
years.  Editors: Mark Bentley, Steve Bryant  To contact the reporter on this story:
