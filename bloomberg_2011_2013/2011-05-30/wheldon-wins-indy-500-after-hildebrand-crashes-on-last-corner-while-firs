Dan Wheldon won the 100th anniversary
edition of IndyCar’s Indianapolis 500 for the second time after
rookie J.R. Hildebrand struck a wall on the final corner while
leading.  Wheldon, a Briton in his first drive of the year who also
won the race in 2005, collected the Borg-Warner trophy after
completing 200 laps in two hours, 56 minutes, 11 seconds
yesterday. Hildebrand’s battered Panther Racing car skidded
across the line in second place, 2.1 seconds later.  “As soon as I knew it wasn’t serious, there was a little
smile on my face,” Wheldon, 32, told reporters. “From that
point, it was just making sure I didn’t do anything silly.”  Hildebrand, 23, looked set to become the ninth rookie
champion when he passed two-time winner Dario Franchitti on lap
196 and took the lead seconds later after Bernard Baguette made
a pit stop. Hildebrand ran too wide on the final corner and
struck the wall, allowing Wheldon to take the checkered flag.  “My disappointment is for the team,” Hildebrand said.
“We should have won.”  Wheldon, driving for Bryan Herta Autosport, never led until
he entered the final straight, becoming the first driver to win
the race having been in front for fewer than two laps. He won
with an average speed of 170.3 miles per hour (274 kph). There
were 23 lead changes, 10 different leaders and 40 caution laps.  Graham Rahal, the son of 1986 winner Bobby Rahal, finished
third, 5.6 seconds behind Wheldon. Tony Kanaan was fourth,
followed by Scott Dixon.  Inaugural Race  Ray Harroun won the inaugural Indy 500 in 1911 at the
 Indianapolis Motor Speedway , which opened two years earlier in
Speedway,  Indiana . This year’s edition of the “Greatest
Spectacle in Racing” was the 95th.  Each of the 33 open-wheel cars that began the 500-mile race
around the 2.5-mile (4 kilometer) circuit known as the Brickyard
were powered by a Honda Motor Co. 3.5-liter, 635-horsepower V-8
engine.  The race featured four women. American Danica Patrick, who
was fourth in her 2005 debut, finished 10th. She led for 10 laps
before being passed by Baguette with 11 laps remaining. It was
Patrick’s seventh appearance in the race.  Pippa Mann, a 27-year-old Briton, was 20th, one place ahead
of Ana Beatriz of Brazil, while Simona de Silvestro of
 Switzerland  finished 10 places further back.  Janet Guthrie was the first woman to compete in the race,
in 1977.  Three-Time Champ  Helio Castroneves, the 2009 champion from  Brazil  who was
seeking a record-tying fourth win and to become the first
overseas racer to claim a quartet of victories, finished 17th.  Alex Tagliani, the first Canadian to win pole position,
withdrew with broken front-wheel struts after he hit the outside
wall on lap 148.  In addition to Wheldon, Franchitti and Castroneves, the
grid featured former winners Dixon (2008) and Buddy Rice (2004),
who was 18th.  The total purse for the race depends on attendance, which
can be as many as 400,000 fans. Franchitti last year earned a
record $2.75 million from the $13.6 million payout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
