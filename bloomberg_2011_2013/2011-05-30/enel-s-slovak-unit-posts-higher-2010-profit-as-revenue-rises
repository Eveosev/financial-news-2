Slovenske Elektrarne AS,  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s
Slovak unit, said its 2010 consolidated net income rose to 373.5
million euros ($533 million) from 279.9 million euros in the
previous year.  Consolidated revenue increased 6.3 percent to 2.18 billion
euros, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based power generator said today
in an e-mailed statement without elaborating.  Italy’s Enel has a 66 percent stake in Slovenske, which
operates power stations with a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts.
The Slovak government owns the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
