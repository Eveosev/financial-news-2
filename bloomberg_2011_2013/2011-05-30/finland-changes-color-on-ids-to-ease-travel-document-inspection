Finland is changing the colors on
identity cards to make it easier to distinguish between cards
that are good for travel from those that aren’t.  The identity cards given to foreigners will be brown
instead of red starting tomorrow and cards given to minors under
the age of 18 will be purple, Ismo Parviainen, project manager
at the  National Police Board  in Helsinki, said today by phone.
The cards given to Finns will remain blue.  Finns over 18 can use their identity cards as travel
documents within the European Union, while Finnish minors and
foreigners cannot, Parviainen said. Finland introduced separate
colors on each type of identity card in 1999 and the new colors
will make it easier to tell them apart, he said.  The police also added safety features on new cards, which
will still cost 51 euros ($72.80) each. The cards aren’t
compulsory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
