Indonesia ’s President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  last week issued a decree allowing underground mining
in some protected forests for coal and minerals, Forestry
Minister Zulkifli Hasan said.  “The ruling is aimed at improving existing management of
forest use for mining,” Hasan said at Coaltrans Asia Conference
in Bali. “Miners must have mining and land-use permits from the
local administration and forestry ministry to operate in
protected forests.”  Primary forests and peatlands are excluded from the decree,
as the government has imposed a two-year ban on mining and
expansion of plantations in those areas, Hasan said.  Indonesia is the world’s largest exporter of power station-
coal and tin and is rich with other minerals such as copper,
nickel and bauxite.  To contact the reporters on this story:
