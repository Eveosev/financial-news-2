China  may more than double thermal
coal imports to 200 million metric tons by 2015 from 90 million
last year, said Neil Dhar, executive vice president at Noble
Group. Imports this year may be unchanged from 2010, he said.  India ’s overseas purchases of the power-station fuel may
increase to 67 million tons this year and 100 million by 2015,
from 58 million in 2010, Dhar said at the Coaltrans Asia
conference in Bali today. China’s domestic consumption will be
3.5 billion tons and India may use 1 billion tons by 2015.  Australia and Indonesia will mainly supply China and India
and additional volumes may come from the U.S. west coast and
 South Africa , Singapore-based Dhar said. The industry is
witnessing cost pressures, which will keep prices high, he said,
declining to give details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
