Egypt ’s government expects to
conclude talks on a $3 billion loan from the  International
Monetary Fund  by June 5 as the North African country seeks to
fund its widening budget deficit after a popular revolt.  “Everything is ready and we don’t anticipate any
problems,” Finance Minister Samir Radwan told Bloomberg
Television in an interview from Cairo today. The IMF board "has
to approve and the agreement has to go to the cabinet and then
the military council. All of this will take a few days.’’  Egypt’s deficit may reach 10 percent of gross domestic
product in the fiscal year that ends next month after a revolt
that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February hurt revenue
from tourism and industrial output. The gap was 8.1 percent in
the previous 12 months. The government is targeting a deficit of
11.3 percent next year, Radwan said.  The yield on Egypt’s 10-year 5.75 percent dollar bond rose
1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.96 percent as of
11:20 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices on Bloomberg. The
Egyptian pound gained 0.2 percent to 5.9470 per dollar. The
benchmark EGX 30 stock index advanced for a fourth day, climbing
0.8 percent to 5,590.57.  Mubarak resigned on Feb. 11 after three decades in power,
ceding authority to the military which dissolved parliament and
suspended the constitution until parliamentary and presidential
elections later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
