Lithuania’s central bank proposed
setting limits on credits for real estate developers and
 mortgage loans  to prevent bubbles in the industry.  Lietuvos Bankas  suggested an 85 percent limit to the value
of the collateral on mortgage loans and a 75 percent cap on
credits for property developers, the Vilnius-based bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. The central bank will discuss the
guidelines with the country’s banking association, it said.  The bank said it is seeking to establish new “responsible-
lending” guidelines to prevent a recurrence of a debt-funded
real-estate boom-to-bust scenario as in 2004-2009. The
 construction industry  contracted about 50 percent, while real-
estate prices fell 30 percent during the crisis, pushing the
banking industry into losses and the economy into a recession.  The guidelines are meant to become “an instrument for
discipline, an antidote against financial short-sightedness and
new bubbles, and also a measure to help protect consumers with
poor economic knowledge from financial liabilities that are too
burdensome,” Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
