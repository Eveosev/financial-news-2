India’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in five days on speculation yields near the highest
level since 2008 will attract investors.  Overseas investors have bought $1.17 billion in rupee-
denominated debt this month, bolstering holdings to a record
$21.2 billion as of May 18, exchange data show. The yield on the
7.80 percent 10-year note climbed to 8.47 percent today, the
highest level for a benchmark 10-year bond since September 2008.  “The biggest risks have been priced in and there are no
reasons why yields should rise further,” said  Anoop Verma , a
fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.
“Falling yields may become a near term trend.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 slipped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.43 percent at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  Bonds dropped earlier today on speculation the pace of
economic growth will prompt the central bank to raise borrowing
costs next month for a fourth time this year.  Gross domestic product increased 8.1 in the first quarter
from a year earlier, compared with 8.2 percent in the prior
three months, according to the median of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  India ’s wholesale prices increased 8.66 percent in April,
more than analysts’ estimates for an 8.5 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey, a report showed on May 16. The  Reserve
Bank  of India raised  interest rates  on May 3 for the ninth time
since March 2010 to cool inflation.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive a floating rate,
was at 8.20 percent, compared with 8.22 percent on May 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
