New Zealand ’s government is concerned
about the nation’s exchange rate after the currency rose to its
highest since the lifting of exchange controls in 1985.  While the stronger currency would help lower oil and import
prices for consumers, it was trading at “unsustainable levels”
for non-commodity exporters, Prime Minister John Key told
reporters in Wellington. The exchange rate was “more bearable”
for the commodity sector because of high export prices, he said.  The so-called kiwi has risen 10 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  in the past three months, the best performer among its 16
major counterparts, as Asian demand drove up prices for New
Zealand’s milk, lumber and meat exports. The currency touched
82.19 U.S. cents earlier in Wellington.  “Obviously we just have concerns about that very high
N.Z./U.S.  exchange rate ,” Key said.  The government has had no discussions with the central bank
about intervention, Key said. The exchange rate’s strength is
related more to inherent weakness in the U.S. economy, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
