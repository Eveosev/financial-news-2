Zimbabwe ’s tobacco production
regulator may license new tobacco auction houses, the Herald
reported, citing Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Matibiri.  Thirteen closely-held companies applied for licenses to
auction the leaves, the Harare-based state-owned newspaper cited
Matibiri as saying on its website. Matibiri didn’t say how many
would be granted licenses, it reported. Zimbabwe has three
tobacco auction houses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
