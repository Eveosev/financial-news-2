Sydney commuters faced gridlocked
highways, public-transport delays and some flooded roads after
rain and wind lashed the east coast of New South Wales state.  The state’s Transport Roads & Traffic Authority website
reported eight flooded roads as of 6:30 p.m. local time. Some
train and buses in the city were delayed, and at least one
ferry route was scrapped after the Parramatta Weir, west of
Sydney, overflowed, the government’s  transport information site 
said.  Today’s rains followed a night of thunderstorms in Sydney,
clogging up transport networks and delaying travelers. The
deluge will continue tomorrow and there’s a chance of further
storms, the  Bureau of Meteorology said  after warning of
“severe” weather for the city and coastal areas to the north
and south.  “Heavy rain and thunderstorms which may lead to flash
flooding is forecast,” the bureau said on its website.
Swimming, surfing and fishing from rocks on some beaches is
unsafe, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
