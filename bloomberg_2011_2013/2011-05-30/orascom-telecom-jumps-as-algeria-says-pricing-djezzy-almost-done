Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  rose the
most in more than a week after the Algerian government said it
has almost completed a valuation of the company’s local unit
Djezzy, which it is seeking to buy.  The shares of North Africa’s biggest mobile-network
operator climbed 1.8 percent, the most since May 22, to 4.45
Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The country’s
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 0.8 percent.  Algeria and Orascom Telecom have been locked in an
ownership dispute over Djezzy for more than a year. The
government has ordered Djezzy to pay more than $800 million in
backdated taxes, a charge the company is challenging in Algerian
courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
