China’s stocks rose for the first
time in eight days, led by consumer staples and energy
producers, amid speculation recent losses that drove the
benchmark index to a four-month low were overdone.  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 16.32, or 0.6 percent,
to 2,726.27 at 11:27 a.m., snapping a seven-day, 5.7 percent
losing streak that was the longest since July 2010.  Heilongjiang Agriculture Co. jumped 3.6 percent on
speculation a drought will drive up grain prices. China State
Construction Engineering Corp. advanced after winning new
orders. China Shenhua Energy Co. rallied after its board
approved a share buyback. China Vanke Co., the nation’s largest
publicly traded developer, dropped to an eight-month low after
the Oriental Morning Post said the government may raise interest
rates next month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
