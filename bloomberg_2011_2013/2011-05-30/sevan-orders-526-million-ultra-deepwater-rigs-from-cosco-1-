Sevan Drilling ASA ordered two ultra-
deepwater oilrigs at a cost of $526 million each from Cosco
Corp. Singapore Ltd.  Sevan Drilling and Cosco signed letters of intent in March
for the construction of the rigs, which require a 20 percent
down payment upon execution of the contracts and the remaining
upon delivery, the Arendal, Norway-based company said in a
statement today. The rigs will be delivered in the last quarter
of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014, it said.  “This is a very important step for Sevan Drilling,”
acting Chief Executive Officer Scott Kerr said in the statement.
“We are expanding our rig fleet within a key market segment,
ultra-deepwater drilling, at a very competitive price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
