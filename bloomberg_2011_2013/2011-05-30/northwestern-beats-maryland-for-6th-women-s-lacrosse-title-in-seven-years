Northwestern University  reclaimed its
National Collegiate Athletic Association women’s lacrosse title
from the University of  Maryland  with an 8-7 victory.  Yesterday’s win allowed Northwestern to avenge a loss to
the Terrapins in last year’s title game, and means the school
has taken six of the last seven national championships in the
sport. The final matched up the country’s top two teams, which
both finished 21-2.  Northwestern, ranked second, came back from a 4-1 deficit
to even the game 5-5 at half time. Tournament most valuable
player Shannon Smith scored four times for the Wildcats, who
controlled possession in the second half to frustrate Maryland,
which had the nation’s fourth-best offense this season.  All eight of the Wildcats who scored come from  New York ’s
Long Island, where the final was held at Stony Brook University.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
