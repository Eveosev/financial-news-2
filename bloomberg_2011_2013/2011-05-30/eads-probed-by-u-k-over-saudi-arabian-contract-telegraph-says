The U.K.  Serious Fraud Office  is
investigating allegations that a European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. unit bribed Saudi Arabian officials to secure a
communications contract, the  Daily Telegraph reported , citing a
person it didn’t identify.  The company provided Saudi officials with cars, jewelry and
briefcases of money through intermediaries in order to obtain a
contract valued at 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion), the
Telegraph said, citing statements by Ian Foxley, a former
employee of EADS unit GPT, to investigators.  The Serious Fraud Office declined to comment, the newspaper
said.  Alvaro Meredith, a spokesman for EADS UK Ltd., confirmed
that the unit, GPT Special Project Management Ltd., is a
subsidiary of Paradigm Services Ltd. and said in an e-mailed
statement that “certain allegations have been made and these
are being properly investigated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
