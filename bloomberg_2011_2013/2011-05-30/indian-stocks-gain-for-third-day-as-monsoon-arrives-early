Most Indian stocks rose as the early
arrival of  monsoon  rains, accounting for more than 70 percent of
annual rainfall, prompted speculation farm output may increase
and help cool food inflation.  Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , the world’s second-biggest
irrigation-equipment maker, climbed 3.6 percent. The monsoon
rains reached the mainland in southern Kerala and  Tamil Nadu 
states two days earlier than forecast and are likely to reach
Karnataka state in the next two-to-three days, the  India
Meteorological Department  said in a  statement  May 29. DLF Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest real estate developer, climbed 2 percent.  “Early arrival of the rains is certainly a positive,”
Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees $465 million as chief investment
officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai, said by
phone. “The monsoon is one of the biggest uncertainties facing
the economy and the markets, so a good start is welcome.” He
said he prefers shares of private lenders, fertilizer companies
and some consumer-goods makers, declining to name any.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index was little
changed at 18,268.44 as of 10:54 a.m. in Mumbai. The gauge
dropped 0.3 percent last week, retreating for a second week. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd.
advanced 0.1 percent to 5,480.25 today. The BSE 200 Index rose
0.3 percent to 2,265.30, with more than two of the measure’s
stocks climbing for every share that fell.  Stock Valuations  The Sensex has lost 11 percent this year on concern high
inflation and rising borrowing costs will hurt corporate
earnings. Equities on the measure are valued at an average 14.7
times estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last
year’s high. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at 11.2
times earnings.  India had to import record quantities of sugar, lentils and
oilseeds in 2009 following the weakest monsoon since 1972.
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is betting on normal rains to
tame food price gains after they averaged 18 percent in 2010.  The  Reserve Bank  of India boosted benchmark  interest rates 
on May 3 for the ninth time in 15 months and said inflation will
remain at an “elevated level” until at least September. The
wholesale-price index, which rose 8.66 percent in April from a
year earlier, has stayed above 8 percent for 16 consecutive
months.  Abundant rains may boost rice, corn, sugar, cotton and
oilseed harvests, helping growth and curbing inflation in a
country where farming represents a fifth of the economy.  ‘More Important’  “This year’s monsoon is even more important because there
are worries about the economy slowing down” as a result of
policy tightening, said  Sonal Varma , a Mumbai-based economist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. “Given the risks on inflation, the last
thing we need is a bad monsoon and food prices spurting.”  India’s economy  may expand “around 8 percent” in the year
through March from 8.6 percent in the previous 12 months, the
central bank estimated May 3. Economic growth has averaged 8.6
percent in the past six years.  Jain Irrigation Systems climbed 3.6 percent to 164.50
rupees.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , India’s biggest real estate developer, climbed
2 percent to 229.70 rupees.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the country’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, increased for a fourth day before it announces
earnings today. The stock rose 0.4 percent to 284.20 rupees,
headed for the highest close in two weeks.  “The market will look to the rain gods for direction,”
Suresh Babu Pyarla, a derivatives strategist at Axis Securities
& Sales Ltd, a unit of India’s third-biggest non-state lender,
said in an interview on May 27. “The monsoon will be a key
factor for stocks in the near term.”  Overseas funds bought a net 12.2 billion rupees ($270
million) of Indian equities on May 26, paring their total
outflows from equities in 2011 to 23 billion rupees, according
to data on the  website  of the market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
