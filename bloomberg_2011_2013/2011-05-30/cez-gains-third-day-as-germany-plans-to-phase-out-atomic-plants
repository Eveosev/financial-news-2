CEZ AS (CEZ)  gained for a third day after
neighboring  Germany  said it will keep a tax on nuclear fuel and
close down all reactors by 2022, sending the electricity price
to the highest in almost two months.  The biggest Czech power generator that exports part of its
output to Germany rose as much as 0.9 percent and closed up 0.4
percent to 934 koruna at 4:24 p.m. in Prague. The advance was
the stock’s biggest since May 12.  German electricity for next-year delivery rose for a second
day to 60.45 euros per megawatt-hour after Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s administration yesterday set the nuclear-energy exit
date following  Japan ’s Fukushima disaster. A tax on spent fuel
rods imposed in the country will stay even as the shutdown
proceeds, Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said.  “We regard the preservation of the nuclear-fuel tax as
slightly positive for CEZ shares,” analyst Marek Hatlapatka at
Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report
today. “The decision on the final phase-out of nuclear plants
in Germany should be largely priced in CEZ shares by now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
