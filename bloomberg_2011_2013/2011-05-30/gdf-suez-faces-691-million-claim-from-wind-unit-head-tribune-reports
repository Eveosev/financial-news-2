GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA is facing a claim of 485
million euros from Jean-Michel Germa, who GDF has removed as the
head of its La Compagnie du Vent wind-power unit, La Tribune
reported, citing Germa.  A tribunal will consider Germa’s appeal against his removal
on June 9, the newspaper said.  Germa says that GDF’s policy was to sipon off assets and
expertise from La Compagnie du Vent into other parts of the GDF
Suez group, La Tribune said.  The newspaper cited unidentified people at GDF Suez as
saying that Germa’s wish to keep the unit independent was
driving it to the wall.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
