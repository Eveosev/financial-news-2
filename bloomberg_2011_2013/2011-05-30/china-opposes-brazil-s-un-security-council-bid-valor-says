The Chinese government is lobbying
countries in  Africa  to reject a proposal by Brazil, India,
Germany and  Japan  to expand the United Nations Security Council,
Valor Economico newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained this information.  Chinese officials are asking African diplomats to oppose a
proposal by the so-called G4 group of countries to expand the
council to allow a bigger voice for emerging countries, the
newspaper said. The proposal, backed by 71 countries, will be
presented to the U.N. General Assembly soon, Valor said.  Brazil is seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
