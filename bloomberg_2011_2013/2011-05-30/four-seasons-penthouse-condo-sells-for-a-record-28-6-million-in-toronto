An international buyer bought a
penthouse at Toronto’s  Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences 
for C$28 million ($28.6 million), which the developer said is
the most expensive condominium sold in  Canada .  The 9,038-square-foot suite is on the top floor of the 55-
storey West Residence building of the complex at Bay Street and
Yorkville Avenue, Bay-Yorkville Developments Ltd. said today in
a statement. The development includes a hotel and 210 private
residences with a 55-storey tower and a 26-storey block.  The Four Seasons, which is under construction, is 85
percent sold, according to the statement. The condominiums and
the hotel are scheduled to open in summer 2012.  The West penthouse was priced at C$30 million when it went
on sale in September 2008, according to an earlier press
release. The buyer wasn’t indentified in the statement.  By comparison, a condominium at  Manhattan ’s  Plaza  hotel
sold for $48 million in March, a record at the time for  New York
City .  Growth in Canada’s market for new and resale homes will
cool this year and next, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said
today in its latest quarterly outlook.  Housing starts will stabilize at levels “consistent with
demographic fundamentals” in an annual range of 166,600 to
192,200, after peaking in the second quarter of 2010, the
national housing agency said.  Bay-Yorkville Developments licensed the Four Seasons name
for the complex from Four Seasons Hotels Ltd., the hotel chain
owned by investors including Microsoft Corp. Chairman  Bill Gates 
and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
