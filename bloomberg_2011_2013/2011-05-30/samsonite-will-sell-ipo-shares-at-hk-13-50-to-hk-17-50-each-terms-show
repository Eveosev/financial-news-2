Samsonite International SA , the
luggage maker backed by London-based CVC Capital Partners Ltd.,
may raise as much as HK$11.7 billion ($1.5 billion) in an
initial public offering in  Hong Kong , a sale document showed.  Samsonite and investors are offering 671.2 million shares
in Hong Kong at HK$13.50 to HK$17.50 each, according to a term
sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. The company plans to set a
final price for the IPO on June 9 and start trading on June 16,
the terms show.  The 101-year-old company will list shares in Hong Kong
ahead of Coach Inc. and Prada SpA as consumer-goods makers seek
to boost market share in China, where rising affluence is
bolstering spending on foreign goods. Beauty-products maker
 L’Occitane International SA (973)  has jumped 37 percent since its Hong
Kong IPO in April last year.  “Brand-name companies targeting mainland Chinese consumers
have good growth prospects in the long term as  China ’s economy
continues to grow fast,” said Nelson Yan, who helps oversee $90
million as investment manager at Mayfair Pacific Financial Group
in Hong Kong. “Samsonite’s valuation is relatively attractive
compared to listed luxury goods makers.”  The price range represents 17 to 22 times Samsonite’s
estimated 2011 earnings, as estimated by banks arranging the
sale. Six luxury-goods companies listed in Asia, including
L’Occitane and women’s shoe retailer Belle International
Holdings Ltd., trade at an average of 26.2 estimated 2011
earnings, according to a note from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Grabbing China Share  Existing shares account for 82 percent of Samsonite’s IPO,
the terms show. Goldman Sachs,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  are managing the offering.  Samsonite, which sells luggage under the Samsonite and
American Tourister brand, said China has the largest potential
for growth as the company plans to open stores in 140 cities.  The Mansfield, Massachusetts-based company aims to boost
market share in China to as much as 35 percent within five years
from 12.5 percent currently, Ramesh Tainwala, the company’s
president for the Asia-Pacific region and the  Middle East , told
reporters in Hong Kong on May 24. Sales in China rose 50 percent
last year, he said.  Samsonite was bought by CVC, a private equity firm, for
about $1.7 billion in October 2007. Its U.S. retail division,
Samsonite Co. Stores, in 2009 sought  bankruptcy protection  from
creditors after the financial crisis caused a slump in demand
for travel-related products.  The company started as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing in
Denver in 1910, with Samson as its first brand. The first
Samsonite-brand suitcase was introduced 29 years later,
according to Hoover’s, Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
