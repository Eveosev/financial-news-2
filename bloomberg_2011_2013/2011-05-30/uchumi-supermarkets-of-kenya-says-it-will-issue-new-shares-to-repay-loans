Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a retailer
whose shares will resume trading tomorrow after a five-year
suspension, plans to issue new stock to debenture holders and
the government to repay loans.  A total of 85.4 million new shares will be issued at 10
shillings (12 cents) each, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement today in the Standard newspaper. The creation of the
stock will result in the Kenyan government becoming the biggest
shareholder in Uchumi, with a 13.4 percent stake, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
