The planned sale of  Daewoo
Electronics Corp.  to  Entekhab Industrial Group  for 577.7 billion
won ($534.9 million) collapsed after the Iranian company failed
to make a full payment, the South Korean company’s creditor said.  Creditors will start negotiations with potential buyers
including  Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , which was a second preferred bidder,
Lee Yong Gyu, a Seoul-based spokesman for  Woori Bank  said by
telephone. Two phone calls to Esfahan, Iran-based Entekhab went
unanswered.  The failure to sell the company will prolong Daewoo
creditors’ decade-long search by Daewoo’s creditors for a buyer
for the former unit of Daewoo Group. The group was once  South
Korea ’s largest conglomerate before it collapsed in 1999.  Entekhab agreed to buy Daewoo in November after creditors
of the Seoul-based company scrapped a sale to New York-based,
asset management firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC in January 2009
because of differences over sale terms.  Electrolux was still interested in buying Daewoo if the
takeover by Entekhab falls through, Chief Executive Officer
Keith McLoughlin said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
