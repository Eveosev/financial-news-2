Samsung SDI Co., a maker of
electric-car batteries, plunged the most in two years in
 Seoul  trading on concern its plan to buy Samsung Electronics
Co.’s solar-cell business may not pay off soon enough.  The shares fell 12 percent to 177,500 won at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Seoul, the biggest drop since May 2009.
The benchmark Kospi index fell 0.3 percent.  Samsung SDI will buy Samsung Electronics’ solar-cell
division for 160.8 billion won ($149 million), according to a
May 27 joint statement by the companies. Yongin, South Korea-
based Samsung SDI will invest 2.2 trillion won in the
business by 2015, targeting 3.5 trillion won in sales,
according to the statement.  The business will require “enormous” investment and
probably won’t contribute to Samsung SDI’s earnings for two
years, Hwang Joon Ho, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co.,
wrote in a report today. Daewoo cut its rating on Samsung SDI
to “trading buy” from “buy,” with a 12-month target price
at 230,000 won.  Samsung SDI’s shares have gained 5.7 percent this year,
compared with a 2.1 percent advance in the Kospi Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
