German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler is considering limiting how often gasoline stations can
change the price at the pump, Handelsblatt said, citing an
interview.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government will discuss whether
to ban oil companies from changing pump prices every five
minutes, the Dusseldorf-based  newspaper  quoted Roesler as saying
in an article for tomorrow’s edition. Limited competition on
 Germany ’s fuel market is leading to higher prices, he was quoted
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
