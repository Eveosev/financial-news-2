Indonesia  will continue to encourage
exports of coal while making it mandatory for miners to meet
domestic demand, Indonesian Energy Minister Darwin Saleh said at
the Coaltrans Asia conference in Bali today.  Indonesia will maintain its “dual role” of generating
government export revenue and meeting domestic demand, Saleh
said. The country is trying to strike a balance between exports,
which account for 75 percent of production, and supplying
locally, he said.  The world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal is building 20
gigawatts of capacity by 2014 of which 14 gigawatts will be
coal-fired, Saleh said. Coal production increased 16 percent
annually over the last 5 years, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
