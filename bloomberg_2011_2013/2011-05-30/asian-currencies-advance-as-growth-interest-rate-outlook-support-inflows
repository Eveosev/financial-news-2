Asian currencies strengthened, led by
the Malaysian ringgit, on speculation the region’s pace of
economic growth will attract funds and policy makers will raise
 interest rates  further to cool inflation.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose for a third
day before a report this week that analysts predict will show
 Malaysia ’s exports increased by the most in nine months from a
year earlier in April. All 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
expect the Bank of Thailand to lift borrowing costs on June 1.
The Philippines gross domestic product gained 4.9 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, compared with 6.1 percent in
the previous three months, data showed today.  “We can get some stable growth momentum from here, which
is supportive of fund inflows,” said Nik M. Khairul, a treasury
dealer at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “As for
rates, the market could see another round of increases this
year.”  The ringgit advanced 0.5 percent to 3.0190 per dollar as of
4:27 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.2 percent to NT$28.830,
Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.3 percent to 8,548 and  South Korea ’s
won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,080.10.  Shipments from Malaysia rose 10.7 percent from a year
earlier, the most since July 2010, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey before a trade ministry report on
June 3. Bank Negara Malaysia raised its policy rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 3 percent on May 5, saying the economy
was expected to “remain firmly on a steady growth path.”  Exporters Convert Income  Asia ’s developing economies will expand 8.4 percent this
year, outpacing growth of 2.8 percent in the U.S. and 1.6
percent in the euro area, according to International Monetary
Fund forecasts published last month.  The Taiwan dollar reached a two-week high,  India ’s rupee
gained for a third day and the Korean won touched the strongest
level in three weeks on speculation exporters were repatriating
income to take advantage of favorable exchange rates.  U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for
international finance Charles Collyns said South Korea should
let the won appreciate, the Korea Economic Daily reported.  “Exporters are selling dollars to translate their income
at the end of the month, pushing up the won,” said Seo Jeong Hun, a currency analyst at Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul. “The
comments from the U.S. Treasury official are giving more room
for the won to rise.”  Thai Inflation  Thailand ’s baht gained to a one-week high before a report
on June 1 that will show consumer prices increased by 4.3
percent in May from a year earlier, the most since September
2008, a Bloomberg survey shows. The currency rose 0.1 percent to
30.35 per dollar.  “Inflation remains on an uptrend in Asia due in part to
solid growth,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “For Thailand, speculation of
rate hikes will grow toward the policy meeting and that will put
appreciation pressure on the baht this week.”  China ’s yuan advanced 0.12 percent to 6.4837 per dollar and
touched 6.4826 earlier, the strongest level since 1993. The
currency’s reference rate was fixed today at 6.4856 per dollar,
the highest level since July 2005.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso rose 0.1 percent to 43.315
per dollar, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The
 Singapore  dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to S$1.2339 while the
Vietnamese dong was 0.1 percent stronger at 20,530.  To contact the reporter on this story:
