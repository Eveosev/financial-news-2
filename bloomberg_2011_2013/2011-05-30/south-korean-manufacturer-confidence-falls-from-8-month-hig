South Korean manufacturers’
confidence retreated from an eight-month high as rising
production costs and gains in the won damped their business
outlook.  An index measuring expectations for June dropped to 97 from
100 for May, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul 
today. A measure of non-manufacturing companies’ expectations
declined to 86 from 89.  The survey was conducted from May 17 to May 24 and was
based on responses from 1,587 manufacturers and 885 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
