Axa  Private Equity  and Permira
Advisers LLP won European Union approval to add  Amadeus IT
Holding SA (AMS) ’s Opodo online travel agency to their Internet travel
businesses.  Combining Opodo with Axa and Permira’s Go Voyages and
eDreams online travel agencies won’t harm competition because
they face “sufficient competition” from airlines’ own
websites, the European Commission said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
