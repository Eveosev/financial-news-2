Lithuania’s central-government budget
deficit narrowed to 1.9 percent of estimated gross domestic
product through the first four months this year.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, narrowed from
2.8 percent of GDP in the same four-month period of 2010, the
Vilnius-based  Finance Ministry  said in a statement on its
website today.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’ government aims to keep
the fiscal deficit, which includes funds from the central
government, local governments and social security, at 5.3
percent of GDP this year, compared with 7.1 percent last year.  Government debt accounted for 33.6 percent of GDP at the
end of April, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
