Qatar plans to create a secondary
market at the  Qatar Exchange  for small and medium-sized
companies, the bourse said today in a  release  on its website.  The May 25 decision by the Supreme Council for Economic
Affairs and Investment would increase small and medium-sized
companies’ “efficiency and enhance their role, so they will be
able to occupy advanced positions regionally and
internationally,” the Qatar Exchange’s vice chairman, Ahmad Al- Sayed, said in the statement.  The regulations for listing on the junior market will be
“lighter” and more “flexible” than the regulations for
listing on the main Qatar Exchange, the bourse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
