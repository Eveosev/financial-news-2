OTP Bank Nyrt. fell the most in four
weeks, pushing Hungary’s BUX stock index lower, as Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said he intended to keep a bank tax and
presented a plan to fix exchange rates on mortgages.  The benchmark BUX index of shares dropped 1.2 percent to
22,786.92 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest. OTP, the country’s
biggest lender, weakened 2 percent to 5,920 forint, the biggest
drop since May 3. The nation’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent
to 268.4 per euro.  The bank tax is an “organic part” of the Hungarian
budget, Orban told reporters in Budapest today. If a European
Union bank tax is adopted by the end of 2012, then the Hungarian
government will introduce that levy once a three-year bank tax
expires at the end of 2012, Orban added.  “The special tax will remain a risk for earnings beyond
2012 for the two domestic listed banks, OTP and FHB,” analysts
at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. led by Akos Kuti wrote in a research
note after Orban’s comments, referring to Foldhitel es
Jelzalogbank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s second-largest mortgage lender.  FHB snapped two days of gains, retreating 0.7 percent to
950 forint, the biggest drop in a week.  “Foreign investors will probably allocate fewer resources
to the Hungarian financial sector than other countries in the
region due to this sector tax,”  Elisabeth Andreew  and Peter Klinke, analysts at Nordea Bank AB, wrote in a report today.  The government and lenders agreed to fix the  exchange rate 
on Swiss franc-denominated mortgages at 180 forint per franc
until the end of 2014 to help borrowers after a moratorium on
evictions expires in July, Orban said.  The plan “sweeps the problems under the carpet,” saddling
banks with the costs and hurting economic growth,  Zoltan Torok ,
an analyst at Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Budapest,
wrote in a research note.  The forint weakened 0.4 percent against the franc to
220.755, extending its losses this month to 6.6 percent, the
biggest slump since November.
