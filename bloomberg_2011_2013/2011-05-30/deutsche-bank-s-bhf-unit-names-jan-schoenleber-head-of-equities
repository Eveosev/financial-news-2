Jan Schoenleber was appointed as new
head of equities at BHF-Bank AG amid a personnel shuffle at the
unit of  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   In addition, Andrew Lockhart was named head of equity
research and Marcus Hahn was made head of equity sales and sales
trading, said Juergen Heine, a spokesman for BHF in Frankfurt.
Schoenleber was previously in charge of proprietary trading at
the firm and replaces Thomas Eckert, who left the company. Hahn
started at BHF as head of equity sales trading in April last
year, while Lockhart was hired as head of cash equity sales in
December 2009.  BHF, which was acquired by Deutsche Bank through the
purchase of Sal. Oppenheim, offers private banking, asset
management and investment banking. Sal. Oppenheim bought BHF
from  ING Groep NV (INGA)  for 600 million euros ($857 million) in 2004.
Deutsche Bank said in April that talks on a sale of BHF to
Liechtenstein’s LGT Group ended and that it won’t pursue a
divestiture of the unit.  Carsten Stork and Markus Hechler, the heads of equity
trading at BHF, have left the company, two people familiar with
the matter said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
