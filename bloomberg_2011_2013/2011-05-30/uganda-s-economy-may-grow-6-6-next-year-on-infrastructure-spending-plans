Uganda ’s economy may grow 6.6 percent
in the 2011-12 fiscal year, boosted by spending on the country’s
energy infrastructure, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Growth may accelerate from 6.4 percent in the current
financial year that ends on June 30, the ministry said in a
budget document handed to Bloomberg News today in Kampala, the
capital. The East African nation’s government is scheduled to
present its annual budget on June 8.  Uganda, East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy, is on the cusp
of an oil boom with  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K.-based energy
company, expected to start pumping crude and gas from the Lake
Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an estimated 2.5 billion
barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven reserves,
according to Tullow.  Funds from oil flows will help finance the construction of
electricity infrastructure, “unlocking one of the key major
constraints to development and transformation of Uganda,” the
ministry said. The budget for the Energy and Mineral Development
Ministry will be raised by 15 percent to 1.23 trillion shillings
($513 million) next year, it said.  Uganda will spend 828.6 billion shillings in 2011-12
developing the 650-megawatt Karuma Hydropower project along the
Nile River, the ministry said. Construction of the 100-megawatt
Isimba Hydropower project on the Nile is also expected to start
next financial year, the ministry said. It didn’t provide
further details.  Oil Refinery  Another key project in the  energy industry  will be the
construction of an oil refinery and an interstate pipeline, it
said. The refinery is expected to begin operating within three
years, the Energy Ministry said on May 25.  Expenditure on public works and transport will drop by 0.5
percent to 1.03 trillion shillings, according to the budget
document.  The country’s total budget for 2011-12 may expand to 9.25
trillion shillings from the projected 9.13 trillion in the
current year, excluding debt repayments, the ministry said.  Uganda is Africa’s second-biggest producer of coffee, after
 Ethiopia . Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of the country’s
annual output.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 7 shillings, or 0.3 percent,
to 2,400 per  U.S. dollar  at 4:30 p.m. today in the capital,
Kampala. The currency has depreciated by 3.8 percent so far this
year, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
