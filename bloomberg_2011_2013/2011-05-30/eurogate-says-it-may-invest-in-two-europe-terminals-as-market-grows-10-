Eurogate GmbH & Co. KgaA,  Europe ’s
largest container terminal operator, may invest in two European
ports as it expects to grow almost twice as fast this year,
Emanuel Schiffer, co-chairman of the company, said.  “There are two other projects we are looking at, and while
we normally develop new terminals from green-field sites, these
are two existing terminals that need a real development kick,”
Schiffer said in an interview at a conference in the German port
of Wilhemshaven on May 27. He declined to identify the ports.  Eurogate  operates nine container terminals in  Germany ,
 Italy , Morocco,  Portugal  and handled 12.6 million standard
containers last year -- more than the 11.1 million boxes handled
by  Rotterdam , Europe’s largest port. The Bremen, Germany-based
company expects to handle 10 percent more containers this year,
compared with 5.2 percent growth last year and a "long-term"
yearly growth rate of 7 percent to 10 percent, Schiffer said.  “If the right opportunity is there, we may also look
outside Europe for new projects,” he said.  The company traces its roots back to 1865, when Eurokai was
founded in Hamburg, and to 1877, when BLG was created in Bremen.
The two companies merged in 1999. Eurogate reported a 29 percent
increase in  profit  to 61.6 million euros ($87.9 million) last
year.  Eurogate may make a bid if Hamburg, Europe’s third-largest
container port, decides to develop the Steinwerder site in its
harbor into a new container terminal, Schiffer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
