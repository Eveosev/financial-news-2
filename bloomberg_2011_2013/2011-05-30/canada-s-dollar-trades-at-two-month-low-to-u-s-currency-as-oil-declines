Canada ’s dollar traded at almost the
lowest level since March against its U.S. counterpart as crude
oil and copper declined before policy makers meet tomorrow to
set  interest rates .  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, capped its fourth straight weekly
drop on May 27, matching a stretch of losses in July 2009, on
signs the U.S. recovery is wobbling. The Swiss franc and
greenback are among the best-performing major currencies this
month as investors seek refuge.  “The Canadian dollar as a cyclical currency has
underperformed,” said  George Davis , chief technical analyst for
fixed-income and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in
Toronto. “The broader-based  U.S. dollar  strength that we’ve
seen has resulted from markets pricing in a lower growth
trajectory.”  The loonie fetched 97.71 cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m.
in Toronto, compared with 97.61 on May 27. It touched 98.16
cents on May 25 and May 26, the weakest level since March 28.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0233. The currency slid 0.2 percent
last week and has fallen 3.3 percent in May.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell 0.2
percent to $100.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Copper dropped as much as 1.2 percent to $4.135 a pound.  The yield on the two-year Canadian government bond dropped
less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.50
percent. The price of the 1.75 percent security maturing in
March 2013 increased 1 cent to C$100.43.  U.S. Yield Spread  The two-year bond yielded 103 basis points more than a
similar  U.S. Treasury , the smallest gap since March 31. The
difference was 116 basis points on May 19.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 1.7 percent this
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  and colleagues will
hold the target rate for overnight lending between commercial
banks at 1 percent, according to all of the 24 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The decision is due tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Ottawa time.  The loonie is the worst performer among its 16 most-traded
counterparts since May 16, when Carney said in Ottawa that the
“persistent strength” of the currency, which reached the
highest in more than three years last month, poses a risk to the
economy and underlying inflation remains subdued.  “After recent Carney comments, we really don’t expect too
much in the way of a change or hints of hikes in the near
term,” said Firas Askari, head currency trader in Toronto at
Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital unit.  Canada’s first-quarter economic growth accelerated to the
fastest pace in a year as outlays by businesses increased while
consumer and government spending stalled.  Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.9 percent annualized
pace from January through March after a previous 3.1 percent
expansion,  Statistics Canada  said today. Economists predicted a
4 percent gain, according to the median of 28 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
