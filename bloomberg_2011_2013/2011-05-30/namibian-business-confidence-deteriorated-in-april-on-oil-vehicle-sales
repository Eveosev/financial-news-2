Namibian companies were less
optimistic about the outlook for business in April after metals
prices fell, vehicle sales declined and international  oil prices 
increased, according to a survey.  The Namibia Business Climate Index dropped 3.5 points to
114.6 from a month earlier, the Windhoek-based Institute of
Public Policy Research and IJG Securities Ltd., which conducted
the survey, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
