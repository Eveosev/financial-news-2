China  will raise retail electricity
prices for non-residential users in 15 provinces starting next
month, the first increase in more than a year, to curb demand
and boost power generation to combat its worst-ever shortage.  Hong Kong  will likely say retail sales increased 25.2
percent in April, slowing slightly from 26 percent in March,
according to the median estimate of nine economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The city is scheduled to release the numbers at 4:30
p.m. local time today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
