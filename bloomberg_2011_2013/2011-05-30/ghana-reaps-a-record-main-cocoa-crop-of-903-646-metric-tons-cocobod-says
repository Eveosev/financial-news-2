Ghana , the world’s second largest
cocoa producer, reaped a record 903,646 metric tons of the
chocolate ingredient in its main growing season as good weather
and better farming practices helped to boost output, according
to the industry regulator.  The 33-week main-crop harvest, which started in October,
was 54 percent higher than last year’s output, Noah Amenyah,
spokesman for the Accra-based  Ghana Cocoa Board , also known as
Cocobod, said by phone today. It’s also the biggest in the West
African nation’s history.  Ghanaian production was not boosted by smuggling of the
beans from neighboring  Ivory Coast , the world’s top grower of
cocoa, Amenyah said. Shipments of Ivorian beans were largely
halted for about three months earlier this year amid a violent
struggle for power that followed the country’s November
presidential election.  Cocobod is targeting production of between 80,000 tons and
100,000 tons in the 12-week light-crop season that starts on
June 10, Amenyah said. The board is also aiming for annual
production of 1 million tons by the 2012-13 harvest, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
