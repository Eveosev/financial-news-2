ONGC Videsh Ltd., the overseas unit
of  India ’s largest explorer, is seeking to sell 700,000 barrels
of  Russia ’s Sokol crude for loading in August, according to a
document e-mailed to potential buyers.  The company, a wholly owned unit of Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., is entitled to a share of Sokol output from the Sakhalin-
1 project because it is one of the investors. The other partners
