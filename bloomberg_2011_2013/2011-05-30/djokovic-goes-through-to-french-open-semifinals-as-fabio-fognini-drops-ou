Second-seeded Novak Djokovic moved to
the last four of tennis’s French Open after his quarterfinal
opponent  Fabio Fognini  pulled out with an injury.  “I have a little problem on my left leg, so we decided to
retire,” the unseeded Italian told a news conference today at
 Roland Garros . “I’m not really happy now for sure, because it
is one of the best tournaments of my career. But it is better
like this. The team, the doctor says if I play tomorrow it may
be dangerous, so I decided to retire.”  Fognini injured his leg yesterday as he overcame cramp and
five match points to beat  Spain ’s Albert Montanes, 4-6, 6-4, 3-
6, 6-3, 11-9 in a match that lasted 4 hours, 22 minutes.  The withdrawal means Serbia’s Djokovic, who has been on
unbeaten run of 43 straight wins since the Davis Cup finals in
December, won’t be able to catch Argentina’s Guillermo Vilas in
Paris for the longest win streak since tennis turned
professional in 1968. Vilas won 46 consecutive matches in 1977.
Djokovic, who is 41-0 this year, can equal  John McEnroe ’s record
of 42 straight wins to start a season if he reaches the finals.  Roger Federer , the 2009 champion and a possible semifinal
opponent for Djokovic, yesterday moved to the quarterfinals with
a straight-sets win over fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka.
Federer, the winner of a men’s record 16 Grand Slam singles
titles, will either play Spain’s David Ferrer or  France ’s Gael Monfils in the last eight. Their match resumes today after it
was stopped because of darkness last night with Monfils leading
6-4, 2-6, 7-5, 0-2.  Djokovic won’t play until June 3, when the semifinals are
scheduled to take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
