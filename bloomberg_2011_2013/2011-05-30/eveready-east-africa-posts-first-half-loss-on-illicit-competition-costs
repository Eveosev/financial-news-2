Eveready East Africa Ltd. (EVRD) , a Kenyan
battery manufacturer, said it posted a first-half loss because
of competition from trade in “illicit” dry-cell batteries and
high raw-material costs as the shilling depreciated.  The loss totaled 54 million shillings ($634,000) in the six
months through March, compared with a profit of 12.8 million
shillings a year earlier, the  Nairobi -based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today. Revenue
fell 19 percent to 659.7 million shillings.  The shilling has depreciated 6.1 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the fourth-worst performer worldwide,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares declined the most since May 24, losing 2.3
percent to 2.15 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi,
extending their retreat this year to 28 percent, the fourth-
worst performing stock on the Nairobi Stock Exchange after
Express Kenya Ltd., AccessKenya Ltd. and Pan Africa Insurance
Holdings Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
