Fortis Inc.,  Canada ’s biggest
publicly traded electric utility, said it agreed to buy  Central
Vermont Public Service Corp. (CV)  for about $470 million to enter the
U.S. regulated electricity market.  Fortis, based in  St. John’s , Newfoundland, will pay about
$35.10 a share in cash, or 44 percent higher than the U.S.
utility’s closing price on May 27 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Fortis will also assume about $230 million in debt
held by the Rutland, Vermont-based company, Fortis said in a
statement today.  Central  Vermont  Public Service is the largest integrated
electric utility in the state, with about 160,000 customers in
about two-thirds of the cities and towns in Vermont, according
to the statement. Upon completion, the acquisition will boost
Fortis’s assets by about 7 percent to C$13.9 billion ($14.3
billion), and add to earnings in the first year, Fortis said.  The purchase is expected to close in about six to 12
months, Fortis said. The company plans to sell 9.1 million
shares to the public at C$33 each for proceeds of C$300.3
million. Scotia Capital and  RBC Capital Markets  are leading the
sale.  Lazard Ltd. is advising Central Vermont in the transaction.  Fortis fell 69 cents, or 2.1 percent, to C$32.97 at 4 p.m.
in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest one-day
decline since November. Central Vermont closed at $24.32 on May
27. The U.S. markets are closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
