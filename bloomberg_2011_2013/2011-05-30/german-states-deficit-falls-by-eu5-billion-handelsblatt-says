The deficit in the 16 German states
fell by 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion) in the first four months
of 2011 from a year earlier,  Handelsblatt  said, citing a Finance
Ministry report.  An increase in tax revenue will allow German states to
limit their deficit to 20 billion euros this year, 6.7 billion
euros less than initially anticipated, the newspaper said.  Two states, Bavaria and Saxony, had a balanced budget from
January to April, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
