Power-station coal prices  at  China ’s
Qinhuangdao port rose for a seventh week to the highest in more
than two years as the country battled with an electricity
shortage.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram gained 0.6 percent to between 830 and 845 yuan a metric
ton as of today compared with a week earlier, according to the
China Coal Transport and Distribution Association. That’s the
highest since October 2008.  The world’s largest energy user may face an electricity
supply shortfall of as much as 40 gigawatts in summer,
surpassing the shortage in 2004, China’s worst, according to
State Grid Corp. of China, the nation’s dominant power supplier.
Coal is used as fuel at more than 70 percent of the country’s
power plants.  Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao port, which ships half of the
nation’s seaborne coal, fell 1 percent from a week earlier to
5.77 million tons, according to the association.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo, Alex Kwiatkowski.  To contact the reporter on this story:
