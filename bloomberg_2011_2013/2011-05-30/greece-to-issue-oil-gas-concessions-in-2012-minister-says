Greece  will introduce licensing
procedures for oil and natural gas exploration next year in some
areas of its territorial waters, Deputy Energy Minister Yiannis
Maniatis said.  An international tender for rights to oil and gas deposits
in the Ionian Sea off the western coast and also south of the
island of Crete will follow the completion of seismic surveys in
the two regions, Maniatis said in a speech today, a transcript
of which was e-mailed by the  Environment, Energy and Climate
Change Ministry .  Greece could raise as much as $15 billion from oil
exploration and production concessions, Maniatis said last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
