A disruption at a  LyondellBasell
Industries NV (LYB)  chemical plant in Illinois caused the temporary
evacuation of about 100 residents yesterday.  People living near the Equistar plant in Morris, Illinois,
68 miles (109 kilometers) southwest of  Chicago , were evacuated
to the neighboring village of Minooka after a  power outage  at
the facility, according to Patrick Brennan, the village
president. The evacuees were sheltered at the Minooka Bible
Church for several hours, Brennan said.  “About 7:30 last night they declared it was safe to go
home,” Brennan said. “There were about 100 of them at the
Bible church.”  LyondellBasell had a  power failure  at the chemical plant in
Morris, Illinois, according to a filing to the National Response
Center. An ethylene storage tank overloaded after the outage and
was at risk of exploding, the NRC report said, citing an
unidentified caller.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
