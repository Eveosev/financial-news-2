Turkish shares extended the lowest
level in almost three months on concern that the central bank is
failing to take the measures required to rein in the country’s
widening current account deficit.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  dropped 915.71, or 1.5
percent, to 61,491.71 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, the
lowest level since March 8. Yields on benchmark two-year debt
rose 4 basis points to 9.01 percent, climbing for the second day
to the highest level in two months.  “Unfortunately, with the current account deficit at record
levels and the international picture becoming shaky, almost no
one is willing to give the central bank the benefit of the
doubt,” Adil Rizvi, director of institutional sales at EFG
Istanbul Securities, said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank has increased banks’ reserve requirements
four times since December to help curb the lending that’s being
used to buy imported goods and widened the current account gap.
Annual loan growth is exceeding 35 percent currently compared
with a central bank target of 25 percent, banking regulator data
published today showed.  Record Deficit  Turkey ’s April trade deficit may be $9.8 billion, equaling
the previous month’s record, the statistics agency in Ankara may
say tomorrow. The deficit widened from $5.5 billion a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of six economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. That would equal the March figure that
was the biggest since records began in 1984.  “A double-digit figure will not be pretty, especially if
the trade in global markets is not positive,” Henza Tukel, a
currency trader at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS, said in e-mailed
comments.  Foreign investors reduced their holdings of stocks by $6.9
billion and  government bonds  by $2.8 billion between May 6 and
May 20, central bank data showed on May 26.  The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.6032 per dollar. The
central bank said today it is reducing the amount of dollars it
buys in daily auctions to $40 million from $50 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
