Indian stocks declined, paring a
monthly gain, on concern faster-than-expected economic growth
may dissuade the central bank from cutting the highest  interest
rates  in the region.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  retreated 0.9 percent to
17,380.75 at the close in Mumbai, trimming the monthly gain to
0.8 percent. The gauge dropped 2.3 percent this week, ending a
four-week advance.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest home
products maker,  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the largest cigarette company, and
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the top software exporter,
dropped from record highs.  Gross domestic product  expanded 5.5 percent in the June
quarter, beating the 5.2 percent gain estimated in a Bloomberg
survey of 39 analysts. The data may fail to ease pressure on
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to revive a development agenda
hampered by graft allegations and political gridlock, as price
pressures keep the central bank from paring rates further.  “The RBI will argue high rates have not impacted growth
and that the government has to get inflation under control,”
Andrew Holland, chief executive officer of investment advisory
at Ambit Capital in Mumbai, said by e-mail. “Stocks will head
down and look at what happens globally in the next few weeks.”  Policy makers must reduce the inflation rate by about 2
percentage points, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Aug. 27.
Inflation has averaged more than 7 percent in 2012, fanned by
food costs and a 17 percent decline in the rupee against the
dollar in the past year that made imports such as oil costlier.
A below-average monsoon threatens to exacerbate price increases
and weigh on growth by crimping farm output.  ‘Outlier’  The wholesale-price index rose 6.87 percent last month from
a year earlier, the fastest inflation in the BRIC group, even as
the pace eased to a 32-month low.  India  also faces record
borrowing needs to plug the widest BRIC budget deficit and a
trade shortfall that has pressured the rupee.  India is “somewhat of an outlier in the world” as price
increases remain above a comfort level of about 5 percent even
as economic growth cools, according to Governor Subbarao. He
left borrowing costs unchanged at 8 percent in July for a second
meeting, after a 0.5 percentage point cut on April 17.  The main opposition party stalled parliament for an eighth
day today, demanding the prime minister to quit after the chief
auditor Aug. 17 found the government may have lost $33 billion
awarding coalfields without holding auctions. The government was
relying upon the parliamentary session to end two years of
policy gridlock to stoke economic growth from the slowest pace
in three years.  Foreign Flows  BNP Paribas SA cut its rating on Indian stocks to neutral
from overweight in a report Aug. 27 on concerns that persistent
inflation and policy deadlock will hurt growth until a new
government is formed in 2014.  The Sensex has still gained 12.5 percent this year, helped
by the biggest overseas equity flows among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg. Foreign funds bought a net $449.5 million
of stocks yesterday, the 23rd straight day of purchases, taking
their investments this year to $12.3 billion, according to data
from the regulator. That’s the longest stretch of net buying
since a record 41-day streak through Oct. 27, 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Sensex trades at 13.7 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.7 times.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, surged 3.8 percent to 17.30.
The Nifty index lost 1.1 percent to 5,258.50 and its September
futures settled at 5,291.65. The BSE-200 Index lost 0.6 percent
to 2,134.32. India’s top two bourses  traded  1 billion shares
yesterday, the highest since July 26 and 17 percent more than
the 12-month daily average of 888 million.  Hindustan Unilever slid 2.6 percent to 515.1 rupees. ITC
lost 1.1 percent to 267.65 rupees, ending a seven-day rally.
Tata Consultancy Services fell 1.7 percent to 1,343.75.  NTPC dropped 2 percent to 168.05 rupees. The company cut
its investment plan to 500 billion rupees in a five-year period
ending 2017 compared with 2 trillion rupees earlier, Business
Standard reported, citing a company official it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
