JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese
solar-panel manufacturer, will supply 1 megawatt of panels to a
chrome mine in  South Africa ’s Limpopo province, reducing its
daytime use of diesel generators.  Solea Renewables will design and build the plant using
4,170 of JinkoSolar’s polycrystalline photovoltaic panels, the
Shangrao-based company said in a statement today. The plant is
being built on a site owned by Cronimet Energy SA and will be
done by late October, according to a separate statement from
Johannesburg-based Solea Renewables.  With increasing demand for raw materials, mines face power
constraints because of capacity limitations at Eskom Holdings
SOC Ltd., South Africa’s state-owned electricity utility, Vusi
Mhlanzi, director of Solea Renewables, said in the statement.  Solar plants “reduce the ever present and increasing
energy demand Eskom faces” and provide “a natural long-term
hedge against all rising costs of power,” Mhlanzi said.  JinkoSolar sees opportunity in South Africa, with its
increasing population, strong economic growth and abundant
sunlight, Kangping Chen, its chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
