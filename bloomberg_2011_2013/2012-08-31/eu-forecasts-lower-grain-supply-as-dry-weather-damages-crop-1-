The European Union’s grain output
may be about 2 percent smaller than average because of dry
weather in some regions, the European Commission said.  Total cereal production may be 279 million metric tons,
according to an e-mailed report today from the commission, the
EU’s executive arm. The soft wheat harvest may be 127 million
tons, which is “status quo” compared with the previous five-
year average, and corn output of 60 million tons is about 2
percent higher than average, it said. The bloc may be a net
grain exporter this season, according to the report.  World inventories of grain at the end of the season may
decline by 33 million tons to 338 million tons, the EU said. The
tightening supply, due in part to drought in the U.S., “is
likely to keep prices at high levels,” according to the report.
Corn touched a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 on the Chicago
Board of Trade, while milling-wheat futures have climbed 35
percent this year on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  Higher prices “risk destabilizing certain sectors of the
European agriculture,” Dacian Ciolos, EU agriculture
commissioner, said in the statement. “This excessive volatility
of markets shows clearly that world agriculture requires
investments, public management policies and predictability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
