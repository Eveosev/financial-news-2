The pound was set for a monthly gain
against the dollar as a report showed U.K. house prices rose in
August, easing concern that the  recession  is worsening.  Sterling strengthened versus its U.S. counterpart in August
amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will extend its asset
purchase program. The average cost of a home  increased 1.3
percent  from July, the biggest monthly gain since January 2010,
the Swindon, England-based customer-owned lender said today. A
separate report showed U.K.  consumer confidence  was unchanged in
August. An  index of sentiment  stayed at minus 29, London-based
research group GfK NOP Ltd. said.  The pound was little changed at $1.5788 at 8:13 a.m. London
time, headed for a gain this month of 0.7 percent. Sterling was
at 79.23 pence per euro, poised for a monthly loss of 1 percent,
the most since June 2011.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is due to speak in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, today where he may discuss his assessment of the
need for more monetary stimulus in the U.S.  Britainâ€™s currency has gained 1.1 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 0.7 percent and
the euro declined 4.5 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 1.45 percent.  U.K. government bonds have returned 4.4 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bunds gained 4 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.3
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
