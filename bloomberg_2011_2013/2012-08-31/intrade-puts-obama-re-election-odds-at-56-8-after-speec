The odds that President  Barack Obama 
will be re-elected on Nov. 6 rose to 56.8 percent after the
Republicans concluded their nominating convention, according to
online prediction market  Intrade .  Obama’s odds, at 10:21 a.m. New York time, compared with a
43.3 percent chance for a victory by Republican nominee  Mitt Romney , according to bets made at the Dublin-based bookmaker.
Obama’s chances increased from 55.7 percent yesterday, while
Romney’s dropped slightly from 43.4 percent. The highest odds
for Obama this year were 61.4 percent on March 12 and again on
April 16.  In his speech last night accepting the nomination, Romney
reached out to disaffected Obama supporters, framing the
election as a choice between visions of the role of government
in America. Acceptance speeches, broadcast during prime-time
television hours, offer candidates a chance to set their image
and themes going into the final months of the presidential
election.  All Intrade contracts pay out $10 for winners, so a price
of $5.68 implies a 56.8 percent chance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
