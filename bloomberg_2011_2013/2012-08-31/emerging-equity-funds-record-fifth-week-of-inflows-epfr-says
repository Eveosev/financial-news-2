Emerging-market stock funds took in
$634 million in the week ended Aug. 29, their fifth consecutive
week of inflows, boosted by speculation the Chinese government
may increase infrastructure spending, according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $16.86 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $30.01
billion for the same period of 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider. The streak of five weeks of inflows was the longest
since the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
