Two-time champion  Venus Williams  was
knocked out of the  U.S. Open  in the second round by sixth-seeded
Angelique Kerber of Germany, completing a year of early-round
Grand Slam exits for the 32-year-old American.  Williams, unseeded this year and ranked 46th in the world,
has struggled for the past two years with Sjogren’s syndrome, an
energy-sapping autoimmune disease.  Williams, who lost 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 to Kerber, was a second-
round loser at the  French Open  and was defeated in the first
round at Wimbledon. The seven-time Grand Slam champion, who has
been ranked No. 1 in the world on three separate occasions, did
not play in this year’s Australian Open.  Williams, who once was among the best servers in women’s
tennis, lost her first five service games against Kerber. She
had 16 double faults and one ace in the match, which ended after
midnight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
