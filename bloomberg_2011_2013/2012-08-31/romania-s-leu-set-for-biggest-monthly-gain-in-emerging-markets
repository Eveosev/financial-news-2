The leu headed for the best
performance this month among emerging-market currencies on
suspended Romanian President Traian Basescu’s return to office.  The currency has advanced 2.5 percent this month,
outperforming all 25  emerging markets  and ranking second after
the Seychelles rupee among all the currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The leu weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.4700 per
euro by 5:38 p.m. in Bucharest.  A  Constitutional Court  invalidated an impeachment
referendum on Basescu on Aug. 21, paving the way for his return
to office on Aug. 28 and easing political turmoil. The central
bank has supported the leu by limiting the amount of funds it
provides to lenders via one-week repurchase agreements auctions,
supplying less than demanded in each of the four weeks in
August.  The central bank tightened liquidity to “limit leu
depreciation,” analysts including Nicolae Covrig at Raiffeisen
Bank Romania SA wrote in a note to clients.  The bank lent 4 billion lei ($1.1 billion) in its Aug. 27
repo auction against bids for 17 billion lei, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It provided a similar amount on Aug. 20
versus 15 billion lei, 5 billion lei on Aug. 13 against 18
billion lei and 6 billion lei on Aug. 6 compared with 15 billion
demanded by lenders.  Yields on  Romania ’s 10-year dollar bonds fell one basis
point to 5.61 percent, the lowest since the securities first
traded in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield fell 32 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
