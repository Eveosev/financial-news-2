Indonesia ’s bonds fell this month,
with the 10-year yield jumping the most since May, and the
rupiah dropped after global funds sold the nation’s assets on
concern the trade deficit will widen.  The yield reached the highest in more than 10 weeks
yesterday after overseas investors withdrew 570 billion rupiah
($60 million) from sovereign debt holdings this month through
Aug. 29, poised for the biggest outflow since May, Finance
Ministry data show. Indonesia probably recorded a trade
shortfall of  $1.5 billion  in July, from $1.3 billion the
previous month, according to the median estimate of 17
economists in a Bloomberg survey ahead of data due Sept. 3.  “The market is bearish on Indonesian bonds,” said
Artanavaro Gasali, the head of global markets at PT Bank ICBC
Indonesia. “Continuing deficits will shrink market confidence,
which will trigger significant capital outflows.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed 56 basis points in August, or 0.56 percentage point, to
6.28 percent, closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield reached 6.29 percent yesterday, the
highest since June 20, and rose 27 basis points this year and
two basis points today.  The rupiah is the worst performer among  Asia ’s 11 most-
traded currencies for the month and year, declining 1 percent in
August and 5.2 percent in 2012, prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg show. The currency gained 0.4 percent today to
9,535 per dollar as of 4:17 p.m. in Jakarta.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 25 basis points this month,
or 0.25 percentage point, to 7.25 percent. The gauge was
unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
