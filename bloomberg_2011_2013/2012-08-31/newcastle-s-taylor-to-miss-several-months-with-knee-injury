Newcastle United defender Ryan
Taylor will miss “several” months with a knee injury, the
Premier League soccer club said on its website.  Taylor, 28, landed awkwardly leaping over a tackle in last
night’s 1-0 Europa League qualifier against Atromitos and was
immediately substituted. A scan today revealed “a serious
injury which will sideline him for months rather than weeks,”
Newcastle said, without giving specific details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
