Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  issued an emergency fix
today for vulnerabilities in its Java software about four months
after it was warned about the bugs.  The delay in providing a fix allowed more than 100,000
computers to get hacked, FireEye Inc. estimated, Bloomberg.com
reported on its Tech Blog.  “Oracle is one of the big vendors that really takes a long
time to react,” Rodrigo Rubira Branco, director of
vulnerability and malware research for  Qualys Inc. (QLYS) , said in an
interview yesterday.  Oracle’s legacy of working mostly inside large
corporations, and on databases that often are offline and more
protected from the Internet’s myriad threats, is colliding with
Java’s widespread presence on the Web, Branco said.  “I’m hoping that what’s happening with Java now will force
them to finally change,” Branco said.  Deborah Hellinger , a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to
comment.  Oracle is the latest technology company to draw criticism
for delays in repairing known security weaknesses in its
products. When more than 600,000 Macs were  compromised  in April,
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was criticized for knowing about the underlying bugs
but taking two months to issue a fix. The gap allowed the first
mass attacks on Apple products to spread. Those issues were also
in Java, the ubiquitous software that’s managed by Oracle and is
installed on billions of computers and mobile phones worldwide.  Emergency Patch  Oracle’s emergency  “patch”  may slow the threat but not
stop it entirely. Users’ general inconsistency in updating their
machines is a common reason why new attacks often exploit older
bugs.  Only the latest version of Java -- Java 7 -- was affected
in the latest attacks, according to Adam Gowdiak, chief
executive officer of Security Explorations. While only Windows
machines were being attacked, the other big operating systems --
Solaris, Linux, even Apple’s Mac OS -- were also vulnerable if
users have Java 7 installed, he wrote in an e-mail.  Security Explorations had warned Oracle about the Java
vulnerability. The emergency patch is a “good sign for the
future” that Oracle is open to faster releases of security
fixes, Gowdiak said.  -- Editors: Marcus Chan, Reed Stevenson  To contact the reporter on this story:
