The ruble strengthened for the first
time in four days as  Brent crude  climbed and U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said he wouldn’t rule out more
stimulus.  The ruble appreciated 0.7 percent to 32.3500 against the
dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow, paring its depreciation this month
to 0.6 percent. The Russian currency gained 0.2 percent versus
the euro to 40.6800 today and appreciated 0.4 percent against
the central bank’s currency basket.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, rose for a second day,
gaining 1 percent to $113.75 a barrel by the close of Moscow
currency trading. Bernanke said additional asset purchases are
an option as policy makers consider further steps to bring down
the  unemployment rate .  “Given that markets got nothing new in terms of Fed action
details, we don’t see reasons why the ruble should rise or fall
substantially unless oil turns really south,” Dmitry Polevoy, a
Moscow-based economist at ING Groep NV, said by e-mail.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 222, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An  index  of five-year
domestic government bond yields compiled by Micex fell four
basis points to 7.55 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
