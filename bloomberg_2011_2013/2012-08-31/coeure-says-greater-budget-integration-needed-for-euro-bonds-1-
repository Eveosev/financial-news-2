European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said euro-area governments need more
integration to pave the way for jointly sold bonds.  “Budget responsibility is essential,” Coeure said today
at a conference near Paris. “More solidarity but also more
mutual control of member states” is necessary and “that will
allow one day to issue euro bonds,” he said.  The remarks to French business leaders emphasize the ECB’s
long-term vision for the euro and the tasks facing governments
as they seek to end a financial crisis that has weighed on the
region’s economy for almost three years. In the short term, the
Frankfurt-based central bank is working on a bond-buying program
that will only be implemented to help governments under
“strict” conditions, Coeure said.  “The ECB will do everything possible within its mandate to
preserve the integrity of the euro,” Coeure said.  The need to end the crisis is urgent because the
integration of  Europe ’s capital markets that occurred over years
has begun to reverse, he said.  “Money isn’t flowing any more from Helsinki, from Munich
to Milan” as markets are fragmenting, he said. “Today we have
the euro but no more a single  capital market .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
