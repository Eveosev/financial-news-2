Crown Paints Kenya Ltd. (CRBG) , the
country’s fourth-best performing stock this year, fell the most
in more than a month as investors took gains, Canaan Capital
Ltd. said.  Shares in  Kenya ’s only publicly traded paint manufacturer
declined 2.1 percent to 35.25 shillings by the close in the
capital, Nairobi, the biggest drop since July 27.  “There is some profit taking because the company has done
really well and it is trading just below its all-time high,”
Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital,
said in a phone interview today.  The stock has rallied 72 percent since the beginning of
this year, more than double the 27 percent gain on the Nairobi
Securities Exchange All-Share Index during the same period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income in the six months through June jumped to 76.5
million shillings ($907,000) from 45.9 million shillings a year
earlier, the company said Aug. 28. Sales climbed 17 percent to
2.1 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
