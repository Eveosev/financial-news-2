World coffee exports jumped 18
percent in July, the  International Coffee Organization  said.  Shipments increased to 9.11 million bags from 7.73 million
a year earlier, the London-based group said today on its
website. The total in the 10 months ended July 31 rose 1.5
percent to 90.4 million bags.  Exports of arabica beans climbed 15 percent in July to 5.35
million bags from a year earlier, and shipments of robusta
coffee increased 22 percent to 3.76 million, the  figures  show. A
bag weight 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Arabica is grown mainly in  Latin America  and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta, used in
instant coffee, is harvested mostly in Asia and parts of  Africa .  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica futures for
December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1.6435 a pound at 1:32
p.m. This year, the price has slumped 28 percent, the biggest
drop among 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poorâ€™s GSCI Spot
Index.  Robusta futures for November delivery gained 0.6 percent to
settle at $2,077 a metric ton on the NYSE Liffe exchange in
London. The price has gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
