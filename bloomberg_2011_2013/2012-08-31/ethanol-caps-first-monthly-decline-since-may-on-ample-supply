Ethanol capped its first monthly
decline since May as ample stockpiles and increased imports
pressure prices.  Futures slumped for the seventh time in eight days after
the U.S. Energy Department reported this week that  stockpiles 
were unchanged last week at 18.5 million barrels and while
 production  dropped 0.5 percent to 819,000 barrels a day. Imports
averaged 22,000 barrels a day, up from none a year earlier.  “We were surprised that we were unchanged in stocks with
production actually down,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 3.4 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $2.553 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade today, the lowest price since July 26. Futures dropped
2.9 percent this month and have gained 16 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.635 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.725, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. Ethanol increased 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.665 a gallon in  New York  and fell 0.5 cent to
$2.575 in Chicago.  Corn for December delivery sank 8.75 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $7.9975 a bushel in  Chicago . The grain also had the first
monthly drop since May. U.S. ethanol is made from corn.  Producers are losing 37 cents a gallon making ethanol from
corn based on September contracts. A bushel yields about 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
