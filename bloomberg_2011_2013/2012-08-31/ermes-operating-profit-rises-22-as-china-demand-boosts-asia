Hermes International SCA (RMS) , the French
maker of silk scarves and  leather goods , raised this year’s
sales-growth target after first-half earnings beat estimates on
Asian demand for luxury products.  The maker of Birkin and Kelly bags’ annual sales growth
excluding currency shifts “could be around 12 percent,” it
said today in a statement. The Paris-based company  last month 
said it targeted annual revenue growth of 10 percent.  Hermes, in which  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  owns a
22.3 percent  stake , is seeking to tap growing demand for  luxury
goods  in  Asia , where wealthy clients continue to increase
spending on items such as Birkin bags. Sales in the region,
other than Japan, rose 25 percent in the half-year, led by
China, Singapore and  Hong Kong , the company said.  The report was “good and reassuring,” said Thomas Mesmin,
an analyst at Cheuvreux in Paris. A 0.1 percentage point
improvement in the operating profit margin to 32.1 percent of
sales was “a very strong performance,” Mesmin said in a note.  Hermes rose as much as 4.1 percent in Paris trading and was
up 2.1 percent at 228.45 euros as of 9:36 a.m. The gain erased
the  stock ’s decline this year, which had followed  surges  of 47
percent in 2011 and 68 percent in 2010.  China Boom  Hermes got about 47 percent of sales from Asia in the
second quarter, compared with 35 percent from Europe and 16
percent from the Americas. Sales of discretionary goods in  China 
will grow by a compounded annual rate of 13.4 percent between
2010 and 2020 to reach $1.88 trillion as shoppers in the world’s
second-largest economy become more affluent, according to data
in a McKinsey & Co. report in March.  Hermes last month reported second-quarter sales rose 22
percent to 814.5 million euros ($1.02 billion), exceeding the
799.3 million-euro average of three analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Operating margin for the year should be between that
achieved in 2010 and 2011, the company said today.  Operating income climbed to 510.9 million euros from 418.1
million euros a year earlier, higher than the 502 million-euro
 average  of three analysts’ estimates. Net income gained 15
percent to 335.1 million euros, beating the 320.7 million-euro
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
