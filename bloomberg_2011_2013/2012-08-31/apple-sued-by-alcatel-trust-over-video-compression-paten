Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was sued by a trust
associated with France’s Alcatel-Lucent SA over accusations it
infringed a patent for video-compression technology.  “Apple’s products, including but not limited to the iPhone
4S, iPad 2 and the ‘new iPad’ by virtue of the manner in which
they encode video, infringe one or more claims” of the patent,
Multimedia Patent Trust said in a complaint filed Aug. 29 in
federal court in San Diego.  The trust seeks unspecified damages and a court order
stopping the alleged infringement.  Alcatel-Lucent, based in Paris, set up the patent trust on
Nov. 28, 2006, two days before Alcatel’s purchase of Lucent
Technologies Inc. The trust previously sued  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and
 DirecTV (DTV) , among other companies, over video-compression patents.
Apple is also a defendant in a separate infringement case
brought in 2010 by Multimedia Patent Trust in  San Diego .  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Multimedia Patent Trust v. Apple, 12-02135,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San
Diego.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
