Stephan Goetzl, president of
cooperative banks in the German state of Bavaria, said he
rejects plans by European Union Financial Services Commissioner
 Michel Barnier  to subject cooperative lenders to supervision by
the  European Central Bank .  Barnier’s plans are driven by power considerations and come
amid calls in  Europe  to damp Germany’s economic expansion,
Goetzl said. It would be “fatal” to allow control over
cooperative banks, which finance Germany’s medium-sized
businesses, he said in an e-mailed statement.  “Whoever submits regional banks such as cooperative banks
to a diktat by the ECB, surrenders the sovereignty over the
financing of medium-sized companies,” Goetzl said. There is
also “no reason” to follow Barnier’s proposal to mutualize
deposit guarantee funds, he said.  Barnier wants the ECB to oversee rescued lenders starting
on Jan. 1, 2013, supervise all so-called systemically important
banks in the 17-nation euro area from July 1, 2013 and supervise
all euro area banks beginning Jan. 1, 2014, Stefaan De Rynck, a
spokesman for Barnier, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
