The  New York  Jets scored their first
and only touchdown of the National Football League’s preseason
in a 28-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.  With most of their starters sitting out last night’s game
in Philadelphia, the Jets ended their touchdown drought as
third-string quarterback  Greg McElroy  threw a second-quarter
scoring pass to Terrance Ganaway.  The Jets, who were the first NFL team to fail to score a
touchdown in their first three preseason games since the 1977
Atlanta Falcons, open their regular-season schedule on Sept. 9
at home against the Buffalo Bills. New York had an 0-4 preseason
record for the first time since 1993.  The Eagles, unbeaten in the preseason for the first time
since 1995, travel to the  Cleveland Browns  in their Sept. 9
opener.  To contact the reporter on this story:
