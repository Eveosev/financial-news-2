India ’s rupee headed for a weekly
loss as government data showed Asia’s third-largest economy
expanded at near the slowest pace in three years.  Gross domestic product  increased 5.5 percent last quarter,
the Central Statistical Office said in a statement today. That
compares with 5.3 percent in the previous three months, which
was the slowest pace since March 2009. A deteriorating outlook
for the economy may curb tax collections and put at risk the
government’s goal of cutting its  budget deficit , the  Reserve
Bank  of India said on Aug. 23.  “Weak growth, coupled with possible fiscal slippage and
inaction from the RBI, is not the combination of settings
investors would like to see,” analysts at Credit Agricole CIB,
including Hong Kong-based  Frances Cheung , wrote in a research
report today. “The rupee is to be kept under pressure.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent this week to 55.675 per
dollar as of 12:30 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.1 percent today, matching the
monthly loss. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
9.80 percent, the lowest level since May 3. The gauge has fallen
140 basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, this month.  Riskier assets will decline ahead of Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s speech at a meeting of central
bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming today, according to  Credit
Agricole . India’s government plans to narrow its budget
shortfall to 5.1 percent of GDP in the year through March 2013,
from 5.8 percent in the previous 12 months.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.72 per
dollar, compared with 56.63 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.67 from 56.59. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
