NextWave Wireless Inc. (WAVE) , the wireless
technology provider, was sued by a shareholder who contends
AT&T’s $600 million takeover offer undervalues the company’s
shares.  The shareholder, Burt Weiss, said in a filing today in
Delaware Chancery Court that  directors  have a duty to get the
best price for the shares and instead agreed to sell the company
at an initial $1 a share, with possible further contingent
payments, without conducting an auction or other market-check.  The deal is also unfairly designed to “cure the massive
debt owed by the company to several of its officers and
directors,” including senior and subordinated note-payoffs,
“lucrative severance payments” and vested  stock options ,
according to the lawsuit, filed in Wilmington.  The companies said Aug. 2 that Dallas-based AT&T would buy
San Diego-based NextWave to add more network capacity for
services such as mobile  Internet access .  Jeff Seedman, a spokesman for NextWave at Finn Partners in
 San Francisco , said the company had no comment on the suit.  The complaint alleges that common stockholders were
originally slated to get $6 a share, later reduced to $1, and
that if the deal is consummated, some NextWave executives may
receive cash incentive awards of $1 million each or more.  NextWave rose 1 cent to $1.31 in over-the-counter trading
at 1:51 p.m. in  New York .  Weiss is asking a judge to block the transaction under its
present terms and to award damages to investors.  The case is Weiss v. NextWave, CA7821, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
