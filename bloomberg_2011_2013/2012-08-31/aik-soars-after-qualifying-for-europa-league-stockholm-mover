AIK Fotboll AB (AIKB)  rose the most in a
year after the Swedish club recovered from a 1-0 first-leg loss
to CSKA Moscow to win 2-0 in Russia yesterday in the return
match, advancing to the group stage of the UEFA Europa League.  AIK are guaranteed 1.3 million euros ($1.6 million) from
UEFA for reaching the group competition and can expect at least
25 million kronor ($3.7 million) in total proceeds from
yesterday’s 2-1 aggregate victory in Moscow, according to an
estimate by newspaper  Svenska Dagbladet .  The stock was up 20 percent  to 2.12 kronor at 10:00 a.m.
local time, the biggest gain since Aug. 12, 2011.  AIK, based in Solna, a suburb of Stockholm, ranks as 202 on
UEFA’s ranking of European clubs, while  CSKA Moscow , the 2005
UEFA Cup Champion, is ranked 18. AIK made a first-half loss of
10.1 million kronor, it said on Aug. 15, compared with a 6.9
million krona loss a year earlier.  The 48-team group stage draw will take place at 1 p.m. in
Monaco today where 31 playoff winners join the seven automatic
qualifiers, including defending champion Atletico Madrid and
Tottenham, and the 10 playoff losers from the elite  Champions
League .  To contact the reporter on this story:
