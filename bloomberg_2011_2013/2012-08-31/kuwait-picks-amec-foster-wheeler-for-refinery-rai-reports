Kuwait picked  Amec Plc (AMEC)  and  Foster
Wheeler AG (FWLT)  as consultants on its 4-billion dinar ($14.2 billion)
refinery,  Al-Rai  newspaper reported, citing unidentified
officials.  The two companies, which will also provide consulting
services to a $4.6 billion clean-fuel project that will boost
the capacity of existing refineries, were selected from nine
bidders, the newspaper said.  Kuwait National Petroleum Corp., the state-run refiner,
plans to issue more tenders for the projects in three months, as
work on the 615,000 barrel-a-day Al-Zour facility proceeds, Al-
Rai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
