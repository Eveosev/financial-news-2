Bryce Harper hit a home run and
drove in three runs as the Washington Nationals defeated the St.
Louis Cardinals 8-1.  Edwin Jackson  improved his record to 8-9 as he struck out
10 batters in eight innings and allowed one run on four hits for
the home team at Nationals Park in Washington last night.  Harper hit a two-run homer in the first inning and a run-
scoring single in the sixth to give Washington a 6-0 lead. Jesus Flores added a two-run single in the seventh to cap the scoring
for the Nationals, who have won two straight games following a
five-game losing streak.  The Nationals improved to 79-51 to lead the National League
East Division by 5 1/2 games over the  Atlanta Braves . Washington
is tied with the  Cincinnati Reds  (80-52) for the best record in
 Major League Baseball .  The Baltimore Orioles (72-58) defeated the American League
Central Division-leading Chicago White Sox 5-3 to move within
three games of the idle New York Yankees (75-55) in the AL East.
The Orioles and Yankees begin a three-game series today at
Yankee Stadium.  The Orioles and  Oakland Athletics  (73-57) who beat the
Cleveland Indians 12-7 last night, are currently in position for
the AL’s two wild card playoff spots.  The Braves (74-57) and Cardinals (71-60) remain atop the
NL’s wild card standings, with St. Louis a half-game ahead of
the Pittsburgh Pirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
