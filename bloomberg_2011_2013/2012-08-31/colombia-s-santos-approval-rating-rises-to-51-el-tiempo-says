Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos ’s approval rating rose to 51 percent this month from 48
percent in June after the press reported he has agreed to start
peace talks with the country’s biggest rebel group, according to
a poll by Gallup  Colombia  published in  El Tiempo  newspaper.  Among those surveyed, 60 percent said they would prefer a
dialogue with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, over attacks by the armed forces to end the country’s 50-
year civil war, according to the Bogota-based daily.  Gallup interviewed 1,200 people in Colombia’s five biggest
cities from Aug. 25 to Aug. 29. The poll has a margin of error
of plus or minus three percentage points, El Tiempo said. On
Aug. 28, Santos confirmed he will start talks with the FARC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
