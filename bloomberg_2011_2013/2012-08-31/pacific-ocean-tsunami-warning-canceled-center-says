The tsunami warning issued after a
magnitude-7.6 earthquake hit off the coast of the  Philippines 
has been canceled, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center.  Waves measuring as high as 16 centimeters (6 inches) were
reported in Surigao City, the Philippines chief volcanologist,
Renato Solidum, said on dzMM radio.   The first tsunami waves did not hit Samar province and
Siargao Island as expected at around 9:32 p.m., Solidum said.
The Philippines ordered evacuation in six provinces after the
quake and subsequent tsunami alert.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
