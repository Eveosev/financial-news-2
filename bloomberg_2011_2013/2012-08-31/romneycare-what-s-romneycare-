Kerry Healey, who served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts under  Mitt Romney , just gave a passionate speech about Romney’s accomplishments as governor. Healey (for whom I interned when she ran for lieutenant governor) presented an impressive list: Romney built a great cabinet full of talented people, half of whom were women. He closed the state’s budget gap and ran up a large rainy day fund. He improved education, cut taxes, presided over low unemployment and got the state a credit upgrade. He served breakfast to veterans, declined his gubernatorial salary, and ably handled a crisis when the ceiling of a highway tunnel collapsed in  Boston . This is a pretty accurate summary of Romney’s service as governor that does not omit any of his major accomplishments or policy initiatives. Right?
