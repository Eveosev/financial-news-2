Switzerland ’s attorney general
opened a criminal probe of  UBS AG (UBSN)  after a complaint filed by
Bruno Manser Fund, a rain-forest advocacy group, that alleged a
Malaysian politician used UBS accounts to launder money.  The investigation was opened on Aug. 29, Jeannette Balmer,
a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said in an e-mail today.
She declined to provide any details of the probe.  The case concerns suspected money-laundering of timber
corruption proceeds from the Malaysian state of Sabah in Borneo,
Bruno Manser Fund said on its  website  today. Switzerland’s anti-
money-laundering legislation makes it a criminal offense for
Swiss companies to be involved in laundering the proceeds of
corruption and other crimes in their worldwide activities, Bruno
Manser Fund said.  UBS will cooperate with the investigation, the Zurich-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement. The bank has reported
possible money-laundering activities in this case in different
countries over several years and was never itself part of
investigations by anti-money-laundering authorities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
