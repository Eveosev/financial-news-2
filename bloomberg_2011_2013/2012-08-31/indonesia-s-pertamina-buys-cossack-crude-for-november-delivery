PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-
owned oil company, bought 600,000 barrels of Australia’s Cossack
crude for delivery in November to its Cilacap refinery,
according to a company official who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  The company is still negotiating the purchase of a second
low-sulfur crude cargo for November, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
