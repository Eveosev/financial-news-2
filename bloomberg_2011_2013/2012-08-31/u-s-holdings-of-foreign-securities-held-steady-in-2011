U.S. holdings of foreign securities
were little changed at the end of 2011 from a year earlier, with
the largest investments made in debt and equities from the U.K.,
Canada, Cayman Islands and Japan.  Total holdings were $6.84 trillion on Dec. 31, compared
with $6.76 trillion at the end of 2010, according to preliminary
data released by the Treasury Department in a statement today.  The survey is taken by the Treasury, the  Federal Reserve 
and the  New York  Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
