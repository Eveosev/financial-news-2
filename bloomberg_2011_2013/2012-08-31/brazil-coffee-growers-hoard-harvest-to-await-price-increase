Coffee farmers in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s largest grower, are hoarding part of their production to
wait for price increases, an association of coffee growers said
today.  The producers are speeding up the harvest, which is 75%
complete, to finish before the raining season starts in
September, said the National Coffee Council in an e-mailed
report.  Coffee prices will likely rise in the next months, the
group known as CNC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
