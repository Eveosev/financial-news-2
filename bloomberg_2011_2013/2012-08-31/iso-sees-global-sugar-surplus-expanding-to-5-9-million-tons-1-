The global sugar surplus will expand
13 percent in the 2012-13 season that starts in October in most
countries from the same period a year earlier, according to the
 International Sugar Organization  in  London .  Sugar supplies will be 5.9 million metric tons higher than
demand, up from a surplus forecast of 5.2 million tons in 2011-
12, the group said in its first estimate for the new season.
Global production will climb by 3.9 million tons to a record
177.4 million tons, while consumption will grow 1.9 percent,
below the 10-year average of 2.4 percent, to 171.5 million tons,
the ISO said in a quarterly report e-mailed today.  “In contrast to the previous year, when a new global
production record was achieved despite a significant decrease in
sugar output in Brazil, in 2012-13 a record high global total
can be firmly attributed to a noteworthy recovery projected for
the world’s leading producer,” the ISO said.  Sugar production in  Brazil  will rise 3.9 million tons to
38.1 million tons in 2012-13 and will remain below the 2009-10
record of 40.9 million tons, the ISO said. In  Australia , the
third-biggest exporter, production will increase to 4.5 million
tons from 4 million tons a year earlier, according to the
report. Output in  China , the second biggest consumer, will rise
to 13.6 million tons from 12.5 million tons in 2011-12.  “Remunerative cane and beet prices led to a significant
rise in the area under cultivation in recent years,” the ISO
said, commenting on China.  Production in  India , the second-biggest producer, will drop
to 26.6 million tons from 28 million tons in 2011-12 because of
dry weather. In  Thailand , output will fall to 10.2 million tons
from 10.6 million tons this season, the ISO said.  Sugar prices have fallen 15 percent so far this year and a
global surplus will “keep world prices under pressure,” the
ISO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
