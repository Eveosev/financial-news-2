Citigroup Inc. (C)  will let customers
challenge the suspension of home-equity loans and provide $120
apiece to some ex-borrowers whose credit lines were cut, under
the settlement of a lawsuit challenging its practices.  The accord, disclosed today in documents filed in federal
court in  San Francisco , resolves a class action, or group
lawsuit, that accused the bank of improperly suspending or
reducing home-equity lines of credit for several hundred
thousand customers.  Citigroup’s Citibank unit will improve its suspension
notices and restore some customers’ access to home-equity
accounts under the agreement, according to the filing.  Borrowers who closed their accounts and were charged a fee
are eligible for $120 each under the agreement. The filing
doesn’t say how many borrowers that covers. New York-based
Citibank agreed to pay $1.2 million to the customers’ lawyers.  The settlement requires court approval, and customers
seeking the $120 payment will need to submit claims. Customers
whose accounts were suspended or reduced by Citibank based on
their property value from 2008 through January are eligible for
settlement benefits.  Citibank denied wrongdoing, according to the court filing
by the customers’ lawyers.  Mark Rodgers , a bank spokesman,
declined in an e-mail to comment immediately on the agreement.  The case is In Re Citibank Heloc Reduction Litigation,
3:09-cv-00350, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
