Filasa International, a French
privately-held company, plans to invest in solar plants in
 Romania  after it started developing several wind parks in the
country , Ziarul Financiar  reported.  Filasa, which plans to invest about 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) in wind parks in the northern county of Suceava, also
seeks to develop about 300 megawatts of power from solar plants,
the Bucharest-based newspaper said, citing Bernard Esquirol, the
company’s chief executive officer.  Filasa’s wind parks in Suceava will have a total capacity
of about 516 megawatts and produce at full capacity in 2017,
according to Ziarul Financiar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
