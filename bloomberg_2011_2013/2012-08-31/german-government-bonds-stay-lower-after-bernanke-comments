German 10-year bunds stayed lower
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he
wouldn’t rule out further bond purchases to boost growth and
reduce unemployment, which he called a “grave concern.”  The nation’s 10-year yield was five basis points higher at
1.37 percent as of 3:09 p.m. London time. The five-year  rate  was
also five basis points higher at 0.37 percent.  Bernanke was speaking today in a speech to central bankers
and economists at an annual forum in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
