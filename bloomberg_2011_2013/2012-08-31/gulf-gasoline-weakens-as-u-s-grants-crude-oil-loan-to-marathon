Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as the
U.S. Energy Department approved a 1 million-barrel loan of crude
oil to Marathon Petroleum Corp. to address shortages caused by
Hurricane Isaac.  The loan of sweet crude oil will be returned within three
months, plus premium barrels, which is similar to interest, the
department said in a statement. Marathon can resume normal
refining operations after running at reduced rates, Shane Pochard, a Findlay, Ohio-based spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline Gulf Coast
dropped 5.5 cents to 8.5 cents versus October futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:55 p.m. East Coast time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
0.33 cent to $3.0512 a gallon.  The oil loan, which is not a release, will be provided from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve’s Bayou Choctaw site in
 Louisiana .  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, strengthened 2.25
cents to a premium of 1.5 cents versus futures.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is increasing rates at its Memphis
refinery after receiving a crude oil shipment from  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s reopened Capline pipeline, two people with direct
knowledge of operations said.  The Memphis plant, which had run at minimum levels since
the pipeline shut Aug. 26 because of Isaac, is moving toward
planned rates today, the people said. The 195,000-barrel-a-day
plant runs primarily light, sweet oil delivered by the pipeline,
according to Valero’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
