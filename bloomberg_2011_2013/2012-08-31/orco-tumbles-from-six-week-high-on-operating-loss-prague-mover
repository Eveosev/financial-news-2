Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)  dropped from
its highest in more than six weeks as the developer in central
 Europe  said it swung to an operating loss and revenue shrank.  The stock fell 3.1 percent to 51.51 koruna at the close in
Prague, making it the biggest decliner today in the PX index.
Orco rallied 5.3 percent in the previous five days to the
strongest since July 17.  Orco had a first-half operating loss of 9 million euros
($11 million), compared with income of 18.9 million euros a year
earlier, the company said in a statement late yesterday. Revenue
dropped to 69.5 million euros from 73.6 million euros.  “The operating result came in significantly worse than we
had expected, partly because of losses from asset revaluation,”
