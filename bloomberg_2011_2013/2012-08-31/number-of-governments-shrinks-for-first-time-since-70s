As a debate rages in  Washington  over
the growth of federal power, the nation’s local governments have
halted their upward spiral for the first time in four decades.  The number of governmental units, ranging from county seats
to special-utility districts, fell to 89,004 in 2012, a 0.5
percent decrease from the 89,476 counted five years ago. The
decline marks the first drop in the number of local governments
since 1972, according to preliminary results released yesterday
by the  U.S. Census Bureau .  “This is likely a reflection of fiscal realities,” said
Joseph Stefko, president and chief executive officer of the
Rochester, New York-based Center for Governmental Research.
“We’re seeing more belt-tightening across the country. I don’t
see any political or ideological driver for these trends.”  Between 2007 and 2012, local government employment shrank
by more than 300,000 people, or 2.2 percent, more than four
times faster than the reduction in the number of governments,
Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show. Between 2002 and 2007,
the number of governments grew 2.2 percent, according to the
Census Bureau. During the same period, BLS figures show local
government employment grew by 4.6 percent.  “It’s a modest decline, but still a halt in the expansion
of government,” said James M. McCormick, chairman of the Iowa
State University political science department. “This is most
likely a reflection of the economic pressures faced by local
governments.”  Maryland Leads  Republicans have assailed President  Barack Obama  for
expanding the federal government’s reach. When Representative
 Paul Ryan  accepted the party’s vice presidential nomination in
Tampa, Florida, on Aug. 29, he said, “The choice is whether to
put hard limits on economic growth, or hard limits on the size
of government, and we choose to limit government.”  The Census Bureau reported that 16 states increased the
number of governments in the last five years. Leading the nation
was Maryland, where government entities grew 35.5 percent to 347.
Most of the state’s local government growth occurred in
“special-purpose” districts that are responsible for functions
such as libraries, parks, hospitals or utilities.  In Ryan’s home state of  Wisconsin , where debate has raged
for the past year over Governor  Scott Walker ’s curbs on the
collective-bargaining abilities of public-employee unions, the
number of local governments grew to 3,123, up 0.1 percent from
the 3,120 in 2007.  D.C. Holds Line  The number of entities in  California , which had faced a $16
billion state budget deficit, also grew 0.1 percent. The
nation’s most-populous state added six local governments,
increasing the total to 4,350.  New York governments increased to 3,454, a 1.5 percent
increase from the 2007 tally of 3,403.  Four states and the  District of Columbia  reported no change
during the last five years in the number of local governments,
including Rhode Island. Employment there has fallen .5 percent
in the past year, more than any other state besides Wisconsin,
according to the Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of States.  The remaining states cut the number of local entities.
 Illinois , which has had the largest number of governmental units
in the nation since 1962, dropped 26 governments, falling 0.4
percent to 6,968.  Fewer Princetons  New Jersey  residents got rid of 2.8 percent of their
governments, including the merger of two towns that shared the
Princeton name with the Ivy League university. Princeton Borough
and the surrounding Princeton Township voted to combine after at
least three earlier consolidation attempts.  Support for the consolidation, the first in New Jersey
since 1997, was boosted when Republican Governor  Chris Christie 
offered state funds to cover 20 percent of the $1.7 million cost.  The largest reductions occurred in  Indiana , where the
number of local governments fell 16.6 percent to 2,694
governments. Leah McGrath, a spokeswoman for the Indianapolis-
based  Indiana Association of Cities and Towns , said the decline
most likely is related to a 2010 constitutional amendment that
capped property taxes.  Hoosiers eliminated 537 government entities between 2007
and 2012, more than the 472 net reduction for the entire U.S.
Special-purpose units in Indiana bore the brunt of the
reductions, falling to 737 governments, 42 percent less than the
1,272 that existed in 2007, census figures show.  “You’ve seen a lot of taxing districts change,” McGrath
said. “You’ve seen a lot more consolidation, ranging from
library to school districts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
