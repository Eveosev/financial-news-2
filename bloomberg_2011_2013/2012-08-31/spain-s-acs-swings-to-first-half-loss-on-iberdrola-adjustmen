Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA ,  Spain ’s biggest construction company, reported a
first-half loss after it sold part of its stake in  Iberdrola SA (IBE) 
and adjusted the value of the remaining holding.  The net loss was 1.23 billion euros ($1.54 billion)
compared with profit of 604 million euros a year earlier, the
Madrid-based company said in a statement today. Sales doubled to
18.83 billion euros from a year earlier, boosted by the
acquisition of a stake in  Hochtief AG (HOT) , a German builder.
Including that stake in the year-earlier period, revenue rose 6
percent.  The builder had a 599 million-euro loss from the sale of a
3.69 percent stake in Iberdrola in April, and ACS also took a
962 million-euro charge to adjust the value of its remaining
14.85 percent stake. ACS also provisioned 302 million euros for
potential losses related to the refinancing of Iberdrola
investments.  ACS shares  fell  as much as 2.9 percent and traded 1 percent
lower at 15.50 euros as of 9:47 a.m. in Madrid trading, valuing
the company at 4.9 billion euros.  Net debt at the end of June was 8.58 billion euros, 13
percent lower than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
