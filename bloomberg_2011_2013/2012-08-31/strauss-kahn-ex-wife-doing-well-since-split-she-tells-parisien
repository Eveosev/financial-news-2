Anne Sinclair said she is “doing
very well” since separating from  Dominique Strauss-Kahn ,
according to  Le Parisien  today, citing an interview with her.  Strauss-Kahn was managing director of the International
Monetary Fund until last year, when he resigned to defend
himself against sexual assault charges in New York. The criminal
case was later dropped and the alleged victim is pursuing a
civil lawsuit against him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
