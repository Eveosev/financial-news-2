Serbia will limit wages of managers
in state-run companies, streamline dozens of government agencies
and tighten control over their spending, even for institutions
that have their own source of income.  The measures are part of a “fiscal consolidation” that
will include a supplementary budget for 2012 set for adoption by
Sept. 15, Deputy Finance Minister Vlajko Senic told reporters in
Belgrade today. There won’t be immediate job cuts in the
administration while a review of all agencies is conducted to
determine which will be merged with ministries to reduce costs,
he said.  “All the revenue will be centralized” under the  Finance
Ministry , even for government bodies that are partly funded by
charging for services, Senic said.  Serbia is trying to reduce a budget gap that reached 7.2
percent of gross domestic product at the end of June, even as
the economy fell into recession in the first half. A $1.3
billion loan program with the  International Monetary Fund  was
suspended in February over failure to meet fiscal targets.  The government also plans to increase value-added tax while
lifting more than a hundred levies to help small- and medium-
sized businesses, Senic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
