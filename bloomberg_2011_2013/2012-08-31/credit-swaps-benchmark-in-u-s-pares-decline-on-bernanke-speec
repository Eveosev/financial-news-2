A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk pared a decline as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said he wouldnâ€™t rule out further bond purchases to
boost economic growth.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
rose to a mid-price of 102.1 basis points at 10:24 a.m. in  New
York , after earlier falling to as low as 100.8 basis points.  The measure, which typically drops as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, is down from 102.9 basis
points yesterday.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
