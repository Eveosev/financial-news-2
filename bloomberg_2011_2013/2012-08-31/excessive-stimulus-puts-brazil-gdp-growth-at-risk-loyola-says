Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
excessive attempts to boost consumption are putting the economy
at risk of overheating, which would make growth less
sustainable, according to Gustavo Loyola, partner at Tendencias
Consultoria and former central bank president.  If the economy expands too quickly, the government will be
obliged to take measures to slow growth, said Loyola in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.4 percent in the second
quarter, the national statistics agency said today. That
compares with a median forecast of 0.5 percent growth in a
Bloomberg survey of 51 analysts.  “The growth is based on private consumption and government
spending, which are expanding much faster than supply,” said
Loyola.“The government needs to pay more attention to the
increase in investment or we will fall into a ’stop and go’
situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
