India ’s 10-year bonds fell the most
in two weeks as the government reported an unexpected pickup in
economic growth.  Gross domestic product rose 5.5 percent in the three months
through June from a year earlier, exceeding the 5.2 percent gain
estimated in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Asia’s
third-largest economy expanded 5.3 percent in the previous
 quarter .  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left
the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 8 percent for a
second meeting in July to curb inflation.  “The data has quelled any expectation of immediate
monetary easing,” said Killol Pandya, the Mumbai-based head of
fixed-income investments at the local unit of Daiwa Asset
Management Co. “The hawkish policy tone may continue.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.23 percent as
of 12:12 p.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It fell two basis points this month. The yield on
benchmark 10-year notes dropped 34 basis points this year.  The  Reserve Bank of India  last cut the repurchase rate by
50 basis points in April. The next policy review is scheduled
for Sept. 17.  Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on
Aug. 19 that  inflation  is currently the main threat to  India’s
economy . The consumer-price index rose 9.86 percent from a year
earlier in July, compared with a revised 9.93 percent gain in
June, the  Central Statistical Office  said this month.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points today to 7.81 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
