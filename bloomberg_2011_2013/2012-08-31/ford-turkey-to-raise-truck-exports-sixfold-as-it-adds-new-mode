Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) , the Turkish
van and truck maker co-owned by Ford Motor Co. and  Koc Holding
AS (KCHOL) , plans as much as a sixfold increase in truck exports to
6,000 vehicles by 2016, helped by a new heavy truck it will
start selling at the end of this year.  Ford Otosan, as the company is known, will produce 3,000
Cargo 1846T heavy trucks annually starting in 2013 at a plant in
Inonu in western Turkey with a $75 million investment, Chief
Executive Haydar Yenigun said in Istanbul.  The new model will help double Ford Otosan’s truck
production to 20,000 units annually eventually, Yenigun said.  Trucks will be exported to 65 countries, Yenigun said.
Ford’s share of  Turkey ’s truck market will probably rise to 25
percent this year from 22.8 percent last year, Yenigun said.  Ford Otomotiv exported 1,000 trucks in 2011. Ford also has
a van-making plant in Kocaeli, near Istanbul.  To contact the reporters on this story:
