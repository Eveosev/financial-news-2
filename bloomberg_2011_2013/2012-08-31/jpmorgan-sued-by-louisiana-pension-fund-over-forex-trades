JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was accused in
a lawsuit of manipulating clients’ foreign-exchange transactions
for its own benefit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System
filed a complaint yesterday in Manhattan federal court alleging
that the bank took advantage of investors by causing them to pay
what were often the worst currency rates available on a given
trading day.  “JPMorgan’s scheme allowed it, in violation of its
contractual and fiduciary obligations, to extract hundreds of
millions of dollars in illicit risk free profits from its
clients under the guise of FX trading,” according to the
complaint.  JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, recorded
more than $4 billion in foreign exchange revenue between 2005
and 2011, according to the complaint.  The pension fund, which is suing on behalf of other
institutional investors for which the New York-based bank
executed currency trades since 2005, is seeking damages,
punitive damages and disgorgement of profits.  A JPMorgan spokeswoman,  Jennifer Zuccarelli , didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’
Retirement System v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 12-cv-6659, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
