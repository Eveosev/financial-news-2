Stars ( Katie Holmes , Al Pacino) and
other bold-face names (Daddy Warbucks!) mingle with the
unfamiliar as Broadway and off-Broadway kick into post-Labor Day
high gear.  There’s a lot I’m looking forward to. Here’s a very
selective look at my list of must-sees through November.  “Chaplin.” Christopher Curtis and Thomas Meehan’s new
musical stars Rob McClure and follows the life of the Little Tramp from  London  poverty to Hollywood stardom. In previews now;
opening Sept. 10 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Information:
+1-212-239-6200;  http://www.telecharge.com .  “Glengarry Glen Ross.” Sure, it’s another revival of a
recently revived show, but David Mamet’s masterpiece about real
estate, the pecking order, and salesmanship after Willy Loman
has an unbeatable draw in  Al Pacino  in  Daniel Sullivan ’s
production. Begins performances Oct. 16 at the Gerald Schoenfeld
Theatre. Information: +1-212-239-6200;
 http://www.telecharge.com .  “Annie.” Katie Finneran, the dazzling lush from
“Promises, Promises,” plays deliciously nasty Miss Hannigan in
James Lapine’s revival of the “Tomorrow” musical. Begins
performances Oct. 3 at the Palace Theatre. Information: +1-877-

Theatre Club. (Information: +1-212-239-6200;

Beaumarchais comedy best known for Mozart’s opera -- brings back
the wily servant in a new adaptation by Charles Morey. It starts
Oct. 19 at the Pearl Theatre’s new 42nd Street home base.
(Information: +1-212-598-9802;  http://www.pearltheatre.org .)  “Giant,” the 1956 geyser of a film starring Liz Taylor,

recently, who cares, when the cast includes Amy Morton and

Tracy Letts? Begins performances Sept. 27 at the Booth Theatre.
