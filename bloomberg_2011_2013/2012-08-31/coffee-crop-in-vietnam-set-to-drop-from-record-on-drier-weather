Coffee production in  Vietnam , the
biggest grower of the robusta variety used in instant drinks and
espressos, is poised to decline from a record on drier weather
in the key growing region.  The harvest may fall 10 percent to 1.40 million metric tons
in the 2012-2013 season starting Oct 1, from an estimated all-
time high of 1.55 million tons, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of six traders and shippers. Rainfall in
the Buon Ma Thuot region this year to Aug. 20 was 28 percent
lower from a year earlier, according to the Dak Lak province’s
Meteorology and Hydrology Department.  A smaller crop could further narrow the spread between the
bitter-tasting beans and arabica used to make specialty drinks.
Roasters used more robusta in their blends to control prices as
arabica surged to a 14-year high in May 2011 after the smallest
Colombian crop since 1976 and reduced output in  Brazil . The 14
percent gain in robusta this year may increase costs for
companies such as  Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food maker.  “The weather in my area has been very dry,” which hurts
development of the beans, said Mai Ky Van, deputy director at
October Coffee Co., a producer in Dak Lak province. “That
combined with the two-year cycle, in which output often declines
after a  bumper crop , means production in the next harvest will
definitely drop.”  Growing Demand  Robusta futures ended at $2,064 a ton yesterday on NYSE
Liffe. Arabica has slumped 28 percent this year and settled at
$1.634 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Robusta’s
discount to arabica has shrunk to 70 cents a pound, from 145
cents at the end of 2011. The spread will contract to 55 cents
by the end of the year, the lowest since July 2009, as demand
increases to a record, the average of 10 trader estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Consumption may climb to 66.1 million bags in 2012-2013
from 62.6 million bags, according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. Usage was 54.8 million
bags in 2010-2011, data from the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader showed. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).
Inventories in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe in  London  have
fallen 66 percent from a record in July 11, 2011.  Vietnam may  ship  120,000 tons in August, according to
preliminary figures by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi,
more than triple the amount in the same period last year.
Exports in the first eight months were estimated at 1.28 million
tons, up 32 percent from a year earlier.  Rising Exports  “Looking at export figures, we can see that a lot of
coffee keeps coming out,” said Le Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based
deputy director of Sept. 2nd Import-Export Co. “The 2011-2012
crop is definitely larger than expected.”  Production in Vietnam will be about 25 million bags in the
season ending in September, said Dutch trader  Nedcoffee BV .  The 2012-2013 crop may decline 15 percent as flowers that
blossomed early dropped off trees, leaving no beans,  Luong Van Tu , chairman of the Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa Association, said in
June. Output for 2012-2013 was estimated at 1.3 million tons in
a Bloomberg survey published Aug. 6.  “There was little rain or no rain” in the 10 days through
Aug. 20 in most regions of the Dak Lak province, the Meteorology
and Hydrology Department said in a statement Aug. 21. The Buon
Ma Thuot area received a total of 743.5 millimeters since the
start of the year to Aug. 20, less than 1,028.1 millimeters in
the same period of 2011 and an average of 1,096.2 millimeters
over the past “many years,” according to the statement.  Robusta is harvested mainly in  Asia  and parts of  Africa ,
while arabica is grown in  Latin America  and is favored for
specialty drinks such as those made by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
