Italy’s inflation rate unexpectedly
declined in August as the deepening recession weighed on
consumer demand.  The inflation rate based on European Union measurements
dropped to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in July, Rome-
based national statistics office Istat said in a preliminary
report today. That was less than the median forecast of 3.6
percent by eight economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices
rose 0.2 percent from July, Istat said.  Based on Italian methodology, prices rose 0.4 percent from
the previous month and gained 3.2 percent from a year earlier,
Istat said today.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity drive has
contributed to pushing the economy into its fourth recession
since 2001. The government forecasts that the euro region’s
third-biggest economy will contract 1.2 percent this year, while
employers lobby Confindustria sees the economy shrinking by more
than twice that rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
