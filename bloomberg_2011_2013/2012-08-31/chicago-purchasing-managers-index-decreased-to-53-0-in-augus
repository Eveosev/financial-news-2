The Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc. said today its  business barometer  fell to 53.0 this
month from 53.7 in July. Figures greater than 50 signal
expansion. Economists forecast the gauge would drop to 53.2,
according to the  median  forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Estimates from the 58 economists surveyed ranged from 51.0
to 55.0.  Economists watch the Chicago index and other regional
manufacturing reports for an early reading on the national
outlook. The Chicago group says its membership includes both
manufacturers and service providers with operations in the U.S.
and abroad, making the gauge a measure of overall growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
