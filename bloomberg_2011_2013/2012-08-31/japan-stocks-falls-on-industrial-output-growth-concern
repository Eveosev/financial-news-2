Japan  stocks  fell a second day after
consumer prices data pointed to little progress in the fight
against deflation and industrial production unexpectedly dropped
amid concern about a deepening global slowdown.  Makita Corp. (6586)  fell 3.3 percent, pacing declines among
machinery makers. Ricoh Co., an office-equipment maker that
counts on the Americas and  Europe  for almost half its sales,
lost 3.8 percent after U.S. jobless claims rose and euro-area
confidence fell.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405)  slid as they widened loss forecasts ahead of
their merger.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  plunged 13 percent after Foxconn
Technology Group’s chairman left Japan without finalizing a deal
to invest in the loss-making electronics company.  “Japan’s industrial production data is very bad,” said
Koichi Kurose, chief economist in  Tokyo  at Resona Bank Ltd.,
which oversees the equivalent of $76 billion. “The economy will
slow down with domestic demand falling as the government’s eco-
car program and other measures wind down, while overseas demand
is deteriorating.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  declined 1.6 percent to
8,839.91 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with volume 6.4 percent
above the 30-day average. The gauge fell 2.5 percent this week,
paring the monthly advance to 1.7 percent. The broader  Topix (TPX) 
Index lost 1.6 percent to 731.64, with more than four times as
many shares declining as advancing.  The Topix has fallen 16 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings will be hurt by Europe’s debt
crisis and slowing growth in China and the U.S. Retail sales
fell more than expected as the government winds down incentives
for energy-efficient vehicles and other measures to stimulate
demand.  Topix Valuations  The decline has cut the price of shares on the Topix to 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less
than one means companies can be bought for less than the value
of their assets.  Consumer prices dropped 0.3 percent from a year earlier,
underscoring concern that the central bank is making little
progress in its fight against deflation and may miss its 1
percent inflation goal. Japan’s industrial production slid 1.2
percent in July from June, the Trade Ministry said in Tokyo
today. The median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  was for a 1.7 percent increase.  Machinery manufacturers fell. Makita dropped 3.3 percent to
2,664 yen. Toshiba Machine Co. lost 2.5 percent to 310 yen.  Steelmakers led declines among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries, which will
merge in October to become the world’s second-largest steelmaker,
widened first-year loss estimates on a combined 240 billion yen
($3.1 billion) in impairment charges. Nippon Steel sank 5.6
percent to 151 yen, while Sumitomo Metal Industries lost 5.1
percent to 111 yen.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today. The gauge
lost 0.8 percent yesterday after a report showed more Americans
than expected filed applications for unemployment last week, a
sign the labor market is faltering amid a slowing economy.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to
speak today at a meeting of central bankers in Wyoming. Fed
policy makers have said they are prepared to provide new
stimulus “fairly soon” unless there is evidence of
“substantial and sustainable.”  Stocks also fell after a report showed economic confidence
in the euro area fell more forecast to a three-year low in
August and Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said his
government would delay requesting a full bailout.  Yen Climbs  The Japanese currency gained versus most of its major peers.
The yen appreciated to as high as 78.40 against the dollar today
in Tokyo, compared with 78.63 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday. Japan’s currency strengthened to 98.03 against the
euro from 98.71. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Ricoh declined 3.8 percent to 616 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a
carmaker that gets half of its revenue from  North America  and
Europe, slipped 2.4 percent to 2,472 yen.  Sharp declined the most on the Nikkei 225, falling 13
percent to 198 yen. Foxconn Technology Group founder Terry Gou
ended a visit to Japan without announcing the conclusion of a
deal to invest in the Osaka-based company.  Foxconn and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. agreed in March
to buy 9.9 percent of Japan’s biggest liquid-crystal display
maker. The deal is being renegotiated after Sharp widened its
loss forecast and the stock plunged to a 30-year low. The
company faces 706 billion yen ($9 billion) of debt maturing
within a year, and is shedding jobs for the first time since
1950 to cut costs.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim Powell , Nick Gentle  To contact the reporter on this story:
