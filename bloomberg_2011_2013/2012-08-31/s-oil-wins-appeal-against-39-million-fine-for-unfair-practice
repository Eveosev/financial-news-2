S-Oil Corp. (010950) ,  South Korea ’s third-
biggest refiner, won an appeal against a 43.8 billion won ($39
million) fine imposed by the country’s antitrust regulator for
an unfair business practice.  The  Seoul  High Court upheld the refiner’s request to
nullify the Fair Trade Commission’s penalty, S-Oil said today in
a statement.  The commission imposed fines totaling 434.8 billion won in
2011 on four refiners, including SK Innovation Co., GS Caltex
Corp. and Hyundai Oilbank Co., for colluding and rejecting
requests by gas stations to switch product brands. S-Oil, 35
percent owned by Saudi Arabian Oil Co., was the first to get the
court’s ruling.  SK Innovation has appealed the fine in the court, spokesman
Yoo Jung Min said by phone today.  Hyundai Oilbank  has contested
the penalty, company spokesman Koh In Soo said by phone today.  GS Caltex wasn’t required to pay its 177.2 billion won fine
after being the first to admit wrongdoing.  S-Oil fell 1.4 percent to 103,000 won at the close in
Seoul. The company’s win was reported earlier today by Asia
Business Daily’s website, which didn’t say where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
