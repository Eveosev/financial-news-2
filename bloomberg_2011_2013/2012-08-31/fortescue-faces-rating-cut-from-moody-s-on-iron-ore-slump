Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , the
biggest seller of junk-rated mining bonds, is being reviewed by
Moody’s Investors Service for a possible cut to its credit score
because of a slump in  iron ore prices .  Moody’s may lower the Perth-based company’s Ba3 rating, the
third-highest junk grade, the ratings firm said in a statement
dated yesterday, after iron ore prices fell 24 percent this
month. A downgrade would affect about $7.6 billion of debt
securities, it said.  “Fortescue is investing heavily in its significant
capacity expansion project, and the depressed operating cash
flow, arising from the drop in iron ore prices combined with the
potential for ongoing short-term weakness, is raising material
challenges for Fortescue,” Matthew Moore, an analyst with
Moody’s, said in the statement.  Fortescue is spending $9 billion to expand operations in
 Western Australia ’s Pilbara region, including building mines, a
port expansion and a rail line. The company is considering
selling some assets such as power stations to raise cash, Chief
Executive Officer Neville Power said yesterday.  “The rating action reflects the considerable constraints
on Fortescue’s liquidity profile due to the rapid and continuing
decline in the iron ore price to levels that are below our base
case expectation,” Moore said.  Fortescue,  Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore producer,
rose for the first time in four days, climbing 1.1 percent to
A$3.59 at 10:54 a.m. in Sydney trading. It has declined 13
percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
