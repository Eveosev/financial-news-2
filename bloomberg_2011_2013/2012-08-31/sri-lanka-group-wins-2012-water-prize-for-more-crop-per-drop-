The International Water Management
Institute, a Sri Lanka-based organization, was awarded the 2012
Stockholm Water Prize for research to help farmers produce
“more crop per drop” and improve agricultural water
management.  King Carl XVI Gustaf of  Sweden  made the award presentation,
which comes with a $150,000 prize, to IWMI in a royal ceremony
during the annual World Water Week event in Stockholm that wraps
up today.  The Colombo, Sri Lanka-based group, which has regional
offices in Asia and Africa, focuses on the sustainable use of
land and water resources in agriculture, promoting management
techniques and policies so enough crops can be grown without a
threat to  food security  to feed Earth’s increasing population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
