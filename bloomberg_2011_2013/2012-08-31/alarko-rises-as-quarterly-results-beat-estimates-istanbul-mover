Alarko Holding AS (ALARK) , a Turkish
conglomerate with interests in construction and energy, jumped
the most in six months after beating profit estimates.  The  shares  climbed as much as 5.8 percent, the most since
Feb. 24, to 4.01 liras and traded 5 percent higher at 3.98 liras
as of 2:32 p.m. in Istanbul. Alarko has gained 31 percent this
year, compared with a 30 percent rally on the Istanbul Stock
Exchange National 100 Index.  The company reported a profit of 34.2 million liras ($18.8
million) in the second quarter, beating the average estimate of
22 million liras from three analysts on Bloomberg. The stock was
upgraded to buy from hold at EFG Istanbul Securities and to an
equivalent rating at Ekspres Invest.  The deviation “stems from our underestimation of the
operational improvement in the contracting segment” and “the
positive seasonality effect of the electricity distribution
business,” EFG analysts Alper Akalin and Sinan Goksen said in
an e-mailed report today. EFG had forecast earnings of 20
million liras, according to the report. “Overall, second-
quarter results are quite positive and highly promising.”  The Istanbul-based conglomerate’s shares trade at a 48
percent discount to the combined companies’ net asset value,
according to the analysts, making them “overly punished
compared to our fair net asset value discount of 30 percent.”  Alarko shares have an enterprise value to current earnings
ratio of 3.78, compared with a sector average of 7.17, according
to  Bloomberg data  comparing them with 14 global peer companies.
The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is 8.44, compared with the
average among peers of 9.95, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
