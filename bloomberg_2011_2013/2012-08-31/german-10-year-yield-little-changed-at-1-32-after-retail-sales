German 10-year bunds opened little
changed after a report showed retail sales in  Europe ’s largest
economy unexpectedly fell in July.  The  yield  on the 10-year security was at 1.32 percent as of
7:07 a.m. London time. The naton’s  two-year  rate was also little
changed at minus 0.035 percent.  Retail sales  in  Germany  slipped 0.9 percent last month
after increasing a revised 0.5 percent in June. The median
