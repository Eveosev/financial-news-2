European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said record liquidity provision won’t
lead to concerns of faster price increases.  “Inflation expectations have remained very well anchored
following the non-standard liquidity provision measures
undertaken by the ECB,” Coeure said in a speech in  Frankfurt 
yesterday, according to a text provided by the ECB today. That
“probably reflects continued negative output gaps in the euro
area as well as confidence that the ECB will be able and willing
to drain liquidity if and when necessary to control inflation.”  The ECB injected has more than 1 trillion euros ($1.25
trillion) into the banking system since December in a bid to
ward off a looming credit crunch. The Frankfurt-based central
bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a record low of 0.75
percent on July 5 as  Europe ’s debt crisis, now in its third
year, worsened.  Still, the debt crisis “has not eroded trust in the euro
as a currency,” Coeure said.  The euro rose after Coeure’s comments were published and
was trading at $1.2542 at 10:57 a.m. in Frankfurt. The ECB will
convene for its monthly rate-setting meeting in Frankfurt on
Sept. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
