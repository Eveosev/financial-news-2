Copper rose in  New York  on
speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hint
at more stimulus to fuel growth in the world’s second-biggest
consumer of the metal.  Bernanke is due to speak today in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming .
His address in 2010 preceded a second round of so-called
quantitative easing. The dollar weakened against the euro,
making commodities cheaper for users of the single European
currency.  “We are all waiting for Jackson Hole,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital Plc in London, said by e-
mail.  Copper for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to $3.461 a
pound by 7:45 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices are down 0.9
percent this week and up 1.3 percent in August. Copper for
three-month delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $7,602.50 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange.  “Some form of QE3 action from  Jackson Hole  is priced into
the market, so any perceived under-delivery will result in a
marked risk selloff,” Jason Dobson, director of metals for Asia
at ICAP Plc in Hong Kong, wrote in a report.  A gauge of manufacturing in China, the biggest global
copper user, may be little changed for August at 50, the level
that divides expansion and contraction, according to economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The prior level was 50.1. The report
is set for release tomorrow.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME fell for a fifth
session to 229,900 tons and slid 2.4 percent this week, daily
exchange figures showed. Inventories in Shanghai Futures
Exchange warehouses fell to 158,065 tons this week, according to
data from the bourse.  Lead for three-month delivery on the LME gained as much as
1.3 percent, the most in a week, and was last up 1 percent at
$1,962.50 a ton. Orders to remove the metal from LME warehouses
jumped 46 percent to 114,025 tons, the highest level since at
least 1997.  Zinc and aluminum fell in  London , nickel rose and tin was
unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
