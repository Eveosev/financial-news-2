England bowled out South Africa for 211 runs in the third one-
day international cricket match at the Oval in London.  Anderson took the last three wickets of the innings as well
as the first,  Graeme Smith  for 18. South Africa only used 46.4
overs. Anderson finished 4-44, while Jade Dernbach was 3-44.  South Africa, which leads the series 1-0, won the toss and
elected to bat in south London. Hamish Amla, who hit 150 in the
visitors’ victory at Southampton earlier this week, was bowled
for 43 by Dernbach, who also got Dean Elgar for 42.  England will bat during the evening session of the 50-over
match.  With the Aug. 28 win, South Africa moved ahead of England
in the  International Cricket Council ’s one-day rankings, and is
the first team to hold the No. 1 spot in all three formats of
the sport. England dropped behind South Africa and India in the
ODI rankings. The first match in the series was abandoned Aug.
24 because of rain in Cardiff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
