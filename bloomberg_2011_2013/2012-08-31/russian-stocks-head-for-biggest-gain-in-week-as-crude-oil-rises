Russian stocks declined to the
lowest in almost a month as investors sold riskier assets after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  didn’t announce
additional stimulus measures.  The Micex Index fell 0.5 percent to 1,422.91 by the close
in Moscow, the lowest level since Aug. 3 and giving a 2.1
percent loss for the week. The benchmark has rallied 1.1 percent
this month. OAO Lukoil retreated 2 percent, the biggest drop
since May 17, as second-quarter profit plunged 69 percent. OAO
Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest natural-gas producer, added 0.7
percent as the board recommended raising the first-half
dividend.  Bernanke said he wouldn’t rule out more bond purchases to
boost growth, while not providing a timeline for any measures.
Bernanke’s speech comes two weeks before he leads a meeting of
the  Federal Open Market Committee  to decide whether an expansion
of the Fed’s record stimulus is needed to spur growth. Two
rounds of large-scale asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion
have so far failed to reduce the jobless rate below 8 percent
more than three years into the recovery.  “Investors wanted to see more concrete stimulus
measures,” Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat Capital
in Moscow, said by phone. “In reality, Bernanke didn’t say
anything new. Despite the oil rally, investors are cautious
about the Russian market today.”  The dollar-denominated RTS Index increased 0.4 percent to
1,389.72, the first gain in six days.  Lukoil Tumbles  Lukoil fell to 1,836.10 rubles. Russia’s second-largest oil
producer posted a profit of $1.02 billion, missing analyst
estimates for $2.4 billion, after  oil prices  fell faster than
export taxes.  Nomos Bank gained 12 percent to 784.40 rubles, the most
since Oct. 6, 2011. Otkritie Financial Corp. said it plans to
acquire the Russian lender over the next two years and offered
to buy out minority shareholders at a premium. The shares rose
14 percent to $12 in  London .  Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, rose 1.9 percent
to $96.37 in  New York , increasing for the first time in three
days. Oil and gas contribute about 50 percent to Russia’s state
revenue.  Brent crude  climbed 1 percent to $113.80.  OAO Gazprom Neft climbed 1.6 percent to 151.48 rubles. OAO
Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline operator, jumped 1.1 percent to
52,759 rubles.  Surgut, Federal Grid  Preferred shares of OAO Surgutneftegas added 11 percent
this month, the biggest advancer on the Micex. OAO Rostelecom
and preferred shares of OAO Sberbank, the nation’s largest
lender, rose 11 percent and 8 percent respectively.  Federal Grid Co., Russia’s high-voltage power transmission
monopoly, dropped 12 percent this month, the biggest decliner.
OAO Raspadskaya coal producer lost 11 percent, the second-
biggest.  Russian equity funds attracted $90 million in the week
ended Aug. 29, according to VTB Capital’s research note, which
cited EPFR data.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  and has
rallied 1.5 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
9.9 times and a 3.6 percent advance for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
