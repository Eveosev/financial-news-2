Arise Windpower AB (AWP) , a Swedish wind
developer, will invest 1.3 billion kronor ($196 million) in a
Swedish project it agreed to buy from Ownpower Projects AB,
provided electricity and certificate prices recover.  Arise plans to build 28 of the 40 turbines on the 84-
megawatt project “once electricity and certificate prices have
recovered somewhat from today’s levels,” according to a
statement from the Halmstad-based company today.  Sweden  operates a green certificate market to provide
incentives for renewable energy. It obliges electricity
suppliers to buy certificates corresponding to a proportion of
their power distribution. Each certificate typically represents
1 megawatt-hour of power sourced from renewables.  The average daily price for certificates in Sweden was
172.83 kronor ($26), as of Aug. 30, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In the U.K., the average daily price is 40.17
pounds ($63.7), and in Poland its 236.63 zloty ($71.3).  Arise signed a conditional agreement with Visby-based
Ownpower earlier this month to buy the project that has all
approvals in place in Solberg for as much as 120 megawatts.  Those conditions, including landowner issues that have now
been met, allowing the purchase to be completed, according to
today’s statement. The project will take about 14 months to
build, with operation expected in 2014, according to Arise.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
