Near-term crude options fell to the
lowest level since May 3 as futures climbed 2 percent after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that further
economic stimulus would be justified.  Implied volatility for options expiring in October, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 25.72 percent as of 3:33 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 26.59 percent yesterday. Bets that prices would fall
accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading today.  Crude oil for October delivery advanced $1.85 to settle at
$96.47 a barrel on the Nymex.  The Nymex is closed Sept. 3 for the U.S. Labor Day holiday
except for electronic trading. October options expire Sept. 17.  Two options were the most active in electronic trading
today. March $130 calls rose 8 cents to 88 cents a barrel at
3:59 p.m. with 1,339 lots trading. The same number of lots
changed hands for March $140 calls as they advanced 4 cents to
50 cents a barrel. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 54
percent of the 85,842 contracts traded.  October $82 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 3,803 lots changing hands. They rose 1 cent to 9
