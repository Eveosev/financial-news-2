EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR)  applied for a
permit in  Scotland  to build the world’s biggest offshore wind
project, larger than the capital city of Edinburgh and able to
generate enough power to supply as many as 1 million homes.  The 1,500-megawatt development in waters off northeastern
Scotland would be split into three wind farms, according to a
document e-mailed today by Moray Offshore Renewables Ltd.,
EDPR’s partnership with Spanish oil company Repsol SA. They
would cover an area of 114 square miles (296 square kilometers).  The project is the first to seek planning permission among
32,200 megawatts of proposed wind farms that won licenses in the
U.K.’s third round of approvals in January 2010. The country is
seeking to meet local carbon-cutting goals and a European Union
target to get 15 percent of all energy from renewables by 2020.  “We’re marking a watershed moment as Round Three starts to
become a reality,” Maria McCaffery, chief executive officer of
lobby RenewableUK, said in an e-mailed statement. “Offshore
wind can provide tens of thousands of jobs across the country.”  Dong Energy A/S and SSE Plc’s 367-megawatt Walney plant off
the coast of northwest  England  is the biggest completed offshore
wind project. The first 630-megawatt part of Dong’s London Array
Project with EON AG and Masdar,  Abu Dhabi ’s state-run renewables
company, is being built, with another 370 megawatts approved.  EDPR, based in  Madrid , plans to install 189 to 339
turbines, depending on their size. Building the farms, which the
Scotsman newspaper earlier said would cost 4.5 billion pounds
($7.2 billion), would begin in 2016, 2017 or 2018, and 2019.  Scotland’s government received the planning application on
Aug. 9 and began a consultation on Aug. 28, Marine Scotland, the
state body that deals with such requests, said today by e-mail.  The U.K. has about 2,000 megawatts of installed wind power
at sea and is targeting 18,000 megawatts by 2020. Scotland aims
to meet all of its electricity demand from renewables by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
