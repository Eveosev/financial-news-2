Russian investigators said they
detained a man responsible for the murder of two women, who
tried to muddle his tracks with a sign written in blood calling
for the release of jailed members of the Pussy Riot punk band.  A 38-year-old PhD holder and professor in the Tatarstan
capital of Kazan admitted to stabbing a mother 76, and daughter,
38, after a quarrel in the women’s apartment on Aug. 22, the
regional  Interior Ministry  said in a  statement  published on its
website today.  To deflect suspicion, the suspect tried to conceal their
deaths as ritual killings, writing the slogan in English on a
wall with the blood of one of the victims and arranging their
bodies to form the number 69, according to the statement.  The suspect, who lived with his parents in Kazan to hide
from creditors, owed the younger woman money after she took out
a loan for several hundred thousand rubles to help him repay
debt, investigators said. On the balcony of his apartment,
police found a knife identified as the murder weapon and the
mobile phones and a promissory note -- or IOU -- stolen from the
victims, according to the statement.  Three members of  Pussy Riot  were sentenced to two years in
prison Aug. 17 for a protest stunt against President  Vladimir Putin  in  Russia ’s largest church, Christ the Savior cathedral in
Moscow. The women were convicted of hooliganism and inciting
religious hatred.  To contact the reporter on this story:
