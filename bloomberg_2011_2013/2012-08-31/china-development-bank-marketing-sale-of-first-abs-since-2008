China Development Bank  Corp., the
nation’s largest policy bank, plans to issue 10.2 billion yuan
($1.6 billion) of asset-backed securities in its first such
offering since 2008, according to a sale prospectus.  The bank will sell the securities in six tranches with
CITIC Trust Co., part of state-owned Citic Group Corp., it said
in the document filed with the Shanghai Clearing House today.
Four tranches of notes are rated AAA and one is rated AA while
the other is a subordinated tranche, it  said .  China Development Bank last sold asset-backed securities in
April 2008, as the global financial crisis deepened, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. CDB and  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939)  sold 7.2 billion  yuan  of asset-backed bonds in December
2005 in the first such deal for financial institutions in the
country.  Asset-backed securities, or ABS, are notes backed by
financial assets. Banks in China were permitted to begin selling
them again after the regulator suspended an issuance program in
2008 in the wake of the financial crisis, Moody’s Investors
Service said in a report on June 11.  CDB’s notes are backed by 49 loans from 43 borrowers,
according to the prospectus. Eighteen of the loans are rated AAA
and 12 are rated AA+. The lowest rating of any of the loans is A
and the highest  interest rate  is 7.32 percent.  About 40 percent, or 19 loans, are in industries including
electricity, heat generation and suppliers. Seven are in railway
transport, according to the prospectus.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
