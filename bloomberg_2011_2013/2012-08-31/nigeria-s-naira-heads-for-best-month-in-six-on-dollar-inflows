The naira headed for its best
monthly performance in six after dollar inflows from the central
bank and oil companies.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer climbed less
than 0.1 percent to 157.95 per dollar as of 12:55 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital. The naira has climbed 1.7 percent this
month, the third-best performer in Africa according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The naira has been “steady” on “dollar inflows from the
central bank, and to a lesser extent, dollar sales by energy
companies,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts at Ecobank
Transnational Inc. in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  The oil industry is the second major source of dollar
supplies in the country after the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which
offers dollars at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays and through
interbank trading to maintain exchange-rate stability. The
Abuja-based regulator  sold $430 million  this week, the most in
three.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7 percent domestic bonds due October
2019 dropped 56 basis points to 14.41 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 slid one basis point to 4.92 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was up 0.1 percent to 1.9315 a dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
