Gasoline and diesel prices at the
pump rose to record levels in euros for a second week, according
to data from the European Commission.  Retail  gasoline  advanced to average 1.701 euros a liter
($8.10 a gallon) this week in the European Union’s 27 member
nations, exceeding a record 1.699 euros on Aug. 24, the data
showed. That’s up 13 percent this year. Diesel climbed to a high
of 1.548 euros a liter, compared with 1.543 last week.  The rally coincides with a surge in  Brent crude , which
gained 27 percent since its 2012 low in June to trade at $113.50
a barrel today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
