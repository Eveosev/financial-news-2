Finland’s economic growth will
probably suffer from the  European debt crisis  as the country’s
aging population erodes its long-term growth potential, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “While Finland has strong fundamentals and a track record
of good policies, the near-term economic outlook is highly
vulnerable to external developments,” the Washington-based
organization said in a report on its website today. “Population
aging remains a challenge for long-term fiscal sustainability.”  Finland’s government should raise the statutory retirement
age of 63 and tighten early-retirement plans to help pay for the
expected rise in health and long-term care costs, the IMF said.  Finland’s economic growth  will slow to 0.6 percent this
year from 2.7 percent in 2011, before accelerating to 1.4
percent in 2013, the IMF said. The government’s budget deficit
will narrow to 0.9 percent next year from 1.3 percent in 2012.  “Although Finland has benefited from safe-haven status
during the European sovereign debt turmoil so far, risks to the
outlook are tilted to the downside,” the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
