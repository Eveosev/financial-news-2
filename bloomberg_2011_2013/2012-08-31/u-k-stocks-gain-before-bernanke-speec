U.K. stocks  were little changed,
following a three-day slide for the benchmark FTSE 100 Index, as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he does not rule
out further bond buying by the central bank.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  contributed the
most to a rally by a gauge of U.K. mining stocks.  Lavendon Group
Plc (LVD)  surged 5.8 percent after the maker of aerial work platforms
doubled its dividend.  Redrow Plc (RDW)  gained 2.7 percent after a
group led by its chairman made a takeover approach.  The FTSE 100 Index declined 0.1 percent to 5,711.48 at the
close in London, after earlier falling as much as 0.2 percent
and rallying as much as 0.8 percent. The equity benchmark
dropped 1.1 percent this week, paring its gain in August to 1.4
percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index was little changed
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 1 percent.  “Bernanke repeated what was expected: the Fed remains
committed to the economy and -- if it needs support -- they will
provide the necessary accommodation,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief
strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in London.
“Markets will have to wait until the next FOMC meeting to see
how the cards fall,” he said, referring to the Federal Open
Market Committee meeting next month.  Bernanke said the  unemployment rate  in the world’s largest
economy has seen no improvement since January. He leads an FOMC
meeting on Sept. 12-13 to decide whether to further stimulate
the economy in an attempt to encourage hiring.  Bernanke Speech  “The costs of nontraditional policies, when considered
carefully, appear manageable, implying that we should not rule
out the further use of such policies if economic conditions
warrant,” Bernanke said today in a speech to central bankers
and economists at an annual forum in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  Xstrata soared 5.7 percent to 952.2 pence, while Rio Tinto
Group, the  world’s third-largest mining company , climbed 0.7
percent to 2,735.5 pence.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  advanced 1.1 percent to
593 pence. A gauge of mining stocks listed on the FTSE 350 Index
rose 1.6 percent.  Glencore International Plc jumped 7.7 percent to 385.05
pence. MSCI Inc. will adjust Glencore’s weighting in its
benchmark indexes on Sept. 1, according to a report from BMO
Capital Markets dated May 18.  Lavendon jumped 5.8 percent to 128 pence after doubling its
 interim dividend  to 0.75 pence per share. The company also
reported  first-half sales  of 114.5 million pounds ($182
million).  Redrow advanced 2.7 percent to 155.1 pence after a group
led by the U.K. housebuilder’s chairman,  Steve Morgan , made a
takeover approach. Bridgemere Securities Ltd., which Morgan
leads, Toscafund Asset Management LLP and Penta Capital LLP said
in a statement that they may offer 152 pence a share for Redrow,
which would value the company at 562 million pounds.  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc (BPTY)  dropped 5 percent to
94.1 pence as the gambling company said average gross daily
revenue fell 11 percent in the eight weeks ended Aug. 25 after a
late start to Germany’s soccer season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
