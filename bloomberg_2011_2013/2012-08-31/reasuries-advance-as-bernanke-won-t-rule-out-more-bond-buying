Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest in almost four weeks, as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he wouldn’t rule out a third round
of bond buying under quantitative easing to spur growth.  Thirty-year bond yields dropped after Bernanke told central
bankers and economists at the Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium
in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , that labor-market stagnation is a
“grave concern.” Ten- and 30-year securities gained for a
second week. Treasuries still lost 0.4 percent in August, paring
their 2012 return to 2.3 percent, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Bernanke “is concerned,” said Justin Lederer, an interest
rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “He didn’t state
anything definitive, but they are there to act. It definitely
feels like it will be in the next few months.”  The 10-year note  yield  slid eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.55 percent at 4:59 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 1.54
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 6, reaching below its 50-
day moving average of 1.59 percent. The price of the 1.625
percent security maturing in August 2022 gained 22/32, or $6.88
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 22/32.  The benchmark yield, which rose earlier to 1.66 percent,
slid 14 basis points  this week .  The  yield  on the two-year note fell by as much as four
basis points, the biggest intraday drop since March 15, to 0.22
percent. The U.S. sold $35 billion of the securities this week,
part of $99 billion in note auctions.  Long Bonds  Thirty-year bond  yields decreased seven basis points to
2.67 percent and touched 2.66 percent, the lowest since Aug. 7.
The long-bond yields fell 13 basis points on the week.  “The fact that QE3 is still a very real possibility has
the longer end of the Treasury market maintaining its underlying
strength,” said Jeffrey Caughron, a partner at Baker Group LP
in  Oklahoma City  who advises community banks on more than $30
billion of investments. “The expectation of a lot of market
participants was that he would be more clear and forceful, but
it is appropriate for him to be careful at this point.”  The yield difference between 10- and 30-year Treasuries
widened to 1.12 percentage points, the most since May 16.  Bernanke, lamenting the suffering caused by unemployment of
more than 8 percent and defending his unprecedented actions,
told the annual forum that “nontraditional policies” shouldn’t
be ruled out if economic conditions warrant. He emphasized that
a new round of bond purchases is an option.  FOMC Meeting  The remarks came two weeks before he leads a meeting of the
 Federal Open Market Committee  to decide whether an expansion of
the Fed’s record stimulus is needed to spur growth.  “The sentiment is that the Fed will be doing more security
purchases and expanding the balance sheet yet another time,”
said Mark MacQueen, partner and  money manager  in Austin,  Texas ,
at Sage Advisory Services Ltd., which oversees $10 billion. “He
somewhat reassured the market that he’s willing to do more. That
was better than expected.”  Treasuries jumped to the most expensive level in a month.
The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists at the
Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and
inflation, was negative 0.97 percent, the most costly since July
25. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value. The average for this
year is negative 0.73 percent.  Sustainable Improvement  The FOMC next meets Sept. 12-13. Many policy makers at the
committee’s last meeting said additional stimulus probably will
be needed soon unless the economy showed a “substantial and
sustainable strengthening,” according to minutes of their July
31-Aug. 1 discussions.  Bernanke’s speeches at the past two  Jackson Hole 
conferences signaled central-bank moves to spur economic growth.
The Fed chief said in his remarks in August 2010 the central
bank “will do all that it can” to ensure a continuation of the
economic recovery and that more securities purchases might be
warranted if growth slowed. Policy makers announced a $600
billion round of Treasury purchases in November 2010.  At the August 2011 conference, Bernanke said the Fed “has
a range of tools that could be used to provide additional
monetary stimulus.” The central announced on Sept. 21 a
program, dubbed Operation Twist, to swap shorter-term Treasuries
in its holdings with longer-term securities to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs.  Balance Sheet  The Fed has expanded its  balance sheet  with two rounds of
quantitative easing to spur the economy. In the first, starting
in 2008, it bought $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities,
$175 billion of federal agency debt and $300 billion of
Treasuries. In the second round, announced in November 2010, the
Fed bought $600 billion of Treasuries.  Treasuries rose yesterday as data showing slower inflation
bolstered speculation Bernanke has more room to add monetary
stimulus. Commerce Department data showed a gauge of prices tied
to  consumer spending  advanced 1.3 percent in the 12 months ended
in July, the smallest gain since October 2009.  The central bank’s favored bond-market  gauge  of inflation
expectations was at 2.54 percent on Aug. 28, down from a 2012
high of 2.78 percent on March 19. The five-year, five-year
forward break-even rate shows how much traders anticipate
consumer prices will rise during a period of five years starting
in 2017. The average over the past decade is 2.75 percent.  The Fed’s mandate from Congress is to aim for maximum
employment and stable prices.  U.S. employers added 125,000 jobs in August, fewer than the
163,000-position increase in July, economists in a Bloomberg
News survey forecast before the Labor Department reports the
data on Sept. 7. The  unemployment rate  will remain at 8.3
percent, they projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
