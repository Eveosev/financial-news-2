Kansas City Federal Reserve
President Esther George said that she hopes the central bank’s
 Jackson Hole  symposium will yield insights on current monetary
policy.  “I remain committed to preserving the symposium’s
reputation for identifying timely issues that are addressed with
intellectual rigor,” George said today in opening remarks over
dinner to central bankers and economists at an annual forum in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  This year the title of the meeting, sponsored by the Kansas
City Fed, is “The Changing Policy Landscape.”  George said she looks forward to “engaging over the next
two days in what I hope will be a productive dialogue.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has an opportunity to
update his policy outlook in a speech at the symposium tomorrow
at 10 a.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
