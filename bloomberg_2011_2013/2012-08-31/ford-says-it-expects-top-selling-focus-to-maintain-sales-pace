Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, said it expects to maintain the sales pace for
its Focus compact car, which outsold the Toyota Corolla to be
the world’s best-selling car in the first six months this year.  Ford sold 489,616 units of the Focus in the January to June
period, compared with 462,187 Corollas, the Dearborn, Michigan-
based automaker said in a statement today, citing data from IHS
Automotive. The company produced its 350-millionth car in its
history at its plant in Rayong,  Thailand , according to the
statement.  “The Focus is attracting many new customers to the Ford
brand for the very first time, particularly in  Asia  where we are
growing every day,”  Jim Farley , Ford’s global market chief,
said in the statement.  Ford is stepping up investments in Asia to tap demand from
from China to India after widening losses in Europe prompted the
carmaker to cut its outlook in July for full-year profit.  The
company said this week it will bring its luxury Lincoln
nameplate to China in the second half of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
