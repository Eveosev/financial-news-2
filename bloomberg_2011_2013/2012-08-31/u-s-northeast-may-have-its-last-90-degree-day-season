The U.S. Northeast may have its last
chance of the season today for temperatures in the 90s, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  After temperatures peak in the low 90s Fahrenheit (low 30s
Celsius) from Washington to Boston, the chances of the Middle
Atlantic and Northeast getting that warm again start to fade,
said Rogers, based in Bethesda, Maryland. Cooler weather will
prevail throughout the region well into mid-September.  Above-normal temperatures in the big cities of the East can
spur electricity use, sending prices in spot electricity and
natural gas markets higher.  Today’s high temperature in  New York City  is expected to
reach 91, according to the  National Weather Service . The high
may be 92 in Boston, 93 in Philadelphia, 95 in Baltimore and 96
in  Washington , the Weather Service said.  The only thing that may bring 90-degree heat back to the
Northeast is Leslie, a tropical storm in the Atlantic, Rogers
said in an e-mail interview. One computer model stalls the storm
“well off the East Coast next week,” and if that happens
higher temperatures may slip back in.  “Otherwise, beyond that, the 90s story in the Northeast
looks like history,” Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
