Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
rose 4 percent at an auction yesterday after supplies declined
and global prices increased, the East African nation’s Coffee
Board said.  The Arabica AA grade sold for an average $180.22 for a 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $173.35 a week earlier, the
Tanzania Coffee Board said today by e-mail from Moshi, the
northern town where the auction is held.  Supplies of the grade fell 15 percent to 5,691 bags and the
beans sold for as much as $189.60 a bag compared with $210 at
the previous sale, it said.  Prices for all mild grades rose by $6.70 a bag, while those
for robust ones climbed by an average of $3.27 a bag after
supplies declined, the board said. Arabica accounts for 75
percent of the country’s output, and robusta the rest.  Supplies for all the coffee at the auction fell 19 percent
to 24,870 bags, while sales declined 12 percent to 23,598 bags,
the Coffee Board said. The board offers its bags in 60-kilogram
packages but prices per 50 kilograms.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag for the good grades:  To contact the reporter on this story:
