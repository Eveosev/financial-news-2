Former Georgian soccer star Kakha Kaladze will head the party list of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition in October elections.  Kaladze will top a 200-strong list for the Georgian Dream
party, the billionaire told reporters today in the capital,
Tbilisi. Ivanishvili reaffirmed his aim to become prime
minister.  Kaladze, who played for  Genoa C.F.C . in  Italy ’s Serie A, has
backed Ivanishvili’s plans to challenge President Mikheil Saakashvili’s alliance in October’s ballot. The billionaire
bought a stake in Kaladze’s Progress Bank last year.  Saakashvili’s ruling party had a lead of more than 20
percentage points over Ivanishvili’s opposition movement,
according to a poll conducted this month and funded by the
United National Movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
