Jonathan Trott hit 71 runs to help
England defeat  South Africa  by 4 wickets to even their one-day
international cricket series and return to the top ranking in
ODI rankings.  Trott was caught by AB de Villiers off Wayne Parnell with
England 5 runs short of victory in the third one-day
international cricket match at the Oval in London. Samit Patel’s
single pushed the hosts to 212-6 to the win with 12 balls
remaining.  James Anderson  took four wickets as South Africa was bowled
out for 211, capturing the last three wickets of the innings as
well as the first,  Graeme Smith  for 18. South Africa only used
46.4 overs. Anderson finished 4-44, while Jade Dernbach was
3-44.  South Africa won the toss and elected to bat in south
London. Hamish Amla, who hit 150 in the visitors’ victory at
Southampton earlier this week, was bowled for 43 by Dernbach,
who also got Dean Elgar for 42.  With the Aug. 28 win, South Africa moved ahead of England
in the  International Cricket Council ’s one-day rankings, to
become the first team to hold the No. 1 spot in all three
formats of the sport. England dropped behind South Africa and
 India  in the ODI rankings after the loss, but recaptured the top
ranking with today’s victory.  The first match in the series was abandoned Aug. 24 because
of rain in Cardiff. The sides meet again Sept. 2 at Lord’s in
London and then Sept. 5 in Nottingham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
