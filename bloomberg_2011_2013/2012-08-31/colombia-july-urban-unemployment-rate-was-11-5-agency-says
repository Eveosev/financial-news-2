Colombia ’s urban jobless rate rose
to 11.5 percent in July, the national statistics agency said
today in Bogota.  Economists had estimated unemployment would be 11.1
percent, according to the median forecast of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Outgoing Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told
lawmakers last month that the rate of unemployment in the Andean
nation is “unsatisfactory.” Echeverry this month ordered the
Treasury to start its own program of dollar purchases, separate
from the central bank’s, in an effort to protect Colombian jobs
by weakening the peso.  The peso has gained 6.2 percent this year, the third-most
of 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg, leading to complaints
from exporters such as coffee and flower growers, and
industrialists, who say it is making it harder for them to
compete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
