euros ($1 billion) in funding from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development this year and next, Tanjug
newswire  reported  citing EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti.  “A lot depends on the government policies and on the
investment opportunities that are available, but I would hope we
would achieve something in these two years,” Chakrabarti said,

great needs and we will be very much wanted to invest into
projects in the next couple of years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
