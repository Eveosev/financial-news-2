Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s DLJ
Mortgage Capital unit was sued in New York by a trustee for
mortgage bond investors claiming $720 million in damages tied to
faulty home loans.  U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the trustee, seeks to force DLJ to repurchase
the loans backing the securities, according to a court filing
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court.  Mortgages backing the securities were riskier than DLJ
promised, leading to a high rate of default and losses of $720
million, according to the filing. U.S. Bancorp is suing at the
direction of investors, according to the filing.  “We will vigorously defend against this latest attempt by
sophisticated parties to improperly shift responsibility for
alleged losses” to Credit Suisse, Steven Vames, spokesman for
the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mail.  The case is Home Equity Mortgage Trust Series 2006-1 v. DLJ
Mortgage Capital Inc., 156016-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
