Harvesting of the 2012-13 coffee
crop in  Indonesia , the third-biggest robusta grower, is over in
the lowlands and 60 percent finished in the highlands, according
to Volcafe Ltd., the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Bean deliveries from farms rose to 5,000 metric tons from
2,000 to 2,500 tons last week, when arrivals had slowed because
of the Muslim holiday of Eid, which marks the end of the fasting
month of Ramadan, Volcafe said in a weekly report e-mailed
today. The domestic market was “very active again,” it said.  Robusta prices have climbed 15 percent this year on NYSE
Liffe in London as global demand is forecast to advance to 66.1
million bags in 2012-13 from 62.6 million bags in 2011-12,
Volcafe estimates. Prices fell 7.1 percent in the past month.  “Most producers and local collectors are holding back
their stock a bit, anticipating a higher price before they
sell,” Volcafe said in the report.  Coffee production in Indonesia will rise to 10.1 million
bags in the season that started in April there, Winterthur,
Switzerland-based Volcafe estimated in a quarterly report
earlier this week. That compares with 6.2 million bags in 2011-
12, when above-average rains brought by the La Nina weather
pattern, a cooling of the  Pacific Ocean , damaged the crop.
Output was 9.4 million bags in 2010-11, it said.  Indonesia Premium  Buyers of Indonesian beans for September and October
shipments were paying a premium of $40 a ton over the price on
the NYSE Liffe exchange in London, according to Volcafe. That is
unchanged from last week, its data showed.  In  Vietnam , the biggest robusta producer, export and
stockpile figures indicate the 2011-12 crop may be about 27.3
million bags, Volcafe said. The country produced 20 million
bags in 2010-11, Volcafe estimates. Inventories in Ho Chi Mihn
city fell by 5,000 tons in August, it said.  The new crop in Vietnam will start in October and exporters
are in the “off-season mood and sporadically give some new crop
offers,” the trader said.  Buyers of Vietnamese beans for September and October
shipments were paying a premium of $30 a ton over NYSE Liffe, up
from $25 a ton last week, Volcafe data showed.  Robusta coffee for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$2,079 a ton by 4:14 p.m. on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
