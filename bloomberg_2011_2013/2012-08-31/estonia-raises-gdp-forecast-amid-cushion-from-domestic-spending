Estonia’s  Finance Ministry  raised
its 2012 economic growth forecast as improving domestic demand
cushions the newest euro-area member against a slump in exports.  Gross domestic product  will probably expand 2.2 percent
this year instead of the 1.7 percent forecast in April, the
Tallinn-based ministry said in an economic outlook distributed
by e-mail today. It kept its growth forecast for next year at 3
percent. The economy expanded 7.6 percent last year, the most in
the European Union.  Estonia, which in 2011 became the first former Soviet
republic to adopt the euro, has been buffered by robust  retail
sales  and public-sector construction financed by sales of spare
UN carbon-emissions quotas. An export-led recovery powered by
Nordic demand is slowing amid the  European debt crisis .  Higher tax revenues will help to limit the  budget deficit 
to 1.2 percent of GDP this year, compared with the April target
of 2.6 percent, while next year’s shortfall will narrow to 0.6
percent, the ministry said. Estonia is the only euro member that
has reported budget surpluses in the past two years and the
country has the lowest public debt in the 17-member region.  The Finance Ministry raised its inflation forecasts against
a backdrop of higher crude-oil prices, which have surged 12
percent over the past two months.  Consumer prices  will probably rise an average 3.9 percent
this year rather than the 3.3 percent seen four months ago, the
ministry said. Inflation may slow to 3.5 percent next year,
compared with a previous estimate of 3 percent, it predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
