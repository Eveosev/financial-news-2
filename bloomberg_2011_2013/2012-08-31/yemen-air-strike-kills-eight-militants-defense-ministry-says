Eight suspected al-Qaeda militants
in  Yemen  were killed today in an air strike in the southeastern
province of Hadramaut, the 26 September website of the defense
ministry reported.  The air strike targeted a vehicle carrying the suspected
militants, according to the website. The attack comes two days
after an air strike in Hadramaut killed three militants,
according to 26 September.  The Association of Southern Provinces Clerics, in an e-
mailed statement today, denounced the Aug. 29 air strike as a
“heinous” U.S. drone attack whose fatalities included a
moderate cleric named Salem bin Ali Jaber. There was no
independent confirmation of the nature of the strikes nor the
fatalities.  The Yemeni government asks for the help of U.S. drones
“where there is a need against the militants who have gone to
plot terrorist attacks,” Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi said
in an interview Aug. 29 with  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
