Chile’s peso appreciated as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he wouldn’t rule out
further stimulus to lower unemployment in the world’s biggest
economy.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 479.96 per dollar as of
11:30 a.m. in Santiago. The currency opened at a one-week high
of 478.8 per dollar and dropped as far as 481.17 per dollar as
Bernanke’s comments were first published before appreciating
again. The peso has strengthened 0.5 percent this month.  Stagnation in the U.S. labor market is a “grave concern,”
Bernanke said, two weeks before a meeting of the  Federal Open
Market Committee .  “It’s been a chaotic session,” said Cristian Donoso, a
trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The
market started optimistic, it turned around as Bernanke spoke
and now people are thinking there might be stimulus in a few
weeks.”  “The costs of nontraditional policies, when considered
carefully, appear manageable, implying that we should not rule
out the further use of such policies if economic conditions
warrant,” Bernanke said today in a speech to central bankers
and economists at an annual forum in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  All five Chilean central bank policy makers referred to the
appreciation of the peso at their Aug. 16 rate-setting meeting,
minutes published today showed.  International investors  in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $9.6 billion short position in the peso on Aug. 29, the
central bank said today. That’s a $1 billion increase from a
week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
