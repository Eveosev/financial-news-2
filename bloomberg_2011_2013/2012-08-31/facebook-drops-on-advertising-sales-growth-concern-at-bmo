Facebook Inc. (FB)  tumbled to a record
low on concern that businesses are spending less to advertise on
the world’s largest social-networking website.  The  shares  of  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook
declined 5.4 percent to $18.06 at the close in  New York . The
stock has lost more than half its value since Facebook sold
shares at $38 apiece in an initial public offering on May 17.  “Checks on near-term paid media spending remain
challenged,” Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets
Corp. in New York, said in a research report today. He has the
equivalent of a sell rating on the stock and cut his price
estimate on Facebook’s shares to $15 from $25.  Facebook may post $5.04 billion in sales this year,
 EMarketer Inc.  estimated, down from the market researcher’s
earlier projection for $6.1 billion as the biggest social
network struggles to sustain advertising growth.  EMarketer, which made its earlier prediction in  February ,
now expects revenue to rise 36 percent in 2012 and 31 percent in
2013, compared with an 88 percent gain last year. Growth in
advertising, which makes up the majority of Facebook’s sales,
will slow to 34 percent in 2012 and 29 percent in 2013, from
more than 68 percent last year, New York-based EMarketer said.  Facebook is grappling with questions from marketers about
how well ads on its site are performing, said Debra Aho
Williamson, an EMarketer analyst. While Facebook says it is
working with companies to show that the ads have an impact with
its 955 million users, the social network must move more
quickly, she said.  ‘Still Hesitation’  Sales “haven’t been growing as fast as we and others had
expected,” Williamson said. “There is still hesitation about
the effectiveness of the advertising, about how much the
advertising is worth.”  The reduced sales projection for 2012 brings EMarketer’s
estimates to 2.4 percent more than the $4.92 billion average
prediction of Wall Street analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. EMarketer’s February estimate was 24 percent
higher than the current average projection.  Last month, Facebook reported sales growth of 32 percent in
the second quarter, down from 45 percent in the first quarter
and 55 percent in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
