The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for the eighth week to the lowest in
more than 13 months, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into U.S. dollars, was
30.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or
Euribor, at 8:40 a.m. in  London , from minus 34 yesterday. It is
the lowest cost since July 22, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 35 basis points below Euribor
from minus 35.5 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and the overnight indexed swap, was
little changed at 21.9 basis points from 21.7 yesterday, the
lowest since July 5, 2011.  The three-month Eonia swap was 6.4 basis points, compared
with 6.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight index average, or
Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.106 percent
yesterday from a record low 0.102 the day before.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 330 billion euros ($413 billion)
yesterday, from 334 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
