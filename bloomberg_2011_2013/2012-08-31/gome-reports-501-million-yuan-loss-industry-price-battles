Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) ,  China ’s second-largest electronics retailer, swung to a
first-half loss amid a slowing economy and price battles.  The company posted a loss of 501 million  yuan  ($79 million)
for the six months ended June from a 1.25 billion yuan profit a
year ago, according to a  statement  to the  Hong Kong  stock
exchange today. Sales fell 22 percent to 23.1 billion yuan.  Gome and bigger rival  Suning Appliance Co. (002024)  face more heated
price competition after online retailer 360buy Jingdong Mall
announced plans to cut prices. Consumers have also curbed
spending as China’s economic growth has slowed to its  weakest
pace  since 2009.  Sales declined on a comparable store basis in August and
July although losses narrowed during those months, President
Wang Jun Zhou said in a conference call after the earnings
announcement. The company forecasts improvements in its e-
commerce business, has adequate capital and no plans to raise
funds for now.  “We closed down some non-performing stores in first-tier
cities and we leveraged our market share to forge stronger
relationship with suppliers,” he said, adding that the company
shared resources between its online and brick and mortar stores
to curb costs.  Gome said it will continue developing its e-commerce
business, which reported a loss in the first half. Suning posted
a 29 percent drop in first-half net income to 1.75 billion yuan.  The companies may benefit from 26.5 billion yuan of
subsidies China plans to allocate to promote the use of energy-
saving household appliances and products. The subsidies will
replace a consumption-incentive program that ended Dec. 31,
according to a May statement posted on the government’s website.  Gome closed up 1.5 percent at 67 Hong Kong cents. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
