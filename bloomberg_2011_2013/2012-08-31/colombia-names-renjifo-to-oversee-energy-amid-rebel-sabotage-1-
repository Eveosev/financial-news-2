Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  named Interior Minister Federico Renjifo to lead the
Mines and Energy Ministry as guerrilla sabotage stalls the
nation’s oil production.  Renjifo, 58, replaces  Mauricio Cardenas , whom Santos
appointed to head the finance ministry on Aug. 23. He’s a board
member of state-run oil producer  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , a post he will
keep holding as Mines and Energy Minister, according to the
government’s  website .  He is “a person who has been involved in the energy
industry for many years,” Santos said in a statement today on
his website.  Renjifo will take over the ministry as rebels target
pipelines and equipment in the fifth decade of armed conflict in
Colombia, South America’s third-largest oil supplier. Production
in July slid to 929,200 barrels a day, from 934,000 barrels a
day in June, according to government figures.  The minister has a law degree from Javeriana University in
Bogota. He held the post of deputy mines minister from 1992 to
1994 and also has worked in the  finance ministry  and on
government development projects, according to the interior
ministry. Santos didn’t name Renjifo’s replacement.  Venezuela and Brazil are South America’s largest crude
suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
