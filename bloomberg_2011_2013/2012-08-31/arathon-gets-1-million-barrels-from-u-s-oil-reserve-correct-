(Corrects name of company in first paragraph.)  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  will borrow
1 million barrels of sweet crude oil from the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to resolve short-term supply impacts from
Hurricane Isaac, the Energy Department said.  The loan, which is distinct from a release from the
strategic inventories, will be provided in response to a request
from Marathon under short-term contractual agreements, the
agency said today in a statement.Â   To contact the reporter on this story:
