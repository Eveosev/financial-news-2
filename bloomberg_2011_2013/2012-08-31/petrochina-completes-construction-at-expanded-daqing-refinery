PetroChina Daqing Petrochemical Co.
completed construction of a unit at its plant in northeastern
 China  and raised the annual crude-processing capacity to 10
million metric tons.  The project, with an investment of 1 billion  yuan  ($157
million), involves adding a crude distillation unit with
processing capacity of 6 million tons a year, China National
Petroleum Corp., the parent company,  said  on its website today.
The facility will help meet feedstock demand for a 1.2 million
ton-a-year ethylene unit.  The expanded refinery is scheduled to start operations in
October, according to Daqing Petrochemicalâ€™s  website .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
