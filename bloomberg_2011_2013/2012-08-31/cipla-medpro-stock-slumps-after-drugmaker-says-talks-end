Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP) , a
generic drugmaker, rose the most in two years after it said
allegations against Chief Executive Officer Jerome Smith won’t
have a “financially material impact” on the company.  The stock climbed 7.3 percent to 7.10 rand at 1:25 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the steepest intraday gain since Aug. 31, 2010.
That pared its decline since the CEO was suspended on Aug. 15 to
14 percent.  “The share is very cheap, but there is still a lot of
uncertainty, so it’s hard to know what you are getting for your
money,” said Mathew Menezes, an analyst at Avior Research Ltd.
in Johannesburg. “You can see this in the share volatility.”  Cipla trades at 9.2 times estimated 2012 earnings, while
larger rival  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  trades at 22.21
times estimated profit.  Cipla said on Aug. 29 that unspecified talks were
terminated after it suspending Smith. Cipla didn’t specify the
nature of the allegations against the CEO. A hearing will start
on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
