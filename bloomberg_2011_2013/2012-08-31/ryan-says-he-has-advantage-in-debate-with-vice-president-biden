Representative  Paul Ryan  said his
U.S. House experience will give him an advantage in his match-up
with Vice President  Joe Biden  when the two debate in October.  “He’s good, but I have been in Congress 14 years, and this
is what we do in the House,” Ryan said in an interview with CNN
today. “The Senate, they don’t debate as often, as frequently.
That’s all we do in the House.”  Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, is chairman of the House
Budget Committee. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney
picked him as his running mate on the party’s ticket earlier
this month.  Biden, 69, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 and
served 36 years there before leaving to become President  Barack Obama ’s vice president.  There is one vice presidential debate, scheduled for Oct.
11 in Danville, Kentucky.  “I love debate,” said Ryan, 42. “It’s one of the things
I love about this job.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
