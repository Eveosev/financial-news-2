America Movil  SAB, the mobile-phone
company controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , acquired 30
percent stakes in two Mexican soccer teams, adding entertainment
assets to compete with  Grupo Televisa SAB. (TLEVICPO)   The stakes in Club Pachuca and Club Leon were purchased
from closely held Grupo Pachuca, according to an e-mailed
statement today. Leon, which was promoted to the Mexican soccer
league’s top division this season, is in fifth place in the
standings, while Pachuca is 13th among 18 teams.  America Movil is stockpiling video content, including
sports, to help lure online viewers from Televisa, the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster and the owner of Club
America, one of Mexico’s most popular soccer teams. Televisa has
been encroaching on Slim’s territory by offering home-phone and
Internet service and entering the mobile-phone business.  Slim’s company doesn’t have a license to sell pay-TV
service in Mexico, instead offering free video online of auto
races and events such as the 2011 Pan American Games.  America
Movil (AMXL)  agreed last year to buy DLA Inc., a distributor of movies
and TV programs online and on cable systems, for $50 million.  Outside of Mexico, America Movil operates cable and
satellite carriers in countries such as Brazil and Colombia. The
company represents about 57 percent of Slim’s $73.3 billion net
worth, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  America Movil gained 0.6 percent to 16.94 pesos at the
close in Mexico City, before the soccer acquisitions were
announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
