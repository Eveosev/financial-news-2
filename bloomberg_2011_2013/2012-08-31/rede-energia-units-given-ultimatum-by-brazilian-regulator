Rede Energia SA (REDE4)  electricity
distribution units have a year to prove their financial and
operational viability or lose concessions, Brazilian electricity
regulator Aneel said.  Regulators voted to begin a one-year intervention process
at eight companies owned by Rede Energia including  Centrais
Eletricas Matogrossenses SA. (CMGR4)  Regulators voted on the
interventions in Brasilia today.  The companies will have two months to submit plans for
improving service quality and guaranteeing debt payments, chief
regulator Nelson Hubner told reporters yesterday. If the
companies fail to meet standards and lose licenses their debt
remains the responsibility of Rede Energia, he said.  The intervention period may include capitalization and
discussions with banks to reduce debt levels, he said, without
elaborating.  Separately, creditors of Rede Energia’s  Centrais Eletricas
do Para SA (CELP3)  are scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss a takeover
bid by  Equatorial Energia SA. (EQTL3)  Celpa, as the biggest distributor
in the country’s Amazon region is known, is operating under
bankruptcy protection. If the bid isn’t approved and the company
is declared bankrupt, the government would auction Celpa’s
concessions, Hubner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
