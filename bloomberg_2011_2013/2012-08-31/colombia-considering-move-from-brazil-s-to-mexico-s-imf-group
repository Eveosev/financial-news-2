Colombia is considering a move from
the constituency led by Brazil at the  International Monetary
Fund , to the one led by Mexico, outgoing Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said.  “We have been exploring different possibilities, and
that’s still ongoing,” Echeverry said in an interview in
Barranquilla, on Colombia’s Caribbean coast. “To us, the
constituency with Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and the Central
American countries seems very attractive.”  Colombia is currently represented on the IMF’s 24-member
executive board by Paulo Nogueira Batista, the fund’s executive
director for Brazil. The group also includes the  Dominican
Republic , Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti, Panama, Suriname and  Trinidad
and Tobago . Most IMF members are grouped into constituencies of
between four and 24 members, though some large economies, such
as the U.S. and China, have their own seat.  Echeverry said he will apply to become director of the
International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere department,
after Nicolas Eyzaguirre said last month that he plans to leave
the post to become chairman of Chilean television channel Canal
13.  Echeverry, who described himself in a February interview as
“a conservative with a copy of Keynes on his bedside table”,
quit President  Juan Manuel Santos ’ government last week citing
personal reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
