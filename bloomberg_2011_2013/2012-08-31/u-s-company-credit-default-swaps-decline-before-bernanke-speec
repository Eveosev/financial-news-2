A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk fell the most in two weeks before a speech by
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  which may signal the
central bank’s willingness to do more quantitative easing.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 101.5 basis points at
8:07 a.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the biggest decline since a 1.5 basis-point
decrease on Aug. 17.  Bernanke is scheduled to speak at a meeting of central
bankers today in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , where his address in
2010 preceded a second round of quantitative easing. Any move by
the U.S. central bank to purchase more bonds would reduce
concern that companies may struggle to make debt repayments amid
a slowing economy.  The swaps measure, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, reached a 15-
week low of 98.5 basis points on Aug. 20, and has dropped 6
basis points in August. The contracts pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
