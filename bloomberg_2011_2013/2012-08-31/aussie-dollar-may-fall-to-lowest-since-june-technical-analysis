The Australian dollar may drop over
the next month to the lowest level since June after it breached
a key support level, Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. said,
citing trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie yesterday fell below its 200-day
moving average of $1.0315 and is poised for further losses,
according to Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at Gaitame.com, a
unit of  Japan ’s largest currency-margin company. The currency
will probably slide further if it drops below $1.0219, the 38.2
percent retracement on a Fibonacci chart of its climb from 95.82
U.S. cents on June 1 to $1.0613 on Aug. 9, Kawabata said. He
said it may fall as low as $1.0098, the 50 percent retracement
and a level unseen since June 29.  The Australian dollar “can probably extend losses toward
the next level of retracement” if it breaks below $1.0219,
Kawabata said. “It shouldn’t take too long for the Aussie to
test $1.009, probably within a month.”  The Aussie dollar fetched $1.0291 as of 11 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0289 yesterday, when it touched $1.0277, the lowest
since July 25. The currency is poised for a 1.1 percent drop
this week and a 2 percent decline this month.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages from
previous highs or lows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
