A bus collided with a train near the
Azeri capital of Baku, killing 6 people and injuring about 47,
according to the country’s Health Ministry.  The driver lost control of the crowded Daewoo bus when
passing a railway crossing in a suburb of Baku at about 7:30
a.m. local time today and was hit by a train travelling from
Agstafa in the west to the capital, Anar Qadirli, head of the
ministry’s press service, said by phone. The death toll was
revised down from 16, which was reported earlier by Interfax.  The cause of the crash is still being investigated,
according to the Health Ministry. Eyewitnesses told Azeri news
service APA that the train pulled the bus along the rails for
about 20 meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
