Catalonia’s credit rating was cut to
junk by  Standard & Poor’s  after  Spain ’s most indebted region
said it will need to tap a national rescue fund.  S&P lowered Catalonia, the largest of Spain’s 17 autonomous
regions, by two grades to BB from BBB- with a negative outlook,
the rating company said today in a statement.  The Spanish region of Murcia this week became the third to
say it will need emergency loans, and Valencia signaled it needs
funds to cover current and past overspending, adding fiscal
pressure on Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy . Catalonia will seek 5
billion euros ($6.3 billion), almost a third of the 18 billion-
euro fund announced in July by the government after being locked
out of financial markets.  The country’s 17 semi-autonomous regions risk overwhelming
a plan to tackle the euro area’s  third-biggest  budget deficit as
Rajoy bails them out for a fourth time this year. The regions
were responsible last year for most of Spain’s overspending and
control more than a third of public spending, are increasingly
being shunned by investors, mirroring the dynamic of the euro-
region debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
