Pernod Ricard SA (RI) , France’s biggest
distiller, will remain assured of its independence in the short,
medium and long-term by the Ricard family’s holding,  Le Figaro 
said, citing Alexandre Ricard,  Pernod started a process yesterday to promote Alexandre Ricard to the dual role of chairman and chief executive officer
from 2015, following the death this month of his uncle Patrick Ricard. Societe Paul Ricard, through which the family holds its
stake, owns 13.81 percent of the group, data compiled by
