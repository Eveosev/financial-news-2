Solaria Energia Medio Ambiente SA,
 Spain ’s only publicly traded solar company, said it will begin
talks to cut jobs at its factory in Puertollano, Spain.  The factory employs 290 workers, and the discussions aim to
“bring resources and labor costs in line with activity in the
photovoltaic sector,” Madrid-based Solaria said today in a
statement on its website.  Solaria said manufacturing will remain one of its principal
business areas, and it’ll explore setting up new plants in
nations around the world where the markets are “more
favorable.”  In an earlier statement, Solaria said it lost 6.6 million
euros ($8.3 million) in the first six months of 2012, down from
a profit of 516,000 euros in the same period a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
