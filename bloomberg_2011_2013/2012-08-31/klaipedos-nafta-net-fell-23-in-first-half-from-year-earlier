Klaipedos Nafta AB, Lithuaniaâ€™s oil
terminal on the Baltic sea, said profit fell 23 percent in the
first six months from a year earlier because its biggest client
oil refiner, Orlen Lietuva AB, closed for repairs.  Net income fell to 21.5 million litai ($7.78 million) from
27.9 million litai in the first six months ending June 30, the
Klaipeda-based company said in a statement to the stock exchange
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
