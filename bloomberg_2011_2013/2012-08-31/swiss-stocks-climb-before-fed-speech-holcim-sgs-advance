Swiss stocks advanced, rebounding
from a one-month low.  The Swiss Market Index rose 0.3 percent to 6,397.66 at
10:15 a.m. in Zurich before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  delivers his annual speech on monetary policy today.  The gauge dropped 0.7 percent yesterday to the lowest level
since July 27 as reports from Germany to Japan added to evidence
that global growth is slowing while speculation cooled that
Bernanke will announce more stimulus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
