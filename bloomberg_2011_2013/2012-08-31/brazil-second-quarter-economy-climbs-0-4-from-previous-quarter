Brazil ’s economy expanded 0.4
percent in the second quarter, the national statistics agency
said today in  Rio de Janeiro .  Analysts had forecast growth of 0.5 percent from the first
quarter, according to the median estimate from 51 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross domestic product expanded 0.5
percent from a year earlier, as compared to the 0.7 increase
forecast by 47 economists.  Latin America’s largest economy has faltered since last
year amid the European debt crisis and weaker Chinese demand for
Brazil’s exports. The government has responded with tax cuts for
goods ranging from automobiles to appliances in a bid to prop up
consumer demand, while the central bank has cut its benchmark
lending rate to a record low.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday he expects
growth will accelerate to a 4 percent annualized rate in the
fourth quarter and reach 4.5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
