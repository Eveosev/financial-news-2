The planned common banking
supervisor for euro-area countries should cover medium-sized
lenders to minimize systemic risks, according to former European
Commission President  Romano Prodi .  “If you have many medium-sized banks that don’t respect
the rules, you have a systemic danger,” Prodi said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview near Versailles,  France . “How
can you exercise control only on 10 banks or let’s say a number
like that” while having “the biggest part of the system not
respecting the rules?” he said.  The  European Central Bank  would have the sole power to
grant banking licenses under proposals to give it supervisory
powers and build a euro-area banking union, a European Union
official said today, speaking on condition of anonymity because
the plan isn’t final. While the Frankfurt-based ECB could decide
to withdraw banks’ licenses, national regulators would still
control when to shut down a lender.  Under the proposals, which are being drafted by the
European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, the ECB would also
gain discretion over which banks to supervise directly and when
it will delegate day-to-day oversight responsibilities, the
official said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
