The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will commit 800 million euros ($1 billion) to
 Serbia  over the next two years to aid its economic recovery and
help reduce unemployment.  The Balkan nation must also “tackle its fiscal deficit,”
which is expected to exceed the 4.25 percent of economic output
target this year as set out in its bailout loan program, EBRD
President Suma Chakrabarti told reporters in Belgrade today.  “The key thing for Serbia is to get growth in the economy
and to reduce unemployment which is far too high,” Chakrabarti
said after meeting with Serbian government officials. We’ll be
here helping in the years ahead.’’  Serbia’s economy is in the midst of its second recession in
three years and unemployment rose to 25.5 percent in the first
six months, compared with 23 percent in 2011. The budget deficit
reached 7.2 percent of gross domestic product in the first six
months of 2012.  The government also wants the EBRD to invest in local
banks, in addition to its current stakes in  Cacanska Banka AD (CCNB) 
and  Komercijalna Banka AD (KMBN) , Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said.  Most of the funding will be used for infrastructure and
energy projects, Dinkic said. Serbia may offer the EBRD a
minority ownership in state-controlled companies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
