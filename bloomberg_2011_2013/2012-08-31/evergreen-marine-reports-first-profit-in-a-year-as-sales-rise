     Aug. 31 (Bloomberg) --  Evergreen Marine  Corp., operator of
 Asia ’s No. 2 container-shipping line, had its first quarterly
profit in a year as sales increased on higher freight rates.  Net income  rose to NT$858 million ($29 million) in the
three months through June from NT$81 million a year earlier,
based on calculations using six-month results announced by the
Taipei-based company today. The average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a second-quarter profit
of NT$804 million.  Evergreen Marine joins APL Ltd. in reporting improved
earnings after industry-wide losses last year prompted carriers
to boost cooperation and raise rates. The company’s second-
quarter consolidated sales jumped 32 percent from a year
earlier, based on  monthly filings  to the Taiwan stock exchange.  Evergreen fell 1.8 percent to close at NT$16 in Taipei
trading today, before the announcement. The  stock  has risen 4.6
percent this year, matching the gain in the benchmark Taiex
stock index.  Before today, the company had posted three straight
quarterly losses.  The first-half net loss was NT$2.4 billion, compared with a
profit of NT$1.39 billion a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Taiwan stock exchange today.  Evergreen Line operates 180 vessels with a combined
capacity of 694,415 containers, according to  Alphaliner  data.
 China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) ’s container-shipping unit is Asia’s
biggest with a capacity for 716,331 containers.  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL)  said Aug. 8 that APL, its
container-shipping arm, had its first quarterly profit since
2010 because of higher freight rates and cost-savings.  To contact the reporter on the story:
