Tiger Woods shares the opening-round
lead at the U.S. PGA Tour’s second playoff event after a 7-
under-par round of 64.  Woods had eight birdies and a bogey at the TPC Boston in
Norton, Massachusetts. He’s tied with  Jeff Overton  and two shots
ahead of  John Senden  and 2010 British Open winner  Louis Oosthuizen  among players who have completed play.  “I played really well today,” Woods, 36, told reporters.
“I hit a lot of good shots, and on top of that, I putted well
at the same time. It was a nice little combination.”  A two-time winner of the PGA Tour’s season-long FedExCup
points title, Woods tied for 38th at last week’s Barclays event,
the first of four playoff tournaments to decide the season’s
overall champion. He entered this week third in the standings
behind Barclays winner  Nick Watney  and Brandt Snedeker.  After this week’s tournament, which includes the top 100
players in the standings, the field will get reduced to 70 for
the BMW Championship at Crooked Stick Golf Club next week. It’s
the first time Crooked Stick will host a PGA Tour event since
 John Daly  won the 1991 PGA Championship at the Carmel, Indiana,
course.  After a one-week break, the top 30 players on the points
list will contend for the FedExCup title at the Tour
Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
