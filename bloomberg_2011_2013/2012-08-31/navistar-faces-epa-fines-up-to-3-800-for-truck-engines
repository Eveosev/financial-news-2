Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International-brand trucks, may be fined as much as
$3,800 for each of its heavy-duty engines that don’t meet U.S.
pollution standards.  The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement
late yesterday that it’s raising the penalties for selling non-
compliant engines from as much as $2,000 apiece, as proposed
seven months ago.  With the final rule, “we can now provide our dealers and
customers with clarity and certainty as we transition to our
clean-engine technology and look forward to utilizing” it, Troy
Clarke, Navistar president and chief operating officer, said in
a statement yesterday.  Navistar chose to meet tightened U.S. truck-emissions
standards with exhaust gas recirculation. Competitors including
 Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  have adopted selective catalyst
reduction technology, and fought the penalties the EPA had
proposed in January, saying they were adopted illegally and set
too low.  Nitrogen oxides exacerbate breathing and asthma problems,
and can lead to the formation of ozone.  The penalty “allows manufacturers to continue producing
and selling engines that come close to air-pollution standards
as they work toward full compliance,” the federal agency said
in its statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
