Spot diesel in  San Francisco  rose
for a fourth day to reach the highest premium to futures since
at least 2007 as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  was said to plan shutting
the flexicoker at its Martinez refinery.  Shell will take the unit offline for three weeks starting
Sept. 4 for planned maintenance, a person familiar with the work
said. Shell reported a planned shutdown of the unit in an Aug.
28 filing with county regulators. The company did not return a
message on its media phone line for comment.  Flexicokers convert heavy hydrocarbons such as residual oil
into lighter products. The Martinez refinery’s flexicoker can
process 22,500 barrels of feedstock a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco gained 2
cents to a premium of 36 cents a gallon more than heating oil
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:09 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the
highest differential for the fuel since Bloomberg began
assessing prices there in November 2007.  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  fell 4 cents to 29 cents a
gallon above Nymex heating oil futures.  CARB  diesel inventories  tumbled 15 percent, or 303,000
barrels, to 1.75 million in the week ended Aug. 24, the state
Energy Commission said by e-mail. That’s the lowest level since
August 2005 and the third weekly decline.  Shut Production  Phillips 66 (PSX)  shut production from its coker at the Rodeo
refinery Aug. 29 after a small fire in the unit the day before,
a person with direct knowledge of the incident said at the time.
The unit was expected to run at 50 percent of capacity yesterday
and at full rates by the end of the week.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery
also cut diesel output last week after a compressor failure at a
hydrodesulfurization unit, a person with direct knowledge of the
upset said Aug. 21.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  has been producing fuels at a reduced
capacity at the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern California, since an Aug. 6 fire shut the
plant’s only crude unit.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
gained 3.5 cents to 29 cents a gallon above Nymex gasoline
futures. The same fuel in Los Angeles rose 3.5 cents to 28 cents
a gallon over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland,  Oregon ,
jumped 5 cents to a premium of 40 cents a gallon above Nymex
gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in  Portland  increased 4.5
cents to 35 cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
