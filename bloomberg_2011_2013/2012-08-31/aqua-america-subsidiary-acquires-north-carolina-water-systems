Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , a water and
wastewater service provider, said today that its North Carolina
unit purchased the water system assets of Fox Run Water Co. and
Moseley-Nash Enterprises, its second acquisition this month.  The $175,000 deal for 12 water systems by the  Bryn Mawr ,
Pennsylvania-based company, which has 3 million customers in 10
U.S. states from Texas to New Jersey, comes three weeks after
adding 26 water systems for $400,000 in the Lake Gaston area of
southern Virgnia near the North Carolina border.  Aqua America reported record second-quarter earnings last
month, buoyed by an 11 percent increase in revenue and an Ohio
acquisition. The shares have risen 13 percent the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
