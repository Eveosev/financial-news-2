Rubber declined for a sixth straight
month after  Japan ’s industrial production unexpectedly slumped,
adding to concern that a global economic slowdown will curb raw-
material demand.  February-delivery rubber lost 1.6 percent to close at 217.8
yen a kilogram ($2,776 a ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange,
the lowest settlement level since Aug. 16. The most-active
contract has dropped 5.2 percent this month, extending this
year’s decline to 17 percent. The sixth monthly drop is the
worst run since 2008.  Japan’s industrial output fell 1.2 percent in July, while
consumer prices decreased 0.3 percent, government data showed
today. The figures reflect diminishing demand overseas for the
nation’s exports amid the European crisis and exchange-rate
appreciation, and the end of incentives for vehicle purchases.  “Data showing a slowdown in the global economy sapped
investor appetite,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  Japan’s weakening accompanies signs of slowing across Asia.
 South Korea  today reported a  1.6 percent drop  in industrial
production in July from the previous month.  January-delivery rubber lost 1.3 percent to close at 21,490
 yuan  ($3,385) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 85.85 baht ($2.74) a
kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
