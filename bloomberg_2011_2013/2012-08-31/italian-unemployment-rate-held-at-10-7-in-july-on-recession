Italy ’s jobless rate held at a
seasonally-adjusted 10.7 percent in July as employers remain
reluctant to hire amid a deepening recession.  June’s reading was revised to 10.7 percent from 10.8
percent, Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report today. Economists forecast an increase to
10.9 percent in July, the median of eight estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Italy’s economy contracted for a fourth straight quarter in
the three months through June as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
policies contributed to deepening the fourth recession since
2001.  The young have been particularly hard hit, with joblessness
among people aged 15 to 24 at 35.3 percent in July, Istat said.  Concerns the economic slump will worsen prompted  Fiat SpA (F) 
to temporarily stop new investments in Italy. Chief Executive
Officer  Sergio Marchionne  may close another factory after
shuttering a plant in Sicily last year. The carmaker will also
halt production at Pomigliano, near Naples, for two weeks
starting Sept. 24 because of weak demand, a union official said
Aug. 29.  Joblessness in the second quarter rose to 10.6 percent from
10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, Istat said
today. The statistics agency originally reported June
unemployment at 10.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
