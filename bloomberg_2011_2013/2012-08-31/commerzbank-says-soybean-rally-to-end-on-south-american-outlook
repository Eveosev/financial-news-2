Soybean prices, which rallied to a
record yesterday, may not extend gains because production in
 South America  is set to surge, Commerzbank AG said.  Brazil ’s soybean harvest “is set to soar” to 81 million
to 82 million metric tons this year,  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst
at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mailed report today.
The country harvested 65.5 million tons in the 2011-12 season
when drought hurt crops, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Soybeans jumped to a record $17.7125 a bushel
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade and are up 45 percent in
2012 as the U.S. suffered its worst drought in more than 50
years.  “We believe the supply shortfalls in the U.S. are
sufficiently priced in, and envisage no further price rises for
soybeans,” Fritsch wrote. “Investors are evidently so
preoccupied with the crop prospects in the U.S. that they are
entirely ignoring the fact that Brazil is likely for the first
time to become the world’s largest soybean producer this year,
ahead of even the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
