Turkey’s  trade deficit  narrowed for
a 10th consecutive month in August, the statistics office said.  The gap declined to $5.86 billion, down from $8.23 billion
for the same month a year earlier the statistics office in
Ankara said on its  website  today. The shortfall was expected at
$8 billion, according to the median estimate of seven economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Turkey has managed to diversify exports away from crisis-
hit Europe, its biggest market, toward the  Middle East , Asia and
 Africa . Import growth has slowed as the central bank tightened
monetary policy to curb growth in  consumer credit , which had
contributed to a current account gap that surpassed 10 percent
of economic output at the end of last year.  That deficit helped the lira down by more than 18 percent
in 2011. The currency has pared losses this year, adding about 6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
