OPEC  oil production declined for a
second month in July as Iranian output tumbled to a 22-year low,
a Bloomberg survey showed.  Production fell 393,000 barrels, or 1.2 percent, to an
average 31.165 million barrels a day this month from 31.558
million in June, according to the survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts. It was the second straight decrease
after daily output reached 21.62 million barrels in May, the
highest level since October 2008.  Iran pumped 2.86 million barrels a day, down 300,000
barrels from June and the lowest level since February 1990. The
Islamic republic was the third-biggest producer the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in July, after Saudi Arabia and
Iraq. Iran had been the second-biggest since May 2000.  “Increasing sanctions are going to result in further
declines in Iranian oil production,” said  Rick Mueller , a
principal with ESAI Energy LLC in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .
“The Iranians are going to struggle to find buyers and will
have to shut in production. There are only so many countries
that are willing to go against both the U.S. and Europe and
purchase Iranian oil.”  European Ban  A European Union ban on the purchase, transport, financing
and insurance of Iranian oil began on July 1. Sanctions aimed at
stopping  Iran’s nuclear program  have curbed investment in
infrastructure and hindered the country’s ability to export.  Saudi Arabia  increased output by 50,000 barrels a day to
9.88 million this month. The desert kingdom pumped 9.9 million
barrels a day in May, the highest level since at least 1989.  Iraqi production  decreased 10,000 barrels to 2.95 million a
day this month. Output in April surged to 2.98 million barrels a
day, the highest level since October 2000. The country’s output
had been depressed since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003.  “Iraqi production continues to increase, which will
mitigate the impact of Iranian cuts,” Mueller said.  Nigeria and  Angola , Africa’s biggest oil producers, had the
second- and third-biggest output declines in OPEC this month,
according to the survey.  Nigeria ’s production slipped 75,000
barrels a day to 2.105 million. Angola pumped 1.725 million
barrels a day, down 65,000 barrels from June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
