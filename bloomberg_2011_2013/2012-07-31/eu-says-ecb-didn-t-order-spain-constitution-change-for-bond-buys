The  European Central Bank  didn’t
tell  Spain  to change its constitution in exchange for bond
purchases by the central bank in August last year, the European
Union’s ombudsman said.  Nikiforos Diamandouros, who investigates complaints about
EU institutions, responded to a request from a Spanish lawyer
for access to a letter the ECB sent then Prime Minister  Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  as the central bank started buying
Spanish bonds. Diamandouros backed the ECB’s refusal to publish
the letter and said it contained no call for a constitutional
amendment, the EU said in a  statement  today.  A month after the ECB started propping up Spain’s bond
market to bring down yields, Zapatero changed the constitution
for only the second time since it was adopted 30 years earlier
to enshrine budget discipline in the charter. The amendment
prompted street protests and a rebellion within Zapatero’s
Socialist Party, while 29 lawmakers boycotted the vote in
Parliament.  Neither the former government nor Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy , who backed the amendment, have ever commented on the
contents of the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
