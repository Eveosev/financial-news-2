Iran  Khodro Co., the country’s
largest carmaker, can produce most of the parts for the Peugeot
206 model,  Fars  reported, citing a top company official.  The company is “self-sufficient in producing 90 percent of
the parts” for that car, said Hossein Najjari, Iran Khodro’s
deputy for production affairs, according to the state-run Fars
news agency. “Efforts are made to use local suppliers for parts
that were previously imported.”  PSA Peugeot Citroen suspended sales of car assembly kits to
Iran in February, the report said. Locally assembled versions of
the Peugeot 405 and 206 models are prevalent in Iran, it said.  U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions against
Iran over its nuclear activities have limited energy, trade and
financial interaction with the Persian Gulf nation. Iran rejects
U.S. accusations that its nuclear program is a cover for
developing atomic weapons and says it’s needed for power
generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
