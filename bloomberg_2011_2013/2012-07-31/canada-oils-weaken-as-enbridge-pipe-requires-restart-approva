Canadian oils weakened for a second
day as an  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  pipeline that helps move  Alberta  crudes
to U.S. refiners remained shut following a leak last week.  The Calgary-based company shut Line 14, which runs from
Superior,  Wisconsin  to the Griffith-Hartsdale area in  Indiana ,
after the 317,600-barrel-a-day pipe spilled an estimated 1,200
barrels of oil July 27. Enbridge can’t start transporting crude
on the line until it submits a plan to the U.S. Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration for approval.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened 75 cents to $22.75
a barrel below West Texas Intermediate at 4:04 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude fell $1.50 to a discount of $5.50 versus the U.S.
benchmark. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like
bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount widened $1 to $5 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark was
unchanged at $17 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet’s
increased 5 cents to $17.45.  Poseidon’s premium added 45 cents to $11.85 and Southern
Green Canyon increased 10 cents $11 a barrel over WTI. Mars
Blend gained 30 cents to $12.40.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $15.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
