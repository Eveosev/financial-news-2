Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the state
oil company known as PDVSA, wants to invest in Argentina to help
the country increase oil production, President  Hugo Chavez  said
today in Brasilia.  YPF SA (YPFD) , Arentina’s largest oil producer, is also working on
plans to start working in Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy crude belt
and may enter the Petroanzoategui heavy crude upgrading project,
Chavez said.  “We’ll work to recover space and time so that YPF soon
will be in the Orinoco, and in fields that are already
producing,” said Chavez. “We’ll keep our presence in
Argentina’s offshore fields, and later we’ll work on refining.”  Venezuelan Oil Minister and PDVSA president Rafael Ramirez
is traveling to Buenos Aires for additional meetings with YPF
officials, Chavez told reporters. PDVSA operates the
Petroanzoategui oil upgrader, which converts heavy crude into
lighter oil, with a 100 percent stake after Chavez nationalized
the stake held by  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in 2007.  Argentina nationalized a 51 percent stake of YPF held by
Spanish oil company  Repsol SA (REP)  in April.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
