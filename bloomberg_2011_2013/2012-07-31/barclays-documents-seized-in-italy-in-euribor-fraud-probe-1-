Barclays Plc (BARC)  offices in Milan were
searched by Italian prosecutors who seized documents as part of
a fraud and market-manipulation probe into banks’ roles in
setting the Euribor benchmark interest rate.  Police obtained files dating from 2007 through 2012,
including e-mails, Michele Ruggiero, a prosecutor in the city of
Trani, said by phone today. Officials for Barclays in  London 
declined to immediately comment.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank, was fined a
record 290 million pounds ($455 million) last month for
attempting to rig the London interbank offered rate and Euribor,
its equivalent in euros, to appear healthier during the
financial crisis. U.K. fraud prosecutors yesterday said they
will investigate the manipulation of Libor and other  interest
rates  after deciding that existing British criminal law covers
the conduct involved.  Italian consumer groups Adusbef and Federconsumatori, which
filed a complaint earlier this month, estimated that the
manipulation affected 2.5 million Italian households with
mortgages tied to Euribor, costing them 3 billion euros ($3.7
billion), based on record 2008 Euribor rates.  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond , Chairman
Marcus Agius and Chief Operating Officer Jerry Del Missier all
stepped down following the fine and criticism from the U.K.
regulator. Their departures were followed by Alison Carnwath,
head of the British bank’s remuneration committee, who stepped
down on July 25.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
