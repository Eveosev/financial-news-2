Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its biggest four-day rally this year,
on speculation policy makers from the U.S. to  Europe  and China
will do more to stimulate economic growth.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, advanced 5.8
percent in  Tokyo  on a share buyback plan, pacing gains among
technology shares. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. soared 14
percent, leading Japanese utilities higher after raising its
sales forecast. Campbell Brothers Ltd., a provider of laboratory
services for the  mining industry , slumped 10 percent in Sydney
after saying volatility and uncertainty in the global economy
may have a negative earnings impact.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.1 percent to 118.66 as
of 7:40 p.m. in Tokyo with more than two shares gaining for each
that fell. The measure has added 5.1 percent in the last four
days, the biggest such advance since Dec. 2, taking its monthly
increase to 1.2 percent, a second straight gain.  “The markets are really focused on central bank actions
rather than the economic environment,” said Matthew Sherwood,
head of markets research for Sydney-based Perpetual Investments,
which manages about $25 billion. “The problem in the global
economy is the solvency of balance sheets of the government and
banks around the world.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 9 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen as the U.S. and Chinese
economies slow. The regional benchmark index traded at 11.9
times  estimated earnings , compared with 13.5 for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 11.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei Gains  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.7 percent after
the nation’s jobless rate dropped in June. South Korea’s Kospi
Index advanced 2.1 percent even after data showed industrial
production dropped. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.6 percent,
rising 4.3 percent in July, the biggest monthly advance since
January. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 0.7 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.1 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. Singapore’s
Straits Times Index, the best-performing Asian developed-market
gauge this month, climbed 0.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2
percent today. The gauge lost less than 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday, snapping a two-day rally, ahead of an Aug. 3 report
that may show the pace of hiring in July failed to reduce the
U.S. jobless rate.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will announce a policy
decision tomorrow, and the  European Central Bank  will convene on
Aug. 2. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  backed a commitment by
European leaders to do everything needed to defend the euro area
while failing to mention its weakest link,  Greece .  ‘Investors Expectations’  “Investors may be buying on expectations the U.S. and
Europe may ease monetary policy,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33
trillion yen ($422 billion) in assets. “Japanese stock prices
are lagging those in the U.S. and Europe, so this may be driving
the market.”  Canon paced gains among technology companies, which
advanced the most of the 10 industry groups on MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. The stock climbed 5.8 percent to 2,650 yen on plans to
spend 50 billion yen ($639 million) to buy back as many as 21
million shares.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , a consumer-electronics maker that
gets 39 percent of its sales in America and Europe, added 2.7
percent to 1.309 million won in  Seoul .  Earnings Reports  Of the 1,007 companies listed on the Asian benchmark gauge,
261 are scheduled to post earnings this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 243 companies that reported this
month for which Bloomberg had earnings estimates, more than half
failed to meet expectations. Earnings per share at companies on
the index are expected to grow 20 percent this fiscal year.  Hokuriku Electric surged 14 percent to 799 yen, the biggest
gain on the Asia-Pacific measure, after raising its fiscal-year
sales forecast. The stock capped its biggest increase since
1988.  Campbell Brothers tumbled 10 percent to A$46.90, the
biggest drop since 2009, as the company forecast first-half net
income after tax of A$130 million to A$140 million ($137 million
to $147 million), and saying it didn’t expect second-half growth
will match the first half. The stock fell the most on the Asia-
Pacific gauge.  Among other stocks that fell,  China Rongsheng Heavy
Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101)  dropped 8.6 percent to HK$1.07 in
Hong Kong after its rating was cut to “underweight” by
Barclays Plc. The stock yesterday plunged to its lowest since
2010 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
complaint accusing a company owned by Chairman Zhang Zhi Rong of
 insider trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
