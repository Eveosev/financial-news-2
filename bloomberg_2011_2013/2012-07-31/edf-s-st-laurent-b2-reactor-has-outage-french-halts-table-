Electricite de France SA had an
unplanned outage at its 915-megawatt St. Laurent-des-Eaux B2
nuclear plant at 10 a.m. Paris time, according to the nation’s
grid operator, Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  No reason was given for the halt. EDF also delayed the
starts of its Penly-2 and Cattenom-4 nuclear power plants, RTE
data show.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
40 reactors online, representing 68 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 atomic plants generate about
78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out
of service, their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
