South Africa  posted its sixth
consecutive monthly trade deficit in June as exports of mineral
products, which includes coal and iron ore, declined, the South
African Revenue Service said.  The  shortfall  narrowed to 5.7 billion rand ($696 million)
from 8.9 billion rand in May, the Pretoria-based agency said
today in an e-mailed statement. The  median estimate  of seven
economists in a Bloomberg survey was a deficit of 5 billion
rand.  A debt crisis in  Europe , which buys a third of South
Africa’s manufactured exports, has curbed demand, boosting the
 trade gap  for the first half of the year to 51.1 billion rand
from 2.5 billion rand a year earlier. That’s widened the deficit
on the current account, the broadest measure of trade of goods
and services, undermining the rand.  Exports fell 1.7 percent to 61.7 billion rand in June from
the previous month as shipments of mineral products slumped 13
percent, the revenue service said. Imports declined 6 percent to
67.4 billion rand as purchases of oil fell 11 percent, it said.  South Africa posted a  current-account deficit  of 4.9
percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, the
biggest in three years, the central bank said on June 21.
Africa’s biggest economy relies on foreign investment in stocks
and bonds to finance the current-account deficit, inflows that
have fluctuated this year as slower economic growth led
investors to sell riskier, emerging-market assets.  The monthly trade figures are often volatile, reflecting
the timing of shipments of commodities such as  oil  and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
