The FBI’s new computer system for
managing cases, $26 million over budget and first scheduled to
be in place at the end of 2009, became operational this month.  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  system, called
Sentinel, now serves as the bureau’s records repository and
provides agents and analysts with a Web-based system to manage
evidence and automate the review of documents, the agency said
today.  The project was announced in 2006 at an estimated total
cost of $425 million to replace the agency’s paper-based files.
It was originally scheduled to be in place more than two years
ago.  More than 30,000 FBI employees have used the system since
the bureau officially made the switch on July 1, the bureau said
today. The final amount allocated for the project was $451
million.  After multiple critical reports from the Justice
Department’s inspector general, delays and cost overruns, the
agency reduced the role of contractors involved in the
development process and took full control in 2010.  The bureau demonstrated Sentinel for reporters at FBI
headquarters in  Washington  today.  The  Justice Department ’s inspector general in December
released a report outlining concerns over costs, effectiveness
and schedule delays. It was the inspector general’s eighth
report on the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
