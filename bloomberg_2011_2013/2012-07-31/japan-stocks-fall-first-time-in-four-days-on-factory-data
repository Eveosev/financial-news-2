Japanese  stocks  rose for a fourth
day amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  and the  European
Central Bank  may signal moves to stimulate economic growth.
Shares also gained as Japan’s jobless rate unexpectedly fell.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets about a half of its
sales from  North America  and Europe, rose 2.1 percent. Hokuriku
Electric Power Co. soared 14 percent after first-quarter
earnings rose.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s second-biggest
shipping line by revenue, added 2.1 percent after reporting
losses narrowed.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker,
surged 5.8 percent after saying it will buy back shares.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.7 percent to 8,695.06
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The gauge lost 3.6
percent this month, the worst performance in the period after
Spain among the 24 benchmark developed-market equity indexes
tracked by Bloomberg News. The broader  Topix (TPX)  today rose 0.6
percent to 736.31, reversing an earlier 0.5 percent decline.  “Investors may be buying on expectations the U.S. and
Europe may ease monetary policy,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33
trillion yen in assets. “Japanese stock prices are lagging
those in the U.S. and Europe, so this may be driving the
market.”  Shares also gained as Japan’s jobless rate unexpectedly
declined in June to 4.3 percent, beating analyst expectations
that unemployment would remain flat at 4.4 percent.  The Topix lost 16 percent since March 27, leaving the gauge
trading at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the
S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number
less than one means that companies can be bought for less than
value of their assets.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.3
percent today. The gauge lost less than 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday, snapping a two-day rally, ahead of an Aug. 3 report
that may show the pace of hiring in July failed to reduce the
U.S. jobless rate.  The Federal Open Market Committee will announce a policy
decision tomorrow, and the European Central Bank will convene on
Aug. 2. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  backed a commitment by
European leaders to do everything needed to defend the euro area
while failing to mention Greece, its weakest link.  Honda rose 2.1 percent to 2,551 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic components maker that earns almost a third of its
revenue from the U.S. and Europe, climbed 1.6 percent to 6,250
yen. Asahi Glass Co., which gets more than 25 percent of its
sales from the U.S. and Europe, jumped 3.4 percent to 463 yen.  Market Focus  “At the moment, the markets are really focused on central
bank actions rather than the economic environment,” said
Matthew Sherwood, head of markets research at Sydney-based
Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25 billion. “The
problem in the global economy is the solvency of balance sheets
of the government and banks around the world.”  Today was the busiest day in Japan’s earnings season, with
271 of the 1,672 companies listed on the Topix reporting. Of the
124 companies that have  reported  since July 1 that have issued
forecasts, 48 percent have exceeded expectations, according to
Bloomberg data.  Hokuriku Electric (9505)  soared 14 percent to 799 yen, the biggest
gain since June 1988, after operating profit in the quarter
ended June 30 jumped 58 percent to 16.8 billion yen ($215
million) due to lower costs. The stock rebounded from a 21
percent drop on July 18 on a report there may be an active fault
under one of the utility’s reactors.  Mitsui O.S.K. added 2.1 percent to 239 yen after its first-
quarter operating loss narrowed to 503 million yen from 8.6
billion yen a year earlier. The shipping line revised its first-
half forecast to a 1 billion yen operating profit from a 1
billion yen loss, citing improved container rates and lower fuel
costs.  Canon Buyback  Canon climbed 5.8 percent to 2,650 yen, the heaviest
contributor to the Nikkei 225’s gain, after saying it will spend
50 billion yen to buy back as much as 1.8 percent of its
outstanding shares through Sept. 10.  Banking shares were the second-biggest decliners among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
 Japan ’s biggest publicly traded bank, fell 1 percent to 381 yen
after Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG reported second-quarter profit
that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
