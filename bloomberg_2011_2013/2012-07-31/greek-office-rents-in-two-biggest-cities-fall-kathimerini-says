Athens  and Thessaloniki ranked among
cities with the biggest drops in office rents in the 12 months
to March 2012,  Kathimerini  reported, citing a report by CBRE
Group Inc.  Office rents in Athens dropped 13.5 percent in the period,
making it the city with the fifth-largest decline in the survey
of 133 cities worldwide, while Greeceâ€™s second-largest city
Thessaloniki was third with a fall of 16.3 percent, the
newspaper said.  Hong Kong  and  Abu Dhabi  were the two cities with
the biggest decline, Kathimerini said.  Office rents in Athens were at their lowest level in 17
years in the first quarter of this year. In the most expensive
area, rents were at 24 euros a month per square meter compared
with as much as 35 euros a few years ago, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
