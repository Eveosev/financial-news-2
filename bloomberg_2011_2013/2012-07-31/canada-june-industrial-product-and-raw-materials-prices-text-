The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) declined 0.3% in
June compared with May. The decrease was largely attributable to
lower prices for petroleum and coal products (-5.0%), but was
partly offset by an increase in motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment (+1.0%). The Raw Materials Price Index
(RMPI) fell 4.0%, mainly as a result of crude oil (-10.1%).  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI recorded a second consecutive decline in June,
following a 0.1% decrease in May. The index was pulled downward
primarily by petroleum and coal products, particularly diesel
fuel (-7.1%) and motor gasoline (-3.6%).  The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products rose 0.5% in
June.  Chemicals and chemical products (-0.4%) and primary metal
products (-0.3%) also contributed to the decrease of the IPPI.  Among the chemical products group, lower prices for
fertilizers (-2.1%) and industrial chemicals (-0.4%) contributed
the most to the decrease.  Prices for primary metal products were driven down by
copper and copper alloy products (-2.4%) and aluminum products
(-1.7%), but were moderated by other non-ferrous metal products
(+1.6%).  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment increased
1.0%, slowing the decline of the IPPI. More modest advances were
observed in meat, fish and dairy products (+1.0%), lumber and
other wood products (+0.9%) and pulp and paper products (+0.6%).  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
generally paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the 1.8% depreciation of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar in June had the effect of increasing
the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. Without the impact
of the exchange rate, the IPPI would have fallen 0.8% instead of
0.3%.  12-month change in the Industrial Product Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the IPPI was
up 0.4%, continuing the year-over-year increases observed since
April 2010. With the exception of May, the growth has been
decelerating continuously since September 2011, when it was 5.6%.  The IPPI was pushed upward mainly by higher prices for
motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (+3.5%),
particularly motor vehicles (+4.9%).  Lumber and other wood products (+7.0%) and meat, fish and
dairy products (+2.7%) made more modest contributions to the
increase.  Compared with June 2011, the advance of the IPPI was
moderated largely by primary metal products (-7.4%), which
posted an eighth consecutive decline. Petroleum and coal
products (-3.2%) also moderated the increase.  The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products was up 1.0%
from June 2011.  The 5.0% year-over-year decline in the value of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar contributed to the advance
of the index. Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have fallen 0.8% instead of increasing 0.4%.  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI (-4.0%) posted its fifth straight decline in June,
following decreases in April (-2.1%) and May (-1.1%).  The decline in the RMPI was mostly a result of mineral
fuels (-9.4%), particularly crude oil (-10.1%). The RMPI
excluding mineral fuels was up 0.7%.  More modest downward pressure was exerted on the index by
non-ferrous metals (-1.2%).  Non-ferrous metals were pushed down largely by copper and
nickel concentrates (-2.5%), as well as by non-ferrous metal
scrap (-3.2%).  Moderating the decline in the RMPI were animals and animal
products (+3.1%), as a result of strong prices for hogs-swine
for slaughter (+16.7%), and wood (+3.0%), which was supported by
increased prices for logs and bolts (+3.6%).  12-month change in the Raw Materials Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI was
down 11.7%, its fourth consecutive decrease. Prior to March, the
RMPI had been increasing since November 2009.  The year-over-year index was pulled downward primarily by
mineral fuels (-19.9%), specifically crude oil (-20.3%). Non-
ferrous metals (-11.8%), particularly copper concentrates (-
15.6%), also contributed to the decline.  Animals and animal products (+5.6%) and wood (+3.2%) were
the only commodity groups to post year-over-year increases in
June. As with the previous month, higher prices for slaughter
cattle (+11.4%) and slaughter calves (+11.6%) were the main
factors in the increase in animal products, while logs and bolts
(+3.8%) was the main factor in the increase in wood prices.  Year over year, the RMPI excluding mineral fuels was down
4.1%.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including transportation, wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that is a
more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada  and is available on CANSIM in table 176-
0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the text, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
