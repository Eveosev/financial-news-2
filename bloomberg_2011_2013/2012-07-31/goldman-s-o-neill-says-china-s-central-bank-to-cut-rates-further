Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said he expects China’s central bank to
continue cutting  interest rates  to shore up the economy.  “I think they need more interest-rate cuts,” O’Neill said
in an interview with Bloomberg Radio from  London  today.
“Inflation has come down sharply, probably more than they
expected, and the economy of course has weakened quite a bit,
too. It’s pretty obvious we’re going to get more rate cuts.”  China’s leaders pledged today to keep adjusting policies to
ensure stable economic growth this year, with the Politburo
reiterating the country will pursue a “prudent” monetary
policy and “proactive” fiscal policy. The central bank has cut
interest rates twice since early June, reduced banks’ reserve
requirements three times since November and sped approvals for
investment projects as economic growth weakened.  O’Neill also said that “it’s rather good” that emerging
economies “worry so much” about the euro area’s fiscal crisis
as it will encourage them to pay more attention to their own
imbalances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
