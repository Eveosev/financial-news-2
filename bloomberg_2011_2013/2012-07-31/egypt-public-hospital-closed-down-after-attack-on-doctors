Egypt ’s Qasr al-Aini hospital was
shut down following an attack by armed men on doctors and
patients early today, a police officer said.  The family of a patient who died at the facility this
morning after he was shot during a fight between two families in
Cairo’s Boulaq district beat several doctors, hospital staff and
patients, Hany Girgis of the Qasr el-Nil police station said by
phone today. They fired warning shots into the air and searched
for members of the other family, he said, adding that the
hospital’s administration decided to close the facility until
the Ministry of Interior provides better security.  Several attacks have occurred at the country’s hospitals in
the past month. The Egyptian Doctors Syndicate decided to begin
a campaign aimed at exposing what it calls police negligence in
securing hospitals, Ahram Online website reported today.  Members of the campaign plan to file complaints with both
the police and the attorney general highlighting inadequate
security at Egypt’s hospitals. They also plan to organize
demonstrations and sit-ins at police stations around the nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
