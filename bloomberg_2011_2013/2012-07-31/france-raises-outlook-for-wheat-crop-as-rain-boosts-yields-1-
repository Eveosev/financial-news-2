French production of soft wheat,
durum wheat and barley will be higher than expected previously
after rain boosted yields, the  Agriculture Ministry  forecast.  Soft-wheat output may climb 7.9 percent to 36.7 million
metric tons from 34 million tons last year, the ministry wrote
in  statement  on its website today, raising its outlook from 35.9
million tons previously.  France is the European Union’s largest wheat producer. The
soft-wheat harvest is about 40 percent completed, and the first
results indicate yields are higher than last year and protein
content lower, according to cooperative Union InVivo.  “The humid weather conditions from the month of April 2012
have been favorable for the yields,” the ministry wrote.
“However, questions remain about the quality of the harvests
because of the persistent rains.”  Corn production is predicted to slip 1.7 percent to 15.6
million tons from 15.9 million tons in 2011 on lower yields, the
ministry wrote.  The forecast for barley production was raised by 326,000
tons to 11.3 million tons, climbing 29 percent from 8.78 million
tons harvested in 2011. Farmers will harvest 2.39 million tons
of durum wheat, 18 percent more than last year, and more than
the previous forecast for 2.11 million tons.  France ’s rapeseed harvest is forecast to slip 1.8 percent
to 5.27 million tons, according to the ministry, which raised
the outlook from 5.14 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
