Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said second-quarter
profit declined 23 percent on falling metals prices and rising
costs, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income fell to $152.6 million, or 60 cents a share,
from $197.6 million, or 78 cents, in the year earlier, Lima-
based Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 77 cents a share excluding some items, the
 average  of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Cerro Verde copper
mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 18 percent stake, and the
company’s Soc. Minera El Brocal SAA unit contributed less to
Buenaventura’s earnings on lower copper, silver and zinc prices,
said Inteligo SAB analyst Lali Merino, who doesn’t own
Buenaventura shares.  “The drop in prices and copper production decline offset
the higher price of gold,” Merino said in a telephone interview
from Lima before the report was released. “Costs were also an
issue.”  She rates the stock a buy.  Income from Buenaventura’s  Cerro Verde (CVERDEC1)  stake fell 49
percent to $33.9 million.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha gold
mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 44 percent stake,
contributed $86.6 million toward earnings, up 33 percent from a
year earlier.  Falling Prices  Revenue rose 2 percent to $350.5 million. Gold production
climbed 3 percent to 277,394 ounces, while copper output fell 20
percent, Buenaventura said. Silver output gained 32 percent to
4.5 million ounces. New York-traded copper and silver futures
dropped 14 percent and 21 percent from a year earlier,
respectively, while gold rose 7 percent.  General and administrative expenses jumped 28 percent to
$25 million, while exploration spending more than doubled to
$26.4 million.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
1,614.60 an ounce today on the Comex in  New York . Silver dropped
0.4 percent to $27.914.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
today. Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, fell 68 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to close at $36.42 in New York. The ADRs have dropped 5 percent
this year.  (Buenaventura will hold its quarterly conference call Aug.
