FAL Oil Co., a United Arab Emirates-
based energy trader that’s under U.S. financial restrictions for
links to  Iran ,, appointed Mohammed Al Sari as general manager
according to the company’s website.  Al Sari replaces Mohammed Osman, the website showed. Osman
couldn’t be reached for comment today on his mobile telephone,
and a secretary at his office in the emirate of Sharjah said he
was on vacation. FAL referred questions about Osman to Nehad
Shaqra, listed on the website as a fuel-oil trader. Shaqra,
contacted by phone, said he was in a meeting and unable to
comment.  The Financial Times reported today that FAL has asked
creditors for $605 million in working capital during debt-
restructuring talks. The newspaper also reported the termination
of Osman’s contract, without citing anyone.  The U.S. government imposed financial restrictions on FAL
in January because the company sold oil products to counterparts
linked to Iran, the target of U.S. economic sanctions. FAL said
the U.S. action was “based on a misunderstanding of FAL Oil’s
petroleum trading activities.”  Pakistan State Oil Co. (PSO)  censured FAL in October for non-
delivery of  fuel oil , according to a notice on the Pakistani
company’s website. FAL is also in a dispute with Sharjah, one of
the U.A.E.’s seven emirates, over billing for oil products it
sold to the government there.  To contact the reporters on this story:
