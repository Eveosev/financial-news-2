New York  Yankees All-Star first
baseman  Mark Teixeira  underwent tests that showed no structural
damage in his injured left wrist. He’ll be re-evaluated in three
days, the team said.  Teixeira, who has 20 home runs and leads the Major League
Baseball team with 71 runs batted in, was diagnosed with
inflammation of the wrist and had a cortisone shot after today’s
MRI exam, the Yankees said in a Twitter post.  Teixeira said he originally hurt his wrist swinging through
a pitch in the Yankees’ July 29 loss to the Boston Red Sox. He
tweaked the injury in last night’s loss to Baltimore when he
dove for a ground ball and landed on his wrist. He wore a
protective brace on his wrist after the game and said he’d
probably miss several days before the injury heals.  The Yankees, who have lost three straight games, host the
Orioles today and tomorrow. They’re off Aug. 2 before opening a
three-game series at home on Aug. 3 against Seattle.  After Teixeira left last night’s game,  Eric Chavez  moved
from third base to first to replace him.  Nick Swisher , who
hasn’t played in the field since July 20 because of a hip
injury, can also play first base when healthy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
