Okomu Oil Palm Plc (OKOMUOIL) , a Nigerian
producer of the kernels, fell for the first time in more than
three weeks after reporting a 14 percent drop in first-half
profit.  The stock lost 4.4 percent, its first decline since July 6,
to close at 30 naira in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital.  Net income slipped to 2.5 billion naira ($15.6 million),
from 2.9 billion naira a year earlier, the Benin City, Nigeria-
based company said in a statement published on the website of
the Nigerian Stock Exchange today. Revenue rose to 6.1 billion
naira from 5.72 billion naira.  “The fall in price is a reaction to the decline in
profit,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-
based Kundila Finance, said by phone today. Some investors are
worried that the company may not match its performance last
year, he said.  Okomu’s shares have risen 30 percent this year, compared
with a 11 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
