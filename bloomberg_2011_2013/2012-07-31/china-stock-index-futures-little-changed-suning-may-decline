China’s stocks  fell to the lowest
level in more than three years amid concern the slowing economy
will hurt earnings growth. Foreign-currency denominated B shares
dropped for their biggest two-day loss in almost a year.  Chinese steelmakers, including Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. and
Angang Steel Co., slid after posting a 96 percent drop in first-
half profit. Kama Co. led declines by B shares on concern
stricter rules by the exchange may lead to companies being
delisted.  China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  gained after the government
boosted investment in railways for the second time in a month.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.3 percent to 2,103.64
at the close, the lowest since March 2009. The gauge,  Asia ’s
worst-performing gauge this month with a 5.5 percent loss, has
tumbled 14.5 percent from this year’s high on March 2. The
 Shanghai  B-Share Stock  Price Index  slumped 0.9 percent for a
two-day, 6.5 percent loss, the most since Aug. 2011.  “The declining trend hasn’t changed, as the economy is
bad,” said Tang Yonggang, an analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co.
in Beijing. “We could see some short-term gains but in the mid-
to-long term it’s going to continue to fall unless we see more
policy loosening.”  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.1 percent to 2,332.92. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, dropped 1.4 percent in  New York .
The Shanghai index is valued at 9.4 times estimated profit,
compared with the three-year average of 14.7.  Steelmakers Drop  Baoshan Steel declined 0.5 percent to 4.20  yuan . Angang
Steel fell 0.5 percent to 3.66 yuan.  Aggregate profit of the nation’s steelmakers was 2.39
billion yuan ($375 million) in the first six months of the year,
Zhang Changfu, general secretary of the producer-funded  China 
Iron and Steel Association, told reporters in Beijing, without
providing an aggregate year-ago figure. Profit margins shrank to
0.13 percent from 3.06 percent a year ago, he said.  China’s economy  expanded 7.6 percent in the second quarter,
the slowest pace in three years, as  Europe ’s debt crisis sapped
exports and a crackdown on property speculation curbed domestic
steel demand. Some producers, including Maanshan Iron & Steel
Co., the nation’s second-biggest, are halting plants for
maintenance to cope with the price plunge.  Gauges of materials and energy stocks were among the three
worst performers in the CSI 300 out of the 10 industry groups.
Jiangxi Copper Co., the biggest producer of the metal, dropped
2.7 percent to 20.04 yuan, adding to yesterday’s 5.7 percent
slide. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. fell 2.2 percent to 18.26 yuan.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 14.3.
About 5.2 billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday,
31 percent lower than the average this year.  Market Confidence  The government should introduce measures to stabilize the
stock market and boost investor confidence, according to a
commentary on the front-page of the  Securities Times  today.
Finance and tax agencies should consider cutting the dividend
tax and stamp duty, among other measures, a reporter at
Securities Times named Xiao Bo wrote.  The Shanghai Composite is poised to fall to levels last hit
during the 2008 global financial crisis should it break through
2,100, according to Chart Partners.  “If 2,100 gives way, which looks likely, it warns that the
1,665 low seen in late 2008 will not only be tested but should
be broken,”  Thomas Schroeder , a Bangkok-based managing director
at Chart Partners, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions
yesterday. “I have targets at 1,700 and then near the 1,500
region upon a breach of the 2008 low.”  B Shares  Tsann Kuen (China) Enterprise Co., a manufacturer of
household electrical appliances, plunged 9.1 percent, sliding
for a seventh day on speculation the company will become among
the first to be removed from trading in the B-share market. The
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced on July 7 that
companies will be delisted should their stock prices trade below
par value of 1 yuan for 20 consecutive days.  Kama, a maker of  diesel engines  and tractors, tumbled 9.9
percent to 29.2 U.S. cents. Shanghai Dajiang (Group) Stock Co.
sank 7.9 percent to 23.2 U.S. cents.  “The B-share markets are marginalized and illiquid,” said
 Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in
Shanghai. “Many companies’ stock prices are very low and close
to their par values so that’s caused concern that some of them
will be expelled from trading.”  China Railway Group gained 0.8 percent to 2.53 yuan. China
Railway Construction Corp. advanced 2.9 percent to 4.68 yuan.  The Ministry of Railways, the nation’s largest corporate
debt issuer, plans to spend 470 billion yuan ($74 billion) on
railroads and bridges this year, according to a bond prospectus
issued yesterday. That’s the second increase in July, making a
combined gain of about 14 percent from the previous figure.  Separately, 28 cities in China are building 2,500
kilometers (1,554 miles) of subway lines from 2010 to 2015, the
 China Daily  reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
