Scottish Power  Ltd., a unit of
 Iberdrola SA (IBE) , is planning a 60 million-pound ($94 million)
connection program that will link less wind power to the
national grid than initially planned.  The proposals announced today include connections for about
650 megawatts of wind farms in central  Wales  to a new
substation, according to a statement from Scottish Power.  That’s less than the 1,000 megawatts initially estimated,
with the revisions following a public consultation and a
 decision  by National Grid Plc to locate the substation at Cefn
Coch in Powys, according to the statement.  The connection project will use lines of 50 kilometers (31
miles) rather than 85 kilometers first planned, according to
Scottish Power. The wind farms are located in an area set aside
by the Welsh government for renewable energy. The sites include
Dyfnant Forest, a project with as much as 120 megawatts of
capacity developed by a unit of Scottish Power.  The company will also link the power lines to the local
electricity network so  wind energy  can be used by businesses and
homes in the area. Scottish Power will start a further
consultation on the plans later this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
