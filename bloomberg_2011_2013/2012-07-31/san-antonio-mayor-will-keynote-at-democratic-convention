Democrats have tapped Julian Castro,
mayor of  San Antonio , Texas, as keynote speaker on the opening
night of their presidential nominating convention in Charlotte,
 North Carolina , in September. He will be the first Latino to
serve that role at a Democratic National Convention.  The choice of Castro, announced today, reflects President
 Barack Obama ’s push to energize Latino voters in the face of a
slow economic recovery and waning support from some swing voters
who backed him in 2008. First lady  Michelle Obama  also will
speak on the convention’s opening night, Sept. 4, convention
officials said.  While Texas isn’t expected to back Obama in November,
Castro, 37, is seen as a rising star in his party and Texas as a
future Democratic prospect as the Latino voting population there
grows. Obama delivered the keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention in 2004.  Castro, who is serving his second term as mayor, released a
YouTube video announcing his speaking role, in which he recalls
being inspired by Obama’s 2004 speech and says “I’ve got some
big shoes to fill.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
