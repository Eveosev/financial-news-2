Michael Phelps  became the most
decorated athlete in Olympic history as the U.S. won the men’s
800-meter freestyle relay, earning the swimmer his record 19th
medal.  Phelps swam the last leg of the final in  London  last night
to win his record-extending 15th gold medal. His overall medal
tally is one more than former Soviet Union gymnast Larissa
Latynina.  “I just started to smile with 25 meters to go,” Phelps
told reporters. “It was a cool feeling.”  Phelps surpassed Latynina an hour after losing the 200-
meter butterfly final, an event he’d dominated since 2003. The
American led the whole race before trying to glide to the wall
at the end, only for Chad le Clos of  South Africa  to pass him
and win by 0.05 seconds.  “I’m not going to sit here and make excuses,” the 27-
year-old Phelps said. “There are times when I sort of become
lazy coming into the wall, and that came out at the moment that
I needed it the most.”  Phelps, who will retire after the London Games, won the
200-meter butterfly at the past two Olympics and at the World
Championships in 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2011. He set the world
record at the 2009 World Championships in  Rome .  2008 Memories  The manner of the defeat was similar to the way Phelps won
the 100-meter butterfly at the 2008 Olympics. Milorad Cavic of
 Serbia  led the final and lunged for the wall underwater, while
Phelps swung his arms through the air to win by 0.01 seconds.  Le Clos said that race was going through his head during
last night’s final, which he won in 1 minute, 52.96 seconds.  “It sounds crazy, but I actually thought I was Michael
after that last turn,” Le Clos, 20, told reporters. “I felt I
can try and do something special here.”  Phelps used the defeat, which he found “a little
frustrating,” as motivation for the relay final.  “I don’t know anyone who hates losing more than Michael
Phelps,” Dara Torres, who won 12 swimming medals in five
Olympics for the U.S., said in an interview last week.  The U.S. relay team of  Ryan Lochte , Conor Dwyer, Ricky
Berens and Phelps defended its title by winning in 6:59.70.
France took the silver medal and  China  got the bronze.  Lochte, 27, clocked 1:45.15 to give the U.S. a lead of a full
body length over  Germany ’s Paul Biedermann after the first leg.
Dwyer and Berens extended their team’s advantage before Phelps
swam the anchor leg to loud cheers from the capacity 17,500
crowd at London’s Aquatics Center.  “I wanted a big lead, as big a lead as possible,” said
Phelps. “I knew those guys would be fast.”  Phelps said he may find it difficult getting to sleep
knowing that no one has won more Olympic medals.  “There are a lot of emotions in my head right now,” he
said. “This has been an amazing ride. It shows that hard work
does pay off.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
