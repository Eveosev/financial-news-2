Michael Foleyquit as head coach of
the New South Wales Waratahs Super Rugby team after one season
in charge.  Foley, 45, handed in his resignation today, the Sydney-
based franchise said in an e-mailed statement. He was appointed
as head coach 11 months ago on a three-year contract after three
seasons as assistant coach to Chris Hickey.  After reaching the six-team playoffs in 2011, the Waratahs
finished 11th in the standings this season after ending the
campaign with a franchise-record eight straight losses. The
Waratahs board will oversee the hiring of Foley’s replacement.  “We firmly believe that this position is a highly sought-
after role,” Waratahs board memberAl Baxter said.  Foley’s departure comes a day after Edwin Zemancheff
stepped down as chairman of the board.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
