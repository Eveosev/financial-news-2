What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents per bushel higher as
little or no rain is forecast in the Midwest, extending the
worst drought in the U.S. since 1956 and curbing production,
Scott Stoller, a grain merchandiser at Michlig Grain in Manlius,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher as
the lack of rain and hot weather curbs yields as plants enter
critical growth stages, Stoller said. Soybean-oil futures may
open steady to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to up 2 cents a bushel, Stoller
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
