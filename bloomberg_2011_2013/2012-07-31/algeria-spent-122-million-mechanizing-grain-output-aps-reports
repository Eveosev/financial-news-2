The Algerian Grain Office spent 10
billion dinars ($122 million) in the past three years to create
a “motoculture” unit, according to the APS news agency, which
cited the office’s general director, Nourdine Kehal.  The funds were used to buy 1,250 combine harvesters, 350
tractors and more than 1,000 seeders, Kehal said, state-run APS
reported yesterday.  The office also plans to equip a grain area of 500,000
hectares with supplemental irrigation systems “in the short
term,” up from currently equipped 95,000 hectares out of the
total 3.3 million hectares reserved for grain production, Kehal
said.  The North African country plans to increase the irrigated
areas to 1.6 million hectares by 2014 from the current 1.1
million hectares, he was cited by APS as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
