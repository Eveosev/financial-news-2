Rona Inc. (RON) , the Canadian hardware
retailer, said it rejected an unsolicited takeover bid of
C$14.50 a share from Lowe’s Companies Inc.  “The board believes that in the best interests of RONA and
its stakeholders, the Corporation should remain focused on
executing its business plan with a view to capturing significant
opportunities that it sees for its business,” Rona said in a
statement today.  Lowe’s remains interested in pursuing the transaction and
is considering “all its options,” Rona said in the statement.  Rona, based in Boucherville,  Quebec , closed yesterday at
C$11.87 in Toronto, for a market value of C$1.44 billion ($1.44
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
