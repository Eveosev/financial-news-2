Six government officials in eastern
 China  are under investigation for dereliction of duty involving
the production of contaminated medicine capsules, Xinhua News
Agency said today, citing the provincial procuratorate.  An initial probe showed that lax supervision by six food
and drug administration officials in Zhejiang province caused
incidents where several companies had made drug capsules with
industrial gelatin, which contains excessive levels of chromium
and is illegal to use for making drug capsules, Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
