Hong Kong   stocks  gained, with the
Hang Seng Index capping its longest rising streak since March,
on signs  China  is boosting infrastructure investment as it seeks
to spur growth in the world’s second-largest economy.  CSR Corp. (1766) , a Chinese train maker, gained 4.2 percent after
China boosted investment in railways for a second time in a
month. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s largest
producer of the metal, rose 1.9 percent. Hang Lung Properties
Ltd., a Hong Kong developer that derives 46 percent of its sales
from the mainland, jumped 3.8 percent after reporting better
than expected half-year results.  The Hang Seng Index rose 1.1 percent to 19,796.81 at the
close of trading in Hong Kong, with all but nine shares gaining
on the 49-member gauge. The gauge last advanced for four days in
March. It and increased 1.8 percent in July, a second straight
advance. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies added 1.6 percent to 9,674.27.  “The question is when investors get bullish,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring
Asset Management ( Asia ) Ltd., which oversees about $8 billion.
“They are looking for a strong reason to buy back into the
market. There is encouraging progress being made.”  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 8.7 percent from this
year’s high in February through today on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The
drop reduced the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10.4 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.5 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Rail Spending  Equities rose after leaders in Berlin, Paris and Rome
backed European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  by saying
they will do what’s needed to protect the euro and as China was
seen boosting its infrastructure stimulus measures.  China’s Ministry of Railways, the nation’s largest
corporate debt issuer, said it planned to spend 470 billion  yuan 
($74 billion) on railroads and bridges this year. Chinese cities
may spend at least 1 trillion yuan building subways from 2010
through 2015,  China Daily  reported, citing Chen Xunru, a member
of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390) , the country’s biggest builder of
train lines and the company with the biggest advance on the H-
share index this year, gained 2.1 percent to HK$3.40. China
Railway Construction Corp., builder of more than half of the
mainland’s modern rail system, gained 1.3 percent to HK$6.79.
CSR gained 4.2 percent to HK$5.71.  Aluminum Corp. (2600) , also known as Chalco, rose 1.9 percent to
HK$3.20. Glencore International Plc, the world’s largest
commodities trader, gained 1.7 percent to HK$38.80. Zijin Mining
Group Co., China’s biggest gold producer, advanced 2.1 percent
to HK$2.49.  Developers Rise  Hang Lung Properties rose 3.8 percent to HK$27.60. The
developer reported during the midday trading break that its
underlying first-half profit was HK$2.5 billion ($322 million),
exceeding the median of three analysts’ estimates surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Other developers rose amid signs that real-estate companies
are selling commercial property at the fastest pace in at least
seven years to raise cash ahead of an increase in government
land sales.  Sino Land Co. Ltd. (83) , controlled by billionaire Robert
Ng, gained 1.5 percent to HK$13.28. Henderson Land Development
Co. Ltd., Hong Kong’s fourth-largest homebuilder by market
value, increased 2.4 percent to HK$45.20.  Of the 25 companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index for
which Bloomberg has first-half earnings estimates, an equal
number of companies have missed projections as have exceeded
them.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advanced 1.1 percent to
19,714. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  lost 1.2 percent to 20.69,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.9 percent in the
benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
