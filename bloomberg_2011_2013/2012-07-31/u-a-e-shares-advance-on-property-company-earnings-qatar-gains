United Arab Emirates shares gained,
sending Dubai’s benchmark stock index to the highest in more
than a week, after earnings at the Persian Gulf country’s real
estate companies beat estimates.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  rose for a second day after the
developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper said quarterly
profit more than doubled. In  Abu Dhabi ,  Sorouh Real Estate (SOROUH)  PJSC
rallied 1.9 percent after net income climbed 34 percent. The DFM
General Index increased 0.3 percent to 1,542.64, the highest
close since July 18. The measure rallied 6.3 percent in July,
the first monthly gain since February. Abu Dhabi’s gauge rose
0.5 percent and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.3 percent.  Gains are being driven “by second-quarter earnings, which
is the local catalyst, and then you have that combined with some
improvement in the global markets,” said Chahir Hosni, equity
sales manager at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai.  Emaar, also the owner of the world’s largest shopping mall
in Dubai and the stock with the biggest weighting on Dubai’s
index, said July 29 net income climbed to 614 million dirhams
($167 million), beating estimates. The shares increased 0.9
percent to 3.4 dirhams, extending their gain this year to 32
percent, compared with a 14 percent advance for Dubai’s  DFM
General Index. (DFMGI)   Global Stimulus  Sorouh, the developer that’s in merger talks with  Aldar
Properties PJSC (ALDAR) , surged to 1.05 dirhams, the highest close since
June 11. Net income rose to 148.2 million dirhams from 110
million dirhams a year earlier, also beating estimates.  Asian stocks advanced today, with the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index gaining 1.2 percent at 4:49 p.m. in Dubai, on speculation
the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank may signal
their readiness to stimulate growth amid signs of a global
economic slowdown, boosting the earnings outlook for exporters.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased 1 percent.  About 91  million shares  traded in Dubai today, compared
with the 12-month daily average of 139 million shares.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose 0.5 percent and  Saudi
Arabia (SABIC) ’s Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.8 percent. Bahrain’s
 BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  added 0.1 percent, while  Kuwait’s Stock
Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  and Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  slipped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
