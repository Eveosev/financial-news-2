U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will announce plans to transform the London Olympic anti-doping
facility into a 10 million-pound ($16 million) center that
studies how genes are transformed by lifestyle.  The phenome center in Harlow, northeast of London, will
allow scientists to study how people respond to drugs and allow
them to investigate the effects of diet, the environment and
stress on the molecular make-up of individuals to develop new
treatments. Cameron will announce the project, the first of its
kind in the world, at a gathering of health professionals in
London today.  “This will take advantage of the extraordinary
opportunities that lie in combining genetic data with the
results of medical tests on tissues and blood,” Cameron will
say, according to remarks released by his office. “It will
produce new forms of drugs and it will lead the world in the
development of precision medicine.”  Facilities and equipment for the center are being provided
by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , to which  Bruker Corp. (BRKR)  and Waters Corp.
will also contribute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
