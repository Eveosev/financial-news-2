The  New York  Jets may continue to
search for an upgrade at offensive right tackle after Jeff Otah
failed a physical exam for the second time, nullifying a trade
that had brought him from the  Carolina Panthers  a week ago.  “He did everything we asked for the past week,” Jets
General Manager Mike Tannenbaum told reporters. “The terms of
the trade weren’t met, so he’s going back to Carolina.”  The Jets had agreed to send a conditional draft choice to
the Panthers for Otah, a former first-round draft pick who was
expected to challenge Wayne Hunter for the starting job.  The 6-foot-6, 340-pound Otah has started all 29 games he’s
played over his four seasons in the  National Football League ,
though he was limited to four games the past two years because
of a knee injury. The Jets didn’t say why he failed the
physicals.  Hunter allowed 11 sacks in his first season as the Jets’
starting right tackle last season.  “We will keep looking for opportunities to improve the
team as they may or may not come along and we will go from
there,” Tannenbaum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
