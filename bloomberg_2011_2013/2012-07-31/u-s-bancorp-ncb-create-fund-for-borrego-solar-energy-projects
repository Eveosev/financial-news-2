U.S. Bancorp (USB)  and National Consumer
Cooperative Bank created a $64.4 million fund to finance
photovoltaic systems that Borrego Solar Systems Inc. will
install.  The fund will support construction of eight projects with
18 megawatts of generating capacity, including four at municipal
landfills and one for a school district, San Diego-based Borrego
said in an e-mailed statement. It has raised a total of $225
million in  project financing  since 2009, and the new fund is its
largest, the company said.  Borrego’s customers buy the electricity from systems it
installs through a financing arrangement known as a power
purchase agreement. The structure eliminates the need to pay
upfront installation costs, and the power is bought at a fixed
monthly rate that’s lower than a typical utility bill, according
to the company.  Investors that create installation funds for solar
developers can take advantage of a 30 percent investment tax
credit for solar energy.  National Consumer Cooperative Bank is providing debt for
the fund, David Lipson, a Borrego spokesman, said by e-mail.
“They can not take any of the tax benefits because they’re not
an owner,” he said of the NCB. “U.S. Bancorp is Borrego
Solar’s equity partner and the two of us, as owners of the
projects, will take the 30 percent ITC and depreciation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
