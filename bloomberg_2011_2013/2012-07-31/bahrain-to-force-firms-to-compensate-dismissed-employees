Bahrain’s government will force
private companies to compensate dismissed employees and extend
their annual and sick leaves or face fines in a bid to improve
working conditions and end human trafficking.  Under the new law, workers will get for 30 days of annual
leave, at least 60 days of maternity leave instead of 45, and 15
days of sick leave with full pay, the Information Affairs
Authority in Manama said in a statement today. The terms of
compensation for dismissed employees weren’t disclosed.  The modifications update laws issued 36 years ago, the
authority said in an e-mailed statement dated yesterday. The
government had “left many legislative gaps and loopholes,
especially in relationship to workers’ negotiations with
management and ways of settling disputes,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
