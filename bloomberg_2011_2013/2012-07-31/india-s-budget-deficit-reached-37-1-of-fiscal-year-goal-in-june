India’s  budget deficit  in the three
months through June was 37.1 percent of the fiscal-year goal as
the nation struggles to narrow a shortfall that the central bank
says may exceed the government’s target.  The shortfall was 1.9 trillion rupees ($34 billion), the
Controller General of Accounts said on its  website  today. The
government’s target for the 12 months through March 2013 is 5.14
trillion rupees.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  is grappling with a budget
deficit amid pressure to keep subsidies for fertilizer and
diesel to help the 824 million Indians living on under $2 a day.
His administration projects record borrowing of 5.69 trillion
rupees in 2012-2013 to fund its targeted shortfall of 5.1
percent of GDP, down from 5.8 percent last year.  The government is at risk of missing the goal, the  Reserve
Bank of India  said in a quarterly review of the economy
yesterday. It said today India’s “large twin deficits” in the
current account and the budget pose “significant risks to
macroeconomic stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
