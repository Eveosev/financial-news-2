Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB) , the 171-
year-old company that provides credit and business data to
businesses, is weighing a sale, according to a person with
knowledge of the situation.  The company is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit
Suisse Group AG to seek buyers, said the person, who asked not
to be named because the matter is private. The process is at an
early stage and there’s no guarantee of a deal, the person said.  Dun & Bradstreet has been losing market share to
competitors, including  Experian Plc (EXPN) ,  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  and Cortera
Inc., said Carter Malloy, an analyst at Stephens Capital
Management in  Little Rock , Arkansas. While that increases
pressure to make a deal, there are no obvious acquirers, Malloy
said. A private-equity buyer wouldn’t see much savings from cost
cutting because the company already runs efficiently, he said.  “We don’t think a deal is very likely,” said Malloy, who
has a neutral rating on the stock. “This would likely be a big
commitment for any PE firm and would likely involve a
multibillion-dollar check.”  Dun & Bradstreet can  trace its roots  back to 1841, when its
predecessor, the Mercantile Agency, was founded, according to
its website. The firm, based in Short Hills, New Jersey,
provides credit reporting and monitoring services, operating a
database with more than 210 million business records.  Roger Sachs, a spokesman for Dun & Bradstreet, didn’t
return calls and e-mails seeking comment. The Wall Street
Journal reported the news earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
