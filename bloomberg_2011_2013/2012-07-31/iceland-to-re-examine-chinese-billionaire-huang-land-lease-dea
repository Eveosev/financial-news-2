Iceland has appointed a taskforce to
review Chinese billionaire Huang Nubo’s plan to lease land from
local municipalities and sidestep the government’s decision to
block his efforts to build a golf resort on the island.  “The decision of the government was to put together a
group of ministers and ministries which will review the
matter,” Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson said to reporters
in Reykjavik yesterday. “The attitude in this matter is that
nothing irreversible has happened.”  Huang said in a July 16 interview he had secured a deal to
lease the land he needed for his resort. A formal agreement on
the $7.8 million deal will be signed in October, he said.  Iceland’s government in November rejected a bid by Huang’s
Beijing Zhongkun Investment Group Co. to buy 300 square
kilometers (116 square miles) of land, saying it would be
“incompatible” with the law amid opposition to foreign
ownership of property. Huang plans to develop a resort and a
mountain park in Iceland before investing in Denmark and  Sweden 
to build a “Nordic holiday resort platform,” he said.  Beijing Zhongkun  plans to build a hotel, about 100 villas
and a golf course on the land, which could be leased for 40
years with an option to extend the contract by another 40 years,
Huang said.  The remaining roughly 300 square kilometers of land will be
developed into a mountain park for activities such as hiking and
horse riding to attract tourists, he said.  Huang is estimated by Forbes magazine to have a fortune of
$1.02 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
