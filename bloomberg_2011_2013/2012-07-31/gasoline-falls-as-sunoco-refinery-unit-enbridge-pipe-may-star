Gasoline declined as  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  may
start a fluid catalytic cracker at the largest East Coast
refinery and as  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  may reopen an oil pipeline
tomorrow that serves the  Chicago  area.  Futures fell as Sunoco plans to start the catalytic cracker
today after shutting it July 23 for unplanned work, a person
with knowledge of the situation said. Repairs on Enbridge’s
317,000-barrel-a-day Line 14 may be completed today, a state
regulator said late yesterday.  “Restarting some units is giving prices a little bit of a
break,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures
Group in Chicago. “People were panic buying, particularly in
the Chicago cash market. The pipeline coming back online should
put some downward pressure on price.”  Gasoline for August delivery fell 2.22 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.9146 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures gained 6.9 percent this month.  It’s the first monthly rise since an 11 percent jump in
March and the largest July increase since 2009.  The more actively traded September contract declined 4.41
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.7743 a gallon. August gasoline and
heating oil contracts expired at the close of floor trading
today.  Gasoline inventories probably rose 800,000 barrels last
week, the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg. Distillate stockpiles probably increased 1.1 million
barrels. The Energy Department is scheduled to report last
week’s oil supplies at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Selling Pressure  “Products are getting selling pressure at expiration and
there is the expectation of a build,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.’’  Heating oil for August delivery declined 3.74 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.8417 a gallon, and gained 5.4 percent in July.
The September contract fell 3.34 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.848 a gallon.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.4
cents to $3.50 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the highest price since June 17. Prices have fallen 11 percent
from a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4, according to AAA, the
nation’s largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
