The Safra Group said it completed
its acquisition of a 50.15 percent stake in  Bank Sarasin & Cie. (BSAN) 
and offered to buy all outstanding Class B registered shares.  Safra will offer 27 Swiss francs ($27.66) a share, the
group said in an e-mailed  statement  today. Luxembourg-based JSH
SA, a Safra unit, will probably announce the offer Aug. 20,
according to the statement.  Safra said it now owns 71.01 percent of the voting rights
of Sarasin and that it plans to eliminate all dividends as of
this year in line with company policy for reinvesting profit.  Sarasin yesterday reported that first-half net income fell
to 44.5 million Swiss francs from 61.3 million francs a year
earlier. Client inflows dropped to 472 million francs from 3.9
billion francs a year earlier and assets under management rose
2.8 percent to 99.1 billion francs at the end of June from 96.4
billion francs six months earlier.  Shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting today
elected a new Board of Directors for the Basel, Switzerland-
based bank. The board includes Chairman Pierre-Alain Bracher,
Vice-Chairman Hans-Rudolf Hufschmid, Philippe Dupont, Sergio
Penchas, Jacob J. Safra, Sipko N. Schat, Marcelo Szerman and
Dagmar G. Woehrl, Sarasin said in a separate statement.  Chairman Christoph Ammann and Peter Derendinger and Pim W.
Mol will leave the bank effective today, Sarasin said.  Safra said it has retained Credit Suisse Group AG to handle
the share purchase, which will run Sept. 4 through Sept. 17 and
may be extended. Safra expects Sarasin to increase its share
capital by 250 million Swiss francs.  Safra, which said it had approximately $101 billion assets
under management as of year end 2011, includes Banco Safra,
Banque J. Safra (Suisse), Safra National Bank of  New York  and
Safra International Bank and Trust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
