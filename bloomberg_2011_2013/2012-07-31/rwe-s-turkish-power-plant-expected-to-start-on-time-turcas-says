RWE AG (RWE) , a German power generator and
distributor, and partner  Turcas Petrol AS (TRCAS)  expect the commercial
operations of their gas-fired power plant in western Turkey to
begin on time, Turcas Chief Executive Officer Batu Aksoy said.  The 775-megawatt plant in Denizli province is having its
turbines and generators tested and will start up at the end of
December as planned, Aksoy said in a telephone interview.  RWE, with 70 percent of the plant, and Turkey’s Turcas have
invested a total of 500 million euros ($614 million) in the site
as part of the Essen, Germany-based company’s plan to spend as
much as 900 million euros in central and Eastern Europe by 2013,
Andreas Radmacher, CEO of RWE’s Turkish unit, said last year.  “There may be some small delays during the testing of
turbines and generators but the commercial commissioning of the
plant remains unchanged and will be on December 31,” Aksoy
said. The site, about 2 percent of  Turkey ’s power capacity, will
power 3.5 million homes in the nation, RWE said on its  website .  Pinar Ozturk, a spokeswoman for RWE in Turkey, didn’t
immediately respond to telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
