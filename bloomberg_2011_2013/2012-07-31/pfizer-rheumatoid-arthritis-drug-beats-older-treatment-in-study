Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  said its rheumatoid
arthritis treatment tofacitinib, one of the companyâ€™s leading
experimental drugs, was more effective than an older treatment
in a large-scale study.  The drug met its primary end-point in the study and no new
side effects were found, Pfizer said today in a statement.
Pfizer said on a conference call with analysts today that the
 Food and Drug Administration  may need more time than expected to
make a decision on approval of the treatment.  The study, dubbed ORAL start, found that tofacitinib was
superior to methotrexate in easing pain and swelling of joints
caused by rheumatoid arthritis, according to the statement.
Results were from the last of three stages of human tests
generally required for FDA approval.  Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder
that affects about 1.3 million Americans and 23.7 million people
worldwide, the company said in the statement.  Pfizer  shares  jumped 2 percent to $24.19 at 10:44 a.m. in
 New York  trading.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
