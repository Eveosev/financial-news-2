Parts of northern  China  were
forecast to see heavy downpours today after some regions
received more than 10 inches of rain last night, according to
the China Meteorological Administration.  The heaviest rainfall today was forecast for parts of Hebei
and Liaoning provinces and the municipality of Tianjin,
according to the weather agency. Medium to heavy showers were
expected in Beijing after almost an inch of rainfall in the
Chinese capital last night, it said.  The city of Jincheng in Shanxi province, about 400 miles
southwest of Beijing, got 200 millimeters to 264 millimeters (10
inches) of rain from 8 p.m. yesterday to 6 a.m. today local
time, according to the agency. Shanxi issued its highest level
storm warning this morning, the official Xinhua Agency reported.  Flooding across China has killed more than 100 people this
month, with 77 of those deaths in Beijing on July 21 when the
heaviest downpour in six decades knocked down homes and caused
flooding that submerged cars. Beijing’s city government issued a
warning for heavy rains and mudslides yesterday, which it
withdrew from its website this morning.  Beijing’s airport  had canceled a total of 50 incoming and
outgoing flights as of 1 p.m. local time today, according to its
website. The city’s traffic bureau issued a statement asking
drivers to reduce speed and exercise caution.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
