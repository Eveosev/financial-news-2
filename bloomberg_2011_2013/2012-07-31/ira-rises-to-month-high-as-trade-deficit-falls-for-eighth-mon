The lira appreciated for a fifth day
to the strongest in more than a month after  Turkey ’s trade
deficit declined for an eighth consecutive month, signaling a
lower  current-account gap.  Bonds rose.  The currency gained 0.5 percent to 1.7933 per dollar at
5:06 p.m. in Istanbul, the highest on an intraday basis since
June 21. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 7.62 percent, the lowest
since January 2011.  Turkey’s  trade deficit  declined to $7.2 billion from $10.2
billion a year ago, the statistics office in Ankara said on its
website today. The median estimate of six economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a shortfall of $7.9 billion. A record current-
account gap last year spurred the world’s biggest currency
decline, sending the lira 18 percent lower against the dollar.  “This figure indicates a very low current-account deficit
around $3.7 billion in June,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an
economist at Garanti Investment in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed
note. “This is positive for the Turkish lira.”  The current-account shortfall shrank to 8.5 percent of GDP
in May, or $67 billion, from $77 billion in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
