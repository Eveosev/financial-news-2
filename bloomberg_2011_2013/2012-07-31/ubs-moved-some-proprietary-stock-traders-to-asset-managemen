UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
moved some people from its U.K. and Asian proprietary stock-
trading desks to the asset-management division as it exits the
business in the investment bank, Chief Financial Officer Tom Naratil said.  “They’re managing client money now,” Naratil said in an
interview in Zurich today. The bank is exploring options for the
remaining part of the business, he added. UBS’s equities unit
incurred a 20 million-franc ($20.5 million) loss in the second
quarter from exiting proprietary trading.  Naratil said in February that the business, which was
profitable for UBS, had about 50 people. UBS is exiting  stock
trading  for its own account as it’s shrinking the investment
bank by more than half to focus on  wealth management  as rising
capital requirements and  Europe ’s debt crisis drag on
profitability.  The equities unit reported revenue of 247 million francs
for the second quarter, the lowest since the fourth quarter of
2008, hurt by a 349 million-franc loss tied to the initial
public offering of Facebook Inc. UBS has “significantly
bigger” ambitions for the business, run by  Mike Stewart ,
Naratil said.  “Our core strengths are in Europe, and we’re weaker in the
U.S. currently,” he said. “We need to invest more in the
Americas, which we’re doing. The U.S. is where we see the
greatest upside for us. There is a good plan to realize the
ambitions that we have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
