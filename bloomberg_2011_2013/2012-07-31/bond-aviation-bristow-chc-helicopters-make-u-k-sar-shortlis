Bond Aviation Group, Bristow
Helicopters, and CHC Helicopter Corp. units have been
shortlisted to compete for a 3.1 billion-pound ($5 billion) U.K.
government search-and-rescue helicopter program.  The winning bidder is going to be named in early 2013, the
Department for Transport, which is running the competition for
the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said in a statement.  The winner will provide about 20 to 25 helicopters under a
10-year service provision contract to provide search-and-rescue
services across the U.K. and within 250 nautical miles offshore.
 United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Sikorsky unit, Eurocopter, the
helicopter maker of Toulouse-based  European Aeronautic, Defence
& Space Co. (EAD) , and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s AgustaWestland are hoping to
secure sales as part of the contract.  The effort comes after a previous search-and-rescue program
-- the 6 billion-pound SAR-H program -- was canceled in February
2011 over contracting irregularities. CHC Helicopters operating
Sikorsky’s S-92 helicopter was the winning bidder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
