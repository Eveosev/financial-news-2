(Corrects name of player traded to Mariners in last
paragraph.)  The  Atlanta Braves  acquired pitcher
Paul Maholm and outfielder Reed Johnson from the  Chicago Cubs  as
they pursue a Major League Baseball playoff berth.  The Braves, who at 58-44 trail the first-place Washington
Nationals by 3 1/2 games in the National League East, sent
right-handed pitchers Jaye Chapman and Arodys Vizcaino to the
Cubs for Maholm, Johnson and an undisclosed cash amount. Atlanta
is currently in position for a wild-card playoff spot.  MLBâ€™s trade deadline is today at 4 p.m.  New York  time.  Maholm, a 30-year-old left-hander, has a 9-6 record this
season and a 3.74 earned run average for the Cubs. Over his past
seven starts, Maholm is 5-0 with a 1.00 ERA.  Johnson, 35, is hitting .302 with three home runs and 16
runs batted in over 76 games this season.  The Cubs also traded catcher Geovany Soto to the  Texas
Rangers  for right-handed pitcher Jacob Brigham, MLB.com said.  The  Los Angeles Dodgers  acquired ex-Seattle Mariners closer
Brandon League for minor league outfielder Leon Landry and minor
league pitcher Logan Bawcom. League was 0-5 with a 3.63 ERA and
nine saves for the Mariners this season.  The Toronto Blue Jays traded outfielder Travis Snider to
the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitcher Brad Lincoln and sent
outfielder Eric Thames to the Mariners for relief pitcher Steve
Delabar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
