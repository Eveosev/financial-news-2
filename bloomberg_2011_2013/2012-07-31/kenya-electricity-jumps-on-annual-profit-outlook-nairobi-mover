Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) ,
the East African nation’s biggest power producer, rose to the
highest in almost two weeks on speculation it will report
increased full-year earnings.  The  shares jumped  as much as 4.2 percent and closed 0.6
percent up at 8:35 shillings in Nairobi, the highest since July
18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I think we will see strong full-year results because by
the half year profit before tax was already up,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based investment
company Rich Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“We had optimal rains so they have been able to increase the
hydrology portion, which is cheaper to generate and reduced
thermal generation, which is more costly.”  Net income for the six months ended Dec. 31 climbed 33
percent to 1.19 billion shillings ($14 million), the company
said Feb. 28. “Above average rains” had improved reservoir
levels, it said. KenGen began operating a third generating unit
at the Kindaruma hydropower dam with 24 megawatts of capacity,
it said June 26.  The fiscal year of KenGen ended June 30 and the company
will probably announce its earnings within a month, a spokesman
who declined to be named, said today by telephone.  KenGen’s future earnings will also be boosted by its
investment in geo-thermal energy, Emma Mareri, an analyst at
Nairobi-based African Alliance Kenya Securities Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  “Geothermal power is stable and they will not be affected
by the risks in hydro-power generation,” Mareri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
