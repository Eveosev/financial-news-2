  Credit Suisse Group AG became  the
latest investment bank to start a specialized unit to help
energy companies buy and sell oil and gas fields, hiring Bank of
Montreal’s Bruce Cox to run the team.  Cox, trained as a petroleum engineer, will join in
September as a Houston-based managing director, Zurich-based
Credit Suisse said in an internal memorandum yesterday. Its
contents were confirmed by spokesman Jack Grone.  Credit Suisse joins  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  and Evercore Partners Inc.
as recent entrants in the oil and gas “acquisition and
divestiture” business. The work often involves running auctions
for oil and gas fields using specialized engineering and
geological expertise.  Lazard hired an A&D banker from  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  this
year, and Evercore recruited a Scotia team last year. Jefferies
Group Inc., Scotia,  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , Macquarie Group Ltd.,
Merrill Lynch & Co., and Royal Bank of Canada have all bought
A&D boutiques since 2005, and Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.,
founded in 2006, has an A&D team.  Cox worked at Exxon Corp. for nine years, followed by 17
years at Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc., an oil and gas
consulting firm, according to the memo, signed by Tim Perry,
head of oil and gas investment banking for the Americas. He
later oversaw technical services at Calgary-based Tristone
Capital Inc., an energy advisory boutique, before joining Bank
of Montreal in 2009.  Cox is “ideally suited to lead the bank’s entry into the
A&D business,” Perry said in the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
