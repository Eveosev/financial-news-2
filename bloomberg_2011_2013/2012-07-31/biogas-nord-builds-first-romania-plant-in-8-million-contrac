Biogas Nord AG (BG8) , a German company
that’s built 350 biogas plants, will construct its first
Romanian plant in a 6.6-million euro ($8 million) contract.  The 3-megawatt project, which generates power by burning
gas made from organic waste, will be commissioned at the end of
2012 or the beginning of 2013, according to a statement from the
Bielefeld, Germany-based company.  Romanian biogas has “huge potential” because of European
Union subsidies and the availability of high-quality organic
material, Razvan Serachitopol, the company’s manager in the
country, said in the statement.  Biogas Nord will retain a 30 percent stake in the plant at
Satu Mare in northwest Romania as the company uses shares in
projects to balance the seasonal cashflows from construction
work, the statement said.  “What we gain is independence from the fluctuations in the
market,” spokesman David Miltner said.  Electricity produced will feed into the public grid, while
heat will be used in a greenhouse.  The plant, “one of the largest” in  Romania  according to
Serachitopol, is expected to generate an internal rate of return
of 30 percent, the company said.  Earlier this month, the builder won its first order in
neighboring  Ukraine , a waste-to-power project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
