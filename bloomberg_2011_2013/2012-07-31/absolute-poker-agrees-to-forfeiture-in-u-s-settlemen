Absolute Poker , an Internet gambling
website, agreed to forfeit assets in a settlement of U.S. claims
that the company conducted illegal online wagering inside the
the country.  The forfeiture will include deposited funds, receivables,
hardware and intellectual property, according to court papers in
the government’s lawsuit filed today in Manhattan federal court.  Assets such as the database of Absolute Poker players are
likely to “substantially decrease in value if not sold soon,”
according to court papers filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
