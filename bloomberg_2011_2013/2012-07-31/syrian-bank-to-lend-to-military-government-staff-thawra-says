Syria ’s  Saving Bank  will resume
issuing loans to low-income government employees and the
military,  Al-Thawra  newspaper said today, citing state-run Sana
news agency.  Haifa Younes, the bank’s general manager, told Sana that
preparations are being made at branches and committees were
being formed to resume lending after Eid al-Fitr, which falls
around Aug. 19, the newspaper said. It didn’t say when lending
stopped.  Many banks in Syria are refusing to offer credit as the
uprising against President Bashar al-Assad’s government that
began in March 2011 drags on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
