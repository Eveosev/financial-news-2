South Africa  halted oil imports from
Iran last month as the Middle Eastern nation faces sanctions
over its nuclear development program.  South Africa received shipments of crude worth 13.3 billion
rand ($1.62 billion) in June, with 60 percent coming from Saudi
Arabia, 19 percent from Angola and 18 percent from Nigeria, the
Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed
statement today. In May, Iran supplied 13 percent of South
Africa’s 14.9 billion rand of oil imports and Saudi Arabia 30
percent.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  signed a law on Dec. 31 that
denies access to the U.S. financial system to foreign banks that
do business with the Central Bank of Iran. On June 12, South
Africa was granted a 180-day renewable exemption from the
sanctions, after demonstrating that it had significantly reduced
purchases of Iranian crude oil purchases.  Iran’s nuclear development program has sparked accusations
from the U.S. and the European Union that enriched uranium may
be diverted to produce weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
