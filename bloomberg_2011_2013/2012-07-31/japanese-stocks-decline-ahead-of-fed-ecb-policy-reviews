(Corrects number of days stocks rose in first paragraph.)  Japanese  stocks  fell for the first
time in four days as concern grew that European leaders may
struggle to revive growth. Shipping companies slipped before
reporting earnings today.  Makita Corp., a maker of power tools that generates 42
percent of sales in Europe, slid 1.1 percent.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) ,
Japan’s largest shipping line, fell 1.7 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) 
soared 3.9 percent after saying it will spend 50 billion yen
($640 million) to buy back shares.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.3 percent to 8,610.10
as of 9:20 a.m in Tokyo, heading for a 4.4 percent loss this
month. The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  today retreated 0.1 percent to
731.29. Both gauges rallied for the past three days on optimism
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  will announce
measures this week to combat the sovereign-debt crisis.  “My concern is that there will be a lot of implementation
risks to any package that is announced,” said Belinda Allen,
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “It’s
hard to be 100 percent certain that this will be the big bazooka
that Europe needs.”  Shares fell even as Japan’s jobless rate unexpectedly
declined in June to 4.3 percent, beating analyst expectations
that unemployment would remain flat at 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
