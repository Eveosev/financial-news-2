Shinhan Financial Group Co. (055550) , South
 Korea ’s largest financial company by market value, said second-
quarter profit slumped as provisions for bad loans rose and the
lending margin narrowed.  Net income  fell to 631.4 billion won ($558 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 964.8 billion won a year
earlier, when the company gained 352.2 billion won by selling a
stake in Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., Shinhan said in
an e-mailed statement. The average of 26 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for 654.1 billion won profit.  Shinhan joins  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560)  in reporting lower
earnings as lenders set aside more funds for potential losses on
loans to builders, shipping lines and households amid slower
 economic growth . Profit may erode further as the central bank’s
interest-rate cut earlier this month shrinks loan margins.  “Provision costs pressured earnings last quarter,” Kim Eun Gab, a Seoul-based analyst at NH Investment & Securities
Co., said before the results were published. “Earnings momentum
should further wane in the second half. Shinhan and other banks
may have to add buffers against potential losses amid unstable
economic conditions.”  Shares of Seoul-based Shinhan gained 2.1 percent to 36,200
won at the 3 p.m. close of trading before the earnings were
released. The shares have lost 8.9 percent this year, more than
the 57-stock  Korea Financial Industry index ’s 1 percent decline.  Higher Provisions  Loan-loss provisions rose 13 percent last quarter from a
year earlier to 326.2 billion won, Shinhan said. The net
interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, narrowed to
2.52 percent from 2.72 percent a year earlier and 2.57 percent
in the previous quarter.  Non-performing loans climbed to 1.48 percent of total
credit from 1.45 percent three months earlier.  The  Bank of Korea  unexpectedly cut the benchmark rate a
quarter point to 3 percent on July 12 and signaled it would act
preemptively to protect against a slowing global economy. The
central bank later lowered its 2012 growth forecast to 3 percent
from 3.5 percent, its second downgrade this year.  Combined earnings at  South Korea ’s 18 lenders including
Shinhan’s banking unit plunged 59 percent last quarter from a
year earlier when the lenders posted gains from selling stakes
in Hyundai Engineering, the Financial Supervisory Service said
yesterday. Increased provisions and smaller loan margins weighed
on their profits, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
