Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) ’s
development unit bought two solar plants in California from GCL-
Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. for $266 million, its first
acquisition in the state.  The plants have the capacity to produce 92 megawatts of
electricity, according to an e-mailed statement from the New
York-based company today. The Alpaugh 50 and Alpaugh North
plants are scheduled to start operating in the fourth quarter.
The two projects each provide enough power to serve about 15,000
homes, according to the statement.  Power from the projects will be sold to  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s
Pacific Gas & Electric subsidiary under 25-year agreements.
Under California law, utilities must get 33 percent of their
power from renewable sources like wind or solar by 2020.  GCL-Poly, based in  Hong Kong , announced the transaction
last week without naming the buyer and said it expects to record
a $16 million pretax gain on the sale.  Con Edison fell 0.7 percent to $64.50 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
