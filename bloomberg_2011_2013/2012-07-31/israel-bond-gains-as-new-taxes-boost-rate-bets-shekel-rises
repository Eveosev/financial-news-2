Israel ’s benchmark bonds advanced,
pushing yields down for the first time this week, as government
measures to contain a widening deficit increased bets borrowing
costs will fall in coming months.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.98 percent at
10:54 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The yield has plunged 34 basis points
this month, poised for the biggest monthly drop since August.
 One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell one basis point to
1.99 percent. The swaps have dropped 15 basis points this month.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Cabinet
approved late yesterday a plan to increase taxes and cut
spending in an effort to contain the deficit. The Cabinet voted
on July 1 to double the deficit target for next year to 3
percent of gross domestic product from the originally planned
1.5 percent as economic growth rate fell to its lowest in almost
three years.  “The approval of the steps provides more confidence to the
market that the government is dealing with a widening deficit,”
said Effi Cohen, a bond trader at  Leader Capital Markets (LDRC)  Ltd. in
Tel Aviv. “We are likely to see  interest rates  coming down
further in coming months as the risk associated with a
ballooning deficit is moderated, which is supporting  government
bonds .”  Under the state’s plan, approved by a vote of 20 to 9,
value-added tax will be raised by one percentage point to 17
percent beginning tomorrow. Income tax will rise in 2013 by one
percentage point for most tax brackets, and by two points for
those who earn 67,000 shekels ($16,634) or more a month. Last
week, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz announced a tax increase
on beer and cigarettes.  The central bank will probably lower interest rates by 25
basis points to 2 percent at its meeting Aug. 27, according to
six out of 13 economists in a Bloomberg  survey . The remainder
forecast rates to remain unchanged. The bank on July 23 held the
rate at 2.25 percent citing “economic risks” and “uncertainty
in fiscal policy.”  Rate Cuts  The shekel rose 0.4 percent to 4.0305 a dollar. The
currency has dropped 3 percent this month, the third-worst
performer among the 10 most-active currencies in  Europe , the
Middle East and  Africa , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economic growth will slow to 3.1 percent this year from 4.8
percent in 2011, central bank forecasts show. The slowdown has
reduced  tax revenue , creating a 2.9 billion-shekel shortfall in
the first six months of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said on
July 4.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, fell for the first time since July 16,
retreating one basis point to 230. That implies an average
annual inflation rate of 2.30 percent over the period.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose 0.1 percent to 266.26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
