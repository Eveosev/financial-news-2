Petroliam Nasional Bhd. ,  Malaysia ’s
state oil company, raised the premiums for some grades of crude
exports starting from September in a revision of its pricing
formula, according to two traders with knowledge of the changes.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known, will
sell its Labuan and Kikeh varieties at a premium of $1.30 a
barrel to the monthly official selling price it sets for Tapis
grade, said the traders, who asked not to be identified because
the information is confidential. Labuan was previously priced at
parity and Kikeh didn’t have a monthly fixed price. Nobody
answered a call to Petronas’ press office seeking comment.  Miri crude will cost $1 a barrel more than Tapis, up from
parity to the benchmark grade, while Dulang will be set 40 cents
higher. It was previously priced at a 30-cent discount.  Petronas will continue to set a monthly adjustment factor
for Tapis, a company official said today, asking not to be
identified because of internal rules. This so-called  alpha  is
used to derive the official price of the low-sulfur crude.  The following table shows the formulas for calculating
official selling prices of Malaysia’s crude exports, in dollars
a barrel. The new formulas will apply to cargoes loading from
September:  To contact the reporter on this story:
