Chile’s peso gained to a 12-week
high on speculation central bank meetings in Europe and the U.S.
this week may lead to measures to stimulate global growth.  The currency rose 0.3 percent to 481.35 per U.S. dollar at
10:26 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier reached 480.65 per dollar,
the strongest intraday level since May 4.  The  Federal Reserve  begins a two-day policy meeting today
after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. policy makers are
looking for ways to strengthen growth. The  European Central Bank 
meets in Frankfurt on Aug. 2 after its President  Mario Draghi 
promised to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.  “Dollar selling is outweighing buying, accompanied by a
rise in commodities and a slight rebound in the euro,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “If either of the central banks comes out with a
stimulus package, that could be the trigger to break 480.”  The price of copper, Chile’s biggest export, gained as
China revealed plans to increase spending on its rail network.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
raised their bets against the currency to $9.9 billion on July
27 from $9.8 billion a day earlier, according to data published
today by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
