The White House Office of Management
and Budget informed Congress today that it will exempt from
potential automatic budget cuts billions of dollars earmarked
for military pay and benefits.  Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Jeffrey Zients, in a two-paragraph letter to lawmakers, said the
exemption “is considered in the national interest to safeguard
the resources necessary to compensate the men and women
serving.”  About $135 billion is requested in fiscal 2013 for military
personnel accounts that cover pay, incentives, moving allowances
and funds set aside for military retirement.  “It is recognized that this action would increase the
sequester in other defense programs,” Zients wrote.  “This means the administration will not lay off or reduce
pay and benefits for any uniformed military personnel as a
result of sequestration,” said  Todd Harrison , a budget analyst
at the non-partisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments in  Washington .  “There will be no pink slips going out to troops but it
also means other accounts which fund DoD civilian employees and
contractors will have to be cut by even more,” he said. “DoD
civil service workers may be the first to go. DoD would likely
have no choice but to lay off or furlough 10 to 15 percent of
its 790,000 civilian workers almost immediately after
sequestration occurs,” Harrison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
