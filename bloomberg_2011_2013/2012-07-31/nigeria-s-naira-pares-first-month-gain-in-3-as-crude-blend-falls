The naira declined against the
dollar as  Nigeria ’s benchmark crude blend retreated, paring its
first monthly gain in three after monetary tightening by the
central bank last week.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.2
percent to 160.8975 a dollar as of 3:26 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has gained 1.1 percent this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “ Oil prices  will continue to have a major influence on the
value of the naira and if recent prices falls are sustained, the
naira is likely to remain under pressure with an ongoing
weakening bias,”  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  strategists led by
Paul-Harry Aithnard in Paris, wrote in a note to clients today.
The naira appreciated last week “partly due to recent indirect
monetary tightening,” the Ecobank analysts wrote.  Nigerian benchmark  Bonny Light crude , which has risen 8.4
percent this month, fell a second day, down 0.2 percent. The
 Central Bank of Nigeria  said July 24 it reduced the amount of
foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of their
shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and kept its
 interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent. The amount of cash as a
percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold with the
central bank was increased to 12 percent from 8 percent.  The yield on Nigeria’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 fell 10 basis points to 16.12 percent, according to July 30
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
declined 12 basis points to 5.33 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9575 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
