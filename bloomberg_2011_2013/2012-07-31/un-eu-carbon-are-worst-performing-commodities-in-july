United Nations greenhouse-gas
credits and European Union carbon permits were the world’s
two fastest-falling commodities in July, amid concern that EU
regulators may struggle to cut oversupply in the bloc’s market.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December dropped 33 percent during the month. They were up 8.5
percent at 2.82 euros ($3.47) a metric ton today after closing
yesterday at a record 2.60 euros. EU carbon for December dropped
16 percent this month, the second worst of 80 commodities
tracked by Bloomberg. Lean hog futures in Chicago were the
third-worst performer with a drop of 15 percent.  EU carbon may drop further because of probable delays to a
proposal that would temporarily withhold permits sold at
auctions planned for the next three years, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance analyst Konrad Hanschmidt said yesterday. The contract
was the best-performing commodity in June, rising 30 percent.  “The market sentiment changed from one that was optimistic
about the supply-delay proposal to one that is pessimistic,”
Matthew Gray, an analyst at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London, said
today in a phone interview.  EU carbon allowances for December jumped 5.2 percent to
close at 6.93 euros a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. German power, U.K. natural gas and European coal all
advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
