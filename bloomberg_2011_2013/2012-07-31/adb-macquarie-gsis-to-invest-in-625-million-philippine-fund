The  Asian Development Bank ,
Philippine state pension fund Government Service Insurance
System, Dutch pension asset manager Algemene Pensioen Groep NV
and  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  will invest in a $625 million-fund
focused on infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation.  The private equity fund will focus on energy, power, water,
environment, communication and  public-private partnership
projects  in the  Philippines , GSIS said in a statement today.
Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets will manage the fund.  “Now is the best time to invest in the Philippines,”
Frank Kwok, a senior managing director at Macquarie, said in a
briefing in Manila today. “We are confident there will be a
steady pipeline of projects and that we can disburse the funds
in a relatively short period of time.”  President  Benigno Aquino  is winning confidence from
investors and ratings companies as he increases state spending
to a record and bolsters an economy that expanded 6.4 percent in
the first quarter. The government is seeking investments in more
than $16 billion worth of infrastructure projects from roads to
schools and airports as it increases incomes and reduces poverty.  GSIS, the lead investor, committed $400 million, President
Robert Vergara said in the briefing today. The other investors
declined to reveal the size of their contributions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
