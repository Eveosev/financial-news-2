Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of construction equipment, cut its annual profit
forecast after first-quarter earnings dropped 42 percent on
lower sales in  China  and a slowdown in Indonesia demand.  Net income will probably be 157 billion yen ($2 billion)
for the 12 months ending March 31, compared with a forecast of
190 billion yen made in April and 167 billion yen a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement. The
cut came after the company said profit fell to 32.1 billion yen
in the three months to June from 55.7 billion yen a year ago.  Japan ’s rebuilding from last year’s earthquake and tsunami
and higher sales from  North America  failed to cover declining
revenue from China, where slowing economic growth and government
property market curbs are sapping demand. Caterpillar Inc.,
Komatsu’s larger U.S. rival, last week raised its full-year
profit outlook as increasing demand from North American builders
and overseas mining companies bucks an economic slowdown.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Japan’s second-largest
producer, on July 25 cut its operating profit forecast 7.7
percent for the year through March, citing delays in an expected
recovery in China. The company boosted its full-year net income
outlook by 14 percent to 40 billion yen.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , China’s biggest maker of
excavators, has lowered its sales forecast for the equipment.
Excavator sales may increase 10 percent this year, slower than a
previous target of 40 percent, Vice Chairman Xiang Wenbo said in
a July 11 interview.  Komatsu  rose  1.6 percent to 1,758 yen before release of the
quarterly result and outlook. The stock has declined 2.3 percent
since the beginning of January compared with a 2.8 percent gain
for the Nikkei 225 stock average and Caterpillar’s 5 percent
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
