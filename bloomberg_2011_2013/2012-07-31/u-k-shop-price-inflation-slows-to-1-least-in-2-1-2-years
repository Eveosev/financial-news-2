U.K.  shop-price inflation  cooled to
its lowest in 2 1/2 years in July as stores cut prices for food
and groceries, the British Retail Consortium said.  Retail prices rose 1 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a 1.1 percent gain in June, the trade group and Nielsen Co.
said in a report in London today. That’s the smallest gain since
November 2009.  Food-price inflation slowed to 3.1 percent from 3.5
percent, while non-food prices fell an annual 0.3 percent.  “Extra promotions, particularly linked to party food and
this summer’s big events, are combining with past falls in
commodity prices which are working their way through to shop
prices,” BRC Director General Stephen Robertson said in the
report. “But the relief may not last. Poor harvests, especially
of corn and wheat in the U.S., are creating a build-up of
inflationary pressure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
