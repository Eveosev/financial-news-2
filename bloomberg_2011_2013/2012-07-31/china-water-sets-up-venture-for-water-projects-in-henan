China Water Affairs Group Ltd. (855) , a
municipal water and sewage treatment provider, agreed to
establish a joint venture for water-related investments and
construction in Henan and neighboring Chinese provinces.  Jianghe Water Affairs Co., a unit of China Water, will
invest 135 million  yuan  ($21.2 million) and own a 45 percent
stake in the venture. The rest will be held by Henan Water
Resources Construction Investment Co. and Huanghe Water Affairs
Co., China Water said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing.  “The water business in Henan and its adjacent areas have
booming potential,” with water resources infrastructures in the
Yellow River basin and the “South to North Water Diversion”
