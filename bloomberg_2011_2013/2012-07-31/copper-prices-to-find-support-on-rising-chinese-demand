Chinese copper demand may expand as
much as 7 percent this year, outpacing supply,  Southern Copper
Corp. (SCCO) ’s Financial Planning Manager Raul Jacob said.  Copper fundamentals are “sound” as global copper supply
has lagged demand this year, with strikes, power shortages and
depleting mines curbing output, Jacob said.  China  will see “growth in copper demand of 6 to 7 percent
this year, which should give support to the copper market in the
next few months,” Jacob said today on a conference call with
analysts. “Demand from emerging economies is also growing,
somewhat offsetting weaker consumption in the European and U.S.
markets.”  CRU, a London-based metals consulting firm, forecasts
global demand for refined copper this year will expand 3.5
percent, or 675,000 metric tons, while copper supply will grow
less than 1 percent, Jacob said. Labor strife halted copper
output at mines in Chile, Peru and  Indonesia  this year.  Southern, the largest copper producer in Peru and Mexico,
will increase second-half investment in mine expansions in both
countries to meet this year’s $1.5 billion capital expenditure
target, Jacob said. The company plans to invest an additional
$1.6 billion in 2013, he said.  Copper futures for September delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to settle at $3.4175 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
