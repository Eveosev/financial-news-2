Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , a developer in
insolvency proceedings, sold its 26 percent in a solar thermal
power project in Spain to a unit of German utility Steag GmbH.  It agreed to sell the interest in the 50-megawatt Arenales
project near Seville for a “double-digit million euro” amount
that’s more than the equity invested, boosting prospects for
creditors, administrator Volker Boehm said today in a statement.  The project, also owned by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s RREEF unit
and Spanish builder  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , is in construction
after being funded by a group of eight banks in September 2011.  The deal follows the sale of Solar Millennium’s interest in
the Andasol 3 solar thermal project in  Spain  and its stake in
developer Flagsol GmbH this month. Solar thermal power involves
concentrating the sun’s rays with mirrors to make steam and
power turbines to generate electricity.  Solar Millennium, based in Erlangen, Germany, filed for
insolvency on Dec. 21, citing slow progress in selling its U.S.
assets and the failure to reach an agreement on bringing in
investors for its Ibersol venture in Spain.
