Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the online game
developer that missed analysts’ second-quarter revenue and
profit estimates, was sued by an investor who alleged
shareholders were misled about the company’s financial health.  Zynga told investors earlier this year it expected
bookings, a measure of sales of virtual goods, of as much as
$1.45 billion in 2012 with growth concentrated in the second
half, while hiding a drop-off in users and delays in releasing
new games, investor Mark DeStefano claimed in a securities fraud
lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco yesterday.  Zynga, the biggest developer of games played on Facebook
Inc.’s social network, rose to $15.91 in March from $13.49 in
February and company insiders sold shares worth $500 million in
a secondary stock offering in April, according to the complaint.  After the company posted lower-than-expected second-quarter
earnings, disclosed delays in releasing games and lowered its
full-year outlook on July 25, its shares fell 40 percent to
$2.97, causing investor losses, DeStefano claimed.  The lawsuit, which names company managers and underwriters
as defendants, seeks approval as a class action, or group
lawsuit, representing all investors who purchased shares from
Feb. 28 to July 25 and unspecified damages.  Dani Dudeck, a Zynga spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the lawsuit in an e-mail.  The case is DeStefano v. Zynga, 12-4007, U.S. District
Court, Northern California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
