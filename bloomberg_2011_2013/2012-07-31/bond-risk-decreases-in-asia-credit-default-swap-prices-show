The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment fell in  Asia , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 1 basis point to 159 basis
points as of 8:45 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge has fallen 11 basis points this month and has
ranged between 132.5 basis points and 210 basis points this
year, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 167
as of 10:45 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show. The
measure fell 7.4 basis points yesterday to that level, its
lowest since May 8, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index was also little changed at
182 basis points as of 9:29 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark has traded between 168.5 and 188.8 this
month, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
