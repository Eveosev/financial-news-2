World coffee exports climbed 5.2
percent in June from a year earlier, according to the
 International Coffee Organization .  Global shipments totaled 9.58 million bags of 60 kilograms
(132 pounds) last month, up from 9.11 million bags in June 2011,
the London-based group said in a  report  on its website today.
Exports for the first nine months of the 2011-12 season that
started in October fell 0.3 percent to 81.16 million bags.  Robusta coffee shipments rose 11 percent to 31.66 million
bags for the season through June, boosted by exports from
Vietnam, the biggest producer. The nationâ€™s exports climbed 32
percent in the period to 18.3 million bags, the data showed.
Arabica shipments dropped 6.2 percent to 49.5 million bags for
the season so far, ICO data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored
for specialty drinks such as those made by Starbucks Corp.
Robusta beans are harvested mainly in Asia and parts of Africa
and are used in instant coffee and espresso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
