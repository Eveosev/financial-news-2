Turkey may intervene in  Syria  if al-
Qaeda or Kurdish militants set up bases near the border or an
independent ethnic or religious state is declared, Foreign
Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  told  Haberturk  newspaper.  The government would consider the presence of al-Qaeda or
the Kurdistan Workers Party on the two countries’ border or
instability in Aleppo that threatens Turkey justification for
intervention, the Istanbul-based paper today cited Davutoglu as
saying in an interview.  Turkey will oppose any groups, whether Kurdish, Sunni or
Druze, from taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to proclaim
their independence, the paper cited him as saying.  “A Kurdish state can’t be established,” Haberturk quoted
Davutoglu as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
