Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, applied to Swedish safety regulators to build
one or two nuclear reactors to replace its older plants.  “There has been no  investment decision ,” Chief Financial
Officer Ingrid Bonde said today. “It’s a very long process.”  Sweden in 2010 agreed to keep a total of 10 reactors in the
country while allowing older plants to be replaced. The Swedish
Radiation Safety Authority  said  it may take 10-15 years from the
receipt of a request for a new reactor to start up. Replacements
may be needed after 2025, according to Vattenfall’s  application .  The authority will draw up regulations for the new reactors
by the end of 2014 at the earliest, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
