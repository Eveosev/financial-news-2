U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains and European shares extended losses after the German
finance ministry said it sees no need to give  Europe ’s bailout
fund a banking license.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September were down less than 0.1 percent at 9:15 a.m. in New
York after earlier climbing as much as 0.4 percent. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index extended its drop to 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
