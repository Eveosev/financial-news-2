Italy’s  jobless rate  rose to the
highest in almost 13 years in June as employers remain reluctant
to hire amid a deepening recession.  The  unemployment rate  increased to a seasonally-adjusted
10.8 percent, the highest since the third quarter of 1999, from a
revised 10.6 percent in May, Rome-based national statistics
office Istat said in a preliminary report today. Economists
forecast an increase to 10.3 percent, the median of eight
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Italy’s economy shrank for a third straight quarter in the
first three months of 2012 as the region’s debt crisis worsened
and Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity measures pushed the
country deeper into its fourth recession since 2001. The young
have been particularly hard hit, with joblessness among people
aged 15 to 24 at 34.3 percent in June, Istat said.  Industrial output in the euro region’s third-biggest
economy probably fell 1.7 percent in the three months through
June from the previous quarter as orders dropped, signaling the
economy likely contracted for a fourth quarter, Rome-based
employers lobby Confindustria said in a note on July 26.  Last week an Italian judge ordered the partial closure of
the Ilva steel plant in the southern city of Taranto over
pollution concerns, prompting unions to call an indefinite
strike. The decision, which may affect 12,000 employees,
followed an inquiry into whether chemicals pumped from the plant
caused high cancer rates and other diseases in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
