Shares of  Texas Roadhouse Inc. (TXRH)  fell
the most in almost a year on investor concerns about slowing
traffic and margin pressures at the restaurant chain.  The  stock  of the Louisville, Kentucky-based company fell as
much as 7.2 percent to $16.65 in  New York , the biggest intraday
decline since Aug. 18. The shares had risen 20 percent this year
before today.  Food costs for the year will rise about 7 percent, chief
financial officer Price Cooper said yesterday during a
conference call. Average check growth will slow to 2.5 percent
in the fourth quarter after a 4 percent gain during the first
half of the year, which may squeeze margins, he said.  ”Investors are concerned about the slowing guest traffic
trends and increased margin compression in the second half of
the year as pricing wanes,”  Larry Miller , an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets Corp., said today in an e-mail. “The good news
is food inflation has moderated. The bad news it still is
forecast up 7% this year, which is among the highest inflation
faced by our companies this year.”  Texas Roadhouse yesterday reported second-quarter per-share
earnings of 28 cents, better than the 24-cent average of analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Comparable restaurant sales
grew 4.5 percent at company-owned locations and 4.8 percent at
franchised outlets, the company said yesterday in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
