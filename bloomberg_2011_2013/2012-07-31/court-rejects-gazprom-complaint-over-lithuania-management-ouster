The Stockholm arbitration court
turned down  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) ’s complaint over  Lithuania ’s plan to
oust managers representing the Russian gas-export monopoly at
the  Lietuvos Dujos AB (LDJ1L)  gas utility.  The court decided that Gazprom can’t prevent the government
from seeking a judicial ruling over the performance of the
Lietuvos Dujos management, the Energy Ministry in Vilnius,
Lithuania’s capital, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The government sought to oust Lietuvos Dujos’s management,
alleging it ignored the interests of Lithuania and didn’t
negotiate a fair gas price for Russian supplies. Gazprom holds
37 percent in the company.  Lithuania is splitting ownership of the gas sales and
transmission activities of Lietuvos Dujos as part of a European
Union drive to force dominant energy companies to improve access
for competitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
