Nigeria ’s state-owned oil company
and Niger Delta Exploration & Production Plc, a local producer,
signed an agreement to explore in the oil-rich southern Niger
River.  The move is “part of measures to grow the in-country
upstream capacity of the  petroleum industry ,” Andrew Yakubu,
the newly appointed Group Managing Director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., said today in an e-mailed statement
from Abuja, the capital. The two companies will explore and
produce crude from Oil Mining Lease 34 where the state oil
company owns 55 percent interest, the company said in the
statement. Niger Delta Exploration owns the remaining 45 percent
share.  OML 34 was previously operated by Royal Dutch Shell’s
Nigerian unit, which held a 30 percent stake until the company
divested its interest. Total SA held a 10 percent stake and Eni
SpA had a 5 percent.  Nigeria is  Africa ’s top crude producer and produced an
average of 2.18 million barrels per day in May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. At least 90 percent of the country’s
oil is pumped by the NNPC in joint ventures with Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni
SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
