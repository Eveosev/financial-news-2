Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Elop and several directors last week bought more than 
$1 million of the company’s shares, which fell to an 18-year low 
this month amid plunging sales.  Elop, a former Microsoft Corp. executive who took over in
2010, bought 275,000 shares of the mobile-phone maker’s stock,
boosting his holding to 425,000 shares, Jennifer Lyons, a Nokia
spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. Chairman  Risto Siilasmaa 
purchased 333,000 shares, lifting his total holding to 732,592
shares. Other board members also increased their ownership.  The stock  fell  to 1.33 euros ($1.64) on July 18 -- the
lowest level since 1994 -- a day before the Espoo, Finland-based
company reported second-quarter earnings. While the stock has
advanced since, it is still down more than 90 percent in the
past five years amid market-share losses to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Android devices. Nokia today rose
8.8 percent to 1.95 euros in Helsinki.  “The purchases underscore the board and our leaders’
commitment to Nokia and confidence in our future,” Lyons said.  The stock purchases were earlier reported by Finnish
broadcaster MTV3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
