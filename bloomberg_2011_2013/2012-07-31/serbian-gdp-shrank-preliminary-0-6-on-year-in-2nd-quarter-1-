Serbia’s gross domestic product
contracted for the second consecutive three-month period in the
second quarter as  Europe ’s debt crisis continued to damp demand
for the Balkan nation’s exports.  Economic output shrank 0.6 percent from the same period a
year earlier after a 1.3 percent decline in the first quarter,
the Statistics Office in Belgrade said in a flash estimate
today. It gave no further details. The central bank had forecast
0.7 percent growth.  Serbia is trying to avoid a second recession in three years
and the government, sworn in on July 27, is preparing anti-
crisis measures to stop the economic decline and trim
unemployment, which reached 25.5 percent in April. The slowdown
has boosted the  budget deficit , current-account gap and public
debt, which have all exceeded targets agreed with the
 International Monetary Fund  in 2011.  Economic growth this year will largely be driven by
consumption, rather than net exports or investments, according
to central bank’s April report. The central bank sees net
foreign investments declining to 400 million euros ($489.9
million) this year from 1.8 billion euros in 2011.  The IMF sees Serbia’s full-year economic growth at 0.5
percent. The Statistics Office will release more detailed GDP
figures on Sept. 28, it said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
