Oil options volatility rose as
futures fell amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will be less
likely to announce additional measures to stimulate the economy
after U.S.  consumer confidence  and business activity
unexpectedly grew.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.3 percent at 3:35 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 30.1 yesterday.  Oil for September delivery fell $1.72, or 1.9 percent, to
settle at $88.06 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  A Bloomberg survey of economists showed the Fed will
probably forgo a third round of large-scale asset purchases at a
two-day meeting beginning today. Consumer confidence rose for
the first time in five months in July and a barometer of
business activity gained.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which rose 14 cents to 32 cents a barrel at
3:41 p.m. with 2,981 lots trading. September $85 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,851 lots changing hands as
they rose 53 cents to $1.26 a barrel.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 51
percent of the 55,031 contracts traded.  September $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 4,099 lots changing hands. They fell 4 cents to
18 cents a barrel. September $85 puts declined 8 cents to 73
cents on volume of 2,568.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,408
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,929 lots and
December $120 calls with 38,420.  To contact the reporter on this story:
