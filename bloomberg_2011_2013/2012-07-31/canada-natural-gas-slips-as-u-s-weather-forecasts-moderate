Canadian natural gas declined as
revised forecasts showing more moderate U.S. weather for mid-
August may signal limited demand by electricity generators.  August gas in Alberta  fell 1.5 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted normal temperatures
in the Northeast and more of the Western U.S. over the next 11
to 15 days, instead of the hotter weather forecast yesterday.
Hot weather has helped reduce a U.S. natural gas  supply glut 
since the end of March by spurring power-plant demand.  “We have  weather forecasts  slipping back and forth a
little bit,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk management specialist
at Intl FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park , Minnesota. “It’s a
little surprising to see it down here simply for the fact that
the forecast continues to stay warm.”  Alberta gas for August delivery declined 3.75 cents to
C$2.42 per gigajoule ($2.28 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:25 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  fell 0.5 cent, or 0.2 percent, to settle at
$3.209 per million Btu.  The high temperature in Boston may rise to 91 degrees
Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) on Aug. 8, 10 above normal, before
dropping six days later to 71 degrees, 9 below normal, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. Las Vegas
may see a high of 92 on Aug. 14, 10 below normal.  Line Volumes  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16 billion cubic
feet at 2:30 p.m. New York time, below the target of 16.2
billion.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.94 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.93 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 171 million cubic feet today. The system
was forecast to carry 1.85 billion, 92 percent of the estimated
capacity of 2.018 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.78
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
