Tulsa and the Metropolitan Utility
Authority are treating Tulsa’s water supply with a new secondary
disinfectant, chloramine, and will continue using chlorine as
the primary disinfectant, the Oklahoma city said.  The new treatment plan, announced in June 2010, will help
Tulsa meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s stricter water
safety rules and provide higher standards for drinking water and
longer-lasting protection, the city said in a news release.  Chloramine has been used to treat water in U.S. cities
since 1917 and will help reduce the concentration of regulated
disinfection byproducts in the distribution system while
controlling bacterial growth in the water system, the city said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
