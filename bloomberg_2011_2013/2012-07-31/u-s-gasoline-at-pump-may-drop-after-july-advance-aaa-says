U.S.  gasoline prices  at the pump
rose in July, stoked by increased costs for crude oil and
ethanol, according to AAA.  The average price at the pump increased 5.1 percent, or 17
cents a gallon, to $3.42, said Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the
largest U.S. motoring group. It was the largest July increase
since the group began keeping records in 2000.  West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, settled
at $89.78 a barrel yesterday, up 5.7 percent for the month.  Corn, the primary component of ethanol, has surged to a
record as the worst U.S. drought in at least a generation
lingered, threatening yields in the world’s biggest grower and
exporter. Corn for December delivery climbed to $8.14 a bushel
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade from $6.3475 on June 29.  The group predicted  gas prices  will remain relatively
unchanged or slightly increase in August.  “Drivers will continue to face high pump prices in the
weeks ahead as the summer draws to a close,” Avery Ash, a
spokesman based in Heathrow, said in a written statement.
“Relief fortunately may be around the corner as we expect gas
prices to drop this fall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
