Syndicated loans in  Japan  jumped 12
percent to the highest in four years in the first half aided by
demand for acquisition funds as companies sought to take
advantage of the yen near postwar highs to expand overseas.  Lending increased to 15.1 trillion yen ($193 billion) in
the six months ended June 30 from the same period a year
earlier, the highest since 15.8 trillion yen in the first half
of 2008, according to figures released today on the Japanese
Bankers Association’s  website . The outstanding balance of loans
rose 7 percent to 59.8 trillion yen, the highest in at least
eight years.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., whose 9.6 billion euro ($12
billion) acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Nycomed was the biggest
overseas deal by a Japanese company last year, signed an 80
billion yen facility in March to help pay for the purchase. The
average rate Japanese companies pay on new loans held below 1
percent for the second straight month in June, while rates on
existing facilities dropped to a record low, the  Bank of Japan 
said today.  “The  exchange rate  is prompting companies to consider
expanding overseas which has resulted in increased demand for
acquisition financing,” Takeshi Shibasaki, the chief strategist
at Mizuho Securities Co. said by telephone today from Tokyo.
“ Interest rates  at such a low level are also a draw for the
companies.”  The yen was at 78.24 per dollar at 2:21 p.m. in Tokyo
today. The Japanese currency climbed to a post-World War II
record of 75.35 on Oct. 31. It has risen 5.8 percent in the past
three months against a basket of nine developed-market peers,
making it the best performer among the group, according to the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index.  Loan Rates  Japan’s average rate on new loans was 0.997 percent in
June, holding below 1 percent for a second straight month, the
BOJ said in a statement on its website today. Existing loan
rates fell to a record low of 1.409 percent, it said.  Takeda Pharmaceutical is paying 1 basis point more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate on the six-year
portion of its 80 billion yen loan and matching the rate on its
four-year part, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Toshiba Corp. borrowed 150 billion yen from Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. in
January to pay for its July purchase of Swiss electronic
metering company Landis+Gyr AG.  The funding includes a four-year facility which pays a
margin of 7.5 basis points more than the six-month  Tokyo 
interbank offered  rate . That’s equivalent to about 0.505
percent, compared with a weighted average coupon of 1.29 percent
Toshiba is paying on its outstanding bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Volumes ex-Japan  Overseas acquisitions by Japanese companies totaled $37.7
billion in the first half of 2012 compared with $42 billion the
first half of 2011 and $48.6 billion the second half of 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Syndicated loan volumes in Asia-Pacific outside of Japan in
the first six months to 2012 totaled $159.4 billion, a 29
percent decrease on the same period of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Loan volumes have been dropping as banks’ wholesale cost of
funding increases and borrowers, faced with rising interest
costs, postpone refinancing. Average interest margins for U.S.
dollar loans in Asia outside of Japan rose to 270.8 basis points
since Dec. 31 from 247.8 basis points the same period of 2011.  Sales of Japanese corporate bonds were little changed in
the first six months from the same period a year earlier at 3.9
trillion yen, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offerings rose 80
percent to 832 billion yen this month from June, bolstered by a
return to the market of two nuclear utilities, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
