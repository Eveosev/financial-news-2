Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-biggest bank, said profit slumped 58 percent in
the three months through June as it complied with government
orders to take losses on real estate.  Net income  dropped to 505 million euros ($619.9 million)
from 1.19 billion euros in the year-earlier period, the Bilbao,
Spain-based lender said in a filing to regulators today.
Earnings missed the 695.5 million-euro average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BBVA’s  presence  in growing markets such as  Mexico , Colombia
and  Turkey  has helped it withstand declining earnings, lending
and deposits in Spain as the recession deepened and corporate
clients pulled out 6 billion euros following debt-rating
downgrades. The  bank , which does 60 percent of its lending at
home, said it has now booked 1.43 billion euros of the 4.6
billion euros of provisions ordered by the government to purge
the real estate loans that it accumulated during the boom.  “There is a timing issue with the real estate provisioning
in  Spain  but they will get it done,” said Daragh Quinn, an
analyst at Nomura International in Madrid, in a phone interview
today. “When you take out the effect of provisioning, the
results look pretty good with a strong revenue performance and
stable asset quality.”  Shares Gain  BBVA fell 4.6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 5.32 euros in
Madrid. The stock is down 19 percent this year. The bank, which
earned 6.13 billion euros in profit before provisions in the
first half, is on course to earn 12 billion euros by that
measure over the whole year, President and Chief Operating
Officer Angel Cano said on a  webcast  for analysts.  Gross lending rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier as
deposits fell 1.5 percent, the bank said. The ratio of bad loans
to total lending was unchanged in June from March at 4 percent.  Loans newly classified as in default jumped to 3.72 billion
euros from 3.09 billion euros in the first quarter. The total of
bad loans reached 16.1 billion euros from 15.5 billion euros a
year earlier.  Net interest income, or revenue from lending after payments
to depositors, rose 16 percent to 3.74 billion euros, the bank
said. The bank is in the process of selling 2 billion euros of
“damaged assets” of different types, Chief Financial Officer
Manuel Gonzalez Cid said on a webcast for analysts today.  Adjusted net income from Spain fell 38 percent to 255
million euros, BBVA said. The bad-loan ratio for the division
rose to 5.1 percent from 4.9 percent in March.  Spanish Lending  Spanish lending fell 3.7 percent from a year ago and
deposits slid 8.4 percent. The bank lost 3.64 billion euros of
Spanish deposits in the second quarter compared with the first
quarter, BBVA said.  Earnings from Mexico, the biggest contributor to BBVA’s
profits, rose 1.2 percent to 439 million euros. Profit from
 South America  climbed to 330 million euros from 270 million
euros a year ago and earnings from Eurasia, a division that
pools BBVA’s business in Turkey and  China  and operations in
 Europe  outside Spain, rose to 277 million euros from 249 million
euros.  Earnings from corporate and investment banking fell 9
percent. BBVA will also suffer a 350 million-euro hit to profits
through 2013 after Telefonica SA scrapped a 1.5 euro-a-share
dividend for 2012, Gonzalez Cid said. The bank has a stake of
almost 7 percent in Telefonica.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest bank, on July 26 posted
a 93 percent slump in second-quarter profit as it purged real
estate loans. Its stock has dropped 8.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
