Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened for a
sixth month, poised for its longest losing streak since 1998, on
concern Europe’s debt crisis will damp growth and exports.  The nation will probably record its third consecutive trade
deficit of  $530 million  in June as overseas sales fell 7.9
percent, according to a median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, ahead of data due tomorrow. The economy will expand
6.1 percent to 6.5 percent this year, compared with a previous
estimate of 6.3 percent to 6.7 percent, the central bank said in
a July 13 statement. The  World Bank  also cut its annual growth
projection for Indonesia this month.  “The lowered forecasts are negative for the rupiah, even
if they are just a domino effect from the slowdown seen in other
countries,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, the head of treasury at
PT Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta. “The rupiah’s
gains will be limited next month as long as  Europe  continues to
be a concern.”  The rupiah dropped 0.5 percent in July to 9,475 per dollar
as of 9:01 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.3 percent today and
4.3 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped one percentage point this
month to 7.5 percent. It fell 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage
point, today.  Global funds bought $357 million more local stocks than
they sold in July through yesterday and added 10 trillion rupiah
($1.1 billion) to their government bond holdings this month
through July 27, according to data from the exchange and finance
ministry.  “There is still interest in Indonesia’s assets, but the
flows into stocks and bonds this month are mostly hot money,
which is unstable,” said Fuliangsahar.  The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds advanced this
month by the most since January, with the  yield  declining 42
basis points to 5.74 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
