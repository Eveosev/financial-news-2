Trying to win a second term in the
U.S. House, Republican Nan Hayworth of  New York  has almost
tripled her fundraising.  “I’m out there on the road, in the district, as I should
be,” Hayworth said. “I have a team that’s amazing. But dollars
are required. Those dollars go toward cable, radio, brochures,
getting the troops on the ground.”  The fundraising by Hayworth and other Republicans in
competitive races is a boost to the party’s chances of retaining
the House this fall. Republicans made a net gain of 64 seats in
November 2010 and recaptured the majority they held from 1995 to
2007.  Of the 19 Republicans most in danger of losing their House
seats in November, including Hayworth, 14 had more money in the
bank as of June 30 than their Democratic opponents.  The most vulnerable lawmakers are those listed in toss-up
contests or as underdogs by two Washington-based publications
that track congressional races, the Cook Political Report and
the Rothenberg Political Report.  “We cannot afford to take anything for granted in this
election,” said  Paul Lindsay , a spokesman for the  National
Republican Congressional Committee .  Hayworth raised $2.2 million through June 30, compared with
$738,382 during the same period two years ago, not including a
$500,000 personal loan. Her amount of cash in the bank almost
doubled, to $1.5 million from $775,000 at the same time in 2008.  Clinton Aide  Her opponent, Sean Patrick Maloney, a former aide to
President  Bill Clinton , emerged from a Democratic primary with
$264,364 in the bank. He raised $675,771 through June 30.  Maloney’s campaign manager, Timothy Persico, said
Hayworth’s money is coming from the special interests she has
represented in Washington.  “Congresswoman Hayworth has spent her time in Washington
fighting for Big Oil and the  insurance industry  - she even wrote
a bill allowing CEOs to hide their salaries,” Persico said.
“PACs and corporate lobbyists have sent over a million dollars
to Congresswoman Hayworth because she’s worth every penny.”  Representative  Allen West  of  Florida , a Tea Party favorite,
raised $10.1 million and entered July with $3.7 million in the
bank. When he was first elected in 2010, he spent $6 million.  Super-PAC Help  West’s leading Democratic challenger, small-businessman
Patrick Murphy, raised $2.3 million and had $1.3 million in the
bank. Murphy’s campaign is also being helped by a super-
political action committee, American Sunrise, which has raised
$350,050, including $250,000 from Murphy’s father, Thomas.  “We’ll have more than enough to get our message out to the
voters,” said Murphy’s campaign manager, Anthony Kusich. West,
running in a different district than the one he now represents,
“has to spend a lot of time rehabbing his image and introducing
himself to new voters.”  In two races, one each in  Iowa  and Ohio, House incumbents
are pitted against each other, and the Republicans also came out
on top. In Iowa, Tom Latham had $2.1 million in the bank as of
June 30 compared with $473,550 for Democrat Leonard Boswell.
Ohio Republican Jim Renacci reported $1.5 million cash on hand
compared with $903,710 for Democrat Betty Sutton.  The Republican financial advantage has been amplified by
spending by outside groups.  Republican Ads  Crossroads GPS, founded with the help of Republican
strategist  Karl Rove , ran 538 spots and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce ran 120 spots to help Latham through July 23, according
to New York-based Kantar Media’s CMAG, which tracks ad spending.
Both groups keep their donors secret.  House Majority PAC, a Democratic super-political action
committee that discloses its contributors, ran 386 spots to help
Boswell.  Some Democratic challengers are having success in matching
or exceeding their Republican opponents. Ami Bera in California,
Tammy Duckworth in  Illinois  and Gary McDowell in  Michigan  all
have more money to spend than the Republican lawmakers they’re
trying to oust.  So do two Democrats in rematches. In  New Hampshire , Ann McLane Kuster reported a bank account balance of $1.3 million to
$912,791 for Republican Representative Charles Bass. Former
Representative  Dan Maffei  of New York entered July with $880,267
cash-on-hand while Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, who ousted
him two years ago, had $765,105.  U.S. Chamber  Still, Republican outside spending cut into the Democratic
financial advantage. For example, the Chamber ran 225 ads to
help Buerkle, according to CMAG.  Only one vulnerable Democratic incumbent, Mark Critz in
 Pennsylvania , had less money to spend than his opponent.
Republican Keith Rothfus had $644,936 in the bank at the end of
June while Critz had $428,275.  In the Senate, the four most endangered incumbents all
entered July with more money in the bank than their opponents:
Republicans  Scott Brown  of Massachusetts and  Dean Heller  of
Nevada, and Democrats  Claire McCaskill  of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana.  Brown had $15.6 million cash on hand to $13.5 million for
Harvard law professor  Elizabeth Warren . Heller had $4.4 million
the bank compared with $4 million for Representative Shelley Berkley.  Tester’s $3.6 million gave him a financial edge over
Republican Representative Denny Rehberg with $2.7 million. And
McCaskill has more money to spend, $3.6 million, than her three
Republican rivals combined: Representative Todd Akin, who has
banked $1.4 million; former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, with
$561,661; and businessman John Brunner, $182,914.  To contact the reporter on this story:
