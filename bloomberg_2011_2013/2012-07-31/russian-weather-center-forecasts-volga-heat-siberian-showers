Russia’s state weather center
forecast “abnormal heat” in the Volga and Central federal
districts this week and showers in parts of the Siberian and
Southern federal districts.  Temperatures will reach 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the Volga area in August’s first two days, 5 to 7
degrees Celsius above normal, the center  said  on its website
today. It predicted a similar deviation from the norm as high as
32 degrees Celsius in the Central Federal District from today
through Aug. 4.  Heavy rains will cover the Southern district’s Krasnodar
region as well as leading Siberian grain-producing areas today
and tomorrow, the center said.  The Volga district accounted for 23 percent of last year’s
national grain crop with a harvest of 21.2 million metric tons,
according to government statistics. The Central district had an
18 percent share after harvesting about 17 million tons. The
Southern and Siberian districts contributed 22.7 million and
14.6 million tons respectively, or 24 percent and 16 percent of
the national crop.  Russia has experienced a drought across grain-growing areas
from the south to Siberia since May, and 16 of the country’s
regions have been affected by heat. The  Agriculture Ministry 
expects this year’s cereal crop to come in at 80 million to 85
million tons, down from 94.2 million tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
