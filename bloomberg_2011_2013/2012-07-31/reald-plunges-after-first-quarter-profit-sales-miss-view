RealD Inc. (RLD) , the supplier of 3-D
projection systems to theaters, fell the most since its market
debut two years ago after reporting a quarterly profit that
missed analysts’ estimates because of costs to supply theaters
with new eyeglasses.  RealD tumbled 23 percent to $9.70 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest drop since its July 2010 initial public offering.
Yesterday, the  Beverly Hills , California-based company reported
first-quarter profit fell 69 percent. The stock, up 59 percent
this year through July 30, was the  second-worst performer  in the
 Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   The profit decline resulted from a lower mix of recycled 3-
D eyewear in shipments to theaters, the company said. Product
costs jumped by 50 percent to $26.8 million. The ratio of new to
recycled eyewear varies from quarter to quarter based on
inventories, Chief Financial Officer Drew Skarupa said.  “It will fluctuate quite a bit,” Skarupa said on a
conference call yesterday. “We continue to urge the Street to
look at this from a break-even perspective.”  Profit in the period ended June 22 fell to $3 million, or 5
cents a share, RealD said yesterday in a statement. That missed
the 15-cent average of eight analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 14 percent to $68.2 million, below the
$70.8 million predicted by analysts.  RealD provides 3-D glasses to theaters that use its three-
dimensional technology, collecting a fee from the film studios
whether each pair is new or recycled, said Rick Heineman, a
company spokesman. New eyewear costs more than glasses that are
reused after cleaning.  Recycled glasses represented 21 percent of domestic
shipments to theaters in the first quarter, down from 61 percent
a year earlier and 34 percent in the March-ended quarter,
Skarupa said on the call.  “Just to be clear, we’re not seeing any reduction in
consumer recycling at theaters,” Skarupa said.  The number of screens using RealD increased about 18
percent to 20,700 from 17,500 a year ago and by 500 from three
months ago, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
