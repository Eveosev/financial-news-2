Hulu LLC, the online television
business owned by Fox, ABC and NBC, said its $7.99-a-month
premium service is coming to Apple TV today, adding a new source
of subscribers for the company.  Customers can register by going to Hulu’s website or
through their Apple TV, a set-top box offered by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
according to a posting on the company’s  blog  today.  Hulu lets users watch programs from most of the major U.S.
broadcasters, as well as showing clips and movies. The Plus
version gives customers access to more episodes and other
features and works on a wider range of devices. It’s already
available on Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 3,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox
360, Roku Inc. devices and Nintendo Co.’s Wii. It also works
with mobile devices such as Apple’s iPad and iPhone, Amazon.com
Inc.’s Kindle Fire and phones running Google Inc.’s Android.  The closely held joint venture increased sales 60 percent
to $420 million last year and has more than 1.5 million paying
subscribers to Hulu Plus,  according to  Chief Executive Officer
 Jason Kilar . The service features popular programming such as
“Family Guy,” “ Modern Family ,” and “The Daily Show.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
