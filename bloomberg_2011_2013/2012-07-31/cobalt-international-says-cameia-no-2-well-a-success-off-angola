Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) ,
the offshore oil explorer backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
rose after it found oil at a second well off the coast of
 Angola .  The shares climbed 3.9 percent to $25.08 at the close in
 New York . Earlier the shares rose as much as 19 percent, the
most intraday since Feb. 10.  Tests showed oil at its Cameia No. 2 well at least 135
meters (443 feet) deeper than Cameia No. 1, Houston-based Cobalt
said in a statement today.  Cobalt is preparing for an additional test in August and
plans to evaluate data to determine the potential of the new
zone. The company has a 40 percent interest in the block. Other
partners are Sonangol EP, Nazaki Oil & Gaz SA and Alper Oil
Limitada.  “We have a lot of work yet to do before we fully
understand the magnitude of the Cameia discovery, but we believe
that we are off to a great start with two successful wells in
the field, and in our Angolan pre-salt exploration program,”
Joseph Bryant, Cobalt’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Cobalt today reported a net loss of $141 million, or 35
cents a share, during the second quarter, compared with a net
loss of $19 million during the same quarter of 2011. The loss
included a write-off of $99 million in expenses related to two
unsuccessful exploratory wells in the  Gulf of Mexico , the
company said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
