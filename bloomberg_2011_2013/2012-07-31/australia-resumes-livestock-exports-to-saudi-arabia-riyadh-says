Australia  will resume exports of
livestock to  Saudi Arabia  after a two-year halt, Riyadh
newspaper reported, citing Australian Ambassador Neil Hawkins.  The kingdom will receive the first shipment of Australian
animals, comprising 75,000 sheep and 6,000 cows, by next month,
the daily newspaper  said . Australia used to export a million
animals a year to Saudi Arabia, making up 60 percent of its
livestock imports, before importers stopped getting shipments
due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, Riyadh quoted
Hawkins as saying.  Australia wants to recapture its previous share of the
Saudi market, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
