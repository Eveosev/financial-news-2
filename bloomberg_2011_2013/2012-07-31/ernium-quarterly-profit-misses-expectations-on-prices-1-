Ternium SA, (TX)  Latin America’s second-
largest steelmaker, said it expects operating profit will be
curbed next quarter after second-quarter net income missed
expectations on lower prices. The stock tumbled.  Net income slid to $110.8 million, or 56 cents per American
depositary share, from $197.7 million, or $1.01, a year earlier,
Luxembourg-based Ternium, said late yesterday in a Marketwire
statement. The company was expected to post per-share profit,
excluding one-time items, of 63 cents, the average of five
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Ternium expects shipment levels to remain little changed in
the third quarter compared with the second quarter as global
economic turmoil affects steel market growth prospects.  “Declining prices in the region during recent months will
result in a lower average price in the third quarter 2012
compared to the second quarter 2012 and will consequently reduce
third quarter operating income,” Ternium said in the statement.  Ternium declined  4.9 percent to $18.59 at 10:54 a.m. in New
York, after earlier dropping as much as 5.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since July 23. The shares slid 32 percent in
the 12 months through yesterday’s close.  “We expect a slightly negative reaction by the market,”
Barclays Plc analysts led by Leonardo Correa in  Sao Paulo  said
in a report released yesterday. “Particularly considering the
weak earnings momentum into the 3Q12 and apparent lack of near-
term catalysts.”  Capex Reiterated  Ternium sales fell 8 percent to $2.2 billion in the period.
Revenue per ton shipped tumbled 7 percent to $989 a metric ton,
mainly as a result of lower prices, the company said.  “We maintain our $1 billion projection for capex in
2012,” Chief Financial Officer Pablo Brizzio said today on a
conference call, referring to Ternium’s annual spending budget.  Ternium’s investment in Brazilian steelmaker  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5)  contributed a loss of $6.7
million in the quarter.  The Techint Group, through its Ternium SA and  Tenaris SA (TEN) 
units, on Nov. 27 agreed to pay 5.03 billion reais ($2.46
billion) for a 27.7 percent voting stake in Usiminas, teaming up
with  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  to control Usiminas.  Usiminas, Brazil’s biggest maker of steel for the  auto
industry , said yesterday net sales climbed 6.6 percent to 3.23
billion reais in the second quarter, while steel sales volume
rose 19 percent to 1.89 million metric tons.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  is the biggest producer of steel in Latin
America. Gerdau, based in  Porto Alegre , Brazil, is scheduled to
report quarterly earnings before markets open tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
