Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) 
will pay the Democratic Republic of Congo $101.5 million for the
mining license at its Frontier site, purchased this year as part
of an acquisition of assets from  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)   ENRC, which bought First Quantum assets in Congo including
its share of the Kolwezi and Lonshi projects for $1.25 billion,
plans to begin annual output of as much as 92,000 metric tons of
copper concentrate at Frontier in 9 to 12 months, said Chief
Executive Officer Felix Vulis in a phone interview today.  “The historical maximum capacity of this plant was 92,000
tons of copper concentrate,” Vulis said. “It’s about that
amount we are keen to produce.” The company plans to refine the
concentrate from Frontier at its Chambishi smelter in Zambia,
about 70 kilometers (44 miles) away from the mine, he said.  The license will be issued in coming weeks, ENRC said.  “We see this as a positive step in allowing ENRC to
commence operations,” Jason Fairclough, a Bank of America Corp.
analyst, said in a note. “We estimate a Net Present Value for
this mine of $1.6 billion, which is not included in our base
case NPV.”  ENRC, a producer of ferroalloys,  iron ore , aluminum and
power in  Kazakhstan , also owns copper and cobalt producers
Central African Mining & Exploration Co. in Congo and Chambishi
Metals Plc in Zambia. It bought the license when it was released
by the prior owners in a deal with the Congo government, Vulis
said. “We are working with the DRC government only,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
