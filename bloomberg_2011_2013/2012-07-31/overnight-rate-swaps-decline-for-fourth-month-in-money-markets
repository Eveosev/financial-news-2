An estimate of future average
overnight borrowing costs in euros fell for the fourth month to
hold near a record, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap fell 17.6 basis points this
month to 5.5 at 8:48 a.m. in  London , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The measure has dropped 16 basis points since the
European Central Bank cut its deposit rate to zero on July 5.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending transactions, was set at
11.2 basis points yesterday from a record 11.1 the day before.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars declined.
The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks pay to
convert euro interest payments into the U.S. currency, was 42
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
from minus 45 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 45 basis points, or 0.45
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 46. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros, according
to the same panel of banks that contribute to Eonia.  Three-month Euribor fell to a record low 0.401 percent
yesterday from 0.415 on July 27.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  yesterday to 336 billion euros ($412
billion) from 337 billion euros on July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
