Yandex NV (YNDX) , owner of  Russia ’s most-
used search engine, said profit increased 76 percent in the
second quarter on higher ad revenue.  Net income reached 1.98 billion rubles ($62 million) from
1.13 billion rubles in the same period last year, Yandex said in
materials distributed to reports in Moscow today before the
results were released. That beat the average estimate of 1.82
billion rubles in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts. Revenue
rose 50 percent to 6.8 billion rubles, while earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 60
percent to 3.07 billion rubles, Yandex said.  Yandex’ share of Russian Internet searches averaged 60.5
percent over the past four weeks, according to Liveinternet, an
Internet service provider and researcher. That’s more than
double  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s 26.7 percent average, the data show.
Mail.ru Group Ltd. had a share of 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
