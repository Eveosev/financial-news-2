Australian wind- and solar-power
projects are forecast to produce some of the nation’s lowest-
cost electricity by the mid-2030s, according to the government’s
Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics.  “ Australia  will experience an energy transformation over
the coming decades that will have a profound impact for
electricity networks, how energy is distributed and on
Australia’s ability to meet its targeted greenhouse gas
emissions reductions,” Quentin Grafton, executive director of
the bureau, said today in a  statement .  The federal government, moving toward a target of
generating 20 percent of the country’s electricity from
renewable energy by the end of the decade, released the
Australian Energy Technology Assessment report today. The nation
introduced a price on  carbon emissions  earlier this month.  Australia burns coal to generate almost 80 percent of its
electricity. Gas-fired power stations will remain competitive
with lower-cost renewable energy technologies through 2050,
Energy Minister  Martin Ferguson ’s office said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
