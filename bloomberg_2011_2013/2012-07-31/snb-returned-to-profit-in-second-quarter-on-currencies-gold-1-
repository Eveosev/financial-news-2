The Swiss central bank returned to a
profit in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by
gains on its foreign-currency positions and gold holdings.  The profit of 8.2 billion francs ($8.4 billion) compares
with a loss of 12.7 billion francs in the year-earlier period,
the  Swiss National Bank  said in an e-mailed  statement  today.
Foreign currency positions contributed with a profit of 7.7
billion francs after a loss of 11.5 billion francs in the
previous year. The SNB earned 502.3 million francs on gold
holdings after a loss of 1.6 billion francs.  “The SNB result depends largely on developments in the
gold, foreign-exchange and capital markets,” the central bank
said. “Strong fluctuations are normal and only provisional
conclusions are possible as regards the annual result.”  The franc was little changed after the release and traded
at 1.2011 against the euro at 10:39 a.m. in Zurich. Against the
dollar, it was at 97.93 centimes.  The Zurich-based central bank has been forced to purchase
foreign currencies to defend its franc ceiling of 1.20 per euro
imposed in September to fight deflation threats and help
exporters. SNB President Thomas Jordan said on July 3 the
central bank is “ready to enforce the minimum  exchange rate 
with unlimited purchases of foreign currencies, if needed.”  Currency Holdings  The SNB earned 6.1 billion francs on foreign-exchange
valuations in the second quarter, according to calculations by
Bloomberg News. While the euro remained largely unchanged versus
the franc in the second quarter, the dollar appreciated 5.2
percent and the pound gained 3.1 percent.  The SNB’s foreign-exchange holdings increased to 365.1
billion francs at the end of the second quarter from 245.5
billion francs at the end of March. The central bank’s euro
holdings were at 219.5 billion francs at the end of June, up
from 124.1 billion francs. Dollar reserves rose to 79.4 billion
francs from 63.9 billion francs and yen holdings also rose.  Government bonds  in their own currencies accounted for 85
percent of the SNB’s assets at the end of the second quarter,
with equities at 10 percent, today’s report showed.  “The figures show that the SNB bought euros in the second
quarter to defend its ceiling,” said  Alexander Koch , an
economist at UniCredit Group in Munich. “At the same time, they
started to sell the euro versus other currencies to diversify
their balance sheet assets.”  For the first half of 2012, the SNB reported a profit of
6.5 billion francs after a loss of 10.8 billion francs a year
ago. Foreign currency positions added 5.1 billion francs after a
loss of 9.9 billion francs, with gold holdings contributing 1.3
billion francs after a loss of 1.6 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
