Azelis, the chemical distributor
owned by buyout firm  3i Group Plc (III) , agreed to form a partnership
with  Marubeni (8002)  Corp. to accelerate expansion in Asian markets.  The companies have identified “many complimentary
synergies” that will result from working together, Azelis and
Marubeni said today in a joint statement. The immediate focus
for the partnership is  China  as Japanese companies relocate
capacity to the country.  “Finding a reliable distribution partner who provides in-
depth market insights to define the winning approach to the
market has been a challenge for western specialty producers,”
Azelis Chief Executive Officer Joris Coppye said in the
statement. “Marubeni and Azelis aim to change that.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
