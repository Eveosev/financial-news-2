Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said he’s still debating with government advisers
whether to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.  The premier spoke in an interview with Channel 2 television
broadcast as U.S. Secretary of Defense  Leon Panetta  arrived in
Israel from Cairo to meet him, Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  and
other officials tomorrow.  “I haven’t decided yet whether to attack,” Netanyahu
said. “However, I see the commitment of this regime of
ayatollahs to develop nuclear bombs that are meant to destroy
us, and I won’t let that happen.”  Netanyahu said media reports that a decision on Iran has
been made are wrong and irresponsible. While describing the
process as one that involves conferring with a wide range of
advisers, the prime minister noted that Israel’s 1981 air raid
on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor was carried out over the
objections of the  Mossad  and military-intelligence agencies.  In Cairo, Panetta told reporters he’ll discuss the Iranian
nuclear threat with Israel’s leaders and review a “number of
options.” Iran says its uranium enrichment program will be used
only for peaceful purposes.  “It’s the wrong characterization to say we’ll be
discussing potential attack plans,” Panetta said. “What we’re
discussing are various contingencies and how we’ll respond.”  The discussions with Israeli leaders “are going to be more
on what is the threat that we’re confronting,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
