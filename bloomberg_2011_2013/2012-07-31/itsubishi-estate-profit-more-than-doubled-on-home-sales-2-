Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) ,  Japan ’s
biggest developer by market value, said first-quarter profit
more than doubled because of a recovery in apartment sales
following the March 11 earthquake last year.  Net income increased to 11.9 billion yen ($152 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from 4.46 billion yen a year
earlier, the company said today. Revenue dropped 7.5 percent to
196.9 billion yen as commercial developments declined.  Mitsubishi Estate and competitors are facing record high
vacancy rates in Tokyo, and supply of  office space  in the city
is expected to reach a nine-year high. Tokyo’s office vacancy
rate rose to 9.43 percent in June, according to Miki Shoji Co.,
while new supply will gain 42 percent this year, the highest
since 2003, according to a  survey  by Mori Trust Co., a Tokyo-
based developer.  Shares of Mitsubishi Estate fell 1 percent to 1,416 yen in
 Tokyo , trimming the year-to-date gain to 23 percent.  The developer sold 999 apartments in the three months ended
June 30, compared with 442 units sold in the same period last
year, according to the statement. Its residential business
returned to a profit of 297 million yen from a loss of 6.2
billion yen.  Operating profit, or sales minus operating costs, fell 3.2
percent to 28.5 billion yen in the company’s sales and office
leasing businesses, the company said today.  Commercial Property  Revenue from the company’s commercial property development
and investment division dropped to 2.6 billion yen in the
quarter from 47.7 billion yen for the same period a year
earlier.  Mitsubishi Estate’s office vacancy rate rose to 4.5 percent
in June from 3.6 percent in March, according to the company’s
website.  Mitsubishi Estate submitted a proposal to build two towers
in Otemachi to the Tokyo Metropolitan government on July 26,
said Ryuichiro Funo, a spokesman. The developer plans to start
the construction of a 31-story  office tower  and a 18-story
building that contains a hot-spring hotel in 2014, and the
projects are expected to be completed by 2016, according to
materials submitted to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
