Belorussian President Aleksandr
Lukashenko fired the border-guard and  air-force  chiefs after
Swedish pilots illegally flew a small airplane from  Lithuania  to
Belarus this month.  Major General Igor Rachkovskiy, chairman of the Border
Committee, and Major General Dmitry Pakhmelkin, Air Force and
Anti-Aircraft Force commander, were dismissed “for failing to
fulfill their duties in ensuring national security,” the
presidential press service said today in an e-mailed statement.  A group of Swedish citizens illegally flew a small plane
from Lithuania to Belarus on July 4, dropping teddy-bear toys
with signs calling for free speech over the capital, Minsk,
Lukashenko  told  a meeting of military and border-guard officials
last week. The pilots were able to return to a Lithuanian
airport without being intercepted and posted video footage of
their flight on the Internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
