Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest publicly traded bank by market value, fell 3.1 percent
in Lisbon trading after reporting a drop in first-half profit.  The stock declined 1.6 cents to 50 euro cents in the
Portuguese capital. Espirito Santo has fallen 39 percent  this
year , giving the lender a market value of 2 billion euros ($2.5
billion).  Espirito Santo, based in Lisbon, yesterday said first-half
 net income  fell 86 percent to 25.5 million euros after tax costs
increased. It paid 101.4 million euros in income tax in the
period.  Costs to consolidate an insurance unit also hurt earnings,
Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Caixa-Banco de Investimento SA
with a buy recommendation on the stock, said in a research note.  The  Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index 
dropped 1.8 percent. Shares of UBS AG paced the decline with a
5.9 percent slide after  Switzerland ’s biggest bank reported a 58
percent drop in second-quarter profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
