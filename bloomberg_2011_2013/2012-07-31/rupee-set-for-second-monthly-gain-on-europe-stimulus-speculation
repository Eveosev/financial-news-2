India’s rupee headed for a second
monthly gain after European policy makers signaled they will
take steps to contain the region’s debt crisis, spurring demand
for emerging-market assets.  The  Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank  meet this
week and will probably keep borrowing costs at 0.25 percent and
0.75 percent, respectively, according to Bloomberg surveys. The
 Reserve Bank  of India may hold its benchmark repurchase rate at
8 percent today, 31 of 34 analysts predict. Three expect a 25
basis point cut.  The rupee will track “a surge in high-yielding assets in
the next few sessions,” analysts at Edelweiss Financial
Advisors Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar, wrote in a
research report today. A rate reduction in India may spur a
rally in stocks, which will support the rupee, the note said.  India’s currency advanced 0.2 percent this month to 55.5450
per dollar as of 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It rose 0.1 percent today. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 11.20 percent today, having fallen 45
basis points, or 0.45 percentage point, this month.  India ’s inflation is a major challenge for monetary policy
even as economic expansion remains weak, the central bank said
yesterday. Foreign funds raised holdings of rupee-denominated
debt by $587 million this month through July 27, exchange data
show, as benchmark 10-year notes  yield  665 basis points more
than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.51 per
dollar, compared with 56.41 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.44 from 56.36. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
