Pennsylvania State University  lost
its first football player to another school since the program
was hit with sanctions that include a four-year bowl ban.  Tim Buckley, who was a redshirt freshman safety at Penn
State last season, transferred to  North Carolina  State. He
attended high school in Raleigh, North Carolina, where North
Carolina State is located.  “The opportunity to come here and play at my state
university, so close to home, was something that I couldn’t pass
up,” Buckley said in a  statement  released by North Carolina
State.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  on July 23 hit
Penn State with a $60 million fine, took away 20 scholarships
annually for four years and issued a postseason ban that matches
the longest in college football history after determining that
school officials tried to cover up child abuse by former
assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.  The NCAA also said it would allow any entering or returning
Penn State football player to transfer to another school and
play immediately.  Buckley, who didn’t mention the sanctions given to Penn
State, will be eligible to compete for North Carolina State in
2012 and will have four years to play. He finished Penn State’s
spring practice listed as a backup at free safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
