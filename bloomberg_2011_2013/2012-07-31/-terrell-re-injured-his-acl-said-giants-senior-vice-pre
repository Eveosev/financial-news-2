New York Giants cornerback  Terrell Thomas  sustained a right knee injury that involves the anterior
cruciate ligament he tore last season.  Thomas reinjured his knee during yesterday’s preseason
practice and underwent tests that showed he damaged his ACL.
Giants senior vice president of medical services Ronnie Barnes
said Thomas will “most likely” undergo an arthroscopic
procedure to determine the extent of the injury.  After leading the Giants in tackles and interceptions
during the 2009 and 2010 National Football League seasons,
Thomas missed the team’s run to a Super Bowl title last year
after tearing his ACL in an Aug. 22 preseason game.  A second-round pick in the 2008 draft, Thomas became a
full-time starter in 2009, when he had a team-high 85 tackles
and five interceptions. He led the team in the same categories
in 2010, recording 101 tackles and five interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
