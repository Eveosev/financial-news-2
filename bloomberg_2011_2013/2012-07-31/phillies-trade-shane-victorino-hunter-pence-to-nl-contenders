The  Philadelphia Phillies  traded
outfielders  Shane Victorino  to the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and
 Hunter Pence  to the  San Francisco Giants , cutting a combined
$19.9 million from the last-place team’s annual payroll.  The  Chicago Cubs  sent pitcher Ryan Dempster to the  Texas
Rangers  for two minor-league prospects as Major League
Baseball’s trade deadline passed yesterday.  Philadelphia’s moves bolstered the rosters of the Giants
and Dodgers, who hold the top two spots in the  National League
West , while signaling that the Phillies accept they won’t
contend for a sixth straight NL East title. The Phillies started
the season with a $174.5 million payroll, second in baseball to
the  New York Yankees ’ $198 million, according to USA Today.  Victorino, 31, who helped the Phillies win a World Series
in 2008, was traded to the Dodgers for relief pitcher Josh Lindblom, minor-league starter Ethan Martin and a player to be
chosen later or cash, both teams said in news releases.  A two-time All-Star center fielder, Victorino is batting
.261 this season with a .324 on-base percentage, nine home runs
and 40 runs batted in. His 24 stolen bases are tied for ninth in
the major leagues.  Having also played one year with the  San Diego Padres ,
Victorino has a .277 batting average with 88 homers, 394 RBIs
and 186 stolen bases in nine major-league seasons. He’s making
$9.5 million this season, according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts.  ‘All-Star Caliber’  “We’re excited to add an All-Star caliber player with
postseason experience,” Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti
said in a statement. “He plays the game with passion, gives us
a top-of-the-order bat from both sides of the plate, can steal
bases and is solid defensively in the outfield.”  Lindblom, a 25-year-old right-hander, was 2-2 with a 3.02
earned run average in 48 appearances for the Dodgers this
season, striking out 43 while walking 18. He is making $483,000
this season.  Martin, 23, was 8-6 with a 3.58 ERA for the Dodgers’
Double-A Chattanooga team this season, making 20 starts.  Pence, 29, a right fielder making $10.4 million this
season, and “cash considerations” were sent to the Giants for
outfielder Nate Schierholtz and two minor leaguers -- catcher
Tommy Joseph, 21, and right-handed pitcher Seth Rosin, 23, the
Phillies said in a news release.  After joining the Phillies from the  Houston Astros  at last
year’s trade deadline, Pence is batting .271 with 17 home runs
and 59 RBIs this season. The 29-year-old right fielder has had
to provide much of the power in the Phillies’ lineup with  Ryan Howard  and  Chase Utley  missing the first half of the season
because of injuries.  Pence played his first 4 1/2 seasons with the Astros. He’s
a career .290 hitter with 131 homers and 471 RBIs.  Schierholtz Stats  Schierholtz, a 28-year-old right fielder, is hitting .257
with five homers and 17 RBIs this season. He is making $1.3
million.  San Francisco, which won the World Series in 2010, is 55-47
this season, while Los Angeles is 56-48.  Philadelphia, 45-57, is 16 1/2 games behind the Washington
Nationals. The Phillies haven’t finished worse than third in the
division since 2000.  Dempster, who threw 33 consecutive scoreless innings before
the streak ended on July 20, was sent to the Rangers for minor-
leaguers Kyle Hendricks, a pitcher, and Christian Villanueva,
and infielder.  A two-time All-Star, the 35-year-old Dempster is 5-5 this
season with a 2.25 earned run average in 16 starts, striking out
83 while walking 27.  The  Boston Red Sox  traded outfielder Scott Podsednik and
pitcher Matt Albers to the Arizona Diamondbacks for left-handed
pitcher Craig Breslow.  Breslow’s Stats  Breslow, 31, is 2-0 with a 2.70 ERA in 40 relief
appearances this season. Albers, a 29-year-old right-hander, had
a 2-0 record and a 2.29 ERA in 40 appearances for Arizona this
season. Podsednik, 36, played in 19 games for Boston this
season, hitting .387 with a homer, three doubles and seven RBI.
He also spent 48 games in the minor leagues.  The Cincinnati Reds acquired reliever Jonathan Broxton from
the Kansas City Royals for minor-league pitchers Donnie Joseph
and J.C. Sulbaran. Broxton was 1-2 with a 23 saves and a 2.27
ERA in 35 appearances this season.  The Pittsburgh Pirates acquired first baseman Gaby Sanchez
and right-hander Kyle Kaminska from the  Miami Marlins  for
outfielder Gorkys Hernandez and a draft pick. Miami also sent
right-hander Edward Mujica to the St. Louis Cardinals for 23-
year-old third baseman Zack Cox, who has spent the season at
Triple-A Memphis.  Pittsburgh also sent infielder Casey McGehee to the Yankees
for reliever Chad Qualls.  McGehee, 29, was hitting .230 with eight homers and 35 RBI
in 92 games for Pittsburgh this season. Qualls went 2-1 with a
4.89 ERA in 43 appearances for the Yankees and Phillies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
