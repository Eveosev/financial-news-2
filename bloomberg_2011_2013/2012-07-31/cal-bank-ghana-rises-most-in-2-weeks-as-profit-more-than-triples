CAL Bank Ltd. (CAL) , a lender in Ghana,
rose the most in almost two weeks after saying first-half profit
more than tripled.  The shares rose 3.3 percent to 31 pesewas as of 1:08 p.m.
in the capital, Accra, the biggest gain since July 19.  Net income soared to 19 million cedis ($9.7 million) from
5.5 million cedis, the lender said in a statement published in
the Daily Graphic newspaper today.  “The stock received positive reaction from the earnings
announced today,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at  Ecobank (ETI) 
Development Corp., said by phone. “Our outlook on the shares is
an upside of between 10 and 15 percent by the end of this
year.”  Net interest income, the money banks make from loans,
increased 68 percent to 31.2 million cedis, Cal said in the
statement. Loans and advances to customers almost doubled to
560.3 million cedis from 292.6 million cedis a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
