Outfielder Shane Victorino was
traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers from the  Philadelphia
Phillies , who received relief pitcher Josh Lindblom and minor-
league starter Ethan Martin, Philly.com  reported .  The swap came on the final day before Major League
Baseball’s trade deadline. The Dodgers are 56-48 and tied with
the  San Francisco Giants  atop the National League West.
Philadelphia is 45-57, 16 1/2 games behind the Washington
Nationals in the NL East.  Victorino, 31, has played his last eight seasons in
Philadelphia, helping the team reach the playoffs the past five
and win a  World Series  in 2008.  A two-time All-Star, Victorino is batting .261 this season
with a .324 on-base percentage, nine home runs and 40 runs
batted in. His 24 stolen bases are tied for ninth in the major
leagues.  Having also played a season with the  San Diego Padres ,
Victorino has a career .277 batting average with 88 homers, 394
RBI and 186 stolen bases.  Lindblom, a 25-year-old right-hander, was 2-2 with a 3.02
earned run average in 48 appearances for the Dodgers this
season, striking out 43 while walking 18.  Martin, 23, was 8-6 with a 3.58 ERA for the Dodgers’
Double-A Chattanooga team this season, making 20 starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
