Finland ’s Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen comments on the preferred creditor status in the
European Stability Mechanism.  Katainen spoke in an interview in Helsinki today.  On the European Stability Mechanism:  “The decisions on the ESM have been taken in  Europe  and
they shouldn’t be problematic.”  “In Finland, the parliament has required that the clause
on preferential creditor status be in the introduction and not
in the articles. Because of Finland’s pari passu clauses, a
mention of preferential treatment of creditors in the articles
could cause problems on the debt markets.”  “Finland has had a clear stance; if the preferred creditor
status is dropped on a case by case basis, the parliament must
decide on this. In such a case, Finland will require
collateral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
