Iran  views $100 as a “fair” price
for crude oil, the state-run Mehr news agency  reported , citing
the OPEC-member nation’s oil minister.  Rostam Qasemi said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries no longer needs to hold an emergency meeting to
address declining prices, as crude sells now for more than $100
a barrel, according to the report today. Qasemi last month urged
the producer group to call such a meeting.  Brent crude  is
trading today at more than $105 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
