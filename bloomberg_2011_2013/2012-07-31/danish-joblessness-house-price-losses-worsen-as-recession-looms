Danish unemployment climbed to its
highest level in 17 months and  house prices  fell as the Nordic
country’s real estate slump shows few signs of abating amid a
deteriorating labor market.  Joblessness, including people in vocational training
programs, rose in June to a seasonally adjusted 6.3 percent, the
highest level since January 2011,  Statistics Denmark  said today.
House prices fell an annual 7.4 percent in May, the Copenhagen-
based agency said.  Property values have plunged 25 percent since peaking in
2007, and the government forecasts a 5.5 percent decline in
house prices this year, threatening to plunge the economy back
into a recession. Economic output, which contracted in the
second half of 2011, may have shrunk last quarter, according to
Danske Bank A/S, the country’s largest lender.  “Growth in the economy is so low,” Niels Roenholt, senior
economist at Jyske Bank A/S, said in a note. “With economic
weakness unfortunately continuing to emerge both at home and
abroad, you can be worried the consequences at some point will
be bigger for the labor market.”  Net joblessness rose in June to 4.6 percent, the statistics
agency said. The average house price fell to 1.71 million kroner
($281,852) in May, compared with 1.87 million kroner a year
earlier. Prices slipped 1.2 percent from a month earlier, the
statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
