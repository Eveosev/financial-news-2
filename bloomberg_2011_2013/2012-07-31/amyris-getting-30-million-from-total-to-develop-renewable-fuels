Amyris Inc. (AMRS) ,  the biotechnology
company 21 percent-owned by  Total SA (FP) , rose the most in two weeks
after the French  oil company  agreed to fund development of
renewable diesel and jet fuels.  Amyris, based in Emeryville, California, increased 9.3
percent to $3.87 at the close in New York, the most since July
17.  Total will provide $30 million this quarter and may
contribute more in mid-2013 and 2014, Amyris said today in a
statement. Total agreed to provide as much as $82 million over
three years, and the companies plan to form a joint venture to
market the biofuel products.  The deal expands on a research partnership the two
companies established in 2010, after Total invested in Amyris,
and reaffirms plans for the joint venture announced last year.
The gains trim the companyâ€™s loss this year to 66 percent and
give it a market value of $218 million.  Amyris uses genetically modified microorganisms to convert
plant-sourced sugars into farnesene, a hydrocarbon that can be
processed into fuels or specialty chemicals.  Chief Executive Officer John Melo said in February that
lower-value products with large markets, including fuels and
lubricants, would be commercialized with joint venture partners
Total and  Cosan SA Industria e Comercio. (CSAN3)  It said in May it would
scale back production to focus on farnesene-derived products
that have higher selling prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
