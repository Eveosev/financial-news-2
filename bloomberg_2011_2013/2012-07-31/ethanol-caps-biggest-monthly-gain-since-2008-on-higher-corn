Ethanol capped the biggest monthly
gain in more than four years in Chicago as higher corn prices
raised production costs and prompted companies to temper output.  Futures gained as corn, used to make the fuel in the U.S.,
reached records this month in Chicago. Ethanol also increased on
speculation an Energy Department report will show plants reduced
 production  a record seven consecutive weeks. Output is down 17
percent from 963,000 barrels a day Dec. 30.  “I assume we’ll get another sizable draw in stocks and the
hot weather will affect the production side,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 1.7 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.63 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since July 23. Prices gained 18 percent
this month, the most since June 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago rose 3 cents to
$2.57 a gallon and in  New York  the additive increased 2.5 cents
to $2.665, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 1.5 cents to $2.635 a gallon
and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 0.5 cent to $2.755.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1.1 percent to
settle at $8.0525 a bushel in  Chicago , after earlier touching
the all-time high for the contract of $8.205.  To contact the reporters on this story:
