CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the small-business
lender that exited bankruptcy two years ago, sold $3 billion of
bonds to pay back debt.  The company sold $1.75 billion of 4.25 percent, five-year
notes to yield 364 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $1.25 billion of 5 percent, 10-year bonds at a
relative yield of 350 basis points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to
refinance the company’s 7 percent so-called series C notes due
in 2016 and 2017, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified because the terms
are private.  Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Agricole SA managed the
sale for the New York-based company run by  John Thain , Bloomberg
data show.  CIT, which emerged from bankruptcy in December 2009, sold
$2 billion of bonds in May with proceeds also used to refinance
the series C notes. As part of the issue, the company sold $1.25
billion of 5 percent, five-year bonds, which traded at 104.5
cents on the dollar to yield 3.96 percent yesterday, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Standard & Poor’s  boosted the  firm’s rating  to BB- on March
9, three levels below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
