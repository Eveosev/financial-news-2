Philippine 20-year bonds declined,
paring their biggest monthly gain this year, on speculation
additional supply of long-term notes will push yields higher.
The peso advanced.  Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said yesterday the
government is considering selling 25-year securities to retail
investors and may offer notes of maturities from seven to 25
years in a debt swap this year. The yield on the bonds due 2032
slid 29 basis points this month as slowing inflation prompted
the central bank to cut its overnight borrowing rate for a third
time this year to a record low of 3.75 percent on July 26.  “News of the retail bonds and debt swap will put pressure
on long-end bonds,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-income trader
at East West Bank Corp. in  Manila . “There’s also a correction
as month-end profits are being booked. Generally, fundamentals
would support lower yields.”  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
5.74 percent in Manila, according to noon fixing prices from the
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. The notes returned 3.4
percent this month, the most since the debt was issued this year.  Philippine bonds have returned 15 percent in the past year,
a performance second only to  Indonesia  in  Asia ’s 10 biggest
economies excluding  Japan , HSBC Holdings Plc local-currency bond
indexes show.  Strengthening Peso  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 41.74 per dollar in Manila and
has strengthened 1 percent this month, according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. It has appreciated 5 percent in 2012, the biggest
gainer among Asia’s 11 most-active currencies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
6.25 percent and slipped five basis points this month.  Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in June from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in three months. Inflation will settle
within the lower half of the central bank’s 3 percent to 5
percent target range this year and in 2013, Governor Amando Tetangco said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
