U.S. author Jonah Lehrer resigned as
a staff reporter at New Yorker magazine after saying he faked
quotes from singer  Bob Dylan  in his latest nonfiction book, the
 Wall Street Journal  reported, citing a statement from Lehrer.  Lehrer said he lied to journalist Michael Moynihan after
being questioned on the authenticity of the quotes three weeks
ago, according to the newspaper.  His book “Imagine: How Creativity Works” is being pulled
from retailers  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  and Amazon.com Inc. after
Dylan’s management said it had no record of any contact with
Lehrer, the Journal reported.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
