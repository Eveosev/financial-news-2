Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s biggest Internet
search engine, fell the most in eight weeks in  New York  trading
after the company reiterated its annual outlook for the slowest
pace of revenue growth since 2010.  Yandex tumbled 6.8 percent to $19.42 at 2:33 p.m., headed
for the biggest slump since June 1. The retreat led declines on
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian
companies listed in the U.S. The measure sank 2 percent to
90.10.  The company reiterated its forecast for a 40 percent to 45
percent revenue growth in 2012, Alexander Shulgin, the chief
financial officer, said at a conference call with analysts and
investors today. Yandex said sales increased 60 percent last
year. Facebook Inc., the world’s largest social-networking
service, reported last week second-quarter earnings that showed
slowing growth.  “Some have expected Yandex would revise its 2012 revenue
growth forecast,” Iouli Matevossov, a senior analyst at  Alfa
Bank , said by phone from Moscow. Investors were expecting
“results would exceed analysts’ estimates. The sentiment on the
industry remains negative following disappointing Facebook
results,” he said.  Yandex said that second-quarter net income, before
adjustments to additional taxes, rose 76 percent to 1.98 billion
rubles ($61.5 million). Revenue expanded 50 percent in the first
half of the year from the same period a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
