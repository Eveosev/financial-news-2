Allison Schmitt of the U.S. won her
first gold medal, taking the 200-meter freestyle at the London
Olympics.  She won the event in an Olympic record of 1 minute, 53.61
seconds.  France ’s Camille Muffat got the silver, while
 Australia ’s Bronte Barratt took the bronze. Muffatt had beaten
Schmitt for the gold in the 400-meter freestyle.  Seventeen-year-old Missy Franklin, the U.S. high school
student who won her first gold medal yesterday in the 100-meter
backstroke only 13 minutes after she’d made the 200-meter
freestyle finals, finished in fourth place today. She led the
