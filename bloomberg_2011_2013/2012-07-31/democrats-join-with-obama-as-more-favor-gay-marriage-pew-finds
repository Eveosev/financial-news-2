Support for gay marriage has jumped
among Democrats in the last four years, according to a Pew
Research Center poll taken before the party moved to include the
issue in its convention platform.  The June 28-July 9  survey  found that 65 percent of
Democrats favor gay marriage, while 29 percent oppose such
unions. In 2008, 50 percent of Democrats backed gay marriage and
42 percent opposed it, Pew said on its website.  President  Barack Obama  is the most prominent Democrat to
have changed his stance in the last four years. In May, the
president said he believed that same-sex couples should be able
to get married; while running for president in 2008, he said
only that he supported civil unions.  The Pew center also found that independent support for gay
marriage has grown, with 51 percent in favor and 40 percent
opposed. Four years ago, independent voters were divided evenly
on the issue, Pew said.  While Republicans continue to oppose gay marriage 70
percent to 24 percent, the public as a whole has shifted in
favor as well, Pew said. In the latest poll, 48 percent of all
respondents backed gay marriage and 44 percent opposed it; in
2008, 51 percent opposed it and 39 percent favored such unions.  The Democratic Party yesterday took an initial step toward
endorsing gay marriage when party platform drafters recommended
including the provision. The platform committee will meet next
month to adopt a proposed statement of the partyâ€™s stands.  The Pew poll included 2,973 adults and has a margin of
error of 2.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
