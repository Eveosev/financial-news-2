Inter Pipeline Fund (IPL-U)  will spend C$2.1
billion ($2.1 billion) to expand its Cold Lake and Polaris
pipeline systems to handle increased production from Canadian
oil-sands projects jointly owned by  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and
ConocoPhillips.  The expansion includes about 840 kilometers (522 miles) of
new pipeline to reach the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and
Narrows Lake developments, Calgary-based Inter Pipeline said in
a statement today. The new lines to Christina Lake and Foster
Creek are expected to begin operating in mid-2014 and the
Narrows Lake facilities will begin in mid-2016.  The systems will increase the shipping capacity from the
projects by 1.25 million barrels a day and provide a diluting
agent to help allow the bitumen, a tar-like substance, to be
transported via pipeline. The two existing Polaris and Cold Lake
lines stretch north and east of Edmonton, Alberta.  Oil-sands production will increase 44 percent to 2.3
million barrels a day in 2015 from 1.6 million barrels last
year, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said on
June 5.  Cenovus, based in Calgary, operates the FCCL Partnership in
Alberta under a 50/50 joint-venture agreement with Houston-based
 ConocoPhillips. (COP)   (Inter Pipeline will hold a conference call on the
expansion at 1:30 p.m.  New York  time, accessible by dialing
