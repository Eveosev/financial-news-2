Banco Santander Chile (BSAN) , the country’s
second-largest lender by assets, dropped the most in five months
after reporting lower-than-expected profit for the second
quarter.  Santander retreated 3.9 percent to 35.05 pesos at 1:16 p.m.
in Santiago, the biggest decline since Feb. 2 on a closing
basis. It earlier slumped 5.4 percent.  The bank reported yesterday a 25 percent drop in quarterly
profit from a year earlier to 106 billion pesos, or $1.14 per
American depositary receipt. The average estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.30 per ADR.  “This decline was mainly due to the lower inflation rate
in the quarter that negatively affected net interest margins,”
Santander said in a statement yesterday.  Santander’s return on equity, a measurement of performance,
slipped in the quarter to 20.7 percent, from 30 percent a year
earlier, according to Banchile-Citi, the joint research
department of Citigroup Inc. and Banco de  Chile .  “The stock now trades at 3.4 times last reported book
value, a valuation level that we deem too demanding for a bank
whose return on equity is now very far from the high 20s it once
recorded, and seems to be settling in the low 20s,” analysts
Daniel Abut, Juan Carlos Arandia and Carlos Rivera wrote in the
report.  Chile’s annual rate of inflation has fallen in the past
four months to 2.7 percent in June, which is below the central
bank’s 3 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
