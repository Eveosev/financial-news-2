Italy’s drought is hampering
commercial shipping as low water levels in the Po, the country’s
largest river, force boats to remain moored to avoid collisions
and underwater obstacles, farm union Coldiretti said.  The water level has dropped 8.5 meters (27.9 feet) below
average at the monitoring station of Canonica d’Adda, about 25
kilometers (16 miles) east of Milan, the Rome-based group wrote
in an e-mailed statement today. The river is used for irrigation
in the Po Valley, the country’s main corn and rice-growing area.  The lakes of Como and Maggiora are also below average
levels, Coldiretti said.  “The exceptional dry has effectively paralyzed commercial
navigation,” Coldiretti wrote.  Water levels at Canonica d’Adda were at minus 8.48 meters
as of 10 a.m on July 29, according to  monitoring  by the
Interregional Agency for the Po River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
