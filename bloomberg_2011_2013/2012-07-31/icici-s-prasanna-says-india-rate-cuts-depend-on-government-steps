Prasanna Ananthasubramanian, chief
economist at Mumbai-based ICICI Securities Primary Dealership
Ltd., comments on the  Reserve Bank  of India’s decision to hold
 interest rates  for a second consecutive policy meeting.  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  kept the repurchase rate at 8
percent, the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement in Mumbai
today. The statutory liquidity ratio was reduced to 23 percent
from 24 percent, effective Aug. 11, the first cut since 2010.  “Inflation has become so sticky that they have no other
choice. In the early part of the year, it looked like prices
were coming down but that was not the case. Now you have monsoon
related issues and lot of prices haven’t been revised. So there
are suppressed prices, which can go up. Risks to inflation are
there and are clearly visible and a central bank cannot ignore
these.  ‘‘For the future, there is still scope and the governor has
left himself some flexibility to cut rates in the second half of
the fiscal. Obviously, it is conditional on steps being taken by
the government. So if we assume the government, over a period of
time, will do certain things, then we are looking at a 50 basis
point rate cut.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
