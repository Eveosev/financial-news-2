Vietnam ’s bonds gained, pushing the
five-year yield to the lowest level in three weeks, on
speculation banks have more funds to buy debt as an economic
slowdown saps demand for loans. The dong held steady.  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year notes fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.80 percent in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The  overnight interbank deposit rate  slid for the eighth day,
falling 36 basis points to 1.47 percent, data from lenders show.  “Bond yields dropped in line with declines in  interest
rates  in the  interbank market ,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh,  head
of fixed-income trading at Asia Commercial Bank in  Ho Chi Minh
City . Banks face difficulties in lending as slowing growth hurts
companies, according to Anh.  The economy grew 4.66 percent in the three months to June
from a year earlier, and Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh said
last month full-year expansion may fall below the government’s 6
percent target.  The dong traded at 20,868 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
