Iran  started a new unit for producing
gasoline at the Tondgoouyan refinery in Tehran, raising the
plant’s output of the fuel to 2.8 million liters (18,000
barrels) a day, the  Islamic Republic News Agency   reported .  The official report didn’t specify the refinery’s gasoline
output before the expansion or its production capacity.  The project includes a unit for processing light naphtha
and an isomerization unit, according to the official report
today. Naphtha is a product of oil-refining that can be used as
a feedstock in petrochemical plants. Tondgoouyan plans for the
expansion to improve the quality of gasoline it produces, by
increasing the fuel’s octane level, IRNA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
