Parts of an  Indiana  law allowing
warrantless arrests of immigrants are unconstitutional in light
of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on an  Arizona  measure,
Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said.  The Indiana law, passed last year, enables local police to
arrest people without a warrant based on immigration court or
U.S. Department of Homeland Security orders, or if officers have
probable cause to believe that the person has been charged with
a felony, Zoeller said today in a filing in federal court in
Indianapolis.  Similar language in Arizona’s immigration law was struck
down as unconstitutional by the nation’s highest court in June.
The  American Civil Liberties Union  sued last year to overturn
Indiana’s law. Given the Supreme Court ruling in the Arizona
case, Zoeller said he can no longer defend portions of the law.  “A warrantless arrest under those circumstances is
unconstitutional,” Zoeller said in today’s filing.
“Warrantless arrests under those circumstances and
justifications will not be defended.”  The case is Buquer v. City of Indianapolis, 11-708, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
