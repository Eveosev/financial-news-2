The Croatian  Finance Ministry 
published a  list  of tax debtors to help boost revenue and narrow
the  budget deficit  to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this
year from 5.5 percent in 2011.  The list, called the “Pillar of Shame” by  national radio ,
includes 102,000 corporate, entrepreneurial and individual
debtors owing taxes for longer than 90 days. They owe a combined
52 billion kuna ($8.5 billion) in taxes, ministry spokeswoman
Sanja Bach said by phone today in Zagreb, or almost half the
country’s estimated 118.8 billion kuna in budget spending for
this year.  Croatia , which is set to join the European Union in July
2013, is struggling to attract investors and revive the economy
after two years of recession and last year’s stagnation. The
Adriatic Sea nation’s seven-month-old government, led by Prime
Minister  Zoran Milanovic ’s Social Democrats, proposed 4 billion
kuna in cuts in January to narrow the deficit and bolster the
country’s credit rating.  “This debt didn’t accumulate overnight,” Nada Cavlovic
Smiljanec, the head of the  Tax Office , said in a  video link  on
the government’s website. “We are primarily talking here about
entrepreneurs and heads of companies who enjoyed good relations
with the previous government and were allowed to avoid tax
liabilities,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
