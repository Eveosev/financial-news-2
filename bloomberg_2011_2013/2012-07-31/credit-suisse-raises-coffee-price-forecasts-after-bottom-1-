Credit Suisse Group AG’s private
banking unit raised its price forecasts for arabica coffee
traded in  New York , saying prices have found a bottom.  Arabica coffee futures will be at $1.80 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in three and 12 months, the bank said in a report
e-mailed today. That compares with a previous forecast of $1.50
a pound. The beans climbed 1.3 percent so far this month on
speculation rains in  Brazil  would reduce crop quality.  “We think coffee prices have found a bottom after a long
correction and expect sideways trading going forward,”  Tobias Merath , head of commodity research at the bank, wrote in the
report. “Prices are now very close to fair value.”  The coffee market remains in a surplus and inventories are
rising, Merath said, without giving an estimate. Valuation,
technical indicators and fundamentals of coffee have recently
improved, according to the bank.  Cocoa prices are likely to keep trading between $2,000 and
$2,500 a metric ton in New York for “quite some time,” the
bank said. It forecasts prices at $2,250 a ton in three months
and $2,300 a ton in 12 months, according to the report. Prices
have climbed 1.9 percent this month to $2,335 a ton.  “Prices are testing the upper end of this range again, but
we see little impetus for a decisive break higher,” Merath
said. “The cocoa market is currently rated neutral on all
accounts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
