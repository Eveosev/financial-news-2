Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold $750 million of
3.5-year bonds in its second benchmark issue since regaining
investment-grade  ratings .  The second-largest U.S. automaker issued 2.5 percent notes
maturing January 2016 to yield 230 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The debt is expected to be rated Baa3, the
lowest level of investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
terms are private.  Ford issued $1.5 billion of 3 percent, five-year securities
last month in its first benchmark sale after being upgraded to
Baa3 by Moody’s on May 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The move, which followed Fitch Ratings’s elevation of
Ford from junk status on April 24, enabled the automaker to
regain control of its logo and other assets pledged as
collateral to obtain a $23.4 billion loan to keep the business
going in 2006.  The maker of the Mustang and Expedition last issued
benchmark three-year debt in May, selling $1.25 billion of 2.75
percent notes at 238 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds, which are rated Baa3 by Moody’s,
traded at 101.1 cents on the dollar to yield 2.35 percent
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada managed today’s sale for
the Dearborn, Michigan-based company, the person said. Ford
Motor Credit Co., its financing unit, issued the debt and
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
