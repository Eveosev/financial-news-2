South Africa ’s unemployment rate,
the highest of more than 60 nations tracked by Bloomberg, fell
to 24.9 percent in the second quarter, as the government, mines
and construction companies hired more workers.  The  jobless rate  fell from 25.2 percent in the previous
three months, Statistics South  Africa  said in a report released
today in  Pretoria , the capital. The number of people without
jobs declined by 56,000 to 4.47 million, while the number of
employed rose by 25,000 to 13.45 million.  “We are not out of the woods yet, but there is hope,”
Kefiloe Masiteng, the statistics agency’s deputy director-
general of social statistics, told reporters. “More work was
created in the formal sector, which is sustainable.”  The government has pledged to create 5 million jobs and
slash the  unemployment rate  to 14 percent by 2020. The National
Treasury expects Africa’s biggest  economy  to expand 2.7 percent
this year, less than half the 7 percent expansion that’s needed
to achieve that goal. South Africa’s unemployment rate compares
with 24.8 percent in  Spain  and 22.6 percent in  Greece .  “Any improvement in the employment statistics is
encouraging,” Adenaan Hardien, an economist at Cadiz Holdings
Ltd., said by telephone from Cape Town. “The improvement over
the quarter is still rather small. Much more needs to be
done on that score. Growth needs to be much higher.”  Manufacturing Jobs  The number of people employed in community and social
services, which includes state workers, rose by 121,000, while
mining added 21,000 jobs and construction 26,000, the statistics
agency said. Manufacturing shed 44,000 jobs, agriculture 18,000,
the trade industry 91,000 and the finance industry 4,000, it
said.  The central bank on July 19 lowered its benchmark  lending
rate  for the first time since 2010, reducing it by half a
percentage point to 5 percent to bolster growth, as  Europe ’s
debt crisis undermines demand for the nation’s exports.  “The manufacturing sector remains susceptible to renewed
weakness in the global economy, particularly in the euro area,
through possible declines in exports,” the Pretoria-based
central bank said on July 23 in its annual economic report.  The rand rose 0.2 percent to 8.1834 against the dollar as
of 12:17 p.m. in Johannesburg, curbing its decline this year to
4.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
