Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the world’s
largest cocoa growers, will get rains though Aug. 10 after 10
days of drier weather earlier this month, according to data from
the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Most of the coast of Ivory Coast and Ghana will get 20
millimeters (0.8 inch) to 40 millimeters of rainfall through to
Aug. 10, data on the NOAA  website  today showed. Central and
northern Ivory Coast will get 40 millimeters to 75 millimeters,
the data showed. In Ghana, rains of 75 millimeters to 125
millimeters are forecast for the western and northern regions.  The Ivorian town of San Pedro, where one of the main cocoa
exporting ports is located, had no rainfall from July 11 to 20,
with the long-term average at 32 millimeters, according to data
from the Ivorian National Meteorological Service. The commercial
capital Abidjan got 12.2 millimeters in the period, compared
with the long-term average of 36 millimeters. The central-
western Daloa region, the biggest growing area, got 37.2
millimeters, more than the long-term average of 33 millimeters.  “The erratic weather of the recent months after a
prolonged dry spell has served to provide cuts to next year’s
crop forecast,” Drew Geraghty, a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in
 Jersey City ,  New Jersey , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
“The true test will be as West Africa heads into its next rainy
season of August to October.”  Cocoa supply will lag demand by 93,000 metric tons in the
2012-13 season that starts in October, according to Rabobank
International. The development of an El Nino, a warming of the
water of the  Pacific Ocean , also threatens cocoa output.
Production fell by an average 2.4 percent in El Nino years, the
 International Cocoa Organization  in London estimates.  Cocoa for December delivery increased 0.1 percent to 1,594
pounds ($2,496) a ton by 2:23 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
