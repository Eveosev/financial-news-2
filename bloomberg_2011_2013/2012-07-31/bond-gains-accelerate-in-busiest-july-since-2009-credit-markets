Returns this month on corporate
bonds from the U.S. to  Europe  and Asia are exceeding those in
the entire second quarter and offerings are poised for the
busiest July in three years as investors show growing confidence
in company finances.  Gains of 2.23 percent in July on debt from the neediest to
the most creditworthy borrowers are the most since 2.38 percent
in January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. A
$7.5 billion offering from  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the world’s
largest brewer, led $277.8 billion of issuance since the end of
June as yields on investment-grade debt touched unprecedented
lows.  Borrowers from  Unilever NV (UNA)  to  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  are obtaining record-low  interest rates  even as
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast growth of 2.18 percent
this year following 2.93 percent in 2011. Investors are seeking
a haven in company debentures with a speculative-grade default
rate of 2.7 percent as of the second quarter compared with a
historic average of 4.8 percent since 1983, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  Corporates “have been the most reliable and dependable
asset class in terms of relative and absolute performance,”
 Jack Malvey , chief global markets strategist at Bank of  New York 
Mellon Corp., said yesterday in a telephone interview. Credit
markets are discounting “the outlook, which is not as dim as
would be presupposed by some of the headlines and the
fluctuations in the equities market,” he said.  Debt Refinancings  Borrowers are using the majority of proceeds from bond
issues to refinance debt, according to data from Moody’s. About
63 percent of investment-grade offerings and 73 percent of high-
yield issues and bank loans involved refinancing in the second
quarter, after excluding sales listed for general corporate
purposes.  “The corporate bond market right now is not particularly
worried about the nearness of a recession and, on the high yield
front, there is still a benign outlook for defaults,”  John Lonski , chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Group in New
York, said in a telephone interview.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. rose, with the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, adding
0.3 basis points to a mid-price of 106.6 basis points as of
11:09 a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Rate Swaps  The measure typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
 bond market  stress, rose from the lowest level in almost 14
months, increasing 0.3 basis point to 19.6 basis points as of
11:09 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when investors seek the
perceived safety of  government securities  and narrows when they
favor assets such as corporate bonds.  Bonds of Itau Unibanco Holding SA are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
with 118 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:17 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The company sold $1.375
billion of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes yesterday.  Forecast Cut  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 global growth
forecast as Europe’s debt crisis prolongs Spain’s recession and
slows expansions in  emerging markets  from  China  to  India . Growth
worldwide will be 3.9 percent next year, less than the 4.1
percent estimate in April, the fund predicted on July 16 in an
update of its World Economic Outlook.  Corporate bond returns worldwide this month of 2.23 percent
on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index, following 1.54
percent in April through June, are accelerating as investors see
the debt as an alternative to traditional havens. Government
securities returned 1 percent in July.  The ratio of cash to total assets for companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index stands at about 9.9 percent, down
from a recent peak of 10.2 percent in September, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Five years ago, the ratio was 5.7 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  met with U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  in  Frankfurt  yesterday after
leaders in Berlin, Paris and Rome backed him by saying they will
do what’s needed to protect the 17-nation euro.  Bank Bonds  The  Federal Reserve  will start a two-day meeting today. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the Senate Banking Committee in
Washington on July 17 that Europe’s financial woes are creating
“spillover effects” in the rest of the world.  Industrial bonds are headed for their best month in three
years, gaining 2.5 percent following 0.04 percent in June, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The debt returned 3.3
percent in July 2009.  Bank bonds have returned 1.82 percent this month, following
0.86 percent in June, index data show. That brings gains for the
year to 8.39 percent, poised for the best year since a 13.8
percent rise in 2009.  Investment-grade bonds have returned 2.31 percent this
month, beating high-yield’s 1.82 percent, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. In June, investment grade’s 0.28
percent return trailed junk’s 2.06 percent.  Corporate bond offerings worldwide this month of $277.8
billion compare with $264.3 billion in June and $222.1 billion
in July 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
reached $286.4 billion in July 2009.  Anheuser-Busch  In the U.S., sales of $94.4 billion mark the busiest July
on record. Offerings in Europe of 14.4 billion euros ($17.7
billion) are headed for the busiest July since 2001, when 22.3
billion euro was raised, Bloomberg data show.  The offering from Leuven, Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch will
help finance its $20.1 billion acquisition of a remaining 50
percent stake in Grupo Modelo SAB de CV. The offering from the
maker of Budweiser and  Stella Artois  was the largest since
United Technologies Corp. sold $9.8 billion of bonds in a six-
part offering in May, Bloomberg data show.  Investment-grade corporate yields fell to an unprecedented
3.007 percent on July 20 on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Corporate index, before climbing to 3.014
percent as of yesterday.  Companies received record-low coupons for three-, five-,
10- and 30-year dollar-denominated bonds this month, Bloomberg
data show.  Spreads Tighten  Unilever, the world’s second-largest consumer-products
company, sold $450 million of three-year notes and Dallas-based
chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc. issued $750 million due in
2015, both at a record-low 0.45 percent for the maturity.
London-based Unilever also issued $550 million of five-year debt
at 0.85 percent.  IBM, the world’s largest computer-services provider, sold
$1 billion of 10-year securities on July 25 at 1.875 percent,
Bloomberg data show. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. issued $500
million of 30-year debentures the next day at 3.25 percent.  Borrowers drawn to low rates “is exactly what policy
makers want to achieve,” Malvey said. “They want to have
issuers in all parts of the world, including financial services,
to extend the maturity of their liability streams so they’re not
as dependent on overnight financing.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold corporate bonds of
all ratings globally has decreased 18 basis points this month to
280 basis points, the lowest since May 8, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  index  data show. Spreads have tightened from 351
at year-end.  “Not every pocket is as weak as suggested by Europe,”
Malvey said. “Corporate market investors seem relatively
content about the credit quality of portfolios and the outlook
for decent performance moving forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
