Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s biggest
electricity supplier, awarded two contracts for geological
surveys in the German  Baltic Sea  as it prepares to build the
400-megawatt Wikinger wind farm.  Iberdrola’s ScottishPower Renewables unit gave contracts
valued at a total 18 million euros ($22 million) to Britain’s
Gardline Group and the Danish Geotechnical Institute, it said
today in a  statement . They’ll drill for rock samples and conduct
seismic surveys to determine what foundations are required for
the farm’s 80 turbines, it said.  “The start of sub-surface drilling is a crucial stage of
the project, enabling construction of one of the largest
deepwater offshore wind farms in the world,” said  Keith Anderson , chief executive officer of ScottishPower Renewables.  Germany is boosting investment in clean energy after
announcing the phase-out of nuclear power last year. The country
plans to build offshore wind farms covering an area six times
the size of  New York  City, raising the share of renewable-energy
output to at least 35 percent of total production by the end of
the decade from about 20 percent now.  Iberdrola has earmarked 1.6 billion euros for the Wikinger
project, which is scheduled to start operating in 2016 and will
eventually produce enough power to supply 350,000 German
households a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
