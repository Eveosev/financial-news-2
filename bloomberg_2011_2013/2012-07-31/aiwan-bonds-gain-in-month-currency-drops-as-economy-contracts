Taiwan’s 10-year bonds rose this
month and the currency weakened as official data showed the
economy unexpectedly declined in the second quarter.  Gross domestic product fell 0.16 percent from a year
earlier in the three months through June, after increasing 0.39
percent in the previous quarter, the statistics bureau said
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13
economists was for a 0.5 percent expansion.  “The really bad GDP numbers are affecting the  bond market 
today,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “Slowing global growth and the  European debt crisis 
is hurting the earnings outlook of Taiwan’s exporters; that’s
providing a bullish environment for bonds as well.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this month to 1.176
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate was
little changed today. The  benchmark 10-year rate  has dropped six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, in July, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Taiwan dollar  slid 0.4 percent to NT$30.010 against its
U.S. counterpart from a month ago, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. The currency gained 0.2 percent today. It touched NT$30.24
on July 26, the weakest level since Jan. 9.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 30 basis points for the month
to 3.60 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  fell 12 basis points to
0.39 percent, the biggest monthly decline since January 2009,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
