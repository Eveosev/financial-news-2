Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  has reached
licensing deals with the four major U.S. record companies for a
music service that lets users store songs remotely and play them
online, competing with Apple Inc.’s iTunes.  Songs from Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp.’s
music business, EMI Group Ltd. and billionaire Len Blavatnik’s
Warner Music Group are now available through the Amazon Cloud
Player, the Seattle-based online retailer said today in a
statement.  With the agreements, Amazon’s music service will work
similarly to Apple iTunes, letting multiple devices access a
centrally stored music collection. Amazon, whose Kindle Fire
tablet computer sells for $199 -- half the price of Apple’s
least expensive  iPad  -- is seeking to make money by offering
higher-margin digital content on the device, such as books,
music and movies.  Amazon said its cloud music users will be able to access
songs on a Kindle Fire, devices running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
operating system, and Apple’s iPhones. The songs, also
accessible through an Internet browser, will soon be available
via Roku Inc.’s streaming service or Sonos Inc.’s home
entertainment systems, Amazon said.  Consumers can scan all the songs on their hard drive --
those from iTunes, Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Media Player and
compact discs -- and play them in Amazon’s Cloud Player.  Amazon will offer a free version of the service that lets
users import as many as 250 songs, as well as a premium version
for $24.99 a year that will allow storage of 250,000 songs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
