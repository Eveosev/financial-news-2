European Union rapeseed production
will be higher than previously forecast after expectations were
raised for  Germany  and amid favorable harvest results in  France ,
industry researcher Oil World said.  The EU rapeseed crop is expected to be 19 million metric
tons, 800,000 tons more than a previous forecast and down from
19.2 million tons harvested in 2011, the Hamburg-based
researcher wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Rapeseed futures in Paris have climbed 17 percent in the
past 12 months in the wake of higher prices for soybeans, which
have jumped 22 percent in  Chicago  in the same period on concern
a U.S. drought will hurt production.  “Rapeseed prices in Europe were recently torn between the
bullishness emanating from the soybean complex and the supply
and demand fundamentals of the rapeseed complex,” Oil World
wrote. “In general, the crop outlook has brightened in Western
and Eastern  Europe .”  German farmers are expected to harvest 4.9 million to 5
million tons of rapeseed, with about 20 percent to 25 percent of
the area harvested, Oil World wrote.  “The crop benefited from ample rainfall in May and June,
which raised the kernel size and weight,” the researcher said.
“The recent change toward warmer and drier weather is promoting
the maturation and speeds up the harvest progress.”  The rapeseed harvest in France may be 5.4 million to 5.5
million tons from 5.37 million tons last year, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
