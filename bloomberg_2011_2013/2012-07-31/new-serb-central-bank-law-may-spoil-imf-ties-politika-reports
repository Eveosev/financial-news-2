Ties between  Serbia  and the
 International Monetary Fund  may be damaged by the Balkan
country’s new central bank law and other steps that affect the
National Bank of Serbia’s independence, Politika reported.  The IMF is “very concerned” about possible changes to the
law and they could reflect on Serbia’s program with the
institution, Politika said, citing the IMF’s resident
representative Bogdan Lissovolik.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, sworn in on July 27,
said it will replace Governor Dejan Soskic if he resists
government efforts to stimulate growth through expansive fiscal
policies. Soskic vowed on July 16 not to resign. Weekly magazine
NIN wrote on July 25 that the government will seek to amend the
central bank law within a week or two to remove Soskic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
