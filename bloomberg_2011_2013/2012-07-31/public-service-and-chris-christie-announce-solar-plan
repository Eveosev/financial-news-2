Public Service Enterprise Group
Inc. (PEG) ’s  New Jersey  utility proposed investing as much as $883
million to raise the state’s solar-power capacity by 32 percent.  The spending, subject to approval by the New Jersey Board
of Public Utilities, would fund solar projects capable of
generating 233 megawatts, Governor Chris Christie and company
chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ralph Izzo said today in a
statement.  New Jersey has the most solar-power generating capacity
after California, according to the Solar Energy Industries
Association in Washington. The state has 730.3 megawatts of
solar-power capacity, according to the association.  Legislation signed by Christie July 23 will require New
Jersey utilities including Public Service Electric & Gas to get
2.05 percent of their electricity from solar projects in 2014,
up from less than 0.5 percent now. The solar mandate will rise
to 4.1 percent by 2028.  Public Service, based in  Newark , New Jersey, proposes to
expand its loan program to companies or individual customers
building solar generators on landfills, idle industrial sites,
warehouse roofs and parking lots, the company said in the
statement. A megawatt can power 800 average U.S. homes,
according to the U.S. Energy Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
