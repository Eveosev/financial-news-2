Turkish banks’  capital ratios  may
drop by an average of about 1 percent because of the country’s
switch to Basel II today,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Turkish banks are generally well capitalized, which is
positive for the lenders’ ratings, Fitch said in a statement
today. Tight regulatory oversight will help prevent a rapid
buildup of industry leverage, it said.  Turkey ’s banking industry reported a total capital adequacy
ratio of 16.2 percent at the end of May 2012.  Turkiye Is Bankasi
AS (ISATR) , the country’s largest bank by assets, had a capital ratio of
13.9 percent at the end of March, down from 14.1 percent in
December, statements filed to the stock exchange on May 11
showed. Turkey’s economy grew 8.5 percent last year as a surge
in loan growth of as much as 40 percent annually allowed
consumers to buy more items such as cars and home appliances.  “Retail portfolios are large in Turkey,” Fitch said.
“High capital charges will dampen a surge in consumer borrowing
and this will be credit positive for the banks.”  The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency was “tough
in its application‘‘ of  Basel II , Fitch said. Under its rules,
foreign-currency-denominated Turkish sovereign bonds attract a
100 percent risk weight, compared with a previous risk weight of
zero percent, it said.  ‘‘Turkish banks are large investors in sovereign bonds, so
capital ratios will suffer,’’ Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
