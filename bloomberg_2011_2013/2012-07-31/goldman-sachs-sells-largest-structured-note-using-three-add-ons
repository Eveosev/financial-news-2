Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold $101.6
million of structured notes tied to the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX) , its largest offering this year, after increasing the size
three times to satisfy demand.  The five-year securities, $70 million of which were issued
July 9, yield 1.5 times the gains of the index, with investors
risking principal if the S&P 500 falls more than 50 percent,
according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank sold $16.2 million
more notes on July 12, $10.1 million additional ones on July 18,
and $5.31 million more on July 24, according to the SEC filings.  For the most recent issuance, the bank estimated the value
of the securities at $960 per $1,000, down from $976 on July 9.
Between July 9 and 24, the  S&P 500  fell 1 percent to 1,338.3.
The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
is known,  climbed  14 percent to 20.47 during the same period.  Such notes are “very sensitive” to changes in the
volatility of the linked index, said Guus Oonincx, founder of
G.O. Capital Markets Consulting Services LLC and a former
managing director at ING Financial Group. “That is often the
culprit for these pricing differences.”  The price of credit default swaps on Goldman Sachs, which
can be used to hedge against losses on the company’s debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, also climbed by about 30 basis
points to 302.7 basis points during the two weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher credit risk reduces the value
of structured notes, which are securities created by banks that
package debt with derivatives.  Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the note.  The bank distributed the latest securities for a 0.3
percent fee, compared with 0.35 percent for the other three
sales, according to the SEC filings.  Goldman Sachs’s second-largest offering, on March 27, was
$100 million of one-year notes linked to the Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
