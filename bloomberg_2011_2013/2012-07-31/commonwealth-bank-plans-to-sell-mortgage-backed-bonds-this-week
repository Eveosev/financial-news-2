Commonwealth Bank of Australia  is
marketing A$750 million ($790 million) of residential mortgage-
backed securities, in the first sale of such bonds by the
nation’s biggest lender in more than a year.  The offering will be completed by Aug. 3 and includes A$690
million of notes that may yield 140 basis points to 145 basis
points more than the one-month bank bill swap rate, Steve Batten, a Sydney-based spokesman, said by e-mail today,
confirming details given to Bloomberg by a person familiar with
the matter.  Standard & Poor’s  gave the securities a preliminary
rating of AAA, according to an e-mailed report.  Sydney-based Commonwealth Bank is selling its first RMBS
since April 2011, when it returned to the market after a four
year absence, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
lender has raised the equivalent of 9.8 billion euros ($12
billion) this year from covered bonds, a different type of debt
that’s also backed by home loans, after the government passed
legislation in October allowing the sale of such notes.  The main class of notes in Commonwealth Bank’s sale last
year were priced to yield 95 basis points more than BBSW,
Bloomberg data show. Bank of Western  Australia  Ltd., a unit of
Commonwealth Bank, sold A$500 million of RMBS in October 2011,
the data show.  Commonwealth Bank is the lead arranger for this week’s sale
and Macquarie Group Ltd.’s banking unit is a co-manager, Batten
confirmed. The lender is also inviting inquiries from investors
regarding A$45 million of AA- rated bonds, and A$15 million of
unrated debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
