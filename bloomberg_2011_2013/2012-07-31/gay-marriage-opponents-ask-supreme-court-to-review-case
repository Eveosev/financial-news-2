Proponents of California’s
Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state,
asked the U.S.  Supreme Court  to review a lower court ruling that
found the voter-approved measure unconstitutional.  The petition, which was expected, was filed today in
 Washington , backers of the 2008 proposition said in an e-mail.
The Supreme Court’s next session begins Oct. 1.  A federal appeals court in  San Francisco  ruled 2-1 in
February that voters couldn’t deprive gay couples of the right
to marry. The court upheld a federal judge’s 2010 ruling
striking down Proposition 8, which amended California’s
constitution to say marriage is only between a man and a woman.  A majority of judges on the federal appeals court refused
in June to rehear the case, paving the way for today’s petition
to the Supreme Court to review the lawsuit. Proposition 8 was
approved by 52 percent of California voters in 2008, outlawing
gay weddings, which had been legalized by the California Supreme
Court earlier that year. The measure remains in effect by court
order.  The case is Perry v. Brown, 10-16696,  U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
