Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , a water and
wastewater service provider, reported record earnings for the
second quarter, buoyed by an 11 percent increase in revenue to
$198.2 million from a year earlier and an acquisition in Ohio.  Profit for the quarter rose 10 percent to $41.4 million
compared with a year ago, the  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania-based
company said yesterday in a website statement. Aqua America
serves almost 3 million residents in 10 U.S. states from
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio to Texas and Florida.  Aqua America completed the purchase of American Water Works
Co.’s regulated operations in Ohio in May to become the largest
investor-owned water utility in the state and sold its  New York 
operations to American Water.  In the first six months of 2012, Aqua America said it
invested $171 million in infrastructure improvements as part of
a capital upgrades program compared with $141 million in the
same period of 2011. Its shares have risen 21 percent this year.  “The company remains on track to invest more than $300
million in 2012. Our  capital expenditures  are focused on pipe
replacement projects to improve our distribution network and
plant upgrades to enhance water quality,” Aqua America Chairman
and CEO Nicholas DeBenedictis said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
