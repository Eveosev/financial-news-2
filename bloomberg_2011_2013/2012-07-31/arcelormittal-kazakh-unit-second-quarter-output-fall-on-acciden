ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit said
second-quarter production was “worse than expected” after an
accident at a sintering plant in May.  Rolled-steel output fell 15 percent to 712,900 metric tons
from 839,700 tons a year earlier, the AO ArcelorMittal Temirtau
unit, said today in an e-mailed statement. That was less than
the 715,600 tons produced in the first quarter.  The company cut liquid-steel output 21 percent to 769,200
tons in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to the
statement. The company produced 811,800 tons in the first three
months of the year.  “The second quarter results were worse than we expected,”
Vijay Mahadevan, general director at ArcelorMittal Temirtau,
said in the statement. “Production was restricted by the
accident at the sintering plant in May, as well as unstable
operations of a number of the metal company’s units.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
