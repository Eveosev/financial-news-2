Best-selling Irish novelist Maeve Binchy died at age 72 after a short illness, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Binchy, who sold more than 40 million books, published her
last novel and received a lifetime achievement award from the
Irish Book Awards in 2010, the newspaper said.  Her books, which often had a humorous take on small-town
life in Ireland, included “Circle of Friends” and “Tara
Road” which were both adapted as feature films, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
