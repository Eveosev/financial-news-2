The Australian dollar touched the
highest level in more than four months against its U.S.
counterpart amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  and  European
Central Bank  may undertake further monetary stimulus.  The currency also gained after a report showed  Australia ’s
building approvals decreased by less than economists expected.
New Zealand’s dollar reached the strongest in almost three
months against the greenback. The South Pacific currencies pared
gains as risk appetite ebbed and global stocks fell.  Australia’s dollar rose to $1.0538, the highest since March
27, before trading little changed at $1.0503 yesterday in  New
York . It traded at 82.06 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, reached 81.22
U.S. cents, the most since May 2, before trading little changed
at 80.87 cents. It slipped 0.1 percent to 63.17 yen.  The Aussie climbed 2.6 percent in July against the
greenback, beating all of its 16 most-traded peers. The kiwi
gained 0.9 percent.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments in Australia declined 2.5 percent in June after
rising a revised 27 percent in the previous period, the Bureau
of Statistics said yesterday. The result compares with the
median forecast of a 15 percent drop in a Bloomberg News survey.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index climbed 1.2 percent, while the
MSCI World Index of stocks rose as much as 0.2 percent before
falling 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1
percent and fell 0.4 percent.  The Fed, which ends a policy meeting today, delayed
introducing a third round of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing at its June session. Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  indicated later it’s still an option. The central bank
bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds from 2008 to
2011 to spur growth.  The ECB meets tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
