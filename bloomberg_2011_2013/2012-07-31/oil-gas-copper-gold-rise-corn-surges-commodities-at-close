The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.2 percent to 643.64 at 4:56 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was
little changed at 1568.839.  CRUDE OIL  Oil in  New York  headed for the first monthly increase since
April before meetings of central bank policy makers to discuss
the economy and a report tomorrow that may show U.S. crude
stockpiles declined.  Crude for September delivery was at $89.62 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , down 16
cents, or 0.2 percent, at 8:47 a.m. London time. The contract
yesterday slid 0.4 percent to $89.78, the lowest close since
July 26. Prices have climbed 5.5 percent this month and have
dropped 9.3 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rose from a seven-month high in New York after
forecasters said the weather will be hotter than normal, which
may boost demand from  power plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for August remained unchanged at $860 a ton,
according to PVM. Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures, or crack spread, rose 0.3 percent to $60.04 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha fell 17 cents to $23.55 a
barrel yesterday from $23.72, the highest in nine months, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. A narrowing reforming margin means
it is less profitable to make motor fuel.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude increased
19 cents to $17.96 a barrel, according to PVM. The crack spread
was the widest since July 23.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold headed for a second monthly gain, the best run since
November, on speculation that central banks around the world may
take additional measures to spur growth, boosting demand for
bullion as a store of value.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,621.75 an ounce at 2:15
p.m. in  Singapore , after reaching a six-week high of $1,629.35
on July 27. Bullion is 1.5 percent higher this month following a
2.4 percent advance in June, and is up 3.7 percent this year.  Spot silver added as much as 0.4 percent to $28.295 an
ounce, up for a fifth day in the best run since January. The
price was at $28.1650, set for the first monthly gain in five.  Cash platinum rose as much as 0.5 percent to $1,423.75 an
ounce, gaining for a fifth day in the best run since October.
The metal, poised for monthly decline, traded at $1,421.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced, trimming a monthly decline, as  China 
increased its railway spending plan for the second time in a
month, boosting demand prospects.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.6 percent to $7,590 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $7,566.50
by 4 p.m. in  Tokyo . The metal is still down 1.5 percent this
month. The September-delivery contract advanced 0.4 percent to
$3.43 a pound on the Comex.  Copper for November delivery added 0.4 percent to close at
55,050  yuan  a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn surged to a record for a second day and headed for its
best month in more than two decades as crop conditions
deteriorated for an eighth week amid the worst U.S. drought in
half a century.  The December contract added 0.5 percent to $8.18 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading at $8.175. Futures
rallied 29 percent this month, the most since June 1988. Wheat
for September dropped 0.3 percent to $9.12 a bushel, paring the
monthly gain to 20 percent, the most in two years.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.2 percent to $16.405
a bushel, trimming the monthly advance to 15 percent.  Rubber declined for a fifth month amid concerns that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will be prolonged, weakening demand for the
commodity used for tires and gloves.  January-delivery rubber fell as much as 1.8 percent to
228.3 yen a kilogram ($2,960 a metric ton) before settling at
229.8 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active
contract lost 4.3 percent this month.  Palm oil futures declined, widening a third monthly drop,
as an industry estimate showed that exports from second-largest
producer  Malaysia  fell in July, signaling a switch to shipments
from  Indonesia .  The October-delivery contract lost as much as 1.9 percent
to 2,948 ringgit ($942) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 2,960 ringgit at 4:23 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .
