Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the
Israeli developer of a technology used to manage traffic on
networks, sank the most in a month in  New York  after the company
said some transactions are being delayed.  Shares of the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based company dropped
6.7 percent to $23.02 as of 11:47 a.m. in New York, headed for
the biggest slump since June 21. Its Tel Aviv shares rose 2.7
percent to 103 shekels, or the equivalent of $25.84.  The process to close deals “is taking longer, more related
to pricing development and actual needs,” Allot’s Chief
Executive Officer Rami Hadar, said in the earnings call with
analysts today. “Maybe service providers are a little bit more
cautious and anxious to optimize capex spending.”  The Israeli company reported that second-quarter sales
jumped 43 percent to $26 million, beating the $25 million mean
estimate of 11 analysts. The company also announced the
acquisition of Oversi Networks Ltd. for $16 million in cash.  Allot had gained 62 percent this year before reporting
earnings, the second-best performing stock on the  Bloomberg
Israel-U.S. equity index . The company trades at 38.1 times
estimated earnings, compared with the average multiple of 16 for
peers on the  Nasdaq Composite Index. (CCMP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
