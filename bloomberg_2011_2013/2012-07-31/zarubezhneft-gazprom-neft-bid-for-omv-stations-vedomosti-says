Russian oil producers  OAO
Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT)  and OAO Gazprom Neft have reached the second stage
of bidding to buy filling stations in  Croatia  and Bosnia-
Herzegovina from Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) ,  Vedomosti  reported, citing
representatives of the companies.  The results of the tender are expected on Aug. 20, the
newspaper said.  OMV, central  Europe ’s biggest oil company, said last
December that it’s selling subsidiaries in Croatia and Bosnia as
it focuses on exploration and production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
