Capcom Co. (9697) , a Japanese video-game
maker, rose the most in eight weeks in Tokyo trading after
reporting first-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates.  The maker of the Monster Hunter Card Muster social-network
game  jumped  6.3 percent, the biggest gain since June 5, to 1,595
yen as of 9:59 a.m. Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, more than tripled to 2.7
billion yen in the three months ended June 30, Capcom said after
the market’s close yesterday. That compares with the 1.8 billion
yen average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Domestic social-network services games’ “strong
contribution was the biggest reason for the good results,”
Nanako Imazu and Christian Dinwoodie, analysts at CLSA Asia-
Pacific Markets in Tokyo, wrote in a note yesterday. They
maintained a buy  rating  on shares of the Osaka-based company and
have a 12-month price estimate of 1,900 yen.  Earnings at Capcom and  rivals  including  Namco Bandai
Holdings Inc. (7832)  are getting a boost from the popularity of games
on Japanese online social networks operated by Gree Inc., DeNa
Co. and Mixi Inc. Shares of Namco Bandai rose to the highest in
three months today after the Nikkei newspaper reported a gain in
operating profit that beat some analyst estimates.  Operating profit  probably rose to 15 billion yen in the
three months ended June 30, after Namco Bandai increased the
number of social games, the Nikkei reported, without saying
where it got the information. That compares with profit of 6.3
billion yen reported a year earlier, and the 8.9 billion yen
average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Namco Bandai climbed 1.5 percent to 1,110 yen as of 9:59
a.m. on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange. The stock earlier rose as much
as 4.3 percent to 1,141 yen, the highest level since April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
