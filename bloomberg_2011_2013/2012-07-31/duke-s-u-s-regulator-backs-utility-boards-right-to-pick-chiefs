Jon Wellinghoff, chairman of the
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , said a utility’s board has
the right to decide who runs the company while declining to
discuss the ouster of  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s chief last month.  Wellinghoff was asked today to comment on the Duke board’s
decision to fire Chief Executive Officer  Bill Johnson , 58,
within hours of the company completing the $17.8 billion
takeover of Johnson’s Progress Energy Inc. The deal, approved by
FERC on June 8, remains an open docket and Wellinghoff said he
can’t comment on the case.  “I believe that a board of directors of a utility has the
right to decide whoever they want to run the utility,”
Wellinghoff said at a Platts Energy Podium in Washington today.
“Once the board of directors does that, regardless of their
timing, I think everybody needs to move on.”  Duke replaced Johnson with  Jim Rogers , 64, who ran the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company before the merger and
had agreed to become chairman, clearing the job for Johnson. The
shift triggered an investigation by the North Carolina Utilities
Commission, which also approved the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
