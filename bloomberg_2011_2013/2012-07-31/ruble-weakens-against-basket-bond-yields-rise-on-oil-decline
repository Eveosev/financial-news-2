The ruble depreciated against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket and yields on Russia’s
local debt rose as oil, the country’s main export, fell.  The  Russian currency  slid 0.2 percent to 35.5031 against
the basket as of 10:24 a.m. in Moscow, the first loss in four
days. The country’s 54 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) of local
debt due February 2027 fell, increasing the yield six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.42 percent.  Brent crude  slipped 0.3 percent to $105.93 per barrel. The
 European Central Bank  and the U.S. Federal Reserve meet this
week, after ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged July 26 to
preserve the euro. The European Union is Russia’s largest
trading partner.  The ruble was little changed at 32.2265 per dollar and lost
0.3 percent to 39.5275 per euro. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 32.73 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.6775 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
