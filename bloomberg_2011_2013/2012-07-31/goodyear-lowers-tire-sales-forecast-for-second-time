(Corrects to say profit beat estimates in first
paragraph.)  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the
largest U.S. tiremaker, reported a second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates and lowered its full-year forecast for
tire sales for the second time this year.  The company’s tire sales this year will be 5 percent to 7
percent lower than in 2011, because of “continued economic
challenges, particularly in  Europe ,” Goodyear said in a
statement today. Goodyear said Feb. 14 it expected tire unit
volume to be about the same as 2011 and on April 27 revised the
forecast, projecting sales to fall 2 percent.  Goodyear’s net income rose to $92 million, or 33 cents a
share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $47
million, or 16 cents a year earlier, the Akron, Ohio-based
company said today.  Excluding one-time items, such as costs of accelerated
depreciation and debt financing fees to refinance a  credit line ,
Goodyear had a profit of 57 cents a share. The average estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 45
cents.  Sales fell 8.4 percent to $5.15 billion in the quarter. The
average of four analysts’ estimates was $5.74 billion.  Raw-material prices will be unchanged from last year,
Goodyear said today. In April, the company forecast an increase
of 9 percent and in February projected such prices would rise 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
