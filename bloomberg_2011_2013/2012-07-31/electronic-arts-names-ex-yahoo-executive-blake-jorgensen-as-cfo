Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-
largest U.S. video-game publisher, named  Blake Jorgensen  as
chief financial officer, adding a former Yahoo! Inc. and Levi
Strauss & Co. executive to its top ranks.  Jorgensen will join Electronic Arts in September, the
Redwood City, California-based company said today in a
statement. He has served as Levi Strauss’s finance chief since
July 2009. Before that, he had the same role at Yahoo.  “His deep understanding of finance and experience in online
commerce and entertainment will be instrumental to EA’s
transformation into digital distribution of game content and
services,’’ Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello said today
in the statement.  Electronic Arts, the publisher of “FIFA” soccer and other
titles, is shifting into Internet games and away from packaged
software. The transition has prompted the company to cut jobs
and make acquisitions, including a purchase of  PopCap Games  last
year for as much as $1.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
