Protecting senior unsecured bank
debt may cost “more than EU taxpayers can bear” and investors
should be liable for their decisions, a committee of advisers to
the European Systemic Risk Board said in a  report  today.  “The examples of Ireland and  Spain  suggest, already at the
national level, that the full protection of all senior creditors
may exceed the government’s fiscal capacity,” the Advisory
Scientific Committee said in the report on its website.  The committee also is “concerned” about the
recapitalization of Spanish banks without determining the actual
losses of the banks first.  “Adding capital without knowing what the assets are
actually worth and how much capital is really needed entails a
serious risk that the funds may simply be lost as the necessary
resolution of the banks is delayed further,” according to the
report.  The committee supported the creation of a European bank
supervisor and a European Resolution Authority to deal with
failing lenders. The authority should be financed primarily by a
levy on banks, the committee said.  The  European Systemic Risk Board  was set up in January 2011
to help detect risks in the financial system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
