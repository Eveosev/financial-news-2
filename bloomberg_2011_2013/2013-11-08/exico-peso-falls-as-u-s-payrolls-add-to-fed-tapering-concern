Mexico ’s peso retreated and bonds
fell as U.S. employers added more workers to payrolls than
forecast, adding to speculation that the Federal Reserve will
reduce monetary stimulus.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 13.2695 per U.S.
dollar at 9:58 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its drop since
Nov. 1 to 1.6 percent, the third straight weekly decline and the
biggest since the period ended Sept. 27.  “Markets are going to start thinking again that the Fed
might initiate tapering at the December meeting,” Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in
a telephone interview from Mexico City. “That’s clearly the
factor that’s weakening the peso.” Banorte still projects that
the Fed will wait until 2014 to reduce stimulus, he said.  Mexican bond yields climbed to a two-month high on
speculation the Fed will accelerate withdrawal of a program of
asset purchases that have kept U.S. rates low and buoyed demand
for emerging-market debt.  Yields on benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 rose 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 6.25 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 1.41
centavos to 129.9 centavos per peso.  Mexican policy makers were unanimous in their Oct. 25
decision to reduce the  target lending rate  to a record low 3.5
percent, minutes of their meeting published today show. They
reiterated that more cuts in the foreseeable future aren’t
advisable as the economy shows signs of recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
