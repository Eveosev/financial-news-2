Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-largest
U.S. water company by market value, reported third-quarter
revenue declined 4.8 percent as higher-than-normal rain caused
clients to use less water.  Operating revenue of $204.3 million was affected by above-average rainfall in several service areas. That compared with
$214.6 million for the same period in 2012. Net income rose 26
percent to $63.6 million in the quarter, the  Bryn Mawr ,
Pennsylvania-based company said late yesterday in a statement.  The shares have advanced 24 percent this year compared with
a 17 percent gain by American Water Works Co., the biggest
publicly traded water utility in the U.S. that this week said
profit slipped 2 percent in the quarter as weather also caused a
drop in customer demand.  Aqua America said too that it has completed the purchase of
nine water and wastewater utility systems in 2013: four in
Pennsylvania, three in  North Carolina  and two in Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
