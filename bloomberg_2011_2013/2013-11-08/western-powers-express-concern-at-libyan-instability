The U.S., U.K.,  France  and  Italy 
expressed concern at instability in Libya and called on its
people to shun force, after the worst gun battles in months
between rival militias in the capital Tripoli left two dead.  The four Western powers said they “reiterate our support
to the elected political institutions and call on Libyans to
reject any use of force against them,” in a statement posted on
the British Foreign Office website today.  Another 29 people were wounded in the fighting in an
eastern part of the capital yesterday, the state-run LANA news
agency reported on its website today, with militias using anti-aircraft guns and grenades.  Two years after the 2011 war that swept  Muammar Qaddafi 
from power, government efforts to revive an economy dependent on
oil are being stymied by feuding militias and protests at oil
facilities that caused nationwide crude production to plunge.
The four Western countries led the  North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ’s aerial campaign against Qaddafi.  Crude output fell to about 250,000 barrels a day on Nov. 3,
according to Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman for state-run
National Oil Corp. That compares with an average 1.3 million
barrels a day during the first half of this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the statement today, the four Western powers said “the
adoption of a constitution will be key to providing the
framework for  Libya ’s secure and prosperous future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
