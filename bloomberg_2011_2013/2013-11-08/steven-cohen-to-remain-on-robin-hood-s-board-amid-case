Steven A. Cohen , the billionaire
whose hedge-fund firm SAC Capital Advisors LP agreed to plead
guilty to securities and wire-fraud charges, will stay on the
board of the  Robin Hood Foundation , the organization said.  “Steve is a valued and thoughtful member of Robin Hood’s
board, and his leadership and generosity over the past nine
years have benefited countless  New Yorkers  in need,” the group,
which fights poverty in the city, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  SAC, indicted this year and accused of operating an
insider-trading conspiracy stretching back to 1999, agreed on
Nov. 4 to pay a record $1.8 billion and shutter its investment
advisory business. The company reaped hundreds of millions of
dollars in illicit profit, according to federal prosecutors.
Cohen, 57, who wasn’t charged in the indictment of his  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based firm, still faces an administrative action
filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged
failure to supervise SAC’s activities.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of
America Corp. and Morgan Stanley are among Wall Street firms
still providing trading and prime-brokerage services to SAC,
said people briefed on the matter, who requested anonymity when
discussing specific clients. Prime-brokerage services include
 securities lending , trade clearing and assistance with capital
raising.  Robin Hood, founded in 1988, focuses on finding, funding
and creating programs and schools for families in  New York ’s
poorest neighborhoods, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
