Sandeep Aggarwal, a former research
analyst with Collins Stewart LLC, admitted passing inside
information about a deal involving  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  to a former SAC Capital Advisors LP fund manager.  Aggarwal, 40, pleaded guilty to one count each of
conspiracy and securities fraud in a hearing today in federal
court in  Manhattan . He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis
that he tipped “Richard Lee and others” about the Yahoo-Microsoft venture in 2009.  “I did this to improve my standing as an analyst and to
increase revenue for my firm,” Aggarwal told Ellis, reading
from a prepared statement and becoming visibly emotional at
times. “I know what I did was wrong and I’m very sorry for my
conduct.  Aggarwal faces as much as 25 years in prison when he’s
sentenced and may be deported to his native  India . He agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of receiving leniency.  SAC, which is owned by billionaire Steven Cohen, is
scheduled to plead guilty to criminal charges today as part of a
record $1.8 billion insider-trading settlement with the
government.  The case is U.S. v. Aggarwal, 13-mj-01877, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
