India ’s rupee led losses in Asian
currencies this week as overseas investors cut holdings of the
region’s stocks on speculation U.S. policy makers will cut
stimulus this year.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index fell 0.3 percent
in the five days through yesterday, after a 0.5 percent drop in
the prior period. Third-quarter U.S. expansion topped estimates
and growth in  service industries  accelerated last month, data
showed this week. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Oct. 17-18
predicted the Fed would begin paring stimulus in March.  “Asian currencies declined this week as markets think the
Fed will scale back its stimulus earlier than expected,” said
Leong Sook Mei, Southeast Asian head of global markets research
in Singapore at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “Flows are
not coming back.”  The  Indian rupee  lost 1.2 percent from Nov. 1 to 62.475 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.7 percent to 11,410,
 Thailand ’s baht fell 0.9 percent to 31.475 and Malaysia’s
ringgit dropped 0.3 percent to 3.1794.  Overseas funds sold $1 billion more South Korean, Thai,
Indonesian and Philippine stocks than they bought this week,
exchange data show.  The U.S. had a 2.8 percent annualized gain in gross
domestic product, compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the
prior three months and a 2 percent advance forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures showed Nov. 7. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index
increased to 55.4 from 54.4 in September. The median estimate of
economists was for a drop to 54.  Rupee, Rupiah  The rupee fell to a five-week low of 62.7513 yesterday. The
 Reserve Bank  of India has cut direct dollar supplies to oil
refiners by 30 percent to 40 percent, Economic Affairs Secretary
Arvind Mayaram told CNBC TV-18.  “U.S. dollar demand from local  oil companies  as the RBI
scales back its FX swaps is likely to weaken the case for rupee
strength,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by New York-based
Rashique Rahman wrote in a report Nov. 7.  The rupiah had a second weekly decline after data showed
gross domestic product rose 5.6 percent last quarter from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since 2009. The nation recorded trade
deficits in seven of the first nine months of this year.  The baht touched a four-week low of 31.515 per dollar
yesterday on concern anti-government protests triggered by a
proposed amnesty law for political offenses will deepen a
slowdown in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy.  Political Unrest  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra called Nov. 7 for an end
to street demonstrations in Bangkok after agreeing to scrap the
controversial amnesty bill.  “Prolonged political unrest will hurt the economy that’s
already weak and, with the current mood, foreigners probably
don’t want to put money in Thailand,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “The political situation will weigh on
the baht, which may underperform its regional peers.”  Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s won dropped 0.4 percent
this week to 1,064.90 per dollar and the Taiwanese dollar
slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.505. The Chinese  yuan  advanced 0.15
percent to 6.0905, while the  Philippine peso  gained 0.1 percent
to 43.188. Vietnam’s dong was steady at 21,100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
