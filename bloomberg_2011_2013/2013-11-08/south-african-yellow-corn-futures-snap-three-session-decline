South African yellow corn futures
rose for the first time in four days by the midday close on the
South African Futures Exchange.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, increased 0.6 percent to 2,337 rand ($228) a metric
ton in Johannesburg. The white variety for delivery in the same
month rose 0.4 percent to 2,422 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continentâ€™s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.4 percent to 3,579
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
