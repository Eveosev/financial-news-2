Ibovespa  futures  declined as concern
that a U.S. stronger economy will spur the Federal Reserve to
reduce bond purchases sooner than expected overshadowed slower-than-forecast inflation in  Brazil .  Toll-road manager  Arteris SA (ARTR3) , frequent-flier program
operator  Multiplus SA (MPLU3)  and energy company  Eneva SA (ENEV3)  may be active
after being removed from the MSCI Brazil index. For-profit
educator  Estacio Participacoes SA (ESTC3)  may move after earnings beat
analysts’ estimates for a third straight quarter.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December  dropped  0.2
percent to 52,740 at 9:23 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real climbed
0.1 percent to 2.3032 per dollar.  A U.S. Commerce Department report yesterday showed that the
world’s largest economy grew at a better-than-estimated 2.8
percent annual rate in the third quarter. Today’s payroll data,
scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. Washington time, may show
that U.S. employers added fewer workers in October.  In Brazil, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said wholesale,
construction and consumer prices climbed 0.30 percent in the 10
days starting Oct. 21. The median forecast of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.59 percent.  Brazil’s main equity index entered a bull market Sept. 9
after rising 20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through
that day. The gauge is still down 23 percent in dollar terms
this year, compared with a decline of 5 percent for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.47 billion
reais ($3.68 billion) yesterday, compared with a daily average
