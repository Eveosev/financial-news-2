Chrysler Group LLC said it’s
recalling about 1.2 million Ram trucks to fix a steering-system
part, although as many as 726,000 may not need to be repaired.  Chrysler, which is majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , said about
453,000 Ram trucks have steering system tie rods that might not
have been properly aligned, either during assembly or while
being serviced, according to a statement by the Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based automaker today. The company is aware of six
accidents and two injuries involving 2008 through 2012 model
year Ram 2500 and Ram 3500 trucks, and another accident with no
injuries involving other models.  One recall will inspect 842,400 Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks
from model years 2003 through 2008 in order to find about
116,000 of the vehicles that have been repaired with tie-rod
assemblies that could become misaligned. The condition could
lead to steering loss, the company said.  Chrysler is also recalling 294,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks
from model years 2008 through 2012, as well as 2008 Ram 1500 4X4
Mega Cabs with tie-rod assemblies linked to previous recalls.
It’s also recalling 43,500 Ram 4500 and Ram 5500 4X4 chassis
cabs from model years 2008 through 2012.  Customers will be notified by mail next month, the company
said, and repair work could begin by January. Parts for the
affected 4500 and 5500 models may not be ready until late 2014,
the company said. Those customers can take their trucks to
Chrysler Group dealers for interim service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
