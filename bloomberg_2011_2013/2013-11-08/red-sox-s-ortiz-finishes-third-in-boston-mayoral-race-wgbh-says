Boston Red Sox designated hitter
 David Ortiz , last month’s  World Series  Most Valuable Player,
finished third in Boston’s mayoral election this week,  according 
to WGBH.  The 37-year-old Ortiz received more write-in votes than any
other person in the Nov. 5 election, the Boston public radio
station said on  its website . Mayor-elect Marty Walsh won with
roughly 72,500 votes, beating John Connolly.  The unofficial results on the city’s website show 560
write-in votes, without parsing them by name. An e-mail sent to
the city’s press office was not immediately returned.  A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortiz told the Boston
Herald earlier this week that he and current mayor Thomas Menino
“go way back.”  “I was proud to get to know him through the years, doing
things with him, especially for kids,” Ortiz said, according to
the newspaper. “The political side -- I don’t know about that,
and I stay away from that. He just told me, ’Go get ’em,
Tiger.’”  Ortiz hit .688 in the World Series with two home runs,
helping the  Red Sox  to their third MLB championship in the past
10 years. This week he also won the Silver Slugger Award as the
best designated hitter in the American League.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
