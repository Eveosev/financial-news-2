The Ibovespa dropped as speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut stimulus measures sooner
than expected offset slower-than-forecast inflation in  Brazil .  Mobile carrier  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  sank the most on the
stock gauge after parent company  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ’s chief
executive officer said its Brazilian assets are strategic,
damping speculation that the unit will be sold.  Brazil’s benchmark equity index  dropped  0.9 percent to
52,299 at 11:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo, extending its weekly decline
to 3.1 percent. Fifty-nine of its 72 member  stocks  fell. The
real weakened 1.2 percent to 2.3336 per dollar.  The Ibovespa extended its decline after a report in
 Washington  showing U.S. payrolls increased more than forecast in
October stoked speculation that Fed policy makers will dial back
monetary stimulus that has helped boost demand for emerging-market assets. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the
world’s largest economy grew at a better-than-estimated 2.8
percent annual rate in the third quarter.  “All attentions are focused” on when the Fed will trim
stimulus, Felipe Rocha, an analyst at the brokerage firm Omar Camargo, said in a phone interview from Curitiba, Brazil. “The
reduction in liquidity in the world should be negative for
Brazil.”  In Brazil, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said wholesale,
construction and consumer prices climbed 0.30 percent in the 10
days starting Oct. 21. The median forecast of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 0.59 percent.  Tim  slumped  5.6 percent to 10.44 reais, the biggest drop on
a closing basis since July 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
