Garance Franke-Ruta at the Atlantic  profiles  a couple who may well get divorced to qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Separately, they’ll probably qualify for some subsidy; together, they don’t. This is not the only program that has this effect. Many tax subsidies phase out at higher income levels, such as IRAs and student loan deductions, and thanks to the tax deal cut over the fiscal cliff, higher-income earners will face  more such phaseouts  this year. Meanwhile, at the lower end of the income distribution, things are, if anything, worse. All the means-tested assistance -- Medicaid, food stamps, housing and child-care benefits -- start phasing out as you move out of “poverty” and toward the “lower middle class.” Those phaseouts constitute a very high marginal tax rate; it is quite possible for someone with a couple of kids to get a raise and thereby be worse off, or to achieve the same effect by marrying their live-in boyfriend. I’m on the record as a  marriage booster . Marriage is a happiness booster, it’s the best environment for raising kids, and it’s one of the most reliable personal finance programs around. It’s good for you, and good for society. Good policy should encourage marriage, not discourage it. Conservatives support “family friendly” policies such as child tax credits, but they tend to give this issue shorter shrift. This dynamic plausibly plays a role in  the disintegration of marriage  among the less educated. You often hear that welfare helped to destroy fragile families by making men less necessary to their economic support. But welfare did more than that: It actually chased men away. A two-adult family was unlikely to be eligible for welfare, or ancillary benefits such as housing and Medicaid. As long as benefits are means tested, that will be true. So should conservatives support more universal benefits? After all, the best way to keep people from being a burden on society is to keep them in intact families. But universal benefit programs are hard to design; Obamacare was supposed to solve the Medicaid problem, but instead, it may just have moved the perverse incentives up into the middle class. Moreover, universal benefits are expensive; even Europe is finding it hard to support them, and they have more tolerance for high taxes. And that’s just the monetary cost. These programs also often undermine their own actuarial base. Generous welfare benefits discourage work, eroding the tax base that is supposed to support them. Even Social Security benefits seem to reduce the number of children people have -- children who are  still very necessary  to support the universal entitlement. And of course, I haven’t even touched on the moral arguments: People have the right to the fruits of their own labors, and to what others are willing to give them voluntarily. And they have the right to give those things voluntarily to others, like their kids. Radical redistribution undermines many of the values -- hard work and private charity -- that conservatives want to promote. But if full-frontal Denmark isn’t the way to go, conservatives need to think hard about their answers to the mess that is our current patchwork of benefits. I’ve seen suggestions here and there, but nothing, so far, that the movement has coalesced around. The liberal answer -- give subsidies to more people! -- creates plenty of problems. If conservatives can come up with a better one, they’ll have a cornerstone for the more populist conservative policy platform that  Ross Douthat  has been calling for. Maybe even for a more populist conservative policy platform that can win elections in 2016.
