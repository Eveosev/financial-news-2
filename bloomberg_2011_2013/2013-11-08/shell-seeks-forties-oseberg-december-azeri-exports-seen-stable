Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to buy
 North Sea  Forties and Oseberg crude grades at higher prices than
deals yesterday. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals
in Europe. BP Plc sought to sell Nigerian Qua Iboe crude for a
fourth day without success even after lowering the offer.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from the port of Ceyhan
in  Turkey  will be little changed in December from this month, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  North Sea  Shell didn’t manage to buy Forties for loading Nov. 29 to
Dec. 1 at parity to Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. This is
9 cents higher than a trade yesterday.  Shell was also unable to buy Oseberg for Nov. 27 to Nov. 30
at 85 cents a barrel more than the benchmark, the survey showed.
This compares with a premium of 75 cents for a cargo it bought
yesterday.  Brent for December settlement traded at $104.44 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $103.75 in the previous session. The January
contract was at $104.42, a discount of 2 cents to December.  Urals/Mediterranean  Shipments of Azeri Light next month from the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will total 21.85 million barrels, or 704,839
barrels a day, according to the plan. That compares with 21.25
million, or 708,333 barrels a day, this month.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, bought 100,000
metric tons of Urals crude for delivery to Gdansk on Nov. 25 to
Nov. 29 from Glencore Xstrata Plc, according to two people with
knowledge of the tender results, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  West Africa  BP Plc offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at $4 a barrel
more than Dated Brent for Nov. 12 to Dec. 12 delivery to
Rotterdam, or a premium of $3.85 for delivery to Lavera,  France ,
during the same period, the survey showed.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought 1 million barrels of Nigerian
Qua Iboe crude for loading on Jan. 1 to Jan. 10 from Exxon Mobil
Corp., said three traders who participate in the market.  Chevron Corp. plans to pipe Angolan Kuito crude into the
Nemba grade from the middle of next month, said three traders
involved in the region’s oil market. The company may not release
any separate loading plan for Kuito from January, they said.  Kurt Glaubitz , a  San Ramon , California-based spokesman for
Chevron, didn’t respond to an e-mail and phone call yesterday
from Bloomberg seeking comment on the Kuito plan.  Chevron discovered Kuito in 1997 and it became  Angola ’s
first producing deep-water field two years later, according to
Chevron’s website. The current production rate is about 60,000
barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
