Tim Participacoes SA  sank the most in six weeks after  Telecom Italia SpA , the mobile-phone service provider’s parent company, signaled that it might not sell the Brazilian unit as part of a plan to reduce debt.  The shares fell 3.9 percent to 10.63 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo, the most since Sept. 25. It was the worst performance on the  Ibovespa  stock benchmark, which lost 0.9 percent.  Tim had rallied 35 percent this year amid speculation that Telecom Italia might be considering a sale, which investors speculated would enhance the value of the company. The Milan-based company yesterday unveiled plans to sell its Argentine business, assets including wireless towers in Italy and Brazil and a mandatory convertible bond to raise a total of about 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) to help pare debt. The Brazilian operations were labeled as core assets.

A buyer of a controlling stake in Tim would have to offer to buy out minority shareholders for the same price offered to Telecom Italia, according to the rules of Novo Mercado, the exchange’s segment where the stock is traded and which has higher standards of corporate governance.
