The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Commodity
Index (SPGSCI)  plans to raise the weighting of Brent crude, the European
benchmark, while trimming that for its U.S. equivalent West
Texas Intermediate.  The index weight of Brent traded on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange will increase to 23.14 percent next year from 22.13
percent in 2013, as the share of New York-traded WTI decreases
to 23.73 percent from 24.85 percent, S&P Dow Jones Indices said
in a statement on its website. Changes in the composition of the
index are based on production levels of its 24 raw materials
averaged over five years.  Brent futures have traded at an average of $14 a barrel
more than WTI over the past three years amid perceptions that
booming  oil production  in the U.S., which restricts crude
exports, has made the nation’s benchmark grade less reflective
of global conditions than the North Sea marker, which can be
shipped around the world. Assets under management of funds
tracking the S&P GSCI were about $80 billion in 2012, S&P Dow
Jones Indices said on Aug. 8.  “Brent is more favorable from an investor perspective,”
said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London.
“Brent, being the global benchmark, benefits from geopolitical
jitters and better reflects global supply-demand dynamics.”  New pipeline capacity intended to divert crude inventories
from the U.S. storage center in  Oklahoma  to refineries on the
Gulf Coast at the start of next year will have a larger effect
on the price spread between Brent and WTI than the index re-weighting, according to Petromatrix GmbH.  Little Impact  The increase in the index’s allocation for Brent is small
and “should not have any significant market impact,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland,
said by e-mail today.  The S&P GSCI index will replace ICE gasoil contracts with
low-sulfur gasoil during two monthly roll periods in 2014,
according to the statement. ICE’s high-sulfur gasoil contract
will cease trading in December 2014 and be replaced by a lower
sulfur equivalent. The high-sulfur contract currently attracts
more volume, with an open interest yesterday of 510,802 lots
versus 6,980 lots for the low-sulfur grade, according to ICE
data.  Gasoil is this third-largest component in the index,
trailing the two crudes, and its weighting will decrease to 8.31
percent from 8.48 percent next year.  Among other changes in the index, gold will decline to 2.80
percent from 2.81 percent, corn will increase to 4.90 percent
from 4.76 percent and  London  Metal Exchange copper will rise to
3.22 percent from 3.16 percent.  S&P Dow Jones Indices is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos., a
