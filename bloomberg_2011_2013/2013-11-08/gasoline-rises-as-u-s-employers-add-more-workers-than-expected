Gasoline rose from the lowest level
since 2011 as U.S. employers added more workers to payrolls in
October than forecast by economists.  Futures gained as much as 1 percent. The Labor Department
reported an addition of 204,000 workers to payrolls in October,
above the 120,000 figure that was the median forecast of 91
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. September payroll gains were
revised upward to 163,000.  “We’re definitely getting a little bit of a rebound off of
the jobs number,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst for
The Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “People are making more
money, so they drive more, and they have jobs, so they commute
to work, and that increases gasoline demand.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 0.54 cent to $2.5085 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:09 a.m. Trading
