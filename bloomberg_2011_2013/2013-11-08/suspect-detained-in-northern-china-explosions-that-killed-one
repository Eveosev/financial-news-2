Chinese authorities detained a
suspect in connection with Nov. 6 blasts in the northern city of
Taiyuan that killed one person and sparked security concerns
ahead of a Communist Party gathering in Beijing tomorrow.  The 41-year-old man, who had served a nine-year prison term
for stealing, confessed after he was captured at 2 a.m. today,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Police found homemade
bombs at his residence, Xinhua said.  “The case has been cleared up,” Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hong Lei told a briefing in Beijing today. “The
suspect has confessed to his crimes. Investigation and
collection of evidence is still ongoing.”  The bombing occurred three days before Communist Party
leaders hold a Nov. 9-12 meeting where they may lay out a series
of economic reforms. Earlier this week, Public Security Minister
Guo Shengkun announced a plan dubbed ‘Beijing Security Moat’ to
head off terrorist attacks before or during the gathering.  Security had already been tightened after a car rammed a
bridge near the Forbidden City in Beijing on Oct. 28 and burst
into flames, killing the three occupants and two bystanders.
Officials said the incident was a terrorist attack.  The Taiyuan explosions went off at about 7:40 a.m. outside
a Communist Party building in the city. Eight people were
wounded in the explosions, one of them seriously, according to
Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
