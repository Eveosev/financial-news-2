Croatian lawmakers called for a Dec.
1 referendum on a constitutional ban on same-sex marriages in
the predominantly Roman Catholic country.  About 700,000 Croats signed a petition initiated by a
conservative group that sought to amend the bill and define
marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Lawmakers to
approve the motion in the European Union’s newest member state
by a 104-13 vote, with five abstentions.  The constitution in the country of 4.2 million people
currently doesn’t contain a definition of marriage. While same-sex marriages aren’t legal in  Croatia , since 2003 gay couples
can register their unions and have similar rights to those
granted to unmarried heterosexual couples.  A referendum becomes binding if majority of people who take
part in it approve it, according to Croatian laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
