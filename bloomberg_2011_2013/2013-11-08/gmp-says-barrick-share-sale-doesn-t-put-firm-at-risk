The chief executive officer of  GMP
Capital Inc. (GMP)  said  Canada ’s second-largest non-bank brokerage
isn’t taking an undue risk or betting the firm by partly
underwriting  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s $3 billion share sale.  Royal Bank of Canada , Barclays Plc and Toronto-based GMP
are leading the sale, which is set to close Nov. 14. The
underwriters acquired all the 163.5 million shares in a so-called bought deal and are trying to sell them for $18.35 each.  Barrick rose 0.2 percent to $18.22 at the close in  New
York . The Globe and Mail reported Nov. 6 the new shares are
proving to be a hard sell to wary investors.  “We take a sophisticated approach to risk,” Harris Fricker said today in a conference call to discuss GMP’s third-quarter results. “This is a business we’ve been in for almost
20 years and as guys who own 23 percent of the firm we’re not in
the habit of ever risking our franchise.”  The underwriters have the option to buy more shares, which
would lift proceeds from the sale to as much as to $3.45
billion, Toronto-based Barrick said in an Oct. 31 statement.
Barrick plans to use $2.6 billion from the sale to buy back
bonds.  “There’s been more speculation over this than Area 51,”
Fricker said, comparing the stock sale with the U.S. military
installation in the Nevada desert that’s been the subject of
decades of speculation and conspiracy theories. “The actual
results will demonstrate the prudence of taking on the
transaction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
