YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW)  Chief Executive
Officer James Welch asked union leaders to extend a labor accord
into 2019 to help the struggling trucker refinance debt.  Welch said the refinancing process must start by Nov. 15,
according to a  slide presentation  shown at a Nov. 5 meeting with
Teamsters union leaders. YRC asked the union to reduce
absenteeism and provide predictable future wage and benefit
increases. Ken Paff, national organizer for Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, confirmed the posting.  YRC, which has posted annual losses since 2007, delayed its
earnings release this week amid talks on the new labor
agreement. The company has almost $1.4 billion in  borrowings 
from what Welch has called “numerous missteps” before he
became CEO in July 2011.  “Our lenders will not refinance our debt unless we have a
five-year agreement along with an improved cost structure and
operational performance,” YRC said in the presentation.  The refinancing process typically takes 90 days and the
company must complete it before the first debt payments come
due, according to the presentation. YRC has a $69.4 million of
convertible bonds maturing on Feb. 15, according to Bloomberg
data.  YRC said in the presentation that its market share has
dropped to 17 percent from 42 percent in 1995. The presentation
shows a graph with two options -- one is refinancing and the
other depicts a truck driving over a cliff.  YRC, based in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , fell 0.7 percent to
$8.98 at the close in  New York . The shares have advanced 33
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
