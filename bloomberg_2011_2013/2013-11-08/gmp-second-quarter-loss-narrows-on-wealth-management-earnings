GMP Capital Inc. (GMP) , Canada’s second-largest non-bank brokerage, narrowed its third-quarter loss as
profit improved in wealth management.  The net loss attributable to common shareholders shrank to
C$695,000 ($664,000), or 1 cent a share, from C$1.91 million, or
3 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said today in a
statement. Revenue fell 27 percent to C$42.6 million.  GMP has increased its bet on wealth management amid a
slowdown in Canadian capital markets. In September, GMP and
partner James Richardson & Sons Ltd. agreed to buy Macquarie
Private Wealth Canada for C$132 million.  “It would be an understatement to describe the past
quarter as challenging,” GMP Chief Executive Officer Harris Fricker said in a conference call. “Both primary and secondary
market activity hit unprecedented lows as uncertain and
challenging macro conditions were exacerbated by shifting
commentary regarding monetary policy by Canadian and U.S.
central banks.”  The brokerage lost 2 cents a share in the quarter after
excluding some items, missing the 1-cent loss average  estimate 
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Wealth-management profit was C$1.13 million, compared with
a loss of C$274,000 a year earlier, as the company cut
compensation expenses, according to the statement. Profit from
capital markets before income taxes fell 11 percent to C$620,000
from a year earlier on lower investment-banking revenue.  GMP  was unchanged  at C$5.95 at 9:31 a.m. in Toronto. The
shares have gained 1.7 percent this year, trailing the 7 percent
advance of  Canada ’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
