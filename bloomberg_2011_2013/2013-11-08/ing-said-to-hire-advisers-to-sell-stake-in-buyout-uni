ING Groep NV (INGA) , the Netherlands’
largest financial-services company, named advisers to sell its
stake in its French private-equity unit, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  was selected to sell Paris-based ING Parcom
Private Equity, with bids scheduled by January, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.  ING, the sole investor in the group’s fund, committed 300
million euros ($401 million) for investments, about half of
which has been spent. Buyers will be expected to honor the
remaining commitment and take over ING’s stakes in companies
already acquired by the fund, which include French chemicals
distributor Safic-Alcan SAS, said the people.  Parcom’s management team may get the chance to take control
of the management company as part of the transaction, said one
person. In March, ING’s German buyout unit was spun out from the
company and raised a 350 million-euro fund under the name
Deutsche Private Equity, according to its website.  A number of banks, including  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , have sold or spun off their
private-equity units as regulators seek to limit risk-taking by
financial companies.  Spokesmen and officials for Lazard, Parcom and ING either
declined to comment or didn’t respond to e-mails and telephone
requests seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
