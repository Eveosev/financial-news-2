Treasuries lost the most in four
months after a report showed the economy added more jobs last
month than forecast, boosting speculation the  Federal Reserve 
may slow bond purchases as soon as its Dec. 17-18 meeting.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes  reached  the highest in
more than three weeks as payrolls grew by 204,000 in October
versus the 120,000 median forecast of 91 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart 
said more needs to be done amid the progress on jobs. Hedge fund
managers increased bets to the most in 18 months that 10-year
note futures will decline.  “The discussion and the decision of taper is back on the
table,” said Dan Heckman, a fixed-income strategist in  Kansas
City ,  Missouri , at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees
$112 billion. “They could announce it in December and start in
January, that’s a real possibility. This is forcing yields on
the long end higher.”  The benchmark U.S.  10-year yield  rose 15 basis points, or
0.15 percentage point, to 2.75 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York
time, Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The price of the 2.5
percent note due August 2023 lost 1 1/4, or $12.50 per $1,000
face amount, to 97 7/8.  The yield increased as much as 16 basis points, the most
since July 5. It reached 3.01 percent on Sept. 6, breaching 3
percent for the first time since July 2011.  With today’s increase, the yield on the 10-year note is
still trading just around the three-month average of 2.71
percent, according to Bloomberg data.  Trading Pace  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose to $453 billion, the
highest level since Sept. 18. It fell to a 2013 low of $147.8
billion on Aug. 9. The high was $662.3 billion on May 22.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index was at 69.9, just below the 2013 average of 71.85.  Hedge fund managers and other large speculators increased
 net short positions  in 10-year note futures in the week ending
Nov.5 to the biggest since April 2012, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Speculative short
positions, or bets prices will fall, outnumbered long positions
by 189,188 contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Treasury 10-year notes touched the cheapest level since
Sept. 23, based on the 0.33 percent level on the so-called term
premium, a  valuation model  used by the Fed that is calculated by
using interest-rate expectations, economic growth and inflation.
The gauge closed at 0.31 percent. It has averaged negative 0.04
percent this year, indicating the securities were overvalued.
The security is considered at fair value at a term premium level
between 25 basis points to 75 basis points.  Economic Outlook  “If the payrolls start to crank up, the market is going to
be getting ready for the future action of the Fed,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income portfolio manager who helps
oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc., in a
telephone interview from Salem,  Massachusetts . “We’re going to
be data dependent, which means economic releases will have a
heavy weight in market direction. There will be a lot more
volatility as people trade out of positions.”  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $70 billion in notes and
bonds next week, including $30 billion in three-year notes, $24
billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on
three consecutive days starting Nov. 12. The amount is down from
$72 billion the previous quarter.  Traders are pricing in a 22.4 percent probability that the
Fed will raise its benchmark overnight rate by its January 2015
meeting, down from a 70.7 percent likelihood on Sept. 5, the day
before the August payroll data was released. The Fed has kept
its target rate unchanged at zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008.  Fed policy should be accommodative for “quite some time,”
Lockhart said today in a speech in Oxford,  Mississippi , adding
that employment may be short of the fed’s goal at the end of
2014.  Meeting Reaction  Yields rose after the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
Oct. 30 that the economy showed signs of “underlying strength”
even as policy makers agreed to continue the monthly bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing. The Fed purchased $5.25
billion in Treasuries maturing between August 2018 and July 2019
today.  Economists predict the Fed will maintain its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases at the current pace until March,
according to a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 17-18. They
forecast the government closure cut growth by 0.3 percentage
point this quarter.  “The market’s going to price in an earlier, versus late
first quarter/early second quarter, taper,” said Richard Schlanger, who helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income
securities as vice president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston .
“This was an October surprise,” he said, referring to the
payrolls report.  A report yesterday showed U.S. gross domestic product grew
at an annualized 2.8 percent rate in the third quarter,
exceeding forecasts for a 2 percent gain. The report along with
today’s payroll’s numbers increased speculation the U.S. will be
cutting back on stimulus as the  European Central Bank  looks to
intensify its accommodative policies, suggesting U.S. Treasuries
may continue to lure buyers of government debt.  ‘Differing Economies’  The ECB President  Mario Draghi  and policy makers have just
one more quarter-point cut left before reaching zero, increasing
the likelihood of unconventional tools such as quantitative
easing or a negative deposit rate if prices slow further or the
economic recovery stalls. Euro-area inflation is less than half
the ECB’s target and unemployment is at the highest level since
the currency bloc was formed in 1999.  “Draghi and the FOMC are faced with monetary policy
decisions for differing economies,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “Where the Fed is concerned with scaling out of QE
as employment continues to improve, Draghi is faced with a
potentially deflationary environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
