Brazil ’s longer-term swap rates
declined after a report indicating slower-than-forecast
inflation added to speculation that policy makers will limit
increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2018 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.18 percent
at 10:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo, paring their increase for the week
to 36 basis points. The real appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.2968
per  U.S. dollar , trimming its decline since Nov. 1 to 1.8
percent, still the worst performance among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Wholesale, construction and consumer prices climbed 0.3
percent in the 10 days starting Oct. 21, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation reported today. The median forecast of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.59 percent increase.  The real has weakened since the government reported last
week that the  budget deficit  swelled in September to the
equivalent of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, the largest
since 2009, adding to concern that the nation’s credit rating
will be cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
