Ethanol futures jumped the most in
six weeks after outlooks for U.S. corn production and
inventories missed analysts’ estimates.  Ethanol rose 2.4 percent, the biggest gain since Oct. 3,
after the Agriculture Department said corn output will be a
record 13.989 billion bushels this year while stockpiles are
projected to be 1.887 billion bushels on Aug. 31, 2014. That
compared with an average production estimate of 14.029 billion
and inventories of 2.044 billion bushels predicted in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Both corn output and inventories were a big surprise,”
Renato Dias, a Campinas, Brazil-based analyst for Intl FCStone
Inc., said in a telephone interview. “Distillers would expect
to see more corn around.”  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened 1.13 cents to 87.94
cents a gallon.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery advanced 3.9 cents
to settle at $1.674 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  Gasoline for December delivery climbed 5.03 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.5534 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn Demand  U.S. distillers will use 4.9 billion bushels of corn, or 35
percent of the crop, to make ethanol, unchanged from a Sept. 11
estimate, the  Agriculture Department  said. U.S. biodiesel makers
will use 5.6 billion pounds of  soybean oil , down from 5.7
billion previously estimated.  Corn for December delivery reversed earlier losses to rise
6.25 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $4.2675 a bushel in Chicago. Corn
is the main feedstock used to make ethanol in the U.S.  “There won’t be as much corn as people expected in the
U.S., but there’s plenty of it in places like Brazil and
 Argentina ,” Dias said. “I would’t be surprised if prices
bounce back in the short term.”  The December crush spread of corn to ethanol was 12 cents,
up from 11 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs declined 1 cent to 25 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 2 cents to 32 cents, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 9.5 cents to $2.025
a gallon in New York, 6.5 cents to $1.76 in Chicago and 6.5
cents to $1.86 a gallon on the  Gulf Coast , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Prices dropped 5 cents to $1.90 on the West
Coast.  The West Coast’s premium to the Gulf narrowed 11.5 cents to
4 cents, while Chicago’s discount to  New York  Harbor expanded 3
cents to 26.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
