Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,
the country’s largest pension manager, reported a 1.8 percent
return in the fiscal second quarter as it raised its allocation
to real estate and infrastructure.  Investment income was C$3.3 billion ($3.15 billion) for the
three months ended Sept. 30, the Toronto-based  fund manager  said
today in a statement. Assets rose 2.1 percent to C$192.8 billion
from the same period last year.  “Investment returns were consistent with the expected
performance of a balanced portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Wiseman  said in the statement. “We continue to diversify
the portfolio and during the reporting period we made
significant investments in eight different countries.”  The fund, which manages retirement savings for 18 million
people in every province except Quebec, made its first real
estate investment in  South Korea  in the quarter, acquiring a 50
percent stake in a Gangnam district office tower owned by a unit
of Samsung Electronics Co.  It also purchased luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group LLC
with Ares Management LLC for $6 billion in September.  Canada Pension raised its investments in equities to 50.6
percent of its portfolio, or C$97.5 billion, from 49.7 percent
in the  year-ago  period. Allocation to fixed income declined to
32.3 percent from 33.5 percent. Real estate and infrastructure
investment climbed to 17.1 percent from 16.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
