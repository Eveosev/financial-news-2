Chile’s inflation rate fell below the
target range for the first time in four months in October as
traders price in further interest rate cuts.  Inflation slowed to 1.5 percent from 2 percent the month
before, the  National Institute of Statistics  said in a report
released in Santiago today, in line with analyst expectations.
In the month, prices gained 0.1 percent. Annual inflation is now
the lowest since May and the weakest in  Latin America .  Policy makers unexpectedly cut the benchmark rate by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent on Oct. 17 for the first time in 21
months citing weaker domestic demand and subdued inflation.
Inflation has remained below the mid-point of the 2 percent to 4
percent target range since June 2012. One-year swap rates imply
traders expect the key rate to drop as low as 4 percent.  A consumer spending boom may be easing, with retail sales
climbing 7 percent in September from the year earlier, compared
with 12 percent the month before. As the prospects for slower
growth mount, the central bank lowered its growth forecast for
2013 on Sept. 4 to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent from 4
percent to 5 percent citing global conditions.  Core prices, which exclude fuel and produce, rose 0.3
percent last month, the statistics agency said. Food and non-alcoholic drink costs climbed 1.8 percent, while transport
declined 1.6 percent and clothing and footwear dropped 0.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
