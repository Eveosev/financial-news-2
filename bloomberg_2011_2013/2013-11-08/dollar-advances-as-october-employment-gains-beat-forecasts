The dollar climbed to an almost two-month high after a Labor Department report showed the economy
added more jobs than forecast last month, boosting bets the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus.  The greenback gained against all of its 16 most-traded
peers except  Mexico ’s peso as payrolls grew by 204,000 in
October, versus the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
for a 120,000 advance. The euro extended its biggest two-week
decline in more than a year versus the dollar as  Standard &
Poor’s  lowered  France ’s credit rating after an interest-rate cut
in the region yesterday. The peso erased losses after policy
makers signaled the end of rate reductions.  “It’s certainly a dollar-positive headline,” Douglas Borthwick, the head of foreign exchange at Chapdelaine & Co. in
 New York , said in a phone interview. “But, one, the Fed wants
to seek growth in all the employment sectors and, two, one
economic number doesn’t make a trend. And the market knows that
very well.”  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index  rose 0.5 percent to
1,021.66 at 5 p.m. in New York. It touched 1,024.31, the highest
since Sept. 13, as it breached 200-day and 100-day moving
averages.  The dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.3367 per euro after
appreciating to $1.3296 yesterday, the strongest level since
Sept. 16. The euro added 0.6 percent to 132.42 yen. The
greenback rose 1 percent to 99.05 yen.  The common currency has dropped 3.3 percent over the past
two weeks, the biggest such slide since July 2012.  Peso, Krona  Mexico’s currency advanced as the minutes of last month’s
central-bank meeting showed policy makers, who reduced the key
interest rate to a record low 3.5 percent, said borrowing costs
below this level wouldn’t be advisable.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 13.1681 per  U.S. dollar 
after falling as much as 0.6 percent.  Sweden’s krona dropped against most of its major peers
after a report showed industrial production was unchanged in
September from a month earlier. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
had forecast a 1.3 percent increase.  The krona weakened for a second day versus the dollar,
slipping 0.9 percent to 6.5939. It fell for the first time in
five days against the euro, depreciating 0.6 percent, to 8.8151
after touching 8.8516, the weakest level since June 25.  The real fell dropped the most this week among Latin
American currencies on concern  Brazil  isn’t doing enough to curb
its  budget deficit  and as speculation mounted that Fed will
begin curtailing stimulus.  The currency slipped 0.3 percent today to 2.3133, sliding
to the weakest level since Sept. 5 and extending its  weekly
decline  to 2.6 percent.  Jobless Rate  The dollar jumped as last month’s jobs increase beat all
estimates in a survey of 91 economists, whose top prediction was
a gain of 175,000 amid the disruption of the 16-day partial
government shutdown that ended Oct. 17.  The gains followed a revised 163,000 advance in September
that was larger than initially estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The  jobless rate  rose to 7.3
percent from an almost five-year low.  “Markets will be starting to talk about December tapering
again,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in a phone interview.
“Expectation for this jobs report was subdued, but it was a
sizable surprise to the upside.”  March Taper  The Fed will maintain the level of purchases at  $85 billion
of bonds  a month until March, according to the median estimate
of 40 economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 17-18. A
survey in September forecast the first reduction would be in
December.  Analysts pushed out their projections following the
government shutdown, which they estimated reduced growth by 0.3
percentage point this quarter.  The Fed’s next policy meeting is scheduled for Dec. 17-18.  The dollar rallied the most on an intraday basis against
the euro since December 2011 yesterday after the  European
Central Bank  cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a record low
0.25 percent as a drop in inflation to the slowest pace in four
years threatened its mission to keep prices stable.  The greenback extended gains after gross domestic product
rose 2.8 percent on an annualized basis for the July to
September period, topping the 2 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey, the Commerce Department said yesterday.  Euro Sinks  The euro declined today as S&P downgraded France to AA from
AA+ with a stable outlook, saying the government’s reform of
tax, labor markets, products and services won’t raise medium-term growth prospects.  The euro will drop to $1.33 against the greenback before
the end of 2013, and will depreciate further to $1.32 by the end
of the first quarter, according to the median estimate of 81
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Volume in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options on the
dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $16 billion today, the
largest share of currency trades at 27 percent, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. The total was 98 percent more
than the average trading for the pair for the past five Fridays
at a similar time.  Options on the euro-dollar rate totaled $11 billion, or 18
percent of the total, with trading in the pair 54 percent more
than average. Total options trading was $58 billion today, from
$55 billion yesterday.  Europe ’s single currency has gained 5.5 percent this year,
the best performer among 10 developed-market peers tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has fallen 10
percent, the biggest decliner, while the dollar has gained 4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
