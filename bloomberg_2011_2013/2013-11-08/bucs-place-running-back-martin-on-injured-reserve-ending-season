The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed Doug
Martin on injured reserve, ending the Pro Bowl running back’s
 National Football League  season, according to an e-mailed
release.  Martin, 24, who rushed for 90.9 yards per game last season
to rank fifth in the NFL, injured his shoulder Oct. 20 against
the  Atlanta Falcons . NFL Network reported that Martin tore his
labrum.  Taken in the first round of the 2012 NFL draft, Martin
started all 16 games during his rookie season, recording 1,926
yards from scrimmage, third most in the NFL. He started six
games this year, carrying the ball 127 times for 456 yards and
one score for the winless Bucs (0-8).  Rookie running back Mike James has started in Martin’s
absence.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
