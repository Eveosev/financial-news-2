Copper analysts are the most bullish
in eight months, joining  hedge funds  betting prices will gain on
stronger demand from China, the biggest buyer.  Eighteen analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  expect prices
to rise next week, seven are bearish and seven neutral, the
largest proportion of bulls since March 8. Money managers and
other speculators held a net-long position of 10,297 contracts
on Oct. 29 after betting on lower prices as recently as
September, the latest U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show. They were bearish from February to August.  Chinese manufacturing rose more than analysts estimated to
an 18-month high in October and refined copper imports jumped to
the most since February 2012 in September. Global stockpiles
tracked by bourses in London, New York and  Shanghai  are the
smallest in almost nine months, at a time when  Europe  is
recovering from recession and the  Federal Reserve  is delaying a
cut in stimulus to bolster economic growth.  “The strength in Chinese apparent demand has taken
everyone by surprise,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst at Barclays
Plc in London who has covered metals for more than a decade.
“Chinese imports could stay quite strong.”  Copper fell 10 percent to $7,110 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange this year. Prices rose 8.2 percent in the three
months through September, the most in six quarters. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities declined 6.4 percent since
the start of January and the MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities gained 15 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index lost 2 percent.  Metal Warehouses  Inventories in warehouses monitored by the three bourses
dropped 29 percent since June to 666,087 tons, the lowest since
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Orders to
withdraw copper from LME-tracked warehouses, known as canceled
warrants, rose 14 percent since Oct. 18, indicating demand may
be strengthening.  As global stockpiles fell,  China  increased imports in four
of the five months through September. Refined copper shipments
into the nation gained 32 percent from a month earlier in
September, the most since 2010, customs data show. The country’s
purchases may remain high in the next few months as looser bank
policy makes it easier to obtain credit for trade, Barclays said
in a Nov. 1 report.  Chinese Manufacturing  The Asian nation’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose
to 51.4 last month from 51.1 in September, government data
showed Nov. 1. That was more than the 51.2 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts. China accounts for 43 percent
of global copper consumption, Europe uses 17 percent and  North
America  11 percent, Barclays estimates.  China’s economy  will expand 7.4 percent in 2014, economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. While that will be the
lowest since 1990, it’s more than double U.S. growth, which will
accelerate to 2.6 percent in 2014 from 1.6 percent this year.
The euro area will expand next year after contracting this year
and last, economists predict.  There are still risks the global recovery will be weaker
than expected and the Fed said last week that the $85 billion
monthly bond purchases will continue because it needs to see
more evidence of sustained economic improvement.  There may be enough metal to meet increased demand, with
Barclays predicting that supply will outpace consumption by
407,000 tons this quarter, compared with a 636,000-ton shortfall
in the previous six months. The glut will total 193,000 tons in
2014, from a 63,000-ton deficit this year, the bank says.  Production Expanding  Production will rise 5 percent next year after producers
from Mongolia to  Indonesia  to  Chile  responded to prices that
surged in the past decade by adding new mines or expanding
existing pits. Codelco, the world’s biggest producer, said last
month it plans to invest $4 billion to $5 billion annually in
the next five years to boost output.  Copper is trading 30 percent below the record $10,190 set
in February 2011 and prices will fall to $6,600 in three months,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts.  Eight of 12 people surveyed expect raw sugar to fall next
week and three were bullish. The commodity lost 7.8 percent to
17.98 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  this year.  Twelve of 21 people surveyed anticipate lower corn prices
and eight said the grain will rise, while nine of 21 said
soybeans will gain and seven expect lower prices. Eleven
predicted losses in wheat and nine were bullish.  Grain Prices  Corn fell 40 percent to $4.1925 a bushel this year in
 Chicago . Soybeans slid 10 percent to $12.69 a bushel, as wheat
declined 16 percent to $6.5175 a bushel.  Sixteen of 32 surveyed said gold will advance next week, 11
were bearish and five neutral. The metal slumped 23 percent to
$1,282.58 an ounce in London this year, set for the first annual
decline in 13 years as some investors lost faith in the metal as
a store of value.  The S&P GSCI gauge of raw materials fell to a four-month
low yesterday, while global equities are trading 2.1 percent
below a more than five-year high reached Oct. 30. Copper,
aluminum, lead and nickel production will rise by at least 3.2
percent next year, Barclays estimates.  “A U.S. recovery and stabilization in China is going to
provide some support,” said Gary Clark, a commodities
strategist at Roubini Global Economics in  London . “You’re
getting these upward bumps on the back of macro data, but the
underlying fundamental driver is rising supply. Commodities are
moving towards a kind of fair value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
