Bank of America Corp.  asked a federal
court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the U.S. that accuses the
lender of misleading investors about the quality of loans
backing $850 million in securities.  The government failed to meet the requirements for suing
under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act, the bank said in a filing today in federal
court in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina . That law is being put to use
by prosecutors to bring mortgage cases against lenders.  “After a three-year investigation the complaint lacks even
a single factual allegation suggesting that any bank employee
took any affirmative step to conceal facts” about the
securities, the bank said.  The government’s complaint, filed in August, chronicles
friction among bank staff in 2007 and 2008 as they excluded
risky “Alt-A” loans while leaving in wholesale debts once
scorned as “toxic waste” by the firm’s then-chief.  According to the complaint, an employee of the Charlotte-based lender sent an e-mail to a trader and others expressing
frustration over efforts to add poor-quality mortgages to the
pool backing securities at issue in the case.  Referencing the substandard mortgages, he wrote “like a
fat kid in dodgeball, these need to stay on the sidelines,”
according to the filing.  The case is U.S. v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , 13-cv-00446,
U.S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina
(Charlotte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
