Anne Marieke Ezendam, a senior
health-care analyst at ING Investment Management Europe, has
been hired as a portfolio manager at Amundi Asset Management,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Ezendam, currently based in the  Hague , Netherlands, will
focus on investments in global health-care companies and will
relocate to Amundi’s London office before starting the role in
January, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
an announcement hasn’t been made.  Paris-based Amundi, the combined investment arm of  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , oversees $1 trillion.  A spokeswoman at Amundi declined to comment. A call and e-mail to an ING spokesman was not immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
