Vitruvian Partners LLP, a U.K.
private-equity firm, plans to secure at least 700 million pounds
($1.1 billion) in the first phase of fundraising for its latest
Northern European fund, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  Vitruvian Investment Partnership II, which started
marketing in the second quarter of this year with an 800
million-pound goal and 1 billion-pound limit, will probably
conclude the first round of fundraising in about a week, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because talks with
investors are private.  At a time that investors are cutting down on their
relationships, 31 buyout funds finished fundraising in the third
quarter of 2013 globally, securing $27.9 billion, down from the
$57.5 billion in the previous quarter, according to London-based
data provider Preqin Ltd. The average time a firm spends raising
a fund is now 18.4 months, compared with 17.8 months in 2012 and
11.3 months in 2006, Preqin said.  Park Hill Group LLC, the placement agent arm of New York-based Blackstone Group LP, is helping raise the money. Officials
at Park Hill and London-based Vitruvian declined to comment on
fundraising.  The firmâ€™s new fund will have the same strategy as a prior
vehicle, making middle-market growth and buyout investments in
Northern Europe. That earlier fund, Vitruvian Investment
Partnership, gathered 925 million euros in 2008.  Vitruvian typically invests 15 million euros to 150 million
euros in companies with enterprise values of 50 million euros to
500 million euros, according to its website. The firm prefers
less capital-intensive industries such as media,  information
technology , telecommunications, financial services, business
services, health care and leisure, the website shows.  The firm in July purchased the energy division of Cinven
Partners LLP-backed EnServe Group Ltd. The unit, called Inenco
Group Ltd., provides energy and risk-management services to
EnServe clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
