Nordecon AS, Estonia’s second-biggest
construction company, rose the most in two years after its
third-quarter profit more than doubled.  The stock rose as much as 7.9 percent and traded up 3
percent at 1.04 euros at 1 p.m. in Tallinn, valuing the company
at 32 million euros ($43 million). Volume of 33,367 shares was
10 times the three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 4.4 million
euros in July-September, from 2.1 million euros in the same
period of 2012, Nordecon said in a statement after trading
yesterday. It attributed the gain to improved efficiency as
project completions pushed sales up 9.4 percent from the year-earlier quarter to 59 million euros.  “Cost-control measures continue to yield strong results,”
the company said. “Margin improvements have also been supported
by the external environment,” it said, citing lower-than-forecast outlays for materials and subcontractors.  Nordecon’s net margin, a measure of profitability showing
the average net income generated for each unit of sales, rose to
7.4 percent in July-September, compared with 2.9 percent in
April-May and 3.9 percent in the third quarter last year.  The company cut third-quarter administrative costs by 14
percent from the year-ago period, while lower project expenses
lifted its gross margin to 10.4 percent from 7.1 percent,
according to data in the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
