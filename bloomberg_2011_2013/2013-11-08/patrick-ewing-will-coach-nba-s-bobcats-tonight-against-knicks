Charlotte assistant  Patrick Ewing , a
Hall of Fame player who spent the majority of his basketball
career with the New York Knicks, made his head coaching debut in
the Bobcats’ 101-91 loss against his former team.  He filled in last night for Steve Clifford, who had two
stents placed in his heart after suffering chest pains while at
dinner two nights ago, the Bobcats said in an e-mailed
statement. He is resting comfortably, the team said.  Ewing was taken by the Knicks with the first overall pick
in the 1985 draft out of Georgetown University. He spent 15 of
his 17 seasons playing for the Knicks. He has never been a head
coach.  The Bobcats, who hosted last night’s game, are owned by
Hall of Fame player  Michael Jordan .  In last night’s game, Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks (2-3)
with 28 points followed by Andrea Bargnani with 25 points and
 Raymond Felton  with 15 at Time Warner Cable Arena. New York had
a 51-47 halftime advantage.  Kemba Walker  had 25 points for the Bobcats (3-3), Gerald Henderson added 18 and Ramon Sessions came off the bench to
score 15 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
