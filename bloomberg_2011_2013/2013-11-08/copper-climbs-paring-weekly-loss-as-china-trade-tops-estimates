Copper rose for a second day,
trimming a weekly decline, as  China ’s trade data beat estimates,
underpinning sustained appetite from the world’s biggest
consumer of industrial metals.  The contract for delivery in three months rose as much as
0.5 percent to $7,179.25 a metric ton and was at $7,167 at 11:09
a.m. in  Shanghai . The metal fell 1.1 percent this week, the
biggest decline since the five days through Sept. 13.  China’s exports rose 5.6 percent in October from a year
earlier, compared with the median estimate for a 1.7 percent
gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 44 analysts and September’s
0.3 percent drop. Imports increased 7.6 percent, exceeding the
median forecast for a 7.4 percent gain and a 7.4 percent growth
in September. A trade surplus was at $31.1 billion.  “Some investors might be buying the metal on a positive
outlook on Chinese imports,” said Sijin Cheng, an analyst at
Barclays Plc in  Singapore .  China’s copper purchases may remain high in the next few
months as a looser bank policy makes it easier for importers to
obtain credit for trade, Cheng said in a Nov. 1 report.  Futures for delivery in December increased 0.3 percent to
$3.259 a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal for delivery
in January on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 0.3 percent
to 51,630  yuan  ($8,475) a ton.  On the LME, zinc, nickel and aluminum also rose, while tin
and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
