Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , the
Rio Tinto Group unit that produces copper in Mongolia, said it
will restate three years of financial results after a subsidiary
decided to change the way it recognizes revenue.  Turquoise Hill will restate results for 2010 through 2012
and part of this year, the Vancouver-based company said
yesterday in a statement.  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , in which Turquoise Hill has a 58
percent stake, will resubmit financial statements for the last
three years. It determined that some of its revenue was
incorrectly classified after a review in conjunction with
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and SouthGobi auditor Deloitte LLP,
it said in a separate statement yesterday. Vancouver-based
SouthGobi also said its third-quarter results will be delayed.  SouthGobi, which produces coal at the Ovoot Tolgoi mine in
Mongolia, said some sales were booked after the commodity was
delivered to the customer’s stockpile at the mine. The
restatement will reflect the recognition of revenue after the
coal is loaded onto the customer’s trucks.  SouthGobi dropped 11 percent to C$1.07 yesterday in Toronto
while Turquoise Hill fell 3 percent to C$4.93.  Turquoise Hill, which operates the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine
in Mongolia, is 51 percent-owned by London-based Rio, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
