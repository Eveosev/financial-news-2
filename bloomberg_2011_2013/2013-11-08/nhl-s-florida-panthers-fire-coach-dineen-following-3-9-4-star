The Florida Panthers fired head coach
Kevin Dineen and assistants Gord Murphy and Craig Ramsay after
starting the season 3-9-4.  The National Hockey League team says Peter Horachek will
take over as the Panthers interim coach and Brian Skrudland and
John Madden will join the team as assistants.  “After 16 games, it was clear that our team needed a
change in philosophy and direction,” Panthers General Manager
Dale Tallon said in a  press release  on the team’s website. “We
have not met the expectations that we set forth at training
camp, and it is my responsibility to make the necessary changes
to ensure that our club performs at its maximum potential.”  The Panthers are seventh in the Eastern Conference’s eight-team Atlantic Division with 10 points. Dineen has coached the
Panthers since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
