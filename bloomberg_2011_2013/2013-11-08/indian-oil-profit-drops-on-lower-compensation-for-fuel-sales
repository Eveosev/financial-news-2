Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s
biggest refiner, reported a 83 percent decline in second-quarter
profit after it received lower compensation from the government
for selling fuels below cost.  Net income  fell to 16.8 billion rupees ($268 million) in
the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 96.1 billion rupees a
year earlier, according to a stock exchange filing today. Sales
rose 3.8 percent to 1.1 trillion rupees.  The lower profit may hurt the government’s chances of
attracting a high price for shares it plans to sell in Indian
Oil to help narrow its budget deficit to a six-year low. The
sale of a 10 percent stake in the refiner may take place by the
end of this month, Petroleum Secretary Vivek Rae said Oct. 4.  Indian Oil  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 213.30 rupees at the
close in Mumbai. They have slumped 21 percent this year,
compared with a 6.4 percent advance in the benchmark  S&P BSE
Sensex. (SENSEX)   Indian Oil and its state-run rivals  Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) 
and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL)  depend on cash compensation from
the federal government and discounts on crude oil from  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  and Oil India Ltd. for profit. They sell
diesel, kerosene and cooking gas below the cost of production to
help curb inflation for the nation’s 1.2 billion people.  Indian Oil received 92.4 billion rupees as subsidy from the
government in the quarter, compared with 160.9 billion rupees a
year earlier, according to the statement.  The rupee’s 5.2 percent drop in the period also lowered
Indian Oil’s profit. The refiner imports about 80 percent of its
crude oil requirement and pays for it in dollars. A weaker rupee
means it has to convert more of the local currency to dollars.  India ’s government is targeting cutting the  fiscal deficit 
to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year ending
March 31, the lowest since the 12 months ended March 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
