Rafael Nadal  maintained his perfect
start at the season finale of men’s tennis while Stanislas Wawrinka made it two wins out of three to join the Spaniard in
the semifinals.  Top-ranked Nadal beat Tomas Berdych 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in his
final Group A match at the ATP World Tour Finals at London’s O2
arena, ending the Czech player’s tournament. Earlier in the day
seventh seed Wawrinka sent Spain’s  David Ferrer  his third loss
with a 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-1 victory. Wawrinka had to wait for
Nadal’s win to guarantee his spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
