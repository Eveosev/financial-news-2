Heraeus Holding GmbH hired Kevin Crisp from Deutsche Bank AG as senior vice president of global
sales for precious metals.  He joined Nov. 5 and will spend most of the time in Hanau,
 Germany , where the company is based, Heraeus said in an e-mailed
statement today. Crisp, who was previously a director of
precious metals at Deutsche Bank in London, will report to Hans-Gunter Ritter and Andre Christl, both managing directors.  Prior to Deutsche Bank, Crisp was deputy general manager at
Mitsubishi Corporation International ( Europe ) Plc, covering
precious metals in Europe and the  Middle East , Heraeus said. He
was chairman of the  London Bullion Market Association  from 2009
to 2011 and sat on the London Platinum and Palladium Market
management committee. Heâ€™s also worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the statement.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment.  Heraeus has been family owned for more than 160 years,
according to its website. Its businesses include trading
precious metals, manufacturing products from those materials and
production of medical biomaterials.  Gold dropped 23 percent to $1,293.10 an ounce in  London
