U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
relative to futures to a nine-day high as refineries operated by
Citgo Petroleum Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc. and  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  reported shutdowns or faults.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  in the region advanced
0.75 cent to 20.5 cents a gallon below New York Mercantile
Exchange futures at 2:02 p.m., the strongest level since Oct.
28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,  rose  0.12 cent to 21.13 cents a gallon
below futures.  Citgo said it halted a reformer following a fire at its
 Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery , and Exxon said it planned to
flare yesterday because of a unit shutdown at the Chalmette
plant, also in  Louisiana . Shellâ€™s Deer Park,  Texas , site
discovered a leak on a pump this week, according to  the company ,
which declined to provide the status of the unit.  The three sites have a combined capacity of 980,700 barrels
a day, or about 11 percent of U.S. Gulf Coast refining volume,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the Energy
Information Administration.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the region, a measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas Intermediate
oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , added $1.21 to $9.93 a barrel, a
second consecutive gain, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The
same spread  based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil, the Gulf Coast
benchmark, rose 56 cents to $6.03 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
