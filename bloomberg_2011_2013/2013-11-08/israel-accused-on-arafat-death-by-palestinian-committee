The head of the Palestinian panel
investigating the death of Yasser Arafat blamed  Israel  for his
poisoning and vowed to find out exactly what happened.  “We can confirm that Arafat did not die because of age or
disease, he did not die a natural death,” Tawfiq Tirawi said at
a news conference in Ramallah in the West Bank today. “We say
again Israel is the only one involved in this.” He said the
panel would approach the United Nations once its inquiries were
complete.  A Swiss team that examined remains of the longtime
Palestinian leader said yesterday its findings “moderately
support” the hypothesis he was poisoned with polonium, while
noting that the results were not definitive. An Israeli
government spokesman called the report more “soap opera than
science.”  Arafat died on Nov. 11, 2004, at the age of 75. His remains
were exhumed at the end of 2012 after his wife, Suha, requested
an autopsy to search for traces of poison. Palestinian groups
have previously accused Israel of causing Arafat’s death, though
they haven’t backed up that accusation with conclusive evidence.
Israel denies killing him.  A similar medical report released by Russia’s Federal
Medical-Biological Agency last month uncovered no trace of
polonium in Arafat’s remains, the Interfax new agency reported
on Oct. 16, citing the head of the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
