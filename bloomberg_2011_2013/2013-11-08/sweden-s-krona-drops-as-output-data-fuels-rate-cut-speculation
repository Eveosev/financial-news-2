Sweden’s krona dropped after a report
showed industrial production stagnated in September from a month
earlier, boosting speculation that the nation’s central bank
will cut  interest rates  to stimulate the economy.  The krona fell against 14 of its 16 major peers, touching
the weakest level in more than four months versus the euro.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 1.3 percent
increase in output. The Riksbank last month pushed back the
timing of its first rate increase to support growth. Norway’s
krone tumbled to a three-year low against the euro.  The weak data “will fuel speculation that the Riksbank
will have to cut rates,” Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of
foreign-exchange research at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen,
wrote in an e-mailed report. “Needless to say that this is
negative for the Swedish krona.”  The krona fell for the first time in five days against the
euro, depreciating 0.5 percent to 8.8085 at 2:35 p.m.  London 
time. It earlier reached 8.8516, the weakest level since June
25. Sweden’s currency slid 0.9 percent to 6.5921 per dollar. The
two-year note yield was little changed at 0.97 percent.  Norway’s krone fell 1.1 percent to 8.2022 per euro, after
touching 8.2318, the weakest level since October 2010. It
declined 1.5 percent to 6.1367 versus the dollar, headed for a
weekly drop of 2.7 percent.  The krona has tumbled 1.3 percent in the past month, the
second-worst performer among 10 developed-market peers tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the krone, which
slid 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
