Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY)  didn’t breach its
obligations to try to resolve disputes with a U.S. labor union
in its stalled acquisition of Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.  Apollo had cited labor disputes at Cooper as a reason for
asking to lower the price of the deal. Cooper accused Apollo of
intentionally delaying the transaction.  “There’s no evidence that Apollo acted in bad faith” in
trying to negotiate a contract with the United Steelworkers
Union,  Delaware  Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III said
today after closing arguments in Georgetown, Delaware.  Glasscock said he would try to rule on the main issue --
whether Apollo must complete the buyout of Cooper -- by Nov. 13,
the date after which Apollo’s financing may be in jeopardy.  The hearing is continuing.  The case is  Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB)  v. Apollo Holdings Pvt
Ltd., CA8980, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
