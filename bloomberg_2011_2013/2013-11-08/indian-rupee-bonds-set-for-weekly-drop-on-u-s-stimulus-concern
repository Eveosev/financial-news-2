India ’s rupee and bonds headed for
the biggest weekly loss in more than two months on concern the
U.S. will pare stimulus earlier than anticipated, damping demand
for emerging-market assets.  Government data yesterday showed the world’s largest
economy expanded at a faster pace than estimated last quarter,
and an employment report today is predicted to show the U.S.
added 120,000 jobs last month. Another negative for the rupee is
the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to cut direct dollar
supplies to oil refiners, according to a research note by Credit
Agricole CIB strategist Dariusz Kowalczyk. That pressures the
currency as the nation runs a current-account deficit.  “India is definitely not one of the better fundamental
countries,” Ilan Solot, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co. in  London , said yesterday. “In a period of risk aversion,
the rupee is probably one of the top currencies to be sold.”  The rupee fell 1.5 percent this week and 0.4 percent today
to 62.6550 per dollar as of 10:13 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 62.74,
the lowest level since Sept. 30. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 203 basis points, or 2.03 percentage points, from
Nov. 1 to 12.25 percent.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
advanced 18 basis points this week to 8.88 percent, according to
prices from the central bank’s trading system. The rate climbed
three basis points today and is at its highest since Aug. 28.  The Reserve Bank of India has reduced direct dollar
supplies to oil refiners by 30 percent to 40 percent, Economic
Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram told CNBC TV-18 yesterday.  Credit Rating  India’s credit rating may be cut to junk next year unless
elections due by May lead to a government capable of reviving
economic expansion, Standard & Poor’s said in a statement
yesterday. S&P expects to review the rating in 2014 after
assessing the next government’s plans and could demote the
nation if “policy drift” continues, it said, while reaffirming
India at BBB-, the lowest investment grade, with a negative
outlook.  India is scheduled to auction 150 billion rupees of bonds
maturing in 2019, 2023, 2032 and 2042 today. U.S. data is today
projected to show the unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent from
7.2 percent. The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annualized
rate last quarter, exceeding the median of economists’ forecasts
for 2 percent growth.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.1 percent to
64.09 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 0.2 percent to 64.42. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
