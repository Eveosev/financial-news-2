Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index completing its longest streak of weekly losses
in five months, after faster U.S. economic growth fueled concern
the  Federal Reserve  may reduce stimulus sooner than expected.  Sony Corp., a TV maker that gets 68 percent of sales
outside  Japan , lost 2.7 percent after the yen’s surge against
the dollar yesterday weighed on Japanese exporters.  Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  sank 4.2 percent after Teck Resources Ltd.
sold a stake worth about A$500 million ($473 million) in
Australia’s third-biggest iron-ore exporter. Samsung Electronics
Co. preferred shares declined 5 percent in  Seoul  after Citigroup
Inc. managed the sale of a $350 million stake in the electronics
manufacturer.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 0.4 percent to 139.72
as of 8:44 p.m. in  Tokyo , extending this week’s retreat to 1.1
percent and capping a three-week loss. About three shares
declined for every one that rose. The gauge has gained 8 percent
so far this year amid unprecedented stimulus from the  Bank of
Japan  and optimism the Fed will continue its bond buying into
2014.  “The stronger GDP data has led some to believe that the
Fed will start tapering a bit earlier than they otherwise
thought,” Keith Poore, head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd. in Wellington, which manages about $130
billion, said by telephone. “Payrolls is going to be a messy
number because of the impact of the shutdown. The market has got
ahead of earnings, so we shouldn’t be surprised to see a little
bit of weakness,” he said, referring to last month’s partial
closure of the U.S. government.  U.S. Payrolls  Investors’ focus now shifts to today’s U.S.  payrolls
report for October after data yesterday showed growth in the
world’s biggest economy accelerated to a 2.8 percent annualized
rate last quarter, faster than the 2 percent median estimate of
economists, and the  European Central Bank  unexpectedly cut
interest rates.  Japan’s Topix index fell 0.7 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slid 0.4 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
added 0.6 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index dropped 1 percent.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.6 percent and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite fell 1.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times
Index declined 0.8 percent. Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  retreated 0.7
percent.  Economists predict a report today will show U.S. payrolls
climbed by 120,000 in October and the  unemployment rate 
increased to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in the previous month.  Of the companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that have
reported quarterly results this season and for which Bloomberg
compiles estimates, about half  exceeded  analysts’ projections on
profit and revenue.  Relative Value  The Asia-Pacific gauge climbed the past two months, pushing
valuations on the measure to 13.5 times  estimated earnings , up
from a multiple of 12.7 at the end of August, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a current multiple of
15.8 for the  S&P 500  and 14.9 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  China’s trade surplus expanded more than forecast to $31.1
billion last month from $15.21 billion in September. Exports
grew 5.6 percent after contracting last month.  China releases reports on industrial production, inflation
and retail sales tomorrow, with factory output growth projected
to have slowed to 10 percent in October from a year earlier.  China Reform  A meeting of China’s leaders begins tomorrow in Beijing
through Nov. 12 to map out a blueprint for economic reform.  The S&P 500 dropped 1.3 percent yesterday, its biggest loss
in two months, after the GDP report. Still, the data showed the
biggest gain in inventories since the beginning of 2012, which
risks holding back the economy this quarter as companies limit
production.  The benchmark of American equities has rallied 23 percent
this year, challenging 2009 for the best annual gain in a
decade, as  corporate earnings  beat estimates and the central
bank kept  interest rates  low to spur economic growth.  The yen maintained gains, trading at 98.18 per dollar as of
5:31 p.m. in Tokyo, after the surprise decision by the ECB to
cut interest rates. A stronger yen reduces the overseas income
of Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Sony lost 2.7 percent to 1,649 yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the
maker of Viera televisions, declined 2.6 percent to 994 yen.
Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, fell 1.1 percent to
6,200 yen. Honda Motor Co. slid 0.8 percent to 3,870 yen.  Fortescue lost 4.2 percent to A$5.46. CIMB Group Holdings
Bhd. sold about 91 million Fortescue shares at A$5.50 each on
behalf of Teck, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Samsung, Dena  Samsung Electronics preferred shares fell 5 percent to
985,000 won in Seoul. Citigroup Inc. managed the sale of about
$350 million of preferred shares at 975,000 won each, according
to terms of the sale obtained by  Bloomberg News .  DeNA Co. (2432)  slumped 11 percent to 1,840 yen after the social-media website operator reported a larger than forecast decline
in second-quarter profit.  China Cosco Holdings Co. dropped 5 percent to HK$3.58 in
Hong Kong, the most in more than four months, after the nation’s
largest shipping company said an  executive director  is under
investigation by a regulatory body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
