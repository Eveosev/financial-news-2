Zions Bancorp (ZION)  and  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF)  led gains in the KBW Bank Index after a bigger-than-estimated jump in payrolls signaled an improving U.S. economy.  Zions, the Salt Lake City-based lender, climbed 4.1 percent
to $29.40 at 11:49 a.m. in New York, the most intraday since
July. Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions rose 4 percent to $9.63,
its largest gain since June. The 24-company index  increased  2.8
percent.  U.S. employers added 204,000 workers to payrolls in
October, surpassing the 120,000-employee median estimate of 91
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The figures indicate companies
adhered to hiring plans and that the world’s largest economy
weathered the impact of a 16-day government shutdown.  “It is largely based on that jobs number,” R. Scott Siefers, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a
phone interview. “The group has underperformed the last few
months, so there’s an element of catch up, and anything that
would show some sort of strength in the economy is good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
