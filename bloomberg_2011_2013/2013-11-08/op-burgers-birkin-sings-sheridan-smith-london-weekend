Tracey Emin ’s sketch of the Queen, a  Jane Birkin  concert, Sheridan Smith, and burger bargains are our choices for London this weekend.  STAGE  You have a week left to see Sheridan Smith in a hippie version of “A Midsummer Night’s  Dream .”  Best known for roles in “Legally Blonde” and “Hedda Gabler,” the actress now  plays  the pink-haired Queen of the Fairies, Titania. The characters in Michael Grandage’s staging smoke pot, wear shades and cheerily cavort in a 1960s commune.  Ends Nov. 16 at the Noel Coward Theatre. Information:  http://www.michaelgrandagecompany.com  or +44-844-482-5141.  DINING  Burger & Lobster this week opened a new branch on the Fifth Floor of Harvey Nichols. Shoppers at the department store can at least save money on eating: A whole lobster costs just 20 pounds ($32), including a salad. A new option for Knightsbridge menu is the California burger, where iceberg lettuce replaces the bun. Information:  http://www.burgerandlobster.com/ .  VISUAL ARTS  The Queen got a gift from the cross-dressing artist  Grayson Perry  last year: the sketch of a motorcycle he designed. It’s one of more than 100 works given by Royal Academicians for her 60th year on the throne -- all on view at the Queen’s Gallery.  The best is  Anish Kapoor ’s blood-red gouache. Tracey Emin’s monoprint of a crowned Elizabeth isn’t bad either, if only she hadn’t misspelled Britannia at the bottom of the work (an error that the plaque and catalog have faithfully reproduced).  “Gifted” is at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace:  http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/  or +44-20-7766-7300.  MUSIC  Birkin performs ex-boyfriend  Serge Gainsbourg ’s tunes -- to Arabic-style arrangements -- at the  Barbican  Saturday:  http://www.barbican.org  or +44-7638-8891.  Steve Reich  is at the Southbank Centre on Sunday for a question-and-answer session followed by a concert.  The composer’s “Clapping Music” starts the Royal Festival Hall event. Reich is back in the news after this applause piece inspired  David Bowie ’s latest track, the ten-minute “Love Is Lost,” the best rock release of the week.  http://bit.ly/161PJ9W   OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  The  Natural History Museum ’s vast ice rink is open for business in the run-up to the holidays, with skates for hire and a pop-up cafe:  http://www.nhm.ac.uk  or +44-20-7942-5000.  Also open is the  rink in Canary Wharf , fitted between tall corporate towers, which claims to be bigger than the ones at either Somerset House or the Tower of London.
