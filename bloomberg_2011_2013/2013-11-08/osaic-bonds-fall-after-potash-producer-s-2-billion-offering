Bonds of  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  fell a day after
a $2 billion offering by the largest U.S. producer of potash and
phosphate fertilizer.  The company’s $600 million of 5.625 percent securities due
November 2043 fell 1.07 cents from the issue price to 98.84
cents on the dollar, yielding 5.71 percent at 2:32 p.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The extra yield
investors demand to own the debt instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries narrowed to 182.7 basis points from 188 at issuance.  The debt, part of Mosaic’s first offering since October
2011, was issued at a discount of 99.91 cents on the dollar and
rose to as high as 101.37 cents in initial trading yesterday,
Trace data show.  The company’s $900 million of 4.25 percent securities due
November 2023 fell 0.56 cent from the issue price to 99.23 cents
on the dollar to yield 4.35 percent, Trace data show.  Mosaic, based in Plymouth,  Minnesota , will use proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures,
share buybacks or dividend increases, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
