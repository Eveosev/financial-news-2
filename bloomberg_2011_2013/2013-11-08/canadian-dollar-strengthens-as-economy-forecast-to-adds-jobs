The Canadian dollar rose against the
majority of its most-traded peers before a report forecast to
show the country added jobs in October for the third straight
month.  The currency rose against its U.S. peer before a separate
report expected to show American job growth slowed in October
amid a 16-day government shutdown brought about by a political
impasse in  Washington . The  Federal Reserve  has said it will only
slow its monetary stimulus program, which benefits riskier
assets like the Canadian dollar, once it sees sustainable
improvement in the job market.  “Canada will react to both the U.S. number and the
Canadian number and it will be a relative value proposition for
the Canadian dollar,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of
foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada , by phone from
Toronto. “It’s going to react more to the U.S. number than its
own number, unless there’s a huge, meaningful miss or beat.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at
$1.0463 per  U.S. dollar  at 8 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys
95.58 U.S. cents.  Canada created 11,000  jobs  in October after adding 11,900
the previous month, according to the median estimate of a
Bloomberg survey of 22 economists. The  unemployment rate  is
expected to rise to 7 percent from 6.9 percent.  The U.S. added 120,000 jobs from 148,000 the previous
month, a separate survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
