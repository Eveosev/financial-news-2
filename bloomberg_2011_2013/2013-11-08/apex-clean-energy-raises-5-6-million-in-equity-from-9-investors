Apex Clean Energy Inc., a
Charlottesville, Virginia-based developer of wind power, raised
$5.6 million in equity from nine investors, according to a
regulatory filing.  Apex is seeking to raise as much as $25 million in the
funding round, according to the  filing  today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Dahvi Wilson, a company
spokeswoman, had no immediate comment.  The company announced Nov. 6 an agreement to sell 200
megawatts of capacity to Westar Energy Inc. from a wind farm
it’s developing in northern  Oklahoma . Apex agreed last month to
sell 200 megawatts of capacity to American Electric Power Co.
from another Oklahoma project that’s expected to begin
operations in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
