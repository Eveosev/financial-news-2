Tokyo  Commodity Exchange Inc. plans
to offer trading in oil and liquefied natural gas swaps in a
venture with Ginga Petroleum Inc. by March next year.  Tocom, as the exchange is known, plans over-the-counter
derivatives trading in crude oil, gasoline, kerosene and gasoil
to boost futures transactions in the four commodities listed at
the bourse, Hiroshi Yamaoka, an official at the exchange, said
by phone from Tokyo today.  “After offering those oil contracts, we will work on
adding LNG swaps trading to our platform,” Yamaoka said.
“Trading will be done on a bulletin-board-type screen with a
voice broking function by phone.”  The start of swaps trading may be followed by the world’s
first LNG futures contract planned by Japan’s Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry. The government wants to list LNG
futures at the exchange in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015
as it seeks to lower the import cost of the supercooled fuel by
providing an alternative benchmark to traditionally used oil.  The country’s largest commodity-futures exchange and Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte., an energy broker, will set up a joint
venture to operate the swaps trading, Yamaoka said. Tocom will
hold 40 percent of the company’s equity, while Ginga will hold
60 percent. Tocom plans to expand clearing functions to over-the-counter trading at its subsidiary, Japan Commodity Clearing
House Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
