Jonathan Heathcote, a partner in
private-equity firm Palamon Capital Partners Ltd., is departing
for Stirling Square Capital Partners LLP, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Heathcote, 52, is the second executive to leave London-based Palamon this year, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private. Managing Director
Annette Wilson, head of  investor relations , left last month
after 14 years.  Palamon, led by Managing Partner Louis Elson, 50, raised
210 million euros ($281 million) in September for its latest
pool of capital compared with a 670 million-euro fund in 2006.  Heathcote, who is scheduled to depart Palamon later this
year after five years, didnâ€™t respond to e-mail requests seeking
comment. Officials at Palamon and London-based Stirling Square
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
