Corn rebounded from the lowest price
in three years after the government predicted smaller harvest
gains than analysts forecast in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter. Soybeans rose the most in eight weeks.  Farmers will collect a record 13.989 billion bushels of
corn this year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in
a report. While that’s more than the 13.843 billion predicted in
September and 30 percent above the drought-damaged harvest of
2012, it was less than the 14.029 billion expected by 36
analysts in a Bloomberg survey, on average.  The prospect of a record harvest sent prices tumbling into
a  bear market  this year and down 50 percent from the record
reached during last year’s drought, which cut output by 13
percent. Cheaper grain may boost profit for buyers including
 Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , a grain processor and maker of
ethanol, and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , a U.S. meat producer that feeds
corn to livestock.  “The crop is not as big as everyone feared, and that
provided the fodder for a rally,”  Dale Durchholz , the senior
market analyst for AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois , said
in a telephone interview. “Farmers have not been aggressively
selling this year’s crop and now they will wait for a rally.”  Corn futures for delivery in December rose 1.5 percent to
close at $4.2675 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.295, the highest for a most-active
contract since Nov. 1. Before the report, prices slid to $4.155,
the lowest since August 2010. Trading was estimated at 660,816
contracts, the highest since Nov. 9, 2010, and more than double
the 100-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rising Reserves  Domestic  corn reserves  on Aug. 31, 2014, before next year’s
harvest, will total 1.887 billion bushels, up from 1.855 billion
forecast in September, after farmers harvest a record crop this
year, the USDA said. Global inventories will jump 22 percent to
a 13-year high.  The export forecast was increased to 1.4 billion bushels,
up 14 percent from the September estimate, as lower prices for
the grain are making U.S. corn more competitive abroad, the
government said. The report was the first in two months after
the USDA canceled its October assessments because of the
government shutdown.  Soybean Rally  Soybeans rose after the government said most of the
increase projected in U.S. production will be exported,
Durchholz said.  Farmers will harvest 3.258 billion bushels this year, up
3.5 percent from 3.149 billion estimated in September and 7.4
percent more than last year’s drought-damaged crop of 3.034
billion, according to the USDA. Exports may rise 9.8 percent
from a year earlier to 1.45 billion bushels, to push total
demand for the U.S. crop to 3.243 billion.  Global  output  in the crop year that began Oct. 1 will be a
record 283.54 million tons, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier
as  Brazil  will top the U.S. as the biggest producer for the
first time, the USDA said. Worldwide inventories before next
year’s harvest will be 70.23 million tons, down from 71.54
million predicted two months earlier. Traders expected reserves
of 72.4 million, on average.  “The world can’t get enough soybeans, and that will
continue to support the market, even with record crops,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “Any kind of
hot, dry weather that threatens crops in  South America  the next
three months will boost prices.”  Soybean futures for delivery in January rose 2.3 percent to
$12.96 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest gain since Sept. 12,
when the government cut its estimate for the U.S. crop. The
oilseed jumped 3.6 percent this week, the most since the week
ended Aug. 23, when dry weather was threatening yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
