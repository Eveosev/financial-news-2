Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai swung between gains and losses before a key policy
meeting in  China  starting tomorrow that may introduce measures
to curb polluting industries.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.2 percent and
declined as much 0.4 percent before trading at 3,670  yuan  ($602)
per metric ton at 11:21 a.m. local time.  China’s Communist Party will hold its third plenary session
of  Central Committee  starting tomorrow, according to Xinhua News
Agency. The meeting is expected to unveil policies on structural
reform, including curbing inefficient steel production capacity,
according to Luzheng Futures Co.  “The market expects the government to seriously tackle the
pollution issue and those measures will spur a rebound in
rebar,” Luzheng Future’s analyst Ren Xinlei said from Jinan.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
fell 0.5 percent to 940 yuan a ton. The steel-making material
for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index lost 0.2 percent to 136.90 yuan a ton yesterday.  China imported 670 million tons of  iron ore  in the first 10
months this year, up 10 percent from a year earlier, the
country’s customs agency said today.  The  spot price  of rebar gained 0.1 percent to 3,555 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
