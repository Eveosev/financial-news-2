Britain’s  trade gap  widened to the
most in more than a year in the third quarter as imports rose to
a record, holding back the economic recovery.  The total deficit widened to 9.72 billion pounds from 5.46
billion pounds in the three months through June, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in  London . Exports fell 3.5
percent and imports increased 1 percent to a record 135 billion
pounds. A separate report showed  construction  rose 1.7 percent
in the quarter, less than the 2.5 percent previously estimated.  Britain’s  economic growth  accelerated to 0.8 percent in the
third quarter from 0.7 percent, according to a preliminary
estimate last month from the statistics office. It will publish
a second estimate of gross domestic product on Nov. 27 and said
today the construction revision has a 0.04 percentage point
impact on the data. That report will also quantify the negative
contribution from net trade on GDP.  The trade report also showed that imports of goods from the
European Union increased to a record 55.2 billion pounds in the
third quarter, increasing the deficit with the bloc to its
widest since the ONS began the data in 1998.  In September, the  goods trade deficit  widened to 9.82
billion pounds from 9.56 billion pounds in August, the ONS said.
Exports declined 0.7 percent and imports rose 0.2 percent. The
surplus on service widened to 6.55 billion pounds from 6.31
billion pounds, leaving the total  trade gap  at 3.27 billion
pounds.  The ONS said construction fell 0.9 percent in September
from August, when it rose 0.1 percent. From a year earlier,
construction was up 5.8 percent since March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
