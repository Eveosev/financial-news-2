Soybean output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer, will be larger than the government
forecast in September after rains in August and September
boosted yields.  Farmers will  harvest  3.258 billion bushels this year,
compared with 3.149 billion (85.7 million metric tons) estimated
in September and last year’s drought-damaged crop of 3.034
billion, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
 report . Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 3.215
billion. The report is the USDA’s first in two months, after
canceling the October assessment during a government shutdown.  Yields were forecast at 43 bushels an acre, compared with
42.3 bushels expected by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. In
September, the government predicted 41.2 bushels, up from 39.8 a
year earlier. Harvested acreage was forecast at 75.688 million
acres, compared with 76.378 estimated two months earlier and
76.164 million in 2012, the agency said.  U.S.  reserves  on Aug. 31, 2014, before next year’s harvest,
will total 170 million bushels, up from 150 million in
September, the  agency  said. The average estimate of 35 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 177 million bushels.  Global  output  in the crop year that began Oct. 1 will be
283.54 million metric tons, compared with 281.66 million
forecast in September, the USDA said. Worldwide  inventories 
before the start of the 2014 Northern Hemisphere harvest will be
70.23 million tons, down from 71.54 million predicted two months
earlier, the USDA said. Traders expected reserves to rise to
72.4 million, on average.  The USDA forecast the average domestic farm-gate price in
the marketing year that began Sept. 1 at $11.15 to $13.15 a
bushel compared with $11.50 to $13.50 estimated in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
