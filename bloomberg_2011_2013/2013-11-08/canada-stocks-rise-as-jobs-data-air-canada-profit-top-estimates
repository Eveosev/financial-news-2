Canadian  stocks  rose the most in
three weeks as Air Canada reported higher-than-estimated
earnings and jobs data beat economists’ forecasts.  Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, surged 7.2
percent after reducing costs.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s
largest insurer, increased 2.6 percent for a fourth day of
gains. Trilogy Energy Corp. plunged 9.8 percent after reporting
a loss as sales declined. Detour Gold Corp. plunged 18 percent
after saying it will not meet its 2013 production targets.
Centerra Gold Inc. and HudBay Minerals Inc. sank at least 3.7
percent as gold dropped to a three-week low in  New York .  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 84.13
points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,378.33 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark Canadian equity gauge has advanced 7.6 percent this
year, the third-worst performance among global developed
markets, ahead of  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .  “Canada’s job numbers were modestly better than expected,
so that’s positive,” said Anish Chopra, a  fund manager  with TD
Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$216
billion ($206 billion). “It looks like the  U.S. economy , at
least by employment, has weathered the shutdown quite well. The
reaction gold investors are having is this is another data point
the Fed will use for tapering.”  The U.S. added 204,000 workers in October, ahead of the
median economists’ forecast of 120,000, according to a Labor
Department report today. The  Federal Reserve  has said
improvements in employment figures may prompt a reduction, or
tapering, of its stimulus program.  Jobs Data  Canada’s  jobless rate  remained at 6.9 percent, the lowest
since 2008, as government workers led the third straight month
of job gains. Employment rose by 13,200 in October, compared to
a median forecast of 11,000 from a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Air Canada (AC/B)  jumped 7.2 percent to C$5.99, the highest close
in five years, as nine of 10  industries  in the S&P/TSX rose.
Trading volume was 16 percent higher compared with the 30-day
average.  Air Canada, the  best-performing  stock in the S&P/TSX in
2013 with a 242 percent advance, reported adjusted earnings of
C$1.29 a share, ahead of the C$1.04 average analyst estimate in
a Bloomberg survey. The company is working to reduce costs at
the carrier by about 15 percent.  Housing Starts  Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, rose 0.7
percent to C$70.31 and Toronto-Dominion Bank, the second-largest, increased 0.8 percent to C$96.96. The S&P/TSX Banks
Index climbed 0.6 percent to a record.  Housing starts in  Canada  jumped to the highest level in
five months in October, led by construction of multiple-unit
projects such as condominiums.  Manulife climbed 2.6 percent to C$19.72 to pace gains among
financial stocks. The company has  advanced  6.7 percent in the
past four days, and yesterday reported rising profit on higher
sales of insurance and savings products.  Trilogy Energy sank 9.8 percent to C$26.76, the biggest
drop since 2008 on a closing basis, after reporting a loss of 8
Canadian cents a share, compared with 17 cents of earnings a
quarter ago. Sales volumes for the third quarter averaged 31,211
barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 16 percent drop from the
previous quarter due to field maintenance.  Detour Gold (DGC)  plunged 18 percent to C$6.35, an almost five-year low. The company said in a statement it will not reach its
2013 production target of 270,000 ounces of gold and now
forecasts 240,000 to 260,000 ounces.  Centerra Gold slumped 8.8 percent to C$3.54 and HudBay
