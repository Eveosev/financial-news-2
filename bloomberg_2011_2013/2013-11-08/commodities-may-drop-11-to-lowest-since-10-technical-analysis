Commodities may fall 11 percent in
the next few weeks to the lowest since May 2010, according to
technical analysis by Bank of America Corp.  The Continuous Commodity Futures  Price Index  of 17 raw
materials is “on the edge of breaking down” and will drop to
447,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-rate
technical strategy at Bank of America in  New York , said by e-mail yesterday. The gauge fell as low as 447.39 on an intraday
basis in May 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  An index of the six main industrial metals traded on the
London Metal Exchange is poised for a second weekly drop this
week, along with gold and silver for immediate delivery. Corn
and wheat are slumping for a third week in  Chicago . Crude oil is
heading for a fifth week of declines in New York and arabica
coffee reached the lowest price since 2006 yesterday.  “A sustained break of 506/500 opens 10 percent additional
downside,” Curry said.  The commodities  measure  settled yesterday at 503.99, fpr a
drop of 9.1 percent this year. Two closes below 500 would mark a
sustained break, according to Curry.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The CCI, as an equally weighted
index, is more representative of performance across commodities
than the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge and Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index, which emphasize energy, according to Curry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
