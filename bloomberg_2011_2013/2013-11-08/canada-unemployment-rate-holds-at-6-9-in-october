Canada ’s  unemployment rate  remained
at the lowest since 2008 in October as government workers led
the third straight month of job gains.  Employment rose by 13,200 and the  jobless rate  held at 6.9
percent,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected unemployment would increase
to 7 percent and employers would add 11,000 positions, according
to median forecasts.  Employment has continued to rise while companies restrict
capital spending in the face of tepid demand for exports that
has curbed expansion of the world’s 11th largest economy. The
 Bank of Canada  on Oct. 23 cut its growth forecast and dropped
language about raising  interest rates  in part because of the
amount of slack in the economy.  “These good jobs numbers were not enough to change
anyone’s conviction that the Bank of Canada is on hold for some
time to come,” said  David Love , a trader of interest-rate
derivatives in Montreal at Le Groupe Jitney Inc., a brokerage.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to C$1.0499 per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:25 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
95.23 U.S. cents. Bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark
two-year government note rising 3 basis points to 1.13 percent.  Public sector employment rose by 47,300 in October while
private employers fired 22,100 workers, Statistics Canada said
today.  Service Gains  Accommodation and food services led the job gains by
industry with an increase of 29,900, bringing its 12-month
employment gain to 7.2 percent. Health care and social
assistance jobs rose by 19,900 while public administration jobs
rose by 19,300 last month.  “All the signs from the labor market are relatively
positive,” said  Mark Chandler , head of fixed-income strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, by telephone
from Toronto. The gains suggest third-quarter economic growth
may have been faster than the central bank’s 1.8 percent
estimate, he said.  The U.S. today also reported that payrolls rose by a more
than forecast 204,000 workers in October while the jobless rate
rose to 7.3 percent from an almost five-year low of 7.2 percent.  Canadian full-time  employment  rose by 16,000 in October and
part-time positions declined by 2,700.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose
by 25,200 and the self-employed category decreased by 12,000.  Goods Losses  Goods producers fired 12,200 workers in October, Statistics
Canada said, with declines of 9,300 in construction and 6,400 in
factory work.  Aerospace manufacturer  Heroux-Devtek Inc. (HRX)  said this week
that 40 employees will be temporarily laid off from its
Longueuil, Quebec, factory because of a drop in orders from the
U.S. Air Force for landing gear repairs.  The labor force participation rate remained at the lowest
in more than a decade in October at 66.4 percent. Last month’s
report showed that the  unemployment rate  fell as young people
dropped out of the labor market.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 1.7
percent in October from a year earlier, trailing the prior
reading of 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
