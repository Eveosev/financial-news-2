Switzerland’s  Stanislas Wawrinka  kept
alive his chances of advancing to the semifinals of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals by beating third-seeded  David
Ferrer  of Spain.  Wawrinka, seeded seventh, beat the already-eliminated
Ferrer 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-1 at the O2 Arena in London. The Swiss
player may advance to the last four of the tennis tournament
depending on the outcome of tonight’s match between Rafael Nadal
and Tomas Berdych.  The event brings together the top eight men for a round-robin tournament that wraps up with a final in three days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
