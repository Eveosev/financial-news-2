Soybean imports by  China , the world’s
biggest buyer, declined to the lowest level in six months as
supply in warehouses in the U.S. dwindled before the completion
of this year’s harvest.  Shipments fell to 4.2 million metric tons in October from
4.7 million tons in September, and compared with 4 million tons
in October 2012, according to data released by Beijing-based
customs agency today. Shipments in the first 10 months of the
year were 49.9 million tons, 3.3 percent more than a year ago.  “There was a seasonal shortage” in the U.S., China’s
biggest supplier, in September and October, analyst Li  Yuan  of
Wanda Futures Co. said today from Wuhan. Crushers also didn’t
place enough advance orders earlier in the year because
processing margins were not seen as attractive then, she said.  Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade have declined 10
percent this year and traded at $12.6475 a bushel at 1:25 p.m in
Beijing. Futures in Dalian have slumped 5.6 percent this year
and traded at 4,480 yuan a ton ($20 a bushel).  With increasing Chinese demand for soybean meal and
improved profits for crushers, shipments will probably rebound,
said Li, who forecast imports of 6.5 million tons and 6 million
tons for November and December.  China’s imports for the marketing year that started Oct. 1
may be 67.5 million tons, up from 60 million tons a year ago, a
unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said last week.
China-based companies including Sinograin Oils Co. in July
forecast 64.5 million tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
