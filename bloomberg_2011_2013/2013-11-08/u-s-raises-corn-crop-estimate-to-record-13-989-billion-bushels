Corn production in the U.S., the
world’s top grower and shipper, will be the largest ever this 
year while stronger exports will contribute to smaller-than-expected inventories next year.  Farmers will collect a record 13.989 billion bushels, up
from 13.843 billion (351.63 million metric tons) estimated in
September, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in report
today in  Washington . The average projection of 36 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 14.029 billion, up from 10.78 billion
in 2012. The USDA report is its first in two months, after
canceling the October assessment during a partial government
shutdown.  Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, before next year’s harvest, will
be 1.887 billion bushels, up from 1.855 billion forecast in
September, the USDA today in a report. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg projected 2.044 billion, on average.  Export expectations were raised 14 percent to 1.4 billion
bushels, as lower prices for the grain are making U.S. corn more
competitive abroad, the USDA said.  Average yields this year will be 160.4 bushels an acre,
compared with 155.3 bushels estimated two months ago and 123.4
bushels in 2012, the agency said after completing its third
survey of farmers and fields this season. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg projected 159.2 bushels, on average.  World  output  in the year that begins Oct. 1 will be 962.83
million tons, compared with 956.67 million forecast two months
earlier, the USDA said. Global  inventories  before the start of
the Northern Hemisphere harvests in 2014 will be 164.33 million
tons, compared with 151.42 million projected in September.
Traders forecast a gain to 155.19 million, on average.  Corn at the farm gate may average between $4.10 and $4.90
in the 12 months that began Sept. 1, compared with $4.40 to
$5.20 forecast in September, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
