The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed by 1 basis point to 138 basis
points as of 8:18 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for a 5 basis-point increase over the past five days and is poised for its
biggest weekly gain since the period ended Sept. 27, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 0.5 of a basis
point to 93.75 as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure is on track to record its first weekly
decline since the five days ended Oct. 18, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 104
basis points as of 11:20 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark has fallen for the past two
days after peaking at 106 basis points on Nov. 5, the highest
since Oct. 28, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
