The  European Central Bank  said that a
European Single Resolution Regime should cover all banks in
countries for which the ECB will become supervisor next year.  “The SRM’s scope should encompass all  credit institutions 
established in  member states  participating in the Single
Supervisory Mechanism,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said
in a legal opinion published today. “The ECB fully supports the
establishment of a Single Resolution Mechanism. It believes that
centralized decision-making on resolution matters will
strengthen the stability of Economic and Monetary Union and that
the SRM will provide a necessary complement to the Single
Supervisory Mechanism.”  The proposed resolution authority, along with European
Central Bank oversight of euro-area lenders that is scheduled to
start in full next year, form the core of an effort to create a
banking union that aims to sever the link between banks and the
sovereign. Prior to assuming its supervisory role, the ECB will
conduct a comprehensive assessment of the banks that it will
later oversee.  “The ECB welcomes the EU Council’s call to adopt the
legislation within the European Parliament’s current term,” the
ECB said. “Furthermore, it strongly supports the envisaged
timeline for the SRM to become effective as of 1 January 2015.
Once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is operational and
supervision is elevated to the European level, the same needs to
happen for resolution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
