First Southern Bancorp Inc. (FSOF) , one of
more than a dozen small lenders that raised money to buy failed
banks after the financial crisis, is exploring a sale, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  First Southern, of  Boca Raton , Florida, is working with
Stifel Financial Corp.’s Keefe Bruyette & Woods unit, to find
buyers, said the people, asking not to be named because the
process is private. The lender, which  trades  over the counter,
had $193 million in equity capital and $1.1 billion of assets as
of June 30, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  First Southern was one of at least 14 lenders that raised
funds from private-equity firms and other investors with the aim
of buying failed banks, according to data from SNL Financial.
Founded in 1987, the bank raised $400 million in 2010 and
acquired two failed banks that year and the year after.  J. Herbert Boydstun, First Southern’s chief executive
officer, said the bank doesn’t comment on strategic decisions.
Michael Gelormino, a spokesman for KBW, also declined to
comment.  First Southern took over Haven Trust Bank Florida in  Ponte
Vedra Beach  after it was closed by regulators in 2010, and First
Commercial Bank of Florida in  Orlando  in 2011. The lender hasn’t
turned an annual profit since 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It lost $362,000 in the first half of 2013, compared with
a loss of $8.1 million a year earlier, the data show.  The bank’s current  shareholders  include Capital Group
Companies Inc., an investment manager, and Banc Funds Co. LLC, a
private equity firm, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
