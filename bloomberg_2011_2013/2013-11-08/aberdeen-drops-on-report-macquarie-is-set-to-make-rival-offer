Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  dropped
in London trading following a report Macquarie Group Ltd. is
planning to make a competing offer for Scottish Widows
Investment Partnership.  Aberdeen said last month that it’s in talks to buy the
Lloyd Banking Group Plc fund management unit, which oversees
about 146 billion pounds ($235 billion) in assets and would make
the Scottish firm  Europe ’s largest publicly traded money
manager. The shares fell 4.6 percent to 422.2 pence in London,
the biggest decline since Aug. 21.  Macquarie, Australia’s largest investment bank, is planning
to offer about 500 million pounds in cash for SWIP  within the
next two weeks, Dow Jones reported citing people with knowledge
of the transaction. A spokeswoman from Macquarie in London
declined to comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  “The timing seems correct” said Peter Lenardos, an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in London with an outperform
rating on the stock. “Aberdeen can afford to pay cash for the
unit, but they would have to do a share placing first. We will
are probably going to see a run for the finish line here, but
anything above 500 to 550 million pounds I would strongly
encourage Aberdeen to step away.”  Aberdeen said on Oct. 24 that it would pay for the
acquisition by issuing new shares to Lloyds and make further
payments in cash over time, depending on SWIP’s performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
