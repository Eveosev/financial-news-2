Japanese  stocks  fell for a second day
ahead of U.S. jobs data as the yen held gains and stronger
economic growth fueled concerns the  Federal Reserve  may cut
stimulus sooner than expected.  The  Topix index  lost 1 percent to 1,172.77 as of 9:02 a.m.
in Tokyo. The measure is poised for a 0.9 percent drop this
week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 1.3 percent to
14,043.39. The yen traded at 98.12 per dollar after advancing
0.6 percent yesterday. The currency also gained against the euro
after the  European Central Bank  cut a key interest rate.  The Topix trailed 23 other developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg in October, rising less than 0.1 percent. The measure
remains the best performer this year in the group with a 38
percent rally. Shares rose as unprecedented monetary easing by
the  Bank of Japan  weakened the yen, improving the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The equity measure dropped 1.3 percent yesterday,
the most since August. Data showed the economy expanded at a 2.8
percent annualized rate last quarter, exceeding the median
economist forecast for 2 percent growth. The Fed has said it
needs to see signs of a sustainable recovery before paring back
stimulus.  Today’s monthly employment report may show payrolls rose by
120,000 workers in October after a 148,000 gain in September,
while the jobless rate rose to 7.3 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  The ECB yesterday cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a
record low of 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent, after a drop in
inflation to the slowest pace in four years threatened its
mission to keep prices stable.  Earnings season continues in  Japan  with more than 200
companies reporting today. Of the 230 Topix companies that have
announced results this quarter and for which Bloomberg had
estimates, 59 percent topped profit expectations, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit per share on the gauge is expected to increase 45
percent from the previous quarter, according to analyst
 projections  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix  traded  at 1.22 times book value yesterday,
compared to 2.53 for the S&P 500 and 1.81 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Topix’s 30-day historic volatility was at 16.61
yesterday, down from its five-year median of 19.16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
