Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the world’s
second-largest maker of commercial  jet engines , raised the
earnings target for its defense aerospace unit after booking
more contracts from the U.S. government.  The subsidiary will see “modest growth” this year rather
than “broadly flat” profit, while sales will advance slightly,
the London-based company said today. Rolls-Royce revised the
profit outlook for its marine unit to no growth from a modest
increase.  Rolls-Royce booked $600 million in contracts from the U.S.
government since reporting half-year results. The outlook for
civil aerospace, the dominant business at Rolls-Royce, remains
at “strong” growth in profit on a modest advance in sales.  The segment has secured key orders since July, including
with  Japan Airlines (9201)  Co. Ltd., which agreed to buy 31 Airbus SAS
A350 wide-body aircraft that are only powered by Rolls-Royce
engines.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  also committed to buying A350s in
the period.  Sales at the group level are still expected to advance
modestly the London-based company said. Rolls-Royce shares have
advanced 34 percent since the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
