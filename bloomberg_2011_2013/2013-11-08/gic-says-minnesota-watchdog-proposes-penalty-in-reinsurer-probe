MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer whose stock has almost tripled this year, said Minnesota
regulators have proposed resolving a reinsurance probe with
penalties against the company.  A draft consent order, which was received Aug. 28 and also
sent to competitors, contains “proposed conditions to resolve
its investigation, including unspecified penalties,” Milwaukee-based MGIC said today in a quarterly filing with securities
regulators. “We are engaged in discussions” with the
Minnesota Department of Commerce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
