Generic drug companies will be able
to publicize new safety information on a product on their own
instead of waiting for their brand-name counterparts to release
the information under a plan from U.S. regulators.  The  Food and Drug Administration  proposed a rule today that
allows generic drugmakers such as  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd (TEVA)  and  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  to makes changes to their labels the same way
as brand-name pharmaceutical companies. Current rules allow
brand manufacturers to update their labels to acknowledge new
safety information before an FDA review of the change.  “This proposal will help ensure that health care
professionals and consumers have access to the latest safety
information for the medications they use,”  Janet Woodcock ,
director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,
said in a statement. “More than 80 percent of prescriptions
filled in the U.S. are for generics, so we want to make sure
that generic drug companies actively participate with the FDA to
ensure that product safety information is accurate and up to
date.”  Under current law, generic companies must wait to change
product safety information until the label for the corresponding
brand medicine has been updated by its drugmaker and received
FDA approval for the revision. The agency said that policy may
have delayed relaying information to health-care professionals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
