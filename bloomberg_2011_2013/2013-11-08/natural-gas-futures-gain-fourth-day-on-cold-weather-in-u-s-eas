Natural gas rose for a fourth day in
 New York  on forecasts for colder-than-normal weather in the
eastern U.S. that may boost demand for heating.  Futures for December delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to $3.542 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , and were at $3.538
at 11:48 a.m. Singapore time. The volume of all futures traded
was about 45 percent less than the 100-day average. The contract
climbed 0.6 percent to $3.519 yesterday and is up 0.7 percent
this week, set to snap a three-week losing streak.  Temperatures may be below average in the eastern half of
the U.S. through Nov. 16, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The low in New York on Nov. 14 may be 32 degrees Fahrenheit
(0 Celsius), 10 degrees less than usual, said AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania. The temperature in Chicago may
fall to 23 degrees, 12 degrees below the average low. About 49
percent of U.S. households use natural gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
