Palm oil  posted the biggest weekly
drop in more than eight months before a report from  Malaysia 
expected to show that stockpiles gained even as production
declined last month.  The contract for January delivery fell 1.5 percent to 2,506
ringgit ($788) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives,
the lowest close for most-active futures since Oct. 29. Prices
declined 4.6 percent this week, the most since the five days
ending March 1.  Palm oil jumped 7.5 percent last week, the most since April
2009, on speculation that output in top producers Indonesia and
Malaysia may be less than analysts expected. Prices rose to
2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest close since September 2012
and 21 percent more than the 2,167 settlement on July 29,
meeting the common definition of a  bull market .  “The market ran up sharply” last week, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Sunvin Group in Mumbai. The
rally slowed demand and some investors are waiting for the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board report due on Nov. 11, he said.  Production in Malaysia probably fell 2.1 percent to 1.87
million tons in October from a month earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey published Nov. 6. Exports were little changed
at 1.6 million tons, while reserves rose 3.4 percent to 1.84
million tons, the highest since April, the survey showed. Output
is typically highest from July to October.  Soybean oil for December delivery lost 0.7 percent to 40.44
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in January was little changed at $12.6575 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
end at 6,228  yuan  ($1,023) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and  soybean oil  slid 0.6 percent to close at 7,160
yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
