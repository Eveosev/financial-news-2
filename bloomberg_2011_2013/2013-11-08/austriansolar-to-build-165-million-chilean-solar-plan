AustrianSolar  Chile  Dos SpA, a
Chilean renewable-energy developer, is filing for permits to
develop a $165 million photovoltaic power plant in Chile’s
Atacama desert.  Work on the 90-megawatt Photovoltaic Sun of Atacama project
is expected to start in February 2015, the Santiago-based
company said today in a  filing  with environmental licensing
agency Servicio de Evaluacion Ambiental. The plant will feed
energy into Chile’s central grid system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
