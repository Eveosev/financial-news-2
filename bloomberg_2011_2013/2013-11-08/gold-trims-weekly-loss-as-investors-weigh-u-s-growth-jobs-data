Gold dropped to a three-week low in
 New York  as payrolls in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
October, increasing speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may
start reducing economic stimulus by the end of this year.  The Labor Department said 204,000 workers were added,
compared with the median forecast of 120,000, according to a
survey of 91 economists. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index gained
in three of the past four days. The economy shows signs of
“underlying strength,” Fed policy makers said on Oct. 30. The
statement pointed to the possibility of reduced bond purchases
as soon as December, Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said.  “The strong numbers today increase the probability of
tapering starting this year,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity
strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. “We are seeing a flight toward the dollar.”  Gold futures for December delivery declined 1.8 percent to
settle at $1,284.60 an ounce at 2:01 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, extending the week’s drop to 2.2 percent. Earlier, prices
touched $1,280.50, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Oct. 17.  Gold has fallen 23 percent this year and is heading for the
first annual drop in 13 years as some investors lost faith in
the metal as a store of value and on speculation a strengthening
economy will spur the Federal Reserve to slow its $85 billion in
monthly debt purchases.  Silver futures for December delivery slipped 1.6 percent to
$21.317 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
December delivery slid 0.2 percent to $757.90 an ounce. Platinum
futures for January delivery dropped 1 percent to $1,442.90 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
