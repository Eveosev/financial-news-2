The Minnesota Vikings scored 20
second-half points to rally past the  Washington  Redskins 34-27
and avoid their fifth straight defeat as Week 10 play got under
way in the National Football League.  The Vikings improved to 2-7, the second-worst record in the
National Football Conference after the winless Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, while Washington dropped to 3-6.  It’s the first victory on U.S. soil this season for the
Vikings, their only other win coming against the Pittsburgh
Steelers at Wembley Stadium in  London  on Sept. 29.  Washington led 24-14 at halftime at the Metrodome in
 Minneapolis  last night as Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III tossed touchdown passes of eight, 11 and one yard to Pierre Garcon, Jordan Reed and Logan Paulsen.  Minnesota  got two first-half touchdowns, on an 18-yard run by Adrian Peterson and on a
two-yard pass from Christian Ponder to Cordarrelle Patterson.  Ponder connected with John Carlson for a 28-yard touchdown
to cut the deficit to six points. Ponder injured his left
shoulder on the home team’s next drive as he scrambled 14 yards
to within one foot of the Washington end zone. Matt Cassel took
over at quarterback and on his first play handed the ball off to
Peterson, who scored to give Minnesota a one-point lead with 57
seconds left in the third quarter.  Blair Walsh kicked field goals of 39 and 40 yards to make
it 34-27 to Minnesota with three minutes, 36 seconds remaining
and the Vikings sealed the win when Washington’s Santana Moss
failed to get both feet down in play on a catch in the end zone
on a 4th-and-goal play with 24 seconds remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
