CBS News ’ “60 Minutes” said it is
weighing whether to correct a report about the 2012 attack on
the U.S. mission compound in Benghazi, Libya.  “‘60 Minutes’ has learned of new information that
undercuts the account told to us by Morgan Jones of his actions
on the night of the attack on the Benghazi compound,”  CBS
Corp. (CBS) ’s news organization said today in an e-mailed statement.
“We are currently looking into this serious matter to determine
if he misled us, and if so, we will make a correction.”  The Sunday-night newsmagazine broadcast a report on Oct. 27
based on the eyewitness account of a security contractor, Dylan
Davies, who was identified under the pseudonym Morgan Jones.
Davies told “60 Minutes” he was on the scene responding to the
Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, in which U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed.  The story was questioned by other media outlets, including
the  New York  Times, which reported today that Davies told the
Federal Bureau of Investigation he wasn’t present. That
contradicts the interview he gave to “60 Minutes” and a book
published by CBS’s Simon & Schuster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
