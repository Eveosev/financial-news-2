The International Paralympic
Committee overturned the lifetime suspension of a powerlifter
from  Azerbaijan  after his former girlfriend admitted to spiking
his drink with a steroid.  Gunduz Ismayilov tested positive for the anabolic steroid
stanozolol at the 2004 Paralympics in  Athens , the IPC said in a
 statement  on its website. He received the life ban because he’d
already served a two-year suspension for a failed test at the
2000 Paralympics.  The IPC said it lifted the ban after Ismayilov’s former
partner, also an athlete who competed in Athens, “admitted in a
Baku court of law that she sabotaged his drink” in the
Paralympic Village. The two had separated in 2003 and though
they remained on good terms, she spiked the drink as a form of
punishment, the IPC said, calling the situation a “very unusual
case with a unique set of circumstances.”  Under IPC rules, Ismayilov will not be eligible to compete
again until he’s undergone three months of out-of-competition
testing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
