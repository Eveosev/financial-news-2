Raymond James  Financial Inc., the
brokerage that acquired Morgan Keegan & Co. last year, named Jim Bunn as co-head of investment-banking.  Bunn, who is currently co-head of the technology services
investment-banking group, will run investment banking with Dav Mosby starting Jan. 1, the company said in a statement today.
Bunn joined the St. Petersburg, Florida-based firm as part of
its 2009 purchase of Lane Berry & Co.  “Jim is an exceptional manager and banker who is
consistently recognized as one of the best in our industry,”
Jeff Trocin, president of global equities and investment
banking, said in the statement. “He led the expansion of the
firm’s technology-services practice and oversaw successive years
of substantial growth.”  Bunn’s team generated the highest merger-advisory revenue
of any investment-banking unit in the firm’s history, Raymond
James said in the statement.  He began his career at  Salomon Smith Barney , where he was a
member of the financial technology investment-banking team until
2004, when he joined Lane Berry, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
