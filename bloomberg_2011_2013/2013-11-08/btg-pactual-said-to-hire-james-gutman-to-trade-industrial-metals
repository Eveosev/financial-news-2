Grupo BTG Pactual hired James Gutman
to trade industrial metals, two people familiar with the matter
said.  Gutman, formerly a partner at Armajaro Asset Management
LLP, joined this month and is based in  London , said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. Gutman resigned from Armajaro Holdings Ltd.’s asset
management unit in April 2012, according to a filing with U.K.
Companies House.  A spokesman for BTG Pactual in  Sao Paulo  declined to
comment, asking not to be identified because of company policy.  BTG Pactual’s commodities business will have about 200
people in 2014, from 120 now, Chief Financial Officer Marcelo
Kalim said on a conference call on Nov. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
