Spot metallurgical coal in the U.S.
slipped on lackluster export demand for the steelmaking
ingredient, IHS Inc.’s Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Low-volatility coal fell $1.65, or 1.2 percent, to $141.25
a ton, the Knoxville, Tennessee-based data provider said.  “Overall sentiment stayed relatively subdued with minimal
demand recorded in Europe,” it said.  IHS Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
