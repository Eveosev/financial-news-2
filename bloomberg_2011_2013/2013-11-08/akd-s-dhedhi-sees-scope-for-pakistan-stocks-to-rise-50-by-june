Aqeel Karim Dhedhi, chairman of AKD
Group, comments on Pakistan’s stocks and the rupee in an
interview in Karachi.  On the stock market:  The country’s benchmark  KSE100 Index (KSE100)  has risen 37 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The  stock market  is set to continue its upward trend as
the new government has taken some tough decisions, including the
IMF loan deal, ending energy subsidies, increasing power tariffs
and cutting corporate tax.  ‘‘I see improvement in coming days and months. The
difficult time is over. If you see across the board, there is no
sector which is not performing.  ‘‘My favorite sectors are fertilizers and banking, followed
by pharmaceuticals. There is a lot of value in the market and
potential to grow. I think the market should rise at least
between 40% to 50% from this point by June 30.’’  On Pakistan’s rupee:  The local currency has declined 9.5 percent against the
dollar this year and traded at 107.29 yesterday.  ‘‘The pace of depreciation will slow in every coming
quarter of the year ending June as economic indicators will keep
getting better.  The  budget deficit  will fall to meet the government’s
target or even lower after the IMF loan deal, easing pressure on
the rupee.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
