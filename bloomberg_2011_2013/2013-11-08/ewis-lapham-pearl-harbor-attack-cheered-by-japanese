department stores had a one-item-per-customer policy while dance
halls and jazz performances became illegal.  Citizens had to use ration coupons, and even the best
restaurants in Tokyo were serving cheap imported rice, or
“mouse poops” as it was known to dissatisfied diners.  Then came news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The country

to Infamy” on the following topics:  1. Unwinnable War.  2. No One Responsible.  3. Divided Government.  4. Alliances in Europe.  5. Pearl Harbor.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
