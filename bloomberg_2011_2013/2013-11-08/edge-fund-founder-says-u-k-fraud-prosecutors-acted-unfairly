Magnus Peterson, the founder of the
collapsed hedge fund Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd., is seeking to
delay a criminal prosecution against him by arguing that U.K.
prosecutors acted unfairly in the case.  A decision by the director of the Serious Fraud Office to
reopen a probe into the firm’s collapse after the former
director closed the investigation is an “abuse of process” by
the agency, Peterson’s lawyer, Peter Lodder, said at a hearing
in  London  today. The court agreed to hear his arguments in
February.  Peterson will also argue that the SFO’s initial decision to
open the probe could be unlawful. The agency was challenged in
court in September over claims its former director, Richard Alderman, improperly delegated decisions to non-lawyer
executives. The court ruled the SFO had acted legally.  Weavering Capital, which once had about $640 million under
management, collapsed in March 2009 after discovering the
counterparty for its biggest trading position was controlled by
the fund’s manager. About 10 employees, including Peterson, were
ordered by a U.K. court last year to repay a total of $450
million to liquidators of the collapsed hedge fund.  Peterson was charged in December with six counts of fraud,
forgery, fraudulent trading and false accounting. A trial is
scheduled for October next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
