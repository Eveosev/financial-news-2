European  government bonds  declined
with Treasuries after a report showed the U.S. economy added
more jobs last month than economists forecast, damping demand
for fixed-income assets.  Benchmark German 10-year bunds headed for a weekly decline
as the data underscored the view of Federal Reserve officials
that employment conditions are improving as they consider when
to dial back record monetary stimulus.  France ’s bonds dropped
after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the country’s sovereign-debt
rating by one level. Spanish and Italian securities also fell.  “We saw a very strong U.S. payrolls report and bunds are
following Treasuries lower,” said Mathias Van Der Jeugt, a
fixed-income strategist at KBC Bank NV in Brussels.
“Expectations for U.S. tapering are being brought forward.
That’s weighing on Treasuries and the U.S.-German spread is
widening,” he said, referring to the yield difference between
the securities.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time.
The rate has increased seven basis points  this week . The 2
percent bond maturing in August 2023 fell 0.715, or 7.15 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,335) face amount, to 102.1.  Treasury 10-year note yields climbed 14 basis points to
2.74 percent. The extra yield, or  spread , investors demand to
hold 10-year Treasuries instead of their German equivalents
widened by seven basis points to 98 basis points, the most since
Sept. 9.  Jobs Data  The  U.S. economy  added 204,000 workers last month and a
revised 163,000 in September that was larger than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today. The median
forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
120,000 advance. The jobless rate rose to 7.3 percent from an
almost five-year low of 7.2 percent.  Spain ’s 10-year yield increased six basis points to 4.11
percent. The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt rose five
basis points to 4.15 percent.  Italy  may reduce its government-bond issuance plan for the
rest of the year, debt agency chief Maria Cannata said in 
Brussels today.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in the euro-area
markets, followed by those of Finland and  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  French Downgrade  S&P downgraded France to AA from AA+ with a stable outlook
saying the government’s reform of tax, labor markets, products
and services won’t raise medium-term growth prospects.  The yield on France’s 1.75 percent bond due in May 2023
increased six basis points to 2.22 percent.  Yet, the cost of insuring French debt against default fell
to the least in more than three years. Credit-default swaps on
French debt slid one basis point to 51.4 basis points today, the
lowest since April 2010, based on closing prices. That compares
with a euro-era high of 253 basis points set in November 2011.  “French yields rose after the downgrade but we expect any
increase to be limited as the move has been largely expected,”
said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European interest-rate strategy at
Societe Generale SA in Paris. “The news may have provided some
impetus for the market to take profits on Italian and Spanish
bonds after a big rally yesterday. But in the bigger scheme of
things, the impact will probably be limited.”  German securities lost 1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent, Italy’s earned 7 percent and French bonds
gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
