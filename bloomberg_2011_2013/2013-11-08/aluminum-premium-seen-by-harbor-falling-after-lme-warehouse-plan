Spot premiums for aluminum ingot will
probably fall in the next few quarters after the London Metal
Exchange’s decision yesterday to change the rules on warehousing
to reduce waits for metal, according to Jorge Vazquez, managing
director of  Harbor Intelligence  in Austin,  Texas . The following
are comments he made by e-mail today.  “The LME’s ruling is an official acknowledgment that the
LME warehousing system that was in operation was being used as a
platform to inorganically inflate aluminum premiums at the
expense of the aluminum consumer and at the benefit of some
warehouses, banks and trading companies.  ‘‘The decision taken by the LME in principle seems to be
intended to help reduce the gap between what the LME is today
and what an efficient, fair, transparent and balanced market
should be.  ‘‘Spot ingot premiums should fall in the quarters ahead
toward more organic levels while the LME price may experience an
upward re-pricing as the market factors in better conditions to
purchase and load-out physical aluminum in the LME and
expectations of falling LME inventories.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
