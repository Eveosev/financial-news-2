U.S. wheat inventories before next
year’s harvest will be larger than the government forecast in
September.  Reserves on May 31, 2014, will total 565 million bushels,
compared with 561 million (15.27 million metric tons) forecast
in September, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
monthly report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting
529 million, on average. The agency’s October report was
canceled during a partial government shutdown.  World  output  in the 12 months that began June 1 will be
706.38 million metric tons, compared with 708.89 million
forecast in September, the government said. Global  inventories 
before the start of the Northern Hemisphere harvests in 2014
will be 178.48 million tons, compared with 176.28 million
predicted two months ago, the USDA said. Traders expected 176.54
million.  The USDA forecast wheat prices at the farm will average
$6.70 to $7.30 a bushel in the 12 months that began June 1,
compared with $6.50 to $7.50 estimated in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
