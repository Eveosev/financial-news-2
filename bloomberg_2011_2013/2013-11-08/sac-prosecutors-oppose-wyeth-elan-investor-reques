Investors in Elan Corp. and Wyeth
shouldn’t be allowed to oppose SAC Capital Advisors LP’s plea
agreement with the U.S., prosecutors and the hedge-fund company
said.  The investors, who said they are victims of insider trading
in Elan and Wyeth by SAC, asked to appear at today’s plea
hearing in  Manhattan  federal court to voice their disapproval of
the deal.  In the hearing, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain will
consider the record $1.8 billion settlement  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based SAC reached with prosecutors to resolve civil
and criminal insider-trading allegations against it.  The investors, who have filed lawsuits against SAC, said
the settlement should be rejected unless it holds the hedge fund
accountable for illegal insider trading in the companies’ stock.
Such an admission would make it easier for them to prove their
cases against SAC.  SAC and prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara  argued in letters to Swain today that the investors
aren’t entitled to be heard at the plea hearing and shouldn’t be
permitted to second-guess the agreement.  The criminal case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-cr-00541, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The civil case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP,
13-cv-5182, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
