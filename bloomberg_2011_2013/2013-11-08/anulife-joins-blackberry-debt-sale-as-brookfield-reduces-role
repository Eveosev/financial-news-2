Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer by market value, agreed to invest $70 million in
 BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) ’s $1 billion debt sale, while  Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. (BAM/A)  and  Markel Corp. (MKL)  reduced their roles.  Brookfield lowered its stake to $10 million from $50
million, and Markel cut its investment to $70 million from $100
million, according to a filing today.  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , BlackBerry’s largest
investor, orchestrated the $1 billion debt sale this week after
deciding not to proceed with a tentative $4.7 billion bid to buy
the struggling smartphone maker.  Investors in the  convertible
debentures also include Qatar Holding LLC and Canso Investment
Counsel Ltd.  The move to borrow the funds underscores BlackBerry’s
deteriorating cash situation. Its cash and short-term
investments fell by almost $500 million last quarter to $2.3
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At that rate,
the money would be gone by the end of next year.  The portfolio management arm of Toronto-based Manulife
holds shares of BlackBerry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
