Repsol SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
producer, plans to invest $4 billion in  Venezuela  through 2022
on existing projects and discoveries to more than double oil
output.  The investments will peak in 2017, Cosme Vargas, the
technical manager for crude oil assets for Madrid-based Repsol
said in an interview yesterday at the Latin American Petroleum
Show oil conference in Maracaibo in Western Venezuela.  “The company expects to increase net oil output in
Venezuela from around 40,000 barrels a day currently to nearly
100,000 barrels a day by 2022,” Vargas said.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Antonio Brufau  said on
Oct. 16 that his company was committed to making investments in
Venezuela over the long-term. Venezuela is seeking investments
from foreign partners as it looks to increase oil production to
6 million barrels a day by the end of 2019.  Repsol, with an 11 percent stake, also participates in the
Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy oil belt, the
largest accumulation of heavy and extra-heavy oil in the world.
It has the capacity to produce 400,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to Venezuela’s state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, has a
controlling 60 percent stake in the Carabobo-1 project while
foreign partners hold the remaining 40 percent stake.  Malaysia’s Petronas said Sept. 10 that it would exit the
project and PDVSA has temporarily assumed the company’s 11
percent stake, according to Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael
Ramirez , who also serves as the president of the state oil
company.  Partners in Carabobo-1 include  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. with an 11 percent stake, and Indian Oil Corp. and  Oil
India Ltd. (OINL)  with 3.5 percent each.  “Repsol will not acquire Petronas’ stake in the
Petrocarabobo oil project,” Vargas told reporters today. The
official said Indian companies were interested in assuming the
stake without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
