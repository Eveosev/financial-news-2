MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Lincoln National
Corp. led a rally of  U.S. insurers on the prospect that rising
yields will improve investment income in their bond portfolios.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, jumped 5.4 percent
to $50.14 at 4:03 p.m. in New York, the biggest increase in
three months. No. 2  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , based in  Newark ,
New Jersey, climbed 3.8 percent.  The 10-year Treasury  yield  rose 15 basis points to 2.75
percent after the Labor Department said the economy added more
jobs in October than forecast. The report boosted speculation
that the Federal Reserve may announce a reduction in bond buying
as soon as next month. The Fed’s purchases pushed yields down,
pressuring businesses in which insurers offer fixed returns to
clients and seek to earn a better rate on investments.  “Higher interest rates are reducing the headwind of spread
compression,” Randy Freitag, the chief financial officer of
 Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , said in a conference call last week.  Lincoln climbed 5.7 percent. The Radnor, Pennsylvania-based
insurer has rallied about 88 percent this year, compared with
gains of 52 percent at New York-based MetLife and 63 percent at
Prudential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
