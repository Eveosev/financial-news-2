Hog futures headed for their biggest
gain in almost two weeks on speculation that U.S. pork demand is
improving, encouraging meatpackers to buy more animals for
slaughter. Cattle prices rose.  Pork processors slaughtered 1.74 million animals in the
first four days of the week, up 1 percent from a week earlier
and 0.7 percent more than a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Wholesale  pork  rose 0.5 percent to 94.06
cents a pound yesterday, and ham  prices  climbed to the highest
price on record, according to the USDA.  “The market is proving pretty strong,”  Dan Vaught , an
economist at Doane Advisory Services in  St. Louis , said in a
telephone interview. “This is the time of the year is when ham
should be at the strongest.”  Hog futures for December settlement climbed 0.6 percent to
88.075 cents a pound at 10:28 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest gain since Oct. 28. Yesterday,
the most-active contract rose for the first time in eight
sessions, snapping the longest slump since Feb. 22.  Cattle futures for December delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$1.3225 a pound on the CME, after falling the previous three
days. The price is up 0.1 percent this week. Feeder-cattle
futures for January settlement rose 0.5 percent to $1.66 a
pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
