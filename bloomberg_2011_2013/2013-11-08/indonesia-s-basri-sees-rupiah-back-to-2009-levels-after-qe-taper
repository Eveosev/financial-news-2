Indonesia ’s rupiah and bond yields
will return to levels seen in 2009 after the Federal Reserve
cuts stimulus that has buoyed emerging-market assets, Finance
Minister Chatib Basri said.  The currency traded at an average of 10,396 per dollar in
2009, compared with 11,408 as of 1:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The  yield  on
benchmark 10-year  government securities  averaged 11.15 percent
in 2009, and was 7.93 percent today, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “The normal world is a world without quantitative
easing,” Basri said in an interview with Bloomberg TV Indonesia
in Jakarta today. “I see that after the QE taper, we will
return to that situation.”  The U.S. central bank will start reducing its $85 billion a
month of bond purchases in March, according to an Oct. 17-18
survey by Bloomberg. Global funds pulled 19.98 trillion rupiah
($1.8 billion) from Indonesian local-currency government debt in
June after the Fed signaled in May that it was considering
tapering. That rupiah has weakened 16 percent against the dollar
this year, while the 10-year bond yield rose 2.74 percentage
points.  Consumer prices increased 8.3 percent in October, official
data show. Inflation will ease to 5.5 percent in 2014, according
to state budget assumptions.  “Much depends on the inflation outlook and investor
confidence, so it won’t be exactly the same as 2009, which was
also a post-crisis environment,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an
economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore . “What we saw
in May was a test run for what will happen when the Fed does
taper, and we see from then that the government and  Bank
Indonesia  understand what’s needed and are making the right
preparations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
