Air Canada (AC/A)  reported third-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates as the nation’s largest
carrier’s cost-cutting plan continued to bear fruit.  Adjusted earnings were C$365 million ($349 million), or
C$1.29 a share, beating the C$1.04 average of nine analyst
estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. On that basis, profit in the
year-earlier quarter was C$229 million, or 82 cents, the
Montreal-based airline said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu is working to
reduce costs at the carrier by about 15 percent in the medium
term with the help of higher-density aircraft, new maintenance
agreements and the July start of the Rouge leisure unit. Expense
reductions include sales and distribution as well as food and
beverage, the company said Oct. 3.  “Air Canada should continue to realize the benefits of its
fairly sizeable” cost-reduction opportunity in the next several
quarters,  Fadi Chamoun , a BMO Capital Markets analyst who
recommends investors to buy the stock, said in an Oct. 16 note
to clients. “Improving operating margins should enable cash
from operations to grow, allowing for better funding of large
aircraft-related capital investments over the coming few
years.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
