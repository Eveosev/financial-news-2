Portugal ’s government bond rating
outlook was revised to stable from negative by Moody’s Investors
Service amid an improving fiscal position and economic outlook.  The nation’s debt is rated Ba3, or three levels below
investment grade by the New York-based credit ranking company.
The general government debt ratio will start to decline from an
elevated level of close to 129 percent of gross domestic product
from 2014 onward, according to Moody’s statement today.  Portugal’s  jobless rate  dropped for a second quarter,
falling to 15.6 percent in the three months through September as
the country’s economy shows signs of recovery. The unemployment
rate fell from 16.4 percent in the second quarter and from 15.8
percent in the third quarter of 2012, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said yesterday on its website. That’s the
lowest jobless rate since the second quarter of 2012.  While Portugal’s economy expanded in the second quarter for
the first time since 2010 as export growth accelerated, Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  still has to trim spending by 3.2
billion euros ($4.3 billion) next year to meet budget deficit
targets as the government tries to exit its European Union-led
bailout program.  Yields on Portugal’s five-year bonds have dropped to 4.88
percent from a high for the year of 7.66 percent on July 12.  Next year’s spending cuts include 1.3 billion euros of
savings in personnel costs as the government lowers wages and
tries to reduce the number of state workers. Public sector
workers in Portugal fell 4.7 percent in the 12 months through
June, the  Finance Ministry  said on Oct. 31. About 10.7 percent
of Portugal’s active population worked in the public sector as
of June 2013.  Growth Forecasts  The government targets a budget deficit of 5.5 percent of
gross domestic product for this year and 4 percent for 2014. It
expects the shortfall will fall below the EU’s 3 percent limit
in 2015, when it aims for a 2.5 percent gap. Portugal’s  debt  is
forecast to peak at 127.8 percent of GDP this year.  The  Portuguese government  predicts the  unemployment rate 
will climb to 17.4 percent in 2013 and 17.7 percent in 2014. On
Oct. 3 it raised the 2014  growth  forecast to 0.8 percent from
0.6 percent. It expects the economy will shrink 1.8 percent this
year, less than its previous estimate of 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
