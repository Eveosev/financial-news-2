The core principles of academic finance are: And so the field is a parade of papers that identify factors reliably associated with statistically significant outperformance. But last month  Ranadeb Chaudhuri ,  Zoran Ivkovich ,  Joshua Pollet  and  Charles Trzcinka  won. They wrote  the most perfect possible finance paper , so everyone else can stop. Well, actually, they can't, because Chaudhuri et al.'s conclusion is "the world needs more finance papers." Sort of. Here (via  Tyler Cowen ) is the abstract: Give them tenure! Or at least a job at a hedge fund! Ahhh they'd probably take the hedge fund. This paper gets a lot done. Most important, 1  it confirms the value of academic finance. The training for a finance Ph.D. teaches you rigorous methods for identifying financial-markets anomalies that can, in theory at least, lead to predictable outperformance. Not all of those anomalies can profitably be exploited, though  there is evidence  that many can be and are.  This study is further, even better evidence that toiling in the anomaly mines can be profitable: It is! In actual businesses! That manage actual money in actual markets! When young aspiring financial academics go home for Thanksgiving and their uncles ask them, "a Ph.D. in  finance?  What are you going to do with  that?, " now they'll have an answer. 2  But it also works at a meta level in that it identifies an anomaly itself. And it is no small anomaly: It's that you can predict a money manager's future performance based on her educational credentials.  That is a big deal.  Most anomalies identified in the literature require a fair amount of capital and computing power to exploit: Hedge funds might put them into operation, but the average individual can't.  This, though, is news you can use: Just make sure your broker has a Ph.D.! I mean, not really, but it does suggest that you'd do well to pick mutual funds and other products managed by Ph.D.s over those that aren't. 3   More broadly, it suggests that investment-management ability is more rationally predictable than is often assumed 4  : It's not just luck and mojo and intangibles; it's teachable in a degree program and deducible from a resume. There is a third level that is so ethereally meta that it has floated off into a footnote. 5  The results aren't  huge  -- Ph.D.s outperform their less-educated peers by about 43 basis points a year -- but they're interesting. Though I guess you should take them with a grain of salt. A good exercise might be replicating this exercise in different contexts and on different samples -- Ph.D.s at hedge funds, Ph.D.s at mutual funds, only Ph.D.s who are chief investment officers, firms with  only  Ph.D.s in senior roles, etc. 6   -- to make sure that they're not just a result of cherry-picking.  A little skepticism is always in order with academic papers. Every academic is tempted to report the result that he wanted to find. But since this result is at some level the single result that every financial academic  most  wanted to find, it probably makes sense to be especially careful.
