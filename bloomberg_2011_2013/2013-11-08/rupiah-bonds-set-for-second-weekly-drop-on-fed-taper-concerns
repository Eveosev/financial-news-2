Indonesia ’s rupiah and government
bonds completed a second weekly decline as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus this year spurred sales of the
nation’s assets by overseas funds.  Global investors reduced local-currency debt holdings by
 420 billion rupiah  ($37 million) in the first two days of this
week, following eight weeks of inflows, Finance Ministry data
show. Funds based abroad sold a net $78 million of Indonesian
stocks this week through yesterday, according to exchange data.
U.S. services and manufacturing growth quickened by more than
economists forecast in October, reports showed this month.  “Concern the U.S. recovery will accelerate Fed tapering
spurred the outflows, which weighed on the rupiah,” said Mika
Martumpal, head of treasury research and strategy at PT Bank
CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The rupiah should stabilize going
forward, with the tendency to strengthen until year-end.”  The rupiah dropped 0.7 percent this week and 0.2 percent
today to 11,410 per dollar as of 5:12 p.m. in Jakarta, prices
from local banks show. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
surged 177 basis points, or 1.77 percentage points, to 14.92
percent from Nov. 1.  In the offshore market, one-month non-deliverable forwards
slipped 0.2 percent this week and advanced 0.6 percent today to
11,315 per dollar. The contracts traded 0.8 percent stronger
than the onshore spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A
daily  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 11,267 per
dollar, compared with 11,035 on Nov. 1, according to the
Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The currency and bond yields will return to levels seen in
2009 after the Fed cuts stimulus, Finance Minister Chatib Basri
said today.  The rate on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent government bonds due
May 2023 climbed 18 basis points this week to 7.94 percent,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield
rose four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
