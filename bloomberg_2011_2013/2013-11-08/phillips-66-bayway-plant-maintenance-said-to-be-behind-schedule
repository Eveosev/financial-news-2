Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway refinery in New
Jersey is behind schedule on a maintenance project, said a
person familiar with operations.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day plant will take an extra two or
three weeks to complete work that began in October, said the
person said, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  The turnaround was expected to last 40 days and include
work on the fuel-gas, isomerization and catalytic cracking
units, another person said last year, also asking not to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Rich Johnson , a spokesman at Phillips 66’s headquarters in
Houston, said maintenance was under way at Bayway. He didn’t
comment on when the work might be finished.  Catalytic crackers upgrade oil feedstock to produce higher-value, lighter products such as gasoline. Isomerization units
make unleaded gasoline components to improve the octane level of
the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
