(Corrects amount of increase foreseen in second
paragraph.)   Work to increase the capacity of the
Kirkuk-Ceyhan crude pipeline from Iraq to Turkey will be
completed within months, according to a Turkish government
official.  Daily flows through the link will rise by about 100,000
to 200,000 barrels a day, from the current rate of 300,000 to
400,000 barrels, when improvements to pumping station equipment
in northern Iraq are complete, the official said, asking not to
be identified because the issue hasn’t been publicly announced.  The main northern crude export pipeline, running from
Iraq’s Kirkuk oil fields to the Turkish Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan, operates at far below its designed capacity of 1.6
million barrels a day after years of disrepair amid
international sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s regime and more
recent sabotage attacks.  Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, whose economy has
boomed from oil production since Hussein’s ouster in 2003, is in
disagreement with the central government over the sharing of oil
revenue, and its plans to build a direct link to Turkey.  Kurdistan plans to increase shipments to 400,000 barrels a
day by the end of the year from 300,000 barrels now and is
planning to open a direct 1 million barrel-a-day link to western
Turkey within two years, Ashti Hawrami, the Kurdish Regional
Government’s natural resources minister, said Oct. 31.  The Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipe is controlled by the Iraqi central
government in Baghdad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
