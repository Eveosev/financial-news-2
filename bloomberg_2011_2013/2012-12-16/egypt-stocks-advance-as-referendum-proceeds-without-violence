Egyptian stocks climbed to the
highest level in three weeks after the first round of voting on
the country’s draft constitution, which has divided Islamists
and opposition groups, passed peacefully.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , Egypt’s largest publicly
traded company, climbed 3.6 percent.  Commercial International
Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , the biggest lender by market value, gained for
the third time in four days. The  EGX 30 (EGX30)  advanced 2.7 percent to
5,303.62 at the close in Cairo, the highest since Nov. 22,
bringing the gain in the past four days to 6.6 percent. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the biggest companies in the Gulf
Cooperation Council rose 0.2 percent.  All except one stock on the 30-member index gained, while
government borrowing costs fell after yesterday’s vote, which
followed a wave of protests against President Mohamed Mursi’s
efforts to push the charter through, sometimes escalating into
violent clashes. About 57 percent of voters approved the
constitution in the first round, held almost two years after
 Hosni Mubarak  was toppled, according to the Muslim Brotherhood,
Egypt’s biggest political group, which supports Mursi.  “The overall picture says we’re moving forward with no
violence,” Ramy El Agamy, Cairo-based institutional sales
manager at NBK Capital Securities Egypt, said by phone. “To the
market, ‘yes’ means International Monetary Fund loan and
parliamentary elections, both of which minimize systematic
risk.”  Results will be announced after the second Dec. 22 round.
Supporters argue the charter will pave the way for economic
recovery while opposition groups say it lays the ground for
Islamist dominance while failing to protect basic rights.  Plans on Hold  Egyptian shares are still down 2.5 percent since Nov. 22,
the day Mursi issued a decree to expand his powers. Mursi, an
Islamist politician elected in June, also suspended tax
increases before the referendum and his government asked the IMF
to postpone a decision on an application for a $4.8 billion
loan, originally slated for Dec. 19.  Orascom Construction Industries rose to 252.06 Egyptian
pounds. Commercial International Bank gained 3.7 percent, the
most in a week, to 34.08 pounds.  Egypt raised 1.5 billion pounds of three-month Treasury
bills and 3.5 billion pounds of nine-month notes at an auction
today, according to central bank data. The average 91-day yield
fell for the first time in four weeks, declining 26 basis
points, or 0.26 of a percentage point, to 12.98 percent. The
273-day average yield lost 21 basis points to 13.46 percent.  Elsewhere in the Middle East, Dubai’s DFM General Index
fell 0.5 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained 0.1
percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased 0.4
percent. Kuwait’s  gauge  and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.1
percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  retreated 0.2 percent while
