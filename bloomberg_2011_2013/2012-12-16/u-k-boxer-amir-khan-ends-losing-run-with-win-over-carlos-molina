U.K. boxer Amir Khan rebounded from
two straight losses by defeating previously unbeaten Carlos
Molina in  Los Angeles  last night.  Californian Molina was withdrawn from the non-title contest
by his corner after the 10th round.  Former light-welterweight world champion Khan lost to
Americans Lamont Peterson and Danny Garcia in his two previous
fights. He replaced Freddie Roach with Virgil Hunter as his
trainer after those defeats.  The win takes Khanâ€™s record to 27-3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
