Robert Griffin III will be replaced
at quarterback by Kirk Cousins today for the  Washington Redskins 
in their game at the  Cleveland Browns  because of a mildly
sprained knee ligament.  The Redskins declared Griffin inactive for the game. Rex
Grossman will be the backup to Cousins, who like Griffin is a
rookie.  Griffin, the No. 2 selection in this year’s National
Football League draft, hurt his right knee a week ago in a
31-28 overtime win against the Baltimore Ravens.  Washington has won four straight games and is tied with the
Dallas Cowboys at 7-6, a game behind the  New York Giants  (8-5)
in the National Football Conference East division with
three weeks left in the regular season. The Giants play today at
the Atlanta Falcons (11-2), who have the NFC’s best record.  Griffin, whose 748 yards rushing are an NFL rookie
quarterback record, has completed 66 percent of his passes for
2,906 yards, with 18 touchdowns and four interceptions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
