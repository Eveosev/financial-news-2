Israeli benchmark bonds gained,
pushing the yield to a record low, after a report showed
inflation slowed, spurring bets the central bank may lower
 interest rates  as early as next week to support the economy.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit securities due
in January 2022 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.7 percent at the close in Tel Aviv, the lowest since
the notes started trading in April 2011.  One-year interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, fell for the first time in four days on Dec. 14,
dropping two basis points to 1.78 percent.  Inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in November, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  said Dec. 14, below the 1.8 percent  median
estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Bank of
Israel  kept interest rates at 2 percent last month after
October’s surprise cut. Economic growth may slow to 3.3 percent
this year from 4.6 percent in 2011, central bank estimates show.  “The surprise drop in consumer prices points to further
moderation of inflationary pressure as economic growth slows,”
said Modi Shafrir, chief economist at Tel Aviv-based at I.L.S.
Brokers Ltd. “We now forecast a chance of more than 50 percent
for interest rates to be cut at the end of the month, which is
positive for  government bonds .”  Buying Bonds  The central bank is scheduled to review interest rates on
Dec. 24. I.L.S. Brokers recommends shortening the duration of
government bonds to around five years to take advantage of the
recent decline in longer-term debt. The benchmark bond yield has
plunged 15 basis points this month. The yield on the 4 percent
bonds maturing in January 2018 fell eight basis points today to
2.74 percent.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of similar
maturity, rose seven basis points to 211. That implies an
average annual inflation rate of 2.11 percent, within the
government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for a third day,
retreating 0.2 percent to 280.20. Local funds raised a net 946
million shekels ($250 million) in the week ended Dec. 13
compared with 1.2 billion shekels in previous week, Meitav
Investment House Ltd. reported today. Corporate-bond funds
pulled in 330 million shekels compared with 483 million shekels
a week earlier.  The shekel was little changed at 3.7900 a dollar on Dec.
14. The currency has strengthened 0.7 percent so far this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
