South Korean presidential candidate
Lee Jung Hee abandoned the race, providing a boost for main
opposition contender Moon Jae In as he trails the front-runner
from the ruling party by less than 1 percentage point.  Lee, a candidate from the Unified Progressive Party, is
leaving the contest because allowing the New Frontier Party’s
Park Geun Hye to win would be a “backward step in history,”
according to a statement today on her website. South Koreans
vote Dec. 19 to replace President  Lee Myung Bak , whose five-year
term ends in February.  The departure of minor-opposition candidate Lee further
focus attention on Park and Moon, who will spar tonight in a
televised debate. Lee had 0.9 percent support according to a
poll released Dec. 13 by Realmeter and JTBC.  “Lee’s withdrawal gives Moon the symbolic status of being
the leader of all of  South Korea ’s opposition,” said Sonn Ho Chul, a political science professor at Sogang University in
Seoul. “But with Lee’s approval rating very low, I doubt it
will change the winner and loser of the election.”  Park’s approval rating was at 48 percent while support for
Moon stood at 47.5 percent, according to the survey of 2,000
people taken Dec. 12, which had a 2.2 percentage-point margin of
error.  Tonight’s debate is scheduled for 8 p.m. in  Seoul , and will
focus on social and education issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
