New Zealand’s recovery will be
slower, constraining inflation and adding to the case for
interest rates to stay low for longer, according to a survey by
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc.  Gross domestic product will rise 2.8 percent in the year
ending March 31, 2014, according to the NZIER Consensus
Forecasts released today, compared with 2.9 percent forecast
three months ago. Growth in the current year will be 2.3 percent
from 2.4 percent previously expected, the Wellington-based
institute said in an e-mailed statement.  A slower recovery adds to signs that the central bank will
keep interest rates at a record-low 2.5 percent for longer.
Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler signaled on
Dec. 6 that borrowing costs may not rise until 2014 amid benign
inflation and sluggish demand.  “The grinding recovery means inflation will remain
subdued,” NZIER said in the report. “Forecasters expect
interest rates to be lower for longer, with gradual rate
increases expected from late 2013.”  Annual  inflation  will be 1.4 percent in the year through
March, down from 1.8 percent in September’s forecasts, according
to the survey of 10 economists, which includes seven banks, the
Reserve Bank, the Treasury Department and the institute.  Inflation will be 2.1 percent in the 12 months to March
2014 and 2.4 percent a year later, the survey showed.  Economists forecast slower jobs growth and higher
unemployment over the period to March 2015. The currency will
also be higher than previously expected, the survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
