Misinformation on the shootings at
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,  Connecticut , is being
posted on social media websites, and that will be prosecuted,
Lieutenant J. Paul Vance said in a televised briefing.  He said the last autopsy results on the shooting suspect
and his mother will be reported this afternoon. Vance also said
that they have not released a timeline of the events from Dec.
14 yet. Vance is with the Connecticut State Police.  The social media postings have been inaccurate,
threatening, and people have been posing as the shooter and
others and may be in violation of federal and state laws, Vance
said.  Police officials said itâ€™s much too early to begin to
comment on when the children will return to Sandy Hook
Elementary School.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
