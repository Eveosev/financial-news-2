State-controlled bank Caixa
Economica Federal may have to take control of bankrupt  Rede
Energia SA (REDE4) , Folha de Sao Paulo  reported .  Caixa invested 600 million reais ($287.6 million) in Rede
Energia in 2010 for a 25 percent stake in the power distributor.
After Rede filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 23, Caixa
requested its investment back as a clause in its contract
provides for, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Majority shareholder Jorge Queiroz de Moraes Jr. has 40
days to pay Caixa back 712 million reais, according to the
report. Queiroz already said that he doesn’t have enough money.
If the payment isn’t made, terms of the contract state Caixa may
take control of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
