Spanish opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba was asked to step aside and allow a new
generation to take the Socialists forward by the partyâ€™s
regional chief in  Madrid ,  El Pais  reported.  Tomas Gomez, 44, told Rubalcaba, 61, at a meeting of senior
officials in Madrid yesterday that the party needed new leaders
with fresh ideas, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified
advisers to Gomez.  Gomez was left isolated after the 18 other regional chiefs
present declined to support his call, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
