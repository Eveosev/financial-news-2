New Zealand  consumers are the most
confident in five quarters as the cost of some products falls
and the Christchurch rebuild gathers pace, a survey showed.  An  index  of sentiment rose to 111.1 in the fourth quarter
from 102.5 in the three months through September,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  and McDermott Miller Ltd. said in a statement
today. That’s the highest since the third quarter of 2011. The
proportion of people saying it is a good time to buy a large
household item was the highest in more than a year.  “Confidence has finally taken off,” said Westpac New
Zealand Chief Economist Dominick Stephens. “The accelerating
Canterbury rebuild, slightly better news on the global economy
and low prices for some  consumer goods  carried the day.”  Improving confidence may bolster New Zealand’s economic
recovery as the central bank holds  interest rates  at a record
low. Fourteen of 16 economists surveyed last week by  Bloomberg
News  forecast central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler will leave
borrowing costs unchanged until at least July.  Still, a net 12 percent of consumers said their financial
situation has deteriorated, the lowest since late 2007, Westpac
said. The net figure subtracts pessimists from optimists.  A net 6 percent expect the wider economy will slow over the
next 12 months, the lowest reading in five quarters. A net 29
percent said it was a good time to buy a major item.  The survey was conducted Dec. 1-10 with 1,577 consumers
interviewed. The margin of error is 2.5 percent, according to
Westpac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
