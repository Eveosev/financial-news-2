Naoki Inose won election as the
leader of the Japanese capital of  Tokyo , the city’s government
said today, after serving for more than five years as deputy to
his predecessor, Shintaro Ishihara.  Inose ran in yesterday’s election as an independent, backed
by his former boss and by the main opposition  Liberal Democratic
Party , which won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections
the same day. Ishihara, 80, won a seat in the lower house of
parliament as a member of the Japan Restoration Party, according
to national broadcaster NHK.  Inose, a writer and historian, pledged during his campaign
to replace aging power plants and improve the subway network in
Tokyo, which has a $1 trillion economy that accounts for almost
a fifth of  Japan ’s gross domestic product. He will also continue
a bid to host the Olympics in 2020 and to make Tokyo’s Haneda
airport an international hub, according to his website.  Inose, 66, faced competition from at least seven other
candidates. They included attorney Kenji Utsunomiya, a former
head of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations; former LDP
science minister Takashi Sasagawa; and Shigefumi Matsuzawa, a
former governor of Kanagawa prefecture.  Ishihara last month merged his political party with the
Japan Restoration Party of Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, which was
projected by NHK to win 50 seats in parliament. Ishihara’s
proposal in April to buy a chain of uninhabited islands also
claimed by  China  ultimately prompted Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s government to do so in September, sparking violent anti-
Japan demonstrations in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
