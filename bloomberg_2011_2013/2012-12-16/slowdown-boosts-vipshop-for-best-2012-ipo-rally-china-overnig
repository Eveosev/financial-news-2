Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , the Chinese
web retailer that sells brands from  Calvin Klein  to Nike at a
discount, is handing investors the best returns among foreign
companies that went public in the U.S. this year as slower
growth in the Asian nation stokes demand for low-cost items.  “Vipshop has a business model that works favorably even
when the economy slows,” Donghao Yang, the company’s chief
financial officer, said by e-mail Dec. 14. “U.S. investors
recognize the value of a company like Vipshop that can deliver
strong top and bottom line improvement consistently.”  Shares of  Vipshop  have surged 124 percent since the
Guangzhou-based firm’s March initial public offering. The jump
topped gains for the 17 other non-American companies that
debuted on U.S. exchanges in 2012, and compares with a 44
percent advance in Israel’s  Caesar Stone Sdot Yam Ltd. (CSTE) , which
ranked second, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Vipshop’s rally
beats the 6.4 percent 2012 increase in the  Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S.  Vipshop has surged since September to surpass its IPO
price, after having to sell shares below target in the offering
as demand for Chinese stocks in the U.S. faltered. The stock
climbed 19 percent last week to a record $14.56 Dec. 14. Vipshop
was one of three Chinese companies to undertake IPOs in the U.S.
this year, down from a peak of 42 in 2010. The government cut
China’s annual growth target to the lowest since 2004 in March
as the slowing U.S. and European economies sap demand for the
nation’s exports.  ‘Strong Momentum’  YY Inc. (YY) , the operator of an online social network that is
also based in Guangzhou, has jumped 30 percent to $13.65 since
Nov. 21, when it raised $94.2 million at $10.50 per American
depositary receipt.  Acquity Group Ltd. (AQ) , a Hong Kong-based
company which has most of its customers based in the U.S., has
declined 3.3 percent to $5.81 from its April IPO price of $6.  Vipshop’s outperformance was driven by the company
“delivering on revenues and earnings growth,” Josef Schuster,
founder of Chicago-based Ipox Schuster LLC, which oversees about
$2 billion, said by e-mail Dec. 14. “Vipshop is likely to
continue its strong momentum as long as growth rates can be
maintained.”  The company, whose discount site for branded fashion is
similar to Gilt.com in the U.S., is “right on track” after
posting positive adjusted net income in the third quarter for
the first time since the business started in 2008, CFO Yang said
in a Nov. 14 interview.  Solars Rally  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., surged 1.8 percent Dec. 14 to
a nine-month high of $39.34, extending gains last week to 2.4
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent on
Dec. 14 to 1,413.58, ending the week down 0.3 percent, amid
concerns over  federal budget  negotiations in the U.S.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  -- China’s third-largest maker of solar
panels, based in Changzhou -- surged 34 percent last week in New
York, leading gains in solar stocks. Trina and  Yingli Green
Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  were chosen to receive  government aid  as the
nation offered a second round of subsides for more than 100 new
energy projects.  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the  San Mateo , California-based solar
power provider led by billionaire Elon Musk, jumped 47 percent
in the two days after raising $92 million in its Dec. 12 IPO.  “Chinese solar companies are benefiting from SolarCity’s
IPO and strong debut trading,” Aaron Chew, a senior analyst
with Maxim Group LLC that rates Trina and Yingli hold, said by
phone from New York Dec. 14. “But it won’t help change the
industry fundamentals.”  LDK, Suntech  Trina climbed to a six-week high of $4.14, while Yingli,
based in Baoding, China, rallied 31 percent last week to $2.34,
the highest level since July 20.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels, added 17 percent
to $1.04, the biggest five-day rally in six weeks.  LDK Solar Co. advanced 26 percent for the week to $1.26,
the highest price since Sept. 27. The solar company, which owes
more than $3.1 billion, is seeking consent from bondholders to
take on more debt. Xinyu, China-based LDK will offer investors
10  yuan  ($1.60) for every 10,000 yuan they hold in its notes due
2014, according to a filing Dec. 14.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index climbed 1.4 percent to
95.82 on Dec. 14, extending its jump in the week to 2 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 3.6 percent last
week, and retreated 0.1 percent today to 11,294.11. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 4.3 percent on Dec. 14, the steepest one-
day rally since October 2009, extending its increase last week
to 4.3 percent. The measure is up 0.5 percent today to 2,160.34.  ‘Turning the Corner’  Chinese stocks rallied on Dec. 14 after a preliminary
reading for December on a purchasing managers index issued by
HSBC Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  indicated expansion in
manufacturing for the second month. The data came after reports
last week showed factory output and retail sales rose at the
fastest pace since March.  “Anyone who’s looking at China’s numbers, even the PMI,
will have to see that it’s definitely turning the corner,”
Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Global Finance
Private Capital, which manages $1.7 billion in assets including
emerging-market stocks, said by phone Dec. 14 from Sarasota,
Florida. “This recovery will be durable and long lasting. China
will be our leading investment in  emerging markets  in 2013.”  Youku, Sohu  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU)  added 2.8 percent on Dec. 14 to $16.05 as
Morgan Stanley rated the owner of China’s most-popular video
websites the equivalent of buy in initial coverage. The Beijing-
based company advanced 15 percent last week, the biggest
increase in three months.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , which owns the fifth-most-visited website in
China, jumped 3.4 percent on Dec. 14 to $42.24, the highest
level since Sept. 24. The company’s 12 percent rally for the
week was the most in four months.  Beijing-based Sohu was removed the “Notorious Markets”
list, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a Dec.
13  report . Sohu’s Sogou site reportedly made “notable efforts”
to reduce inclusions of infringing content, the representative’s
office said. Jiang Xin, a spokeswoman for Sohu, declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
