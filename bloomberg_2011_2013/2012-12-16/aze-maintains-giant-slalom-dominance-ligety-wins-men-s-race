Slovenia’s  Tina Maze  continued her
perfect record in World Cup giant slalom ski races this season
by winning a fourth straight race in the discipline. Ted Ligety
of the U.S. took a men’s giant slalom.  Maze was 0.22 second faster than Austria’s Kathrin Zettel
over two runs, with France’s Tessa Worley taking third spot in
Courchevel, France.  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. failed to finish
her first run.  The 29-year-old Maze has a maximum 400 points in the giant
slalom competition, 120 more than Zettel. Worley has 160 points.
Maze also tops the overall competition on 799 points, with
Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch her closest challenger on 468
points.  In Alta Badia, Italy, Ligety closed to within 106 points of
overall World Cup leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway after
dominating today’s race.  The 28-year-old American, who has won three of this
season’s four giant slaloms, was more than two seconds faster
than Austria’s Marcel Hirscher. Thomas Fanara of France was
third.  Ligety tops the giant slalom competition with 360 points, a
lead of 40 over Hirscher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
