(Correct first and second paragraphs to show output from a
unit of the Nigerian National Petroleum Co. is 130,000 barrels a
day.)  Oil production by the Nigerian
Petroleum Development Co., a unit of the state oil company,
climbed to 130,000 barrels a day in December, double 2010
output, according to the state oil company.  NPDC is a unit of Nigerian National Petroleum Co.  NPDC plans to drill 40 wells in the next five years as it
aims to reach output of 250,000 barrels a day by 2015, spokesman
Fidel Pepple said in an e-mailed statement today in Abuja, the
nation’s capital.  Output from  Nigeria ’s Okono 6 and 7 oil fields rose to
12,000 barrels a day, the statement said, without giving a
comparative figure.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and  Eni SpA (ENI)  run joint ventures with NNPC that pump
about 90 percent of the country’s crude.  Total Nigerian crude output was about 1.9 million barrels a
day in November, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  NPDC is the exploration and production subsidiary of NNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
