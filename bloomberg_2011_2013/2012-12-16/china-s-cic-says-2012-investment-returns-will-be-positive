China  Investment Corp., which helps
manage the world’s largest foreign-currency reserves, will make
a profit on its overseas investments this year after a loss in
2011, according to  Jesse Wang , executive vice president of the
sovereign wealth fund.  Monetary easing in Western countries boosted  capital
markets  and investment returns, Wang said yesterday at forum in
Sanya, China. While CIC is investing in Europe, it would do so
more proactively if heavily indebted countries and the European
Union create a more investor-friendly environment, he said.  “Our overseas  investment performance  will be better this
year than last year and we will definitely deliver a positive
return on that and book profits,” Wang said at the forum,
without providing specific figures. “The outlook for the euro-
area debt crisis is still not optimistic and there are still no
bright prospects. CIC will adhere to a principle that will keep
its investment portfolio highly diversified in order to minimize
risk.”  Beijing-based CIC was set up to improve returns on China’s
foreign exchange reserves by investing overseas. It posted a 4.3
percent loss on its international investments last year, its
worst performance since the company was set up in 2007, as
declines in global commodity prices roiled the value of its
resources-heavy portfolio. China had $3.3 trillion of reserves
as of Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
