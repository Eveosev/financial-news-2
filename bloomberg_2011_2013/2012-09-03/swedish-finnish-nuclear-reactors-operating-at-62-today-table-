Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors run
by Vattenfall AB,  EON AG (EOAN) ,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj
are producing at a combined 62 percent of capacity, unchanged
from Aug. 31, according to data from company websites and
calculations by Bloomberg.  Forsmark-1, Oskarshamn-1, Oskarshamn-3 and Ringhals-4 in
Sweden and Loviisa-1 in  Finland  are out of service for
maintenance or repairs. The remaining nine are operating.  EON AG will start its 1,400-megawatt Oskarshamn-3 reactor
tomorrow, it said on Aug. 29 in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot
AS exchange. Vattenfall AB will start its 984-megawatt
Forsmark-1 reactor tomorrow, it said in a filing on Aug. 30.  The table below lists all units and their utilization rates
based on latest available data. It shows current output and
installed capacity in megawatts and utilization in percent.  
* Data for the Loviisa reactors weren’t available on Fortum’s
website. Figures are an estimate based on real-time production
from transmission system operator Fingrid Oyj.  To contact the reporter on this story:
