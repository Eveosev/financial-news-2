Slovakiaâ€™s cumulative budget  deficit 
widened to 2.68 billion euros ($3.37 billion) as of Aug. 31 from
2.02 billion euros in the same period last year, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  Revenue declined 3.3 percent in year to 7.1 billion euros,
trailing expenditures, which rose 4.4 percent to 9.78 billion
euro, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based ministry said on its web
site today. The shortfall was 2.24 billion euros on July 31.  The eight-month deficit represents 73 percent of the full-
year target of 3.68 billion euros. The country, which adopted
the euro in 2009, aims to cut fiscal deficit to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 from 4.8 percent of GDP in the
previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
