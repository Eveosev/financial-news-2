India ’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in four days on speculation yields near the highest
level in two weeks will lure investors.  Yields jumped the most in a month on Aug. 31 as official
data showed gross domestic product rose 5.5 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, exceeding the 5.2 percent gain estimated in
a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Ten-year bond yields in
India are the highest among Asia’s major economies, compared
with 3.39 percent in  China  and 3.00 percent in South Korea.  “Investors probably want to lock in at these levels as
yields are relatively high,” said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based
chief dealer of fixed-income and currencies at  State Bank  of
Bikaner & Jaipur.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.22 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
rose five basis points to 8.24 percent on Aug. 31, the highest
level since Aug. 21.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, declined one
basis point to 7.81 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
