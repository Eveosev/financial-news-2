OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, advanced the most in four weeks as emerging-market
stocks rallied on speculation that China’s government will
announce further stimulus measures.  The shares rose 1.4 percent to 3,630 forint by the close in
Budapest, the biggest jump since Aug. 6. The benchmark BUX stock
index gained 0.5 percent to 17,592.14.  China’s Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.2 in August
from 50.1 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing. A
separate manufacturing gauge released by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and
Markit Economics was at 47.6, indicating the fastest contraction
in more than three years.  “It is a widespread opinion that the data will provide a
good reasoning for Chinese stimulus measures,” Jozsef Miro, a
Budapest-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a
research report today.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index climbed for a second day,
headed for the biggest gain since Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
