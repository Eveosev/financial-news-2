Israel Land Development Co. Energy
Ltd. (IE)  surged the most since 2010 in  Tel Aviv  and Modiin-LP jumped
ahead of drilling results expected this week from the Myra 1
well in which the gas and oil explorers own stakes.  The shares in Israel Land Development Co. Energy soared 29
percent, the most since December 2010, to 0.452 shekel at 2:25
p.m. in Tel Aviv. Modiin climbed 13 percent to 0.221 shekel.  “The anticipation of the initial findings of the results
of the drilling at the Myra 1 well is what is pushing up the
shares,” Richard Gussow, an analyst at DS Securities &
Investments in Tel Aviv, said by phone today.  Israel Land said Aug. 27 that it expects to reach target
layers at the well in the first week of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
