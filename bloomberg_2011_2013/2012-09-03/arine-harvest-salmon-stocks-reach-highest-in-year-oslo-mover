Marine Harvest ASA (MHG)  and  Leroey
Seafood Group ASA (LSG)  rose to the highest levels in more than a year
in Oslo trading on bets for further gains in fish prices as the
market recovers from a slump last year.  Marine Harvest, the world’s biggest salmon farmer, touched
4.6 kroner today, the highest since June 24, 2011, and traded up
1.9 percent at 4.56 kroner as of 12:15 a.m. in Oslo. Leroey, the
second-largest fish farmer, gained 1.7 percent to 117.5 kroner,
the highest since July 26, 2011.  “There’s growing optimism,” said Henning Steffenrud, an
analyst at Swedbank First Securities in Oslo. “It’s looking
very tight toward the end of the year and into 2013. Lower
supply-side growth and even periods with negative supply growth
from  Norway  indicate higher prices, and that’s clearly the
expectation for the salmon sector right now.”  Shares in salmon producers tumbled last year as prices fell
60 percent to 18 kroner ($3.1) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from
April to October amid growing output from Norway and  Chile , the
world’s largest producers. Prices have since recovered to about
26 kroner a kilo, according to the latest update from NOS
Clearing ASA, and are expected to continue rising as supply and
demand rebalance, according to Steffenrud.  Swedbank First Securities forecasts an average salmon price
of 26.5 kroner a kilo in 2012, 29 kroner next year and 30 kroner
in 2014. The bank has a buy recommendation on Marine Harvest
with a target price of 5 kroner a share, and on Leroey with a
target of 130 kroner.  Marine Harvest, of which billionaire  John Fredriksen  owns
21.7 percent, has risen 75 percent this year. Leroey has
advanced 42 percent in the same period.  “Demand has proven to be very strong, because it has
absorbed the volume increases this year at relatively good
prices,” Steffenrud said. “Prices have stayed at an even
better level than what one might expect at this period of the
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
