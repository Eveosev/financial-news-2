On CBS's "Face the Nation" Sunday, Maryland Governor and Obama surrogate  Martin O'Malley  did his cause no favors with his answer to the obvious question from host Bob Schieffer. "Can you honestly say," Schieffer asked, "that people are better off today than they were four years ago?” O'Malley's answer: "No." O'Malley added, "That's not the question of this election." That's not going to fly. O'Malley proceeded to lay out how the  Bush administration  had made mistakes and left President  Barack Obama  playing a terrible hand. Obama partisans have been using this line for four years and have internalized it. Apparently it's so obvious to them that Obama deserves to be graded on a curve that they don't realize how pathetic it sounds to say so. Obama's challenge at this convention is to make the case that his four years were well spent -- not just on health care, foreign policy and social issues, where Obama has clear achievements to highlight, but on the economy. And he has to explain why the next four years can be expected to produce more economic growth than the last four. It's a tough case to make, but it's not optional. As Schieffer responded to O'Malley, "Bush is not on the ballots." (Josh Barro is lead writer for the Ticker.  E-mail  him and  follow  him on Twitter.)
