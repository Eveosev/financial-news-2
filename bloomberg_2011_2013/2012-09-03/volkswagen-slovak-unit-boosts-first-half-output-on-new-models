Volkswagen AG (VOW) â€™s factory in  Slovakia 
raised first-half output by 122 percent as new models and demand
for sport-utility vehicles allowed it to assemble almost the
same number of cars as in all of 2011.  Volkswagen Slovakia AS built about 209,400 cars in the
period, Vladimir Machalik, a spokesman for the unit, said in an
e-mailed statement from Bratislava, Slovakia, today. The amount
compares with 210,441 vehicles assembled for the whole of last
year.  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker began producing the
so-called New Small Family subcompact cars in 2011 in Slovakia,
where it was already assembling Touareg and Audi-brand Q7 SUVs.
The company has said it plans to nearly double output to about
400,000 cars this year.  SUVs accounted for 56 percent of all cars built by June,
according to the statement. The company said today it expects
markets to remain volatile in the second half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
