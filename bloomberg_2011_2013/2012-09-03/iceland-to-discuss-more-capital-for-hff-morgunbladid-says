Iceland Welfare Minister Gudbjartur Hannesson will meet with the Housing Finance Fund later this
week to discuss a 14 billion kronur ($114 million) capital
injection into the state-backed mortgage bank, Morgunbladid
reported.  The government is “concerned” over HFF’s capital adequacy
ratio,  Morgunbladid  cited Hannesson saying. The ratio is at
1.4 percent, far below the at least 5 percent level it needs to
maintain, he said.  The state “stands behind HFF and will continue to do so,”
he told Morgunbladid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
