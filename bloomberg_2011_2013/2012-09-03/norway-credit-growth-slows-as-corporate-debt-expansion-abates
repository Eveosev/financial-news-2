Norwegian credit growth slowed in
July as company borrowing decelerated after the country’s
central bank indicated it may start raising rates at the end of
the year.  Credit growth rose an annual 6.9 percent, compared with 7.1
percent in June,  Statistics Norway  said on its website today.
Household credit growth was 7.2 percent, up from 7.1 percent in
June while borrowing by non-financial enterprises slowed to 6.7
percent from 7.1 percent in June, the office said.  The central bank last week stuck to a plan of raising rates
as soon as December, after keeping the main rate unchanged at
1.5 percent for a third meeting. The bank has cut rates twice
since December to curb krone gains that have hampered exports.
Rate cuts have fueled borrowing and pushed up  house prices  in
the world’s third-richest nation per capita.  To contact the reporter on this story:
