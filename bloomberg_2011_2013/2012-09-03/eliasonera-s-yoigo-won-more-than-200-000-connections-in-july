Yoigo, the Spanish mobile-phone
operator put up for sale by owner  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , said it won
more than 200,000 connections from competitors in July.  “Yoigo has tremendous opportunities to continue to grow
and add lines with small and medium-sized companies in  Spain ,”
Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Taulet, who took over two days
ago, told reporters in Santander, Spain, today.  TeliaSonera AB CEO Lars Nyberg said as recently as July 18
that Yoigo was for sale. TeliaSonera,  Sweden ’s biggest phone
company, on that day lowered its 2012 margin forecast after
sales fell in its mobile phone services and broadband units amid
mounting competition.  Taulet said Yoigo might not be sold as the business is in a
“much better position than in 2008 when there were also rumors
and nothing happened.” Yoigo is focusing on its business and
any decision about a sale is up to the shareholders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
