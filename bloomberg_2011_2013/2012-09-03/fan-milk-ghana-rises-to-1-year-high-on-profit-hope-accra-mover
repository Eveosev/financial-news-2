Fan Milk Ltd. (FML) , a maker of food and
beverage products in  Ghana , rose to the highest in a year as
speculation profit will increase in the third quarter.  The stock gained 4.2 percent to 2.74 cedis as of 2:08 p.m.
in the capital, Accra, the highest since Sept. 2, 2011.  “We expect demand for the company’s products to gain from
political campaigns and rallies, which will become more
prominent from this month forth,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock trader
at Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone
today. “We are expecting profit growth of about 31 percent for
Fan Milk for the nine months ending this month.”  Ghana holds presidential and parliamentary elections in
December. Parties will contest to fill the 230-member parliament
while president John Dramani Mahama will seek to win a second
term for the ruling National Democratic Congress against
opposition New Patriotic Party candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo.  The NPP started its campaign activities on Aug. 29 while
the NDC began theirs the next day.  Fan Milk’s net income increased 31 percent to 13.1 million
cedis ($6.8 million) in the first half through June 30. Revenue
in the six months climbed to 73.3 million cedis from 52.1
million cedis a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
