Turkey ’s bond  yields  rose the most
in almost a month after inflation slowed less than economists
expected last month, threatening the central bank’s forecast for
the end of this year.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds climbed 14 basis points,
or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.75 percent at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest increase since Aug. 7. The lira weakened
0.2 percent to 1.8208 per dollar, retreating for the seventh
time in eight days.  The inflation rate declined to 8.9 percent in August from
9.1 percent in July as food and transport prices rose, the
statistics agency in Ankara said on its website today. The
median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 8.3
percent. The central bank’s  core measure of price growth  which
excludes food and non-alcoholic beverages declined to 7.2
percent in August from 7.5 percent a month earlier.  Oil prices 
advanced 11.5 percent in the three months through August.  “Commodity prices are rising and the lira is not strong,”
Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at Is Investment
Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “The outlook
on inflation is under risk.”  The central bank’s inflation estimate for the end of the
year is 6.2 percent. The rate of price increases is expected at
8.9 percent in December and 7 percent in 2013, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The bank provided 500 million liras ($274.6 million) at its
lowest 5.75 percent funding rate in the one-week repurchase
agreements auction today, compared with 7.5 billion liras
provided Aug. 31. The  average funding cost  for lenders in Turkey
fell to 6.41 percent on Aug. 28, the lowest since Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
