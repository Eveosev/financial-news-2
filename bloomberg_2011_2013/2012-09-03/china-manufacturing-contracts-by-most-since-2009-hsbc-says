China ’s manufacturing contracted at
the fastest pace since March 2009, a private survey showed,
indicating the slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy is
deepening.  The purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics had a final reading of 47.6
for August after a preliminary 47.8 provided Aug. 23. The gauge
was at 49.3 in July. The dividing line between expansion and
contraction is 50.  The report adds to evidence that China’s slowdown is
extending into a seventh quarter after growth decelerated to a
three-year low in the April-June period. A separate
manufacturing purchasing managers index released Sept. 1 by the
government showed the first contraction since November.  “China’s exporters are facing increasing difficulties amid
stronger global headwinds,”  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist
for HSBC in Hong Kong, said in a statement today. “Beijing must
step up policy easing to stabilize growth and foster job market
conditions.”  --Zhou Xin. Editors: Scott Lanman,  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
