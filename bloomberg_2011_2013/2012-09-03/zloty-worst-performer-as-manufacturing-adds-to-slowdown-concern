The zloty declined after a report
showed contraction in Polish manufacturing deepened in August
more than estimated, adding to slowdown concern.  The zloty lost 0.4 percent to 4.1884 per euro as of 6:07
p.m. in Warsaw. The currency gained on Aug. 31 after a three-day
drop that sent it to a five-week low. The yield on five-year
notes fell 3 basis points to 4.30 percent today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing contracted for a fifth month in August as
output decelerated at the fastest pace in more than three years,
HSBC Holdings Plc said today. A purchasing managers’ index fell
to 48.3 in August from 49.7 in July and below the 49.2 median
estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The PMI data “puts increasing pressure for policy response
in the face of a likely deeper than expected economic slowdown
in the coming quarters,”  Agata Urbanska , economist for central
and eastern Europe at HSBC in London, wrote in an e-mailed
comment.  Poland’s central bank, the only one in the European Union
to raise  interest rates  this year, has scope to reduce borrowing
costs if needed as the country’s economy slows, Governor  Marek
Belka  told Bloomberg Television during a weekend conference of
central bankers and economists in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
