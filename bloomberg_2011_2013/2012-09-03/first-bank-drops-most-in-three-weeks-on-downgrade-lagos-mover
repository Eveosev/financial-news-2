First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
nation’s third-largest lender by market value, headed for its
biggest drop in more than three weeks after an 18 percent rally
last month prompted Vetiva Capital Management to downgrade it.  The shares fell 1 percent to 13.4 naira as of 11:11 a.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, retreating the most since Aug. 9
on a closing basis.  First Bank had its best monthly rally in more than three
years after saying July 24 first-half profit more than doubled
to 46 billion naira ($291 million) and as it received regulatory
approval to become a holding company on Aug. 27.  “Whilst we remain upbeat on the fundamentals of First
Bank, following this rally, we review downward our rating on the
counter to reduce, especially as we expect a price ease in the
sessions ahead,” Lagos-based Vetiva said in an e-mailed note
today.  First Bank has jumped 51 percent this year, compared with a
34 percent gain for the  Bloomberg NSE Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which
tracks the performance of  Nigeria ’s 10 most capitalized lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
