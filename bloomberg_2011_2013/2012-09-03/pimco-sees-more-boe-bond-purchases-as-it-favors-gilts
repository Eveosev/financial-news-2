Investors should sell  government
bonds  such as Treasuries because yields will rise in the next
three years as the market demands higher compensation for the
risks of default and inflation, Titanium Capital Ltd. says.  “You’ve got to be bearish on government debt,” Philip Manduca, chief executive at Titanium in London, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “City Central” with
Francine Lacqua and  Guy Johnson . “Whichever way you crack it,
either numbers don’t add up and you get government busts and
downgrades, or you get a situation of debasement and potential
inflation down the road.”  The global economic slowdown and the likelihood of a slide
in stocks also threatens gold and high-grade government bonds
because some investors may have to sell these assets to raise
funds, he said.  “You’ve got to get an equity downleg as the weak economic
growth story continues to exacerbate,” Manduca said. “In a
downleg in equities, all other markets get washed out as people
search for liquidity and margin call payments.”  An index of government bonds around the world has returned
14 percent over the three years through Aug. 31, according to
indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The MSCI  All-
Country Index (MXWO)  of stocks handed investors a gain of 20 percent in
the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
