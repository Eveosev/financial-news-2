Australia  should increase spending
on education by about A$6.5 billion ($6.7 billion) a year as the
nation seeks to create one of the top five schooling systems in
the world by 2025, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said.  “Leaders of Asian nations tell me when I meet with them of
their relentless focus on education,” Gillard said in a speech
in Canberra today. “We mightn’t want to replicate the methods
of their schooling systems but you have to admire their drive
for results.”  Australia is ranked seventh on reading and science and 13th
on mathematics, Gillard said. The nation’s first female prime
minister plans to introduce the Australian Education Act in
parliament this year and wants it passed in 2013, ahead of
elections that must be held in November.  The program, to start in 2014 and funded by federal and
state governments, will focus on improving the quality of
school-teaching, empowering principals to make decisions on
their schools, and using a foundation of reading, writing and
mathematics.  “Every child’s education should be supported with a
benchmark amount of funding: a new schooling resource standard
based on what it costs to educate a student at the schools we
know already get strong results,” Gillard said. The standard
should should apply regardless of whether the school is publicly
or privately funded, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
