Ukraine’s gross domestic product
will expand about 4.5 percent next year, after an estimated
growth of 3.7 percent this year, according to a government
forecast.  The government will cut the corporate income tax rate to 19
percent next year from 21 percent this year, Deputy Finance
Minister Serhiy Rybak said in a statement on the Finance
Ministry website published late Aug. 31. The statement didn’t
disclose any other budget assumptions.  The  World Bank  on July 19 cut its forecast for Ukraine’s
GDP by 0.5 percentage point to 2 percent this year and forecast
3 percent growth next year. Ukraine’s economy expanded 5.2
percent in 2011. The economic growth quickened to 3 percent in
the second quarter, when it made final preparations for the Euro
2012 soccer championship.  The former Soviet republic had a one-time benefit from its
partnership with  Poland  in hosting the premier European  soccer
tournament  in June after the two nations poured $35 billion into
roads, airports, hotels and rail lines. That advantage will
probably wane as the euro-area debt crisis trims demand for
exports such as metals, which generate more than 50 percent of
GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
