An opinion poll shows Egyptian
President Mohamed Mursi’s approval rating at 77 percent after
his first 60 days in office, the independent  Al-Masry Al-Youm 
newspaper reported today.  The poll, carried out by the Egyptian Center for Public
Opinion Research, indicates that 13 percent of the 1,142 people
surveyed by phone on Aug. 30 were dissatisfied with Mursi’s
performance while 10 percent were undecided, the newspaper said.  The survey, the first conducted on Mursi since he was sworn
into office on June 30, found that 60 percent would vote for him
if new elections were held while 18 percent said they wouldn’t
and 22 percent were undecided. The survey had a margin of error
of three percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
