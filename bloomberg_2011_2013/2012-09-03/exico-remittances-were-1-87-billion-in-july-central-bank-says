Mexican remittances were $1.87
billion in July compared with $1.91 billion in the same month
last year, the central bank said today on its website.  The median estimate of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for remittances to reach $2 billion in June.  Remittances are  Mexico â€™s biggest source of foreign currency
after auto exports and oil production. The money sent home by
Mexican nationals living in the U.S. has historically accounted
for more than 95 percent of remittances, according to the
Washington-based  Inter-American Development Bank .  U.S. economic expansion cooled in the second quarter, and
consumers and companies may continue to curb spending in the
second half of the year as rising fuel costs, unemployment and
the prospect of tax changes and government budget cuts hurt
confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
