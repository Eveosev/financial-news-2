Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, reached an agreement with its union workers to
end the costliest strike in the company’s history.  An Aug. 30 accord between labor representatives and Hyundai
was backed by 53 percent of the company’s 45,000 guild members,
according to a  statement  on the union’s website today.  The agreement, which will raise the average compensation by
27.3 million won ($24,000) and discontinue overnight shifts,
ends the first legally sanctioned walkouts at the carmaker since
2008. Seoul-based Hyundai Motor estimates the dispute cost the
company a record 1.7 trillion won in lost production.  “It’s definitely good news but the production loss was
worse than expected and will most likely have a negative impact
on the company’s third-quarter earnings,” said Lee Sang Hyun,
an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. “However, Hyundai
will be able to make up for the losses in the fourth quarter and
meet their yearly sales target by end of the year.”  Hyundai  shares  fell 1.9 percent to 237,000 won as of 11:30
a.m. in Seoul trading as the strike led the company’s monthly
sales, reported yesterday, to fall for the first time since May
2009. The benchmark Kospi index was little changed.  The wage agreement includes a 98,000 won increase in
monthly base salary, a one-time payout of 9.5 million won and
bonuses worth 500 percent of a worker’s monthly salary,
according to a separate statement on the union’s website. This
is equivalent to an average of 27.3 million won extra per
person, according to the statement.  New Shifts  The pact will also end overnight shifts from March next
year. Employees will now work from 6:40 a.m. to 3:20 p.m. or
3:20 p.m. to 1:10 a.m. as Hyundai ends 24-hour staffing of
assembly lines.  The company will invest about 300 billion won in equipment
and facilities to maintain output after working hours are
reduced, according to an e-mailed statement on Aug. 30.  While Hyundai Motor has periodically faced partial
stoppages in the past four years because of labor disputes, none
were legally sanctioned and they rarely lasted beyond several
hours. The last formal strike occurred in 2008, when a 12-day
walkout cost the company an estimated 44,645 vehicles, or 691
billion won, according to Hyundai.  Hyundai estimates labor disputes had caused missed
production of more than 1 million vehicles and lost sales worth
11.6 trillion won before this year. Workers went on strike in 21
of the first 22 years since the union’s 1987 formation.  Overseas Plants  Hyundai has reduced the impact of strikes in  South Korea  by
expanding production in the U.S.,  China ,  India  and  Turkey  during
the last decade.  A new plant in China started production earlier this year
and another plant is scheduled to open in  Brazil  at the end of
this year, according the company.  South Korean plants accounted for 46 percent of Hyundai
Motor’s production capacity in 2011, down from 60 percent in
2008, when the last strikes took place, and 93 percent in 2000.  Worldwide, Hyundai sold 2.8 million vehicles for the first
eight months of this year, up 8.6 percent from a year earlier,
according to an e-mailed statement. Hyundai, together with
affiliate Kia, is also bucking the slump in  Europe  by increasing
sales in the shrinking market.  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , an affiliate of Hyundai, is still
negotiating this year’s wage pact with its union.  The nation’s second-largest automaker has lost 757.7
billion won or 45,995 units in production from strikes that
began in July 13, Kia said in an e-mailed statement. Workers
will go on another partial strike tomorrow, according to a
statement on the union’s website.  The automaker will probably report a third-quarter profit
of 2.2 trillion won, according to the average of 22  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
