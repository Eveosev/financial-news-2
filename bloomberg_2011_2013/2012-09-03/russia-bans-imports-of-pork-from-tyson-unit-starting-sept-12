Russia barred imports of frozen
boneless pork produced by a unit of  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  after
laboratory tests found listeria in the meat, according to the
national food-safety watchdog.  The temporary ban on pork from Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. takes
effect Sept. 12,  Rosselkhoznadzor , as the service is known, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Tyson Fresh Meats  is a division
of Tyson Foods, Alexei Alekseenko, the serviceâ€™s spokesman, said
by phone in Moscow.  Tyson Foods, based in Springdale,  Arkansas , made no
immediate reply to an e-mailed request for comment from
Bloomberg sent outside of business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
