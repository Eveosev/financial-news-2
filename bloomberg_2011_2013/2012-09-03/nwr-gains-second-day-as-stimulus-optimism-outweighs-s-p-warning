New World Resources Plc (NWR)  dropped as
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may downgrade the company’s credit
rating, outweighing jumps in prices of coal and metals.  The stock of the biggest Czech producer of coking coal slid
0.2 percent to 88 koruna at the close in Prague. NWR has dropped
35 percent this year, having reached its lowest in three years
on Aug. 30.  S&P cut the outlook on NWR’s BB- credit rating to negative
from stable on Aug. 31 after the market closed, citing risks of
a downgrade in the next 12 months as low coking-coal prices
threaten to dent the company’s earnings.  “We consider the news negative,” Bohumil Trampota, a
stock analyst at J&T Banka AS in  Prague , wrote in a report to
clients today. “Coking-coal prices considerably declined and
will probably not go up in the nearest period.”  The stock earlier rose as much as 2.6 percent as basic
resources companies were among the biggest gainers in  Europe 
after worse-than-expected economic data from China and the euro
area boosted speculation that central banks will add to
stimulus. Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives rose 0.9 percent
to $100.6 a metric ton in the Netherlands, a second day of
gains. The next-year contract is down 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
