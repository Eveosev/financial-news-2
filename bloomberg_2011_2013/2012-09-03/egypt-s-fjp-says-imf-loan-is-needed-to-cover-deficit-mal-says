A $4.8 billion International
Monetary Fund loan is the only way Egypt can bridge a budget
deficit likely to reach $25 billion,  Al Mal  reported, citing a
senior  Freedom and Justice Party  official.  The country doesn’t have other options to raise funds, such
as issuing Islamic Sukuk, in the absence of a parliament that
could approve them, the newspaper said, citing Abdallah Shehata,
who heads the Islamist party’s economic committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
