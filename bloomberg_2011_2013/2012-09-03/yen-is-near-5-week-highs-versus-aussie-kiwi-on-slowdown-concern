The euro weakened versus most of its
major counterparts amid concern policy measures from the
 European Central Bank  may not be enough to contain the region’s
debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency declined from almost a two-month
high against the dollar as ECB President  Mario Draghi  said the
central bank would be willing to buy bonds of maturities as
longs as three years. The U.S. currency gained as global stocks
and commodities fell even after a report showed manufacturing in
the U.S.  contracted  for a third month, adding to speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will announce another round of monetary easing.  “It’s not a popular view that Draghi would go back on his
commitments from the previous meeting, so most people are
anticipating what he will say,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head
of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in
New York. “I now think the big event of the week is Friday,
with U.S. payroll data pushing the Fed toward a decision.”  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2566 at 5:01 p.m. New York
time, after climbing to $1.2638 on Aug. 31, the strongest since
July 2. The shared currency was little changed at 98.57 yen,
after appreciating to 99.03 yen on Aug. 31, the strongest since
Aug. 21. The yen fell 0.2 percent to 78.43 per dollar.  Euro Sale  “You sell the euro; there’s a lot already priced in and we
pretty much know what the ECB is going to do,”  Sebastien Galy ,
a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in
New York, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch
Money” with Sara Eisen. “They’re probably going to purchase
bonds in the two-year area, conditional on  Spain  asking for
help.”  The euro has dropped 4.1 percent this year, the worst
performance among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen declined 2.9
percent, and the dollar weakened 0.7 percent.  The common currency faces “good resistance” in the
$1.2684-to-$1.2692 range,  Tom Fitzpatrick  and Shyam Devani,
technical strategists at Citigroup Global Markets, wrote today
in a research note.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose 0.2 percent to 81.346 as the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory  index  fell to 49.6
last month, the lowest since July 2009, from 49.8 in July, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today.  Jobs Data  The  U.S. economy  added 125,000 payroll jobs in August,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
87 economists before the Labor Department report Sept. 7. That
compared with an increase of 163,000 jobs in July.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as 0.7
percent, while the MSCI World Index of stocks fell 0.4 percent.  Australia’s dollar declined 0.2 percent against its U.S.
counterpart after gaining as much as 0.4 percent. The central
bank kept its  overnight cash-rate target  at 3.5 percent. It
earlier fell to $1.0224, the weakest level since July 25. The
Aussie was little changed at 80.19 yen after sliding 0.9 percent
yesterday.  The nation’s economy expanded 0.7 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months for the strongest first
half of growth since 2007, a  Bloomberg News  survey showed before
a government report tomorrow.  New Zealand’s dollar tumbled against the greenback even as
the nation posted its first gain in commodity export prices
since January. The so-called kiwi fell 0.4 percent to 79.45 U.S.
cents and declined 0.2 percent to 62.31 yen.  ECB Plan  Draghi said yesterday the bank’s primary mandate compels it
to intervene in bond markets to wrest back control of  interest
rates  and ensure the euro’s survival. The ECB announces its next
policy decision on Sept. 6.  Mounting his strongest case yet for ECB bond purchases,
Draghi told lawmakers in a closed-door session at the European
Parliament in Brussels that the bank has lost control of
borrowing costs in the 17-nation monetary union. Bloomberg News
obtained a recording of his comments, some of which were
published by Italian news agency AGI yesterday.  There are growing “expectations for some kind of ECB bond-
buying intervention,” said Eimear Daly, a currency analyst at
Monex Europe in  London . “Everyone is completely fixated on the
bond-buying plan.”  European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  traveled to
Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today as
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti hosts French President
 Francois Hollande  in Rome.  Traders and strategists are more divided than at any time
since 2011 over whether officials will be able to keep the
currency from tumbling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  At about $1.26, the euro is 3.3 percent above the $1.22
median year-end estimate of more than 50 analysts, after the gap
expanded to 3.8 percent last week. The last time the euro
exceeded the consensus by that much was in July 2011, and it
tumbled 9.4 percent in the next 10 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
