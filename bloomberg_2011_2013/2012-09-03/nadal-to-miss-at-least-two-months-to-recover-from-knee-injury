Rafael Nadal  will miss at least two
more months as the former top-ranked tennis player recovers from
a knee injury.  The Spaniard won’t participate in his country’s Davis Cup
semifinal against the U.S., according to a statement released
today on his website.  The 11-time Grand Slam champion has a partial tear of the
patella tendon as well as inflammation in the knee, according to
the statement, and being treated with drugs and physical
therapy. He announced a plan to skip some events before the
Olympics, and has also missed the  U.S. Open .  “I really want to be back competing and enjoying the
tennis tour, but I have many years in front of me and my knee
needs some rest,” he said in the statement. “I will be back
when I have no pain and able to compete.”  Nadal, ranked No. 3 in the world, said on July 4 that he
had tendinitis in one of his knees. The announcement came the
week after he lost to No. 100-ranked Lukas Rosol in the second
round at Wimbledon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
