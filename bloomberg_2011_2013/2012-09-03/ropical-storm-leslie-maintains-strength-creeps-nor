Tropical Storm Leslie crept closer
to  Bermuda , where it may arrive this weekend as a hurricane,
according to the  National Hurricane Center .  Leslie has top winds of 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour
and is moving north-northwest at 3 mph, an  advisory  released
just before 5 p.m.  New York  time showed. The storm’s center was
about 585 miles south of Bermuda.  “Large swells propagating away from the tropical cyclone
will affect Bermuda and nearly all of the U.S. East Coast for
much of the week,” John Cangialosi, a specialist for the
hurricane center in Miami, said in a forecast analysis.  Leslie is the 12th storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season ,
which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has its statistical peak
on Sept. 10. Last week, Hurricane Isaac struck coastal  Louisiana 
as a Category 1 storm that closed 95 percent of oil production
and 73 percent of natural gas output in the  Gulf of Mexico .  On its current  track , Leslie is expected to near Bermuda
this weekend as a Category 2 storm with winds of 100 mph,
according to the center.  Farther to the east, Tropical Depression 13, formed about
1,350 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The
system, with top winds of 35 mph, is expected to strengthen into
Tropical Storm Michael without ever becoming a threat to land.  To contact the reporters on this story:
