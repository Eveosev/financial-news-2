Islamists groups in  Mali  have moved
south, taking control of Douentza, a town 190 kilometers (118
miles) from the central city of Mopti, according to a spokesman
for the organizations.  Ansar ud Dine and MUJAO took the area on the morning of
Sept. 1 and are setting up checkpoints, Oumar Hamaha said by
phone yesterday. They seized weapons from local militias, he
said.  The fighters took control of nothern Mali along with the
National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, which is seeking
a separate nation for the area. The groups have since split,
with Ansar ud Dine and MUJAO attempting to install Shariah law
in the area.  Hamaha said they will institute the rule in Douentza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
