Chinese shares  rose for the first
time in four days after the first contraction in manufacturing
in nine months spurred speculation the government will introduce
more stimulus measures.  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the nation’s largest developer by market
value, gained the most in two months after SouFun Holdings Ltd.
said August home prices increased.  Citic Securities Co. (600030) , China’s
biggest listed brokerage, paced gains among brokerages after the
China Securities Regulatory Commission allowed trust companies
to resume investing in equities. Manufacturing slowed further in
August, surveys of  purchasing managers  showed Sept. 1 and today,
with one gauge at the lowest level since March 2009.  “The PMI has led to more concern that the economy is
worsening,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “Investors’ confidence is quite low and the
latest numbers don’t help the situation. However, the silver
lining for this situation is there may be more possibilities of
reserve ratio requirement cuts and other loosening measures.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.6 percent to 2,059.15
as of the close, rebounding from the lowest level since February
2009. The gauge trades at 9.3 times estimated earnings, the
lowest level since January, according to weekly  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Trading value sank to 35 billion yuan ($5.6 billion)
on Aug. 31, the  lowest  since Dec. 31, 2008.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rallied 1.1 percent to 2,228.37. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  advanced 0.5 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
0.2 percent in New York.  Deepening Slowdown  Signs that China’s economic slowdown is deepening have
dragged the Shanghai Composite down 7.5 percent this quarter.
The gauge sank 2.7 percent in August, a fourth straight month of
declines. That’s the longest streak since August 2004, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. shares rallied on Aug. 31 after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s 24-page speech at the Kansas City
Fed’s symposium made the case for further monetary easing and
concluded that the central bank’s non-traditional policy tools
such as bond purchases have been effective in boosting growth
and improving financial conditions.  The Purchasing Managers Index  fell  to 49.2 in August from
50.1 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing. A
separate manufacturing PMI released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics was at 47.6, indicating the fastest
contraction in more than three years.  PBOC Policy  China should “decisively” expand the strength of its
fine-tuning in accordance to the changes in the economy and
markets, People’s Daily said in a front-page essay by an
unidentified commentator. The nation should have a “reserve”
of fiscal, tax, financial, foreign trade and industrial policies
to counter complex and difficult situations and study a suitable
time to activate these policies, according to the commentary.  Policy makers lowered  interest rates  in June and July after
two reductions in reserve-requirement ratios for lenders this
year as the economy expanded at the slowest pace since 2009. An
index of non-manufacturing industries released today showed an
expansion to 56.3 in August from 55.6 the previous month.  The property gauge was the best performer among five
industry groups on the Shanghai index today, rising 3.3 percent.
China Vanke gained 3.4 percent to 8.29  yuan  in Shenzhen.  Poly
Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  surged 7.7 percent to 10.13 yuan, the
biggest advance since Jan. 4.  Sales Volume  China’s home prices rose 0.24 percent in August from a
month earlier to 8,738 yuan ($1,377) a square meter, said
SouFun, the country’s biggest real estate website owner, in a
statement today. Citigroup Inc. said in a report dated Aug. 31
Chinese property shares are set to rally as sales volume
rebounds.  Citic Securities gained 2.9 percent to 10.52 yuan.  Haitong
Securities Co. (600837) , the country’s second-largest brokerage by market
value, advanced 4.6 percent to 8.64 yuan. China will reopen its
stock markets to trust companies to help increase the number of
investors, according to a statement posted on the  China 
Securities Regulatory Commission website.  The notice , posted on
Aug. 31, didn’t specify when the change will take effect.  Policy makers are trying to revive confidence in  capital
markets  and boost economic growth, as the Shanghai Composite
fell on Aug. 31 to the lowest level since February 2009.  Brokerages to Rally  The regulator has already announced a 20 percent reduction
in transaction fees on equities trading. That cut will save
investors 600 million yuan in the last four months of the year,
the regulator estimated on Aug. 2.  “The government has been releasing a lot of positive
measures for brokerages,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund
manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.
“In the medium term, brokerage stocks look likely to rally, as
these new businesses will improve their profitability.”  Everbright Securities Co. (601788)  rallied 3.1 percent to 11.34
yuan. The brokerage said on Aug. 31 it won approval for a margin
financing trial, according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock
Exchange.  Weichai Power Co. (000338) , China’s biggest maker of heavy-duty
trucks, jumped 5.2 percent to 17.99 yuan in Shenzhen trading,
the largest increase since February 2011, after agreeing to a
738 million euro ($927 million) investment in forklift maker
Kion Group GmbH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
