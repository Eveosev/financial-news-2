Keppel Corp., (KEP)  the world’s largest
oil-rig maker, said its group including Budimex SA won a
contract to build a 300 million zloty ($90 million) energy-from-
waste heat and power plant in  Poland .  The partners, which also include CESPA Compania Espanola de
Servicios Publicos Auxiliares SA, will construct the facility
for Bialystok’s municipal solid-waste management company
Przedsiębiorstwo Usługowo-Handlowo-Produkcyjne, Keppel said in a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange today.  The plant will have annual capacity to process about
120,000 tons of waste, reducing the quantity of waste sent to
the landfill site in Hryniewicze, Poland, to about 12 percent
from more than 90 percent, according to the statement. Keppel
will execute 49.6 percent of the work by project value, it said.  The bid by Keppel and its partners “was able to offer the
best technical solution particularly in terms of energy
production, with low emissions to the atmosphere at low
operational cost,” Janusz Marek Szymczukiewicz, president of
the Polish waste management company, said in the statement.  The plant will also generate 7.5 megawatts of electricity
in summer and will supply 17.5 megawatts of thermal energy to
the municipal’s district heating in the winter, according to
Singapore-based Keppel.  Budimex (BDX)  is Poland’s largest builder. Construction for the
project will start in the first quarter of 2013, with completion
expected in 2015, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
