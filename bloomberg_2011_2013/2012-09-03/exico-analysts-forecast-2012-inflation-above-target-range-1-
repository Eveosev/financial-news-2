Mexico economists expect inflation
to end the year above the central bank’s target range, the
highest estimate for this year, as a bird flu outbreak and
drought push prices higher.  Economists forecast year-end inflation of 4.01 percent, up
from 3.91 percent the month before and 3.81 percent in July,
according to a monthly central bank survey published today on
its website. The central bank targets inflation of 2 percent to
4 percent.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.45 percent in mid-August
from 4.42 percent at the end of July as the bird flu outbreak
and drought pushed up the cost of poultry, eggs and corn.  “We have to be alert,” Sergio Martin, chief economist at
HSBC Mexico SA, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
“But we aren’t worried, because the rise is in non-core
inflation,” mainly farm prices, Martin said.  Economists in today’s survey forecast the economy will
expand 3.75 percent this year. Economic growth beat economists’
forecasts in the second quarter, with gross domestic product
expanding 0.9 percent from the previous three months, an
annualized rate of 3.5 percent, as exports increased 5.8 percent
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
