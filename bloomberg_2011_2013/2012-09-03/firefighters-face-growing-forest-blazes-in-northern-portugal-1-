Portuguese firefighters are battling
blazes in the north of the country amid strong winds and high
temperatures that have helped spread the forest fires, a civil
protection official said.  “Low humidity levels, moderate to strong winds and high
temperatures are all factors that have had a major impact on
these forest fires,” Patricia Gaspar, operations assistant for
the civil protection authority, said by phone today.  “These weather conditions are expected to remain in place
until the end of the week,” she said.  Portugal , where authorities are normally on alert for fires
from July to September, has asked the European Union for four
planes to help fight the blazes after a Russian-made Kamov
helicopter involved in the operations crashed, Gaspar said.  Both the pilot and co-pilot survived the crash with minor
injuries, broadcaster SIC Noticias reported today.  The number of blazes listed as burning for more than two
hours or requiring more firefighting equipment rose to 12 at
1:30 p.m. from six this morning and were located in the
districts of Santarem, Coimbra, Aveiro, Porto, Castelo Branco,
Guarda and Viseu, according to the  civil protection authority’s
website .  Firefighters are also trying to extinguish a
“significant” blaze in the southern district of Beja, the
civil protection authority said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
