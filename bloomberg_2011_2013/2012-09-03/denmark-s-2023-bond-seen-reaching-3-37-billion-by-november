Denmark  received bids for more than
twice the amount offered in the country’s new 10-year bond as
the debt office prepares to replace its existing benchmark note
in that maturity.  The debt office in Copenhagen sold 5.03 billion kroner
($851 million) in its November 2023 note, which offers a 1.5
percent coupon. The yield at the auction, which attracted bids
for 10.44 billion kroner, was 1.46 percent, the central bank
said today.  Denmark will probably have issued 20 billion kroner in the
new bond by November, allowing the 2023 note to replace the
existing 10-year bond as the nation’s benchmark in that maturity
in about two months, according to  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Denmark’s
biggest lender and a primary dealer.  “They ought not to have any problems reaching 20 billion
kroner by November,” Jens Peter Soerensen, Danske Bank chief
bond analyst in Copenhagen, said by phone yesterday. “They have
a luxury problem, as demand is still very strong.”  Denmark pays less than  Germany  to borrow over 10 years and
has charged investors to hold its two-year debt through most of
July and August. The government, which boasts a debt ratio
that’s less than half the euro-zone average, estimates its
borrowing need will slump 29 percent next year as the  budget
deficit  narrows to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product.  ‘Decent Size’  “We need to have a decent size outstanding, big enough for
it to be attractive to international investors, before it can
become a benchmark,” Ove Sten Jensen, head of debt issuance at
the central bank, said in an interview yesterday. “It’s also a
question of the old benchmark having a time till expiration that
harmonizes with its benchmark maturity.”  Jensen’s office will “reach out to the primary dealers and
try to get a sense of what kind of timing they think would be
appropriate for a shift between the two series,” he said.  The yield on Denmark’s existing 10-year benchmark bond --
the 3 percent note due November 2021 -- rose three basis points
to 1.176 percent as of 10:26 a.m. local time. That’s 24 basis
points less than similar-maturity German bunds. Two-year Danish
debt yielded minus 0.129 percent, 10 basis points less than
bunds.  Investors should sell short-term Danish bonds and instead
buy the new 1.5 percent note due 2023, Danske said in a note
last week.  “It’s better to buy the note now before it becomes a
benchmark,” Soerensen said. “Because once the switch has been
made, it will obviously be more expensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
