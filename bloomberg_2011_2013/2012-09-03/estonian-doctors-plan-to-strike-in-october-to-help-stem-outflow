Estonian doctors called a strike for
next month after attempts to negotiate wage increases with the
government and employers failed.  The main goal of the work stoppage is to prevent doctors
and nurses from emigrating, the doctors’ union said in an e-
mailed statement today. The duration of the strike hasn’t been
decided.  About a quarter of  Estonia ’s 4,000 specialized doctors are
above pension age, and more than a third of all physicians are
considering working abroad, the union said in June.  Doctors in the  North Estonia Medical Center , the country’s
biggest hospital, earn an average monthly wage of 2,296 euros
($2,893), compared with the national average of 900 euros, while
they exceed nominal workloads by 43 percent on average, the
hospital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
