Indian stocks fell to their lowest
level in a month after data showed manufacturing expanded at the
slowest pace in nine months in August and as the political
standoff between the government and the opposition continued.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) , the third-largest producer by
market value, slumped to the lowest level in more than three
years. The purchasing managers’ index slid to 52.8 from 52.9 in
July, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today. A
number above 50 indicates growth.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , the biggest
non-state electricity generator, lost 2 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, slid 0.3 percent
to 17,384.40 at close, the lowest level since Aug. 3. The gauge
lost 2 percent last week, its first weekly decline in five. The
 Bharatiya Janata Party , the main opposition party, stalled
parliament for a ninth day, demanding Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to quit after the nation’s chief auditor on Aug. 17 found
the government may have lost $33 billion awarding coalfields
without holding auctions.  “The economy is faced with multiple challenges,” Deven Choksey, managing director at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities
Pvt. in Mumbai, said by telephone today. Still, “the move on
GAAR is rational and could pave the way for more equity inflows
and also for FDI money into India.”  The Sensex has increased 13 percent this year as foreign
funds have pumped in $12.3 billion into Indian stocks. Overseas
investors sold a net $26.3 million of equities on Aug. 31, the
first sale after 23 straight days of purchases, data from the
market regulator show.  The Sensex trades at 13.7 times  estimated earnings , more
than the 10.8 multiple for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ,
which has risen 3.9 percent in 2012.  Parliament Stalled  The standoff has stalled legislation. Singh was relying
upon the parliamentary session to revive his reforms agenda and
boost economic  growth  as policy gridlock over attempts to open
up the economy, graft scandals and elevated inflation deter
investment.  India last year halted a plan to allow Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and other foreign companies to open supermarkets, while an anti-
corruption bill and proposals to permit foreign investment in
aviation are also stalled. The $1.8 trillion economy, Asia’s
third largest, expanded 6.5 percent in the year ended March 31,
the slowest pace since 2003. Growth may be a “little better”
than last year, Singh said Aug. 15.  Stocks fell today even as a draft report released on Sept.
1 by a government panel suggested delaying the implementation of
the General Anti-Avoidance Rule by three years. Foreigners
turned net sellers of Indian stocks in April and May on concern
the plan, announced by former finance minister  Pranab Mukherjee 
in March, would indiscriminately apply to their holdings.  India VIX  Jindal Steel slumped 2.2 percent to 344.50 rupees, its
lowest close since May 26, 2009. Tata Power lost 2 percent to
97.55 rupees and  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of British luxury car
brands Jaguar and Land Rover, declined 1.5 percent to 230.9
rupees, the lowest level in three weeks.  Two-wheeler makers rallied.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , which
tumbled 8.9 percent last week, jumped 2 percent to 1,798.95
rupees.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT)  climbed 2.8 percent to 1,662.50 rupees
after losing 5.5 percent last week.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, slid 0.1 percent to 17.28.
The Nifty fell 0.1 percent to 5,253.75 while its September
futures traded at 5,273.10. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  lost 0.3 percent
to 2,118.46. The top two bourses traded 787 million shares on
Aug. 31, compared with a 12-month daily average of 888 million
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
