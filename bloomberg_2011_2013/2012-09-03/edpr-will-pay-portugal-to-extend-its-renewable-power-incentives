EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR)  expects to pay as
much as 4 million euros ($5 million) a year from 2013 to 2020 in
exchange for  Portugal  extending incentives for renewable-energy
generation as part of a government program to cut power costs.  The payments, estimated at 3.6 million to 4 million euros,
will improve “visibility” on the incentives the unit of EDP-
Energias de Portugal SA will receive, it said in a  statement .  Under the deal with the state and wind industry, developers
may pay to extend their 15 years of subsidies to 20 to 22 years,
using four tariff plans, according to Oviedo, Spain-based EDPR.  The payments will help cover power-system costs, it said.  The government last week said savings from the program may
reach 140 million euros over the eight years to 2020 after it
agreed with wind developers to curb the cost of subsidies
awarded for projects under legislation prior to 2005.  EDPR has 615 megawatts covered by the deal, or about 8
percent of total installed capacity, according to the company.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
