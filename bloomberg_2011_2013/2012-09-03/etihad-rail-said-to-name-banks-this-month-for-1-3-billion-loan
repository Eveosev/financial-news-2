Abu Dhabi ’s Etihad Rail, which is
building the United Arab Emirates’ first rail network, will take
a decision this month on a $1.3 billion loan to fund the first
phase of the project, two bankers familiar with the plan said.  The loan will have a maturity of five or ten years and
payments will be backed by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the main
user of the railway, according to the bankers, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private.  Etihad Rail’s initial segment will link the Shah natural
gas field, southwest of Abu Dhabi, to oil and gas treatment
facilities at Habshan, closer to the Emirate’s coast, and to the
port at Ruwais. The first line between Habshan and Ruwais will
start operating in 2013 with the extension to Shah, about 266
kilometers (165 miles) from the coast, following a year later.  Banks will be lending to Etihad Rail, which in turn has
signed an agreement with Adnoc that it will get paid for the
services it provides, the bankers said.  Etihad Rail wasn’t able to immediately comment when its
public relations company was contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
