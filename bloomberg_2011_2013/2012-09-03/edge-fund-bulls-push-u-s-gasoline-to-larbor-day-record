Hedge funds  raised bullish bets on
 gasoline  to more than a three-month high, helping push prices at
the pump to record levels for the U.S. Labor Day holiday, as
Hurricane Isaac roared toward the  Gulf of Mexico  and a deadly
blast closed  Venezuela ’s largest refinery.  Money managers increased net-long positions, or wagers on
rising prices, by 3 percent in the seven days ended Aug. 28,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report on Aug. 31. They were the highest
since the week ended May 1.  Gasoline futures have advanced 22 percent from a 2012 low
in June as stockpiles dropped and refineries closed. Futures
reached a four-month high last week as Isaac closed 13 percent
of fuel-making capacity on the  Gulf coast  and a gas explosion at
Venezuela’s Amuay plant shut production, threatening to revive
the debate about energy costs as President  Barack Obama  seeks
re-election. Crude oil, buoyed by Middle East tension and the
prospect of fiscal stimulus, also boosted the motor fuel.  “Everyone is pretty bullish,”  Stephen Schork , president
of Schork Group Inc., a consulting firm in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said by phone Aug. 31. “The bottom line is we
have a dearth of refining capacity and not enough ability to
make gasoline. On top of that, we’ve had a big rally in oil.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 2 percent in the week
covered by the report to $3.1261 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and closed at $3.1056 on Aug. 31, when they
expired. The fuel jumped 6.6 percent in August.  Pump Prices  Regular  gasoline  at service stations, averaged nationwide,
cost $3.827 a gallon on Sept. 1, a record for the date and the
highest level since April 25, according to data from Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group, compiled by
Bloomberg. It remained at that level yesterday, 4.6 percent more
than a year earlier.  “We expect it to continue to break highs the next few days
at least,”  Michael Green , a spokesman for AAA in Washington,
said Aug. 30 by e-mail. “We wouldn’t expect the price to change
too much by the end of the weekend.”  The increase is helping reignite an issue that has pitted
Obama, who has called for the elimination of billions of dollars
of subsidies enjoyed by the oil and gas industry, against  Mitt Romney , the Republican nominee.  Gasoline for October delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$2.9333 in the week covered by the report and settled at $2.9728
on Aug. 31. The futures were up 1.7 cents at $2.9898 at 1:15
p.m. in  New York . The discount to September fuel reflects
speculation that demand will slip as the driving season ends
with Labor Day today, and the switch to winter-grade fuel that’s
cheaper to produce and needs to meet less-stringent emissions
rules.  Futures Contracts  September contracts rose 1.3 percent to a 16-week high on
Aug. 22 after an Energy Department report showed stockpiles
slipped to a 10-week low, and minutes from a Federal Open
Markets Committee meeting indicated policy makers may expand
fiscal easing soon.  Gasoline  stockpiles  declined to 201.2 million barrels, the
Energy Department said Aug. 29. It was the lowest since the week
ended May 25.  Futures gained again on Aug. 23 as Isaac, the ninth named
storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season , forced offshore workers
to evacuate, and threatened to curb oil and gas output from the
region and suspend operations at coastal refineries.  The contracts jumped 2.5 percent on Aug. 27 to $3.1548, the
highest since April 30, as the storm roared toward landfall in
Louisiana. The Gulf region is home to 23 percent of U.S. oil
production, 7 percent of natural-gas output and 44 percent of
refining capacity, according to the Energy Department.  Hurricane Isaac  Isaac forced companies including  BP Plc (BP/) , Apache Corp.,
 Murphy Oil Co. (MUR) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. to temporarily shut output and evacuate workers. Closures
peaked on Aug. 30, with 95 percent of oil production shut in and
73 percent of natural gas, according to the  Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement .  The strain on the U.S. refining system was compounded by
increased fuel demand from  Latin America  and the Aug. 25
explosion and fire that killed at least 42 people and halted
production from  Petroleos de Venezuela SA ’s Amuay plant, which
can process 645,000 barrels of oil a day.  PDVSA, as the state-owned oil producer is known, is the
sole owner and operator of the refinery. The Paraguana complex
has a capacity of about 950,000 barrels a day, second in size to
Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jamnagar refinery in India, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Oil Output  Rising U.S. oil and natural gas production has made the
country a global export hub for gasoline and diesel. Drilling in
formations such as the Bakken shale in  North Dakota  helped push
U.S. oil output July to the highest since 1999, according to the
Energy Department.  The surge in production helped the U.S. meet 81 percent of
its energy needs last year, the most since 1992. The country
became a net-exporter of refined products for the first time
since World War II as Latin American refining capacity remained
insufficient to meet the region’s demand.  Venezuela imported an average of almost 38,000 barrels of
refined products from the U.S. in the first five months of the
year, up from about 23,000 barrels in the same period last year,
according to  data  from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.  Brazil  imported an average of about 146,000
barrels a day this year through May, an increase of 17 percent
from last year, the  data  show.  Rising oil prices also pushed gasoline higher. Crude has
advanced 24 percent from a 2012 low in March as the U.S. and
European Union tightened sanctions against Iran and slow
economic growth raised speculation that policy makers will ease
fiscal policy.  Iranian Decline  Iran’s output has declined 23 percent this year to 2.75
million barrels a day in August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Iran’s southern coast overlooks the  Strait of Hormuz ,
a waterway through which about 20 percent of the world’s oil
passes.  Oil advanced 2 percent to $96.47 a barrel on Aug. 31 after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
may take additional measures to help lower U.S. unemployment,
which has been above 8 percent since 2009. Futures for October
delivery rose 58 cents to $97.05 a barrel in electronic trading
today on the Nymex.  Money managers increased bullish bets on higher  gasoline 
prices by 2,124 to 72,571 in the week ended Aug. 28, the CFTC
data show.  Net-long positions in  oil  held by money managers, including
hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity trading advisers,
advanced 12,945 futures and options combined, or 7.2 percent, to
192,471 futures and options combined, the data show. Oil
declined 35 cents a barrel to $96.33 on the Nymex in the week
covered by the report.  Heating Oil  In other markets, money managers raised bets on U.S.
 heating oil , a proxy for diesel, for a ninth consecutive week.
Net-long wagers advanced 4,352 futures and options combined, or
23 percent, to 23,083, the highest since the week ended May 8,
the CFTC report showed. Heating oil was little changed at
$3.1203 a gallon in the week of the report before settling at
$3.1696 on Aug. 31. Heating oil for October delivery rose 1.85
cent to $3.1987 a gallon at 1:15 p.m. in New York.  Net-long bets on four natural gas contracts fell for a
fifth straight week, dropping by 23,217 futures equivalents, or
16 percent, to 126,105, the lowest since the seven days ended
June 19, the CFTC data show. Natural gas declined 5.8 percent in
the week covered by the report to $2.614 per million British
thermal units. Futures were at $2.786 at 1:15 p.m. in New York.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and ICE Henry Hub
Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath, Louisiana, is the delivery point for
Nymex futures, a benchmark price for the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
