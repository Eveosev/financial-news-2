Sight deposits of domestic banks
with the  Swiss National Bank  increased last week.  Average sight deposits rose to 289 billion francs ($302
billion) in the week ending Aug. 31 from 286.4 billion francs in
the previous week, the Zurich-based SNB said in a statement on
its website today. Average sight deposits calculated on an
accumulated monthly basis advanced to 288.1 billion francs from
286.8 billion francs, the central bank said.  Sight deposits have been pushed higher as the SNB increased
liquidity and bought euros from banks to defend its currency
ceiling, crediting lendersâ€™ deposits with the amount of francs
sold. The central bank introduced the limit of 1.20 francs per
euro in September to fight deflation risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
