Romania ’s Finance Ministry will
accept a “slight” increase in the yields it pays for leu-
denominated debt for short-term treasuries,  Ziarul Financiar 
reported, citing Deputy Minister Enache Jiru.  The market pressure that pushed domestic borrowing costs
higher and prompted the Finance Ministry to reject bids at
several auctions last month doesn’t “fully” reflect the
country’s economic fundamentals or the state’s funding needs,
Jiru told the Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
