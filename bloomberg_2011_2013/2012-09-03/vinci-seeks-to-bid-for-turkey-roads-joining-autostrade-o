Vinci SA (DG) , Europe’s biggest builder,
Autostrade per l’Italia SpA and  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  of Spain
are among companies that applied to get prequalification for a
Turkish government auction for operating toll roads and
Bosporus bridges.  Vinci Concessions Holding AS, the French company’s Turkish
unit, applied without a partner for the prequalification auction
for which the deadline was today, the Ankara-based asset sale
agency, known as OIB, said in an e-mailed statement. The auction
is planned for later this year.  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , Turkey’s biggest business group, applied
with partners UEM Group Berhad, a Kuala Lumpur-based highway
operator owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, and  Gozde Girisim
Sermayesi Yatirim Ortakligi AS (GOZDE) , a Turkish private-equity firm,
the OIB said.  The winner will get 25 years of operational rights for
eight toll roads of about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) and two
crossings over the Bosporus, according to the terms. The
government’s sale of toll highways is part of a privatization
drive to pull in 12.5 billion liras ($6.87 billion) selling
assets including electricity grids this year.  Autostrade of Italy is bidding with Turkey’s  Akfen Holding
AS (AKFEN) , Dogus Holding AS and Makyol Insaat Sanayi Turizm & Ticaret
AS, the OIB said. OHL, based in  Madrid , joined Istanbul-based
partner Zorlu Holding AS in asking for prequalification.  MV Holding AS, Nurol Insaat & Ticaret AS, Fernas Insaat AS,
Kalyon Insaat Sanayi & Ticaret AS and Alsim Alarko Sanayi
Tesisleri & Ticaret AS, a unit of Turkey’s  Alarko Holding AS (ALARK) ,
applied as the only group that doesn’t have a foreign partner,
the OIB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
