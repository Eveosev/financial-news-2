Oil rose on speculation central
banks will take more steps to boost growth after manufacturing
unexpectedly contracted in China.  Prices gained as much as 0.9 percent as equities rallied
amid expectations that policy makers would enact stimulus
measures to spur expansion. China’s Purchasing Managers Index
shrank for the first time in nine months in August, a government
survey showed Sept. 1. China is the world’s second-largest oil-
consuming country after the U.S.  “The disappointing data from China emphasizes that waiting
for central bank action is the name of the game,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt  who predicts
prices will stay above $90 a barrel this month. “Speculation of
central bank intervention will keep prices supported despite
bearish fundamentals of weak demand and abundant supplies.”  Crude for October delivery increased 58 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $97.05 a barrel at 1:15 p.m. in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Earlier, it touched $97.30,
the highest intraday level since Aug. 27. Prices have climbed 26
percent since reaching the year’s low of $77.28 on June 28. They
advanced 9.6 percent in August, a second monthly gain.  Floor trading in  New York  is closed for the U.S. Labor Day
holiday. Electronic trading halted at 1:15 p.m. without a
settlement and will resume at 6 p.m., exchange owner CME Group
Inc. said on its  website . Transactions since electronic trading
opened yesterday will be dated tomorrow.  Brent Settlement  Brent oil for October settlement rose $1.21, or 1.1
percent, to end the session at $115.78 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices advanced 9.2 percent
last month. The European benchmark grade’s  premium  to West Texas
Intermediate was at $18.73, compared with $18.10 on Aug. 31.  New York oil has technical support at $95.76 a barrel,
along the bottom of an uptrend channel on the daily chart,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This channel started
from the 2012 intraday low of $77.28 on June 28. Buy orders tend
to be clustered near chart-support levels.  China ’s Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.2 in August
from 50.1 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said Sept. 1. The figure
was below the estimates of 24 of the 25 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  A separate measure by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today showed the fastest contraction since March 2009.
The final reading for the HSBC and Markit Economics report fell
to 47.6 from a preliminary figure of 47.8 from Aug. 23. The
dividing line between expansion and contraction for both surveys
is 50.  Stimulus Signals  China should “decisively” expand the strength of its
fine-tuning in accordance with the changes in the economy and
markets, People’s Daily said in a front-page essay by an
unidentified commentator. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  may unveil details of his bond-purchase program after a
policy meeting Sept. 6.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Aug. 31 that
he wouldn’t rule out more stimulus to boost the economy. The Fed
will implement measures as needed to spur growth, he said at the
Kansas City Fed’s annual economic-policy symposium in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming .  “Bernanke did say if more is needed, the Fed stands by to
do more, which is good for the economy, it’s good for markets,”
 Markus Rosgen , chief Asian strategist at Citigroup Inc., said in
a Bloomberg Television interview. “In terms of China, there is
certainly more room to ease.”  Equities Rally  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rebounded from two weeks of
losses, the first back-to-back declines since May. It advanced
0.8 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures for September
rose 0.3 percent, and the MSCI World Index jumped 0.1 percent.  Oil also rose as about 58 percent of the Gulf of Mexico’s
daily crude output capacity remained shut in following Hurricane
Isaac. Some production has resumed from last week when about 95
percent of production was shut in, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement reported yesterday.  The equivalent of about 804,000 barrels a day of oil output
was offline as of 12:30 p.m. New York time, it said.  Production among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries slipped 75,000 barrels to an average 31.988 million
barrels a day last month from a revised 32.063 million in July,
according to a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies , producers and
analysts. Output in  Iran  fell 350,000 barrels to 2.75 million
