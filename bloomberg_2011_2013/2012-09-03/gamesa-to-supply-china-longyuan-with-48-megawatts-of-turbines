Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA., (GAM) 
Spainâ€™s biggest maker of wind turbines, won a contract to supply
China Longyuan Power Group Corp. with 48 megawatts of the
machines for a project in  Fujian province .  Gamesa, based in Zamudio, will ship 24 turbines, each with
a 2-megawatt capacity, to the site in Jiangkou from October, it
said today in an e-mailed statement, without giving terms.  The company is boosting its presence in China as the nation
seeks to get 15 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuels by
2020. Gamesa and Beijing-based China Longyuan have worked
together on 1,728 megawatts of projects, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
