Indonesia’s bonds gained, pushing
the 10-year yield lower by the most since January, and the
rupiah advanced after data showed the  trade gap  unexpectedly
narrowed in July to the least this year.  The local currency snapped a four-day decline after data
showed the nation’s trade shortfall in July decreased to $177
million, the statistics bureau said today. That’s compared with
the $1.5 billion estimated by economists in a Bloomberg survey
and a revised $1.3 billion the previous month, which was the
widest deficit in data going back to February 2008. Exports fell
 7.3 percent  from a year earlier, compared with a decline of 16
percent in June, the bureau said.  “There is positive sentiment in the market following the
data as we saw many investors selling dollars,” said Taufan
Tito, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat  Indonesia  in
Jakarta. “I still expect the trade deficit to widen, driven by
growth concerns in Europe, China and the U.S.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 9,565 per dollar as
of 5:09 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since Aug. 23, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It lost 0.6
percent last week and was  Asia ’s worst-performing currency in
August. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 7.25
percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 6.12
percent, the biggest drop since Jan. 19, closing prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
