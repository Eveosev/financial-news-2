Mexican federal police officers who
were detained after an attack on a U.S. Embassy vehicle Aug. 24
were investigating a kidnapping in the area,  Milenio  reported.  The 12 officers were tracking down kidnappers who had
struck a few hours earlier, said Luis Cardenas Palomino, head of
regional security at the Federal Police, the Mexico City-based
newspaper said on its website today. Federal police fired on the
vehicle, wounding two U.S. employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
