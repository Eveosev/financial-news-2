Qatar has initiated an “official
plan” to set up a national reinsurance company that would be
majority-owned by the government with the “participation” of
local insurance companies,  Al Sharq reported , citing
unidentified people familiar with the plan.  The company would be large enough to cover the domestic
market, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
