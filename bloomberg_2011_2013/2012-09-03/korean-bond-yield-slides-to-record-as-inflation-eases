South Korea ’s government bond yields
fell to the lowest levels on record after the government
reported the slowest inflation in 12 years. The won climbed to
the strongest level in more than a week.  The nation’s assets also gained on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will press ahead with a third round of  quantitative 
easing, a policy that boosts the supply of dollars and spurs
demand for emerging-market assets. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said Aug. 31 that U.S. unemployment was a “grave concern” and
further monetary easing can’t be ruled out. South Korea’s
 consumer prices  rose 1.2 percent in August from a year earlier,
the least since May 2000, government data released today showed.  “There are hopes for a liquidity-driven rally as Bernanke
signaled further stimulus and foreign investors are buying
aggressively,” said Lee Seung Hoon, a fixed-income analyst at
Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “The inflation data gave an
added boost to the  bond market .”  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.83
percent in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate for
3.25 percent notes due June 2015 fell two basis points to 2.75
percent, the lowest for a benchmark three-year note on Bloomberg
data going back to Aug. 2000.  Three-year debt futures rose 0.05 to 106.35 and the one-
year interest-rate swap decreased three basis points to 2.82
percent.  Won Strengthens  The won appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,131.05 per dollar in
 Seoul , after a 0.4 percent decline in August, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,129.73 earlier, the
strongest since Aug. 23. One-month implied volatility for the
won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options,
slid 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  The prospect of monetary easing in the U.S. offset Korean
trade figures showing exports fell for a second month. Shipments
from  Asia ’s fourth-biggest economy dropped 6.2 percent in August
from a year earlier, the sixth monthly decline of 2012,
government data showed on Sept. 1.  “Bernanke’s comments weren’t enough to assure a drastic
pick-up in investor sentiment, but we’ll be seeing some relief
rally in the  currency market  today,” said Jude Noh, a Seoul-
based chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank. “South Korean
exporters that have delayed currency conversion last month may
also sell the dollar.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
