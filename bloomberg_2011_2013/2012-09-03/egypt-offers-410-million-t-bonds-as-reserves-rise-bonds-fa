Egypt  will seek bids for treasury
bonds valued at 2.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($410 million) today
after foreign reserves surged in August. The nation’s dollar
bonds retreated.  The Arab country will offer five- and seven-year securities
valued at 1.5 billion pounds and 1 billion pounds, respectively,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It last sold
similar-maturity notes on Aug. 16 at average yields of 16.6
percent and  16.9 percent .  Gross foreign reserves , which fell by more than 50 percent
since the start of the uprising against  Hosni Mubarak ’s regime
last year, rose $705 million last month to $15.1 billion, the
biggest advance in that period. The increase came after Egypt
received a $500 million deposit from Qatar and sold 513 million
euros ($645 million) of T-bills.  Egypt, which relies on sales of domestic debt to finance
its  budget deficit , is due to restart talks this month with the
 International Monetary Fund  for a loan of as much as $4.8
billion. The money is needed to help cover the deficit expected
to reach $25 billion, Al Mal newspaper reported today, citing
Abdallah Shehata, head of the economic committee at the Islamist
Freedom and Justice Party, the country’s biggest.  The 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020 retreated,
sending the yield up three basis points, or 0.03 of a percentage
point, to 5.46 percent at 11:25 a.m. in Cairo, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The rate plunged 104 basis points
in August, outpacing a seven basis-point drop to 5.98 percent in
the Middle East average, according to the JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBIG Mideast Sovereign Yield Index.  The pound, subject to a managed float, was little changed
at 6.1023 a dollar, near the weakest level since December 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
