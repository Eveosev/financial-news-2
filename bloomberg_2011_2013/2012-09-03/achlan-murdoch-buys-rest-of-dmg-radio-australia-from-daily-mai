Lachlan Murdoch ’s private equity
firm Illyria bought 50 percent of DMG Radio Australia from  Daily
Mail and General Trust Plc  for full ownership of the company of
which he is chairman.  Lachlan, the oldest son of  Rupert Murdoch , has paid A$100
million ($103 million) in cash and will pay a further sum
equivalent to 50 percent of the final DMG Radio Australia
dividend for the year ended Sept. 30, Daily Mail said in a
statement today. Lachlan acquired the other half of DMG Radio
Australia in 2009 and the radio broadcaster is now developing
its online and digital business, according to its  website .  Lachlan, a former publisher of his father’s New York Post
newspaper, stepped away from  News Corp. (NWSA)  in 2005 to focus on
businesses outside of his family. In February he was named
chairman of Ten Network Holdings Ltd., the owner of one of
Australia’s largest TV networks.  “Following an approach from Illyria, we decided now was an
appropriate time to realize the value created by DMGRA’s
improved performance,” Daily Mail Chief Executive Officer
Martin Morgan said in the statement. Daily Mail, based in
London, said it will use proceeds to reduce debt.  Daily Mail shares were unchanged at 479.5 pence at 8 a.m.
in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
