Zain (ZAIN)  Iraq, a unit of Kuwait’s  Mobile
Telecommunications Co. (NMTC) , has had its funds seized in all Iraqi
banks until it pays a $262 million fine for selling 5 million
SIM cards without permission, Iraq’s telecommunications
regulator said.  “We have warned them to pay the fine,” Ahmad al-Omari, a
member of the Communications and Media Commission’s trustee
board, said by phone today from Baghdad. “This procedure has
been carried out as a punishment.”  The commission said on its website in February 2011 that
the fine was imposed on Zain for putting 5 million subscriber
identity module cards on the local market without permission.
Zain Group said at the time that it didn’t know why Iraq’s media
and telecommunications regulator had imposed the fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
