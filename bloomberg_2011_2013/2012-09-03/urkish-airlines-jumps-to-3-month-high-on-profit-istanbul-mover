Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier
known as  Turkish Airlines , jumped to the highest in more than
three months after reporting it swung to a second-quarter
profit.  The  shares  climbed as much as 2.5 percent before trading
1.7 percent higher at 3.66 liras by 1:58 p.m. in Istanbul, the
strongest level since May 17.  The company reported a net income of 193.1 million liras
($106 million) in the three months to June, beating the average
estimate of 113.9 million liras from 11 analysts on Bloomberg.
It posted a 170.6 million-lira loss in the same period last
year. Sales advanced to 3.8 billion liras from 2.8 billion
liras.  Turkish Airlines doubled its EBITDA year-on-year through
“higher load factor and higher yields,” Erkan Savran, the head
of research at Ak Investment, said in an e-mailed report today.
The company kept “costs under control mainly via savings in
maintenance, ground handling and to a lesser extent personnel
expenses,” Savran said.  The stock has surged 73 percent this year, compared with a
31 percent rally in the Istanbul Stock Exchange  National 100
Index. (XU100)   The carrier trades at 12.6 times projected earnings for
this year, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of
11.57 for the index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
