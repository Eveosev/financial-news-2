Cypriot energy officials are
visiting  Israel  to discuss importing natural gas to Cyprus for
electricity production until the country is able to tap its own
recently discovered reserves,  Financial Mirror  said.  The  Electricity Authority of Cyprus  and the countryâ€™s
 Natural Gas Public Company  will issue an invitation as soon as
possible for companies to bid to import natural gas to Cyprus
from Israel, the Nicosia-based financial newspaper reported
today, citing Neoklis Sylikiotis, Cypriot Commerce, Industry and
Tourism Minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
