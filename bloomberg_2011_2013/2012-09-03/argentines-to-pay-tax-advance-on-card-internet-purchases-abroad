Argentine credit card companies will
add a 15 percent tax advance to purchases their clients make
abroad by internet, the official gazette said today.  The resolution extends a measure published last week that
imposed the 15 percent tax advance on purchases made by
cardholders while traveling outside the country.  Banks must also charge the tax advance on extractions from
automatic telling machines outside of the country, according to
todayâ€™s resolution. Argentines can only withdraw dollars from
ATMs if the extraction is made from a dollar-denominated bank
account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
