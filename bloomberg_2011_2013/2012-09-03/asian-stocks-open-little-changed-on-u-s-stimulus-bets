Asian  stocks  outside Japan rose as
comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and
economic reports across the region fueled speculation that
central banks will boost stimulus measures. Japanese stocks fell
as the yen rose against most of its major counterparts.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier
that gets 67 percent of sales from the U.S., rose 1.2 percent in
Sydney. Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. paced gains among Chinese
developers on a report the nation should do more to help
economic growth. Samsung Card Co. soared 15 percent in  Seoul 
after the credit-card issuer said it will buy back shares.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker that gets 80 percent of sales from
exports, lost 1.7 percent.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.2
percent to 418.82 as of 7:10 p.m. in  Tokyo  with about three
stocks gaining for every two that fell. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index was little changed at 117.69. Shares rose after Bernanke
said on Aug. 31 that a third round of asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, is an option to fight unemployment.  “The market has held out pretty well on the expectation of
QE and I guess there’s some confirmation over the weekend that
may happen,” said  Donald Williams , chief investment officer at
Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd. that manages about
$1 billion. “It’s going to be difficult for the market to keep
rallying on the promise of QE and other measures without some
improvement in the data.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent in August, the
first monthly drop since May, on concern policy makers won’t
introduce enough stimulus measures to revive the global economy.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 12.3 times
estimated earnings on average as of last week, compared with
13.6 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.6 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.4 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index rose 0.6 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi index 
added 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.3 percent.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.1 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today, with U.S.
markets closed for a holiday. The index advanced 0.5 percent in
 New York  on Aug. 31, capping its third monthly gain, after
Bernanke raised prospects for quantitative easing. Two rounds of
large-scale asset purchases have failed to bring the
unemployment level below 8 percent more than three years into
the recovery.  China Manufacturing  James Hardie  rose 1.2 percent to A$8.48.  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , which generates 72 percent of its sales in  North
America , added 2.6 percent to HK$12.08 in Hong Kong.  In China, the Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.2 in
August from 50.1 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said Sept. 1. It’s
the first time in nine months that the measure has fallen below
the 50 level that signals contraction.  A separate report released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed China’s manufacturing contracted last
month at the fastest pace since March 2009.  China should “decisively” expand the strength of its
policy fine-tuning based on economic developments and market
changes, according to a front-page commentary published in
China’s People’s Daily newspaper.  Shimao Property gained 3.3 percent to HK$12.08. China
Resources Land Ltd. climbed 4.8 percent to HK$15.70.  Regional Slowdown  Shares fell earlier as data pointed to an economic slowdown
in Asia. In South Korea, inflation slowed to the weakest pace in

the most in almost two years. In  New Zealand , a gauge of the

automaker that gets 27 percent of its sales from Europe, slid
4.1 percent to 70 yen.  Samsung Card surged 15 percent to 41,200 won, the biggest
gain on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. It will buy back 7.1
million shares, or 5.8 percent of its outstanding stock, through
Nov. 30 and cancel them when the buyback is complete, the
company said in a regulatory filing on Aug. 31.  Among stocks that fell, Sharp Corp. declined 6.1 percent to
186 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported that the Japanese
television maker cut the price of a stake it’s selling to
Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group.  Standard & Poor’s  also cut
