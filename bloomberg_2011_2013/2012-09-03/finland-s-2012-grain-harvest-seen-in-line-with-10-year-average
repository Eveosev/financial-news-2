Finland’s grain harvest this year
will be on par with the 10-year average at 3.8 million metric
tons, according to the second preliminary crop estimate, the
agriculture ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. The
autumn harvest won’t reach record levels because of slow growth
and floods in the summer, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
