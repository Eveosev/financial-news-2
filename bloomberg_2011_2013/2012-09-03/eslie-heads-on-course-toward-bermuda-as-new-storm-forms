Tropical Storm Leslie, the 12th
named system of the Atlantic season, is moving northward on a
track that may take the storm to  Bermuda  by this weekend, the
National Hurricane Center said.  Leslie is 465 miles (745 kilometers) north of the Leeward
Islands with 60 miles per hour winds, the Miami-based center
said in a 5 a.m. website  advisory . The forecast track calls for
the system to gain hurricane-status of at least 74 mph by Sept.
7 and may threaten Bermuda over the weekend.  In the Pacific, Tropical Storm John became the 10th named
system of that oceanâ€™s season, the NHC said in an  advisory . The
storm is 270 miles south of  Baja California  with 40 mph winds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
