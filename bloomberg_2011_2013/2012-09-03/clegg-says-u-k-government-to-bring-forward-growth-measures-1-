Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
said the U.K. government will bring forward measures to promote
economic growth.  He told lawmakers today that efforts to revive the economy
will fill the parliamentary time left by legislation to overhaul
the upper, unelected House of Lords, which was dropped last
month after Prime Minister  David Cameron  failed to persuade
rank-and-file Conservatives to support it.  Speaking in the House of Commons in London, Clegg said he
and Cameron will shortly announce initiatives to spur
homebuilding and expand the supply of “affordable” social
housing to “help create growth and jobs in our economy.”  Clegg confirmed that the bill to introduce a mainly elected
upper chamber of Parliament had been withdrawn today and
expressed hope that the revamp of the Lords might be revived
after the next election in 2015.  Almost a third of Conservative lawmakers sided with the
Labour opposition in voting against fast-tracking the
legislation, consigning it to what Clegg called a “slow
death.”  In retaliation, his Liberal Democrats say they will oppose
electoral-boundary changes sought by the Tories to help them win
an outright majority at the next election. Clegg said today the
whole party will vote against the proposals, raising the
prospect of ministers defying their own government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
