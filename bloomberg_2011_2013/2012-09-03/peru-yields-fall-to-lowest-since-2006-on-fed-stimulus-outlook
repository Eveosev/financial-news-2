Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields to their lowest level since 2006, as wagers the  Federal
Reserve  will expand monetary stimulus spurred demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market debt.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.48 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.25 centimo to 122.10
centimos per sol.  Peruvian yields, which are increasingly moving in tandem
with U.S. Treasuries, have fallen 15 basis points in the past
two weeks as investors bet the U.S central bank will announce
measures to shore up growth in the world’s biggest economy. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Aug. 31 he wouldn’t rule out more
stimulus and emphasized a new round of bond purchases was an
option.  “The feeling is that there won’t necessarily be stimulus
from additional QE but that the Fed could say that rates will
stay low beyond 2014,” said Alberto Jabiles, a trader at  BBVA
Banco Continental  in  Lima . “Investors are looking for yield in
countries with strong debt positions like Mexico, Peru and
Chile, and see very good yield in Peru compared to the U.S.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6090 per U.S. dollar,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank bought $100 million in the spot market
today and paid an average 2.6078 soles per  U.S. dollar , it said
on its website. The bank, which purchased $1.05 billion last
month, increased reserve requirements Sept. 1 in an effort to
stem foreign inflows fueling appreciation in the sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
