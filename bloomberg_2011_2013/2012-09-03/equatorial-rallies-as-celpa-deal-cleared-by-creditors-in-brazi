Equatorial Energia SA (EQTL3) ,  controlled  by
Brazilian private-equity firm Vinci Partners Investimentos
Ltda., jumped the most in almost four years after creditors
approved its takeover of  Centrais Eletricas do Para SA (CELP3) , or
Celpa.  Equatorial, based in Rio de Janeiro, rose 8.3 percent to
close at 16.85 reais in Sao Paulo trading, the steepest advance
since Oct. 29, 2008. Celpa creditors voted Sept. 1 to accept
Equatorial’s offer made in June, according to a regulatory
filing today. Equatorial plans to merge Celpa, which operates
under bankruptcy protection, with Cia. Energetica do Maranhao,
or Cemar, the distributor it owns in the state of Maranhao.  The transaction requires approval from the Brazilian
electricity regulator, Aneel. The regulator appointed on Aug. 31
administrators for eight distributors controlled by Celpa’s
majority shareholder  Rede Energia SA. (REDE4)   Celpa filed for bankruptcy protection Feb. 28 after a more
than four-year freeze on rates pushed up debt to about 2.3
billion reais ($1.13 billion). Creditors include Societe
Generale SA, Banco do Brasil SA, Bank of America Corp., Banco
Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA, according to Celpa
regulatory filings.  Rede rose 21 percent to 2.60 reais, the most since Dec. 7,
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
