Profits (SPX)  are moving U.S. equity
prices more than any time since the  bull market  began 3 1/2
years ago, rewarding investors for picking stocks based on
 company data  instead of following the herd rocked by Europe’s
debt crisis and the slowing U.S. economy.  Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose or fell
an average of 4.4 percent the day after releasing results since
July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last time
they moved more was in the second quarter of 2009. Daily swings
in the benchmark gauge narrowed to 0.4 percent last month from
2.2 percent a year ago, as economic and policy changes battered
investors. More than 475  S&P 500  stocks moved in the same
direction in six of the first nine days of August 2011, with  all
500 down  on Aug. 8.  Bulls say lockstep moves are diminishing because investors
are changing their behavior, making choices based on corporate
results at a time when analysts estimate profits for companies
in the S&P 500 will rise almost 10 percent a year through 2014.
Bears say the focus on earnings won’t bring back individuals who
have drained more than $420 billion from U.S. equity mutual
funds over the past four years even as  stocks rallied  108
percent since March 2009 and net income was unchanged in the
second quarter.  “I’m not saying it’s an easy job to be a stock picker in
this environment, but it’s certainly easier,” Sandy Lincoln,
the Chicago-based chief market strategist with BMO Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $100 billion, said in an Aug.
28 interview. “Stock selection does have the opportunity here
to finally show a face with a smile.”  Calm Markets  Earnings matter more as concern about Europe’s debt crisis
eases following European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s
pledge to defend the euro. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent last
week, trimming the 2012 gain to 12 percent, as evidence of a
global economic slowdown overshadowed speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will introduce stimulus measures. The index slid 0.6
percent to 1,398.60 at 11:14 a.m. in  New York  today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 in a speech to
central bankers and economists at an annual forum in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming that a new round of bond purchases is an option,
citing unemployment of more than 8 percent as a “grave
concern.”  The S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain on Aug. 3 was the month’s
only daily swing greater than 1 percent, compared with nine such
fluctuations in June, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While
markets calmed,  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) ,  Western Digital
Corp. (WDC)  and eight other companies rose or fell more than 20
percent on the day after reporting earnings.  MetroPCS Jumps  MetroPCS, a pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, posted a 76
percent increase in earnings on July 26 as the Richardson,
Texas-based company cut sales-promotion costs amid a slowdown in
new customers. The result  exceeded estimates  by the most since
2009, sending the stock up 37 percent.  Western Digital , based in Irvine,  California , surged 21
percent after the maker of disk drives and networking products
reported profit that surpassed forecasts on July 25. While the
result beat projections by 37 percent, in line with the five-
year average, the price move was three times as big as the rate
since 2007 after releasing results.  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) , the world’s third-largest oilfield
services provider, rallied 9.2 percent on July 20, when the
Houston-based company said improved results from North America
beat analysts’ estimates. The same day, the S&P 500 declined 1
percent as  Spain  said the recession will extend into next year
and concern about its regional governments’ finances grew.  AMD, WellPoint  Earnings that trailed forecasts exerted more influence too.
 Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the second-biggest maker of
processors for personal computers, slumped 13 percent the day
after income from the Sunnyvale, California-based company missed
analyst estimates for the first time since 2009. The move was
more than twice the average price change.  Shares of  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  slipped 12 percent after the
Indianapolis-based health-plan provider reported profit that
fell short of projections, while a disappointing quarter for
 International Game Technology (IGT)  led to a 20 percent drop in the
shares.  “When some company breaks the monotony with a good or bad
earnings report, you get an exaggerated reaction,”  Ben Fischer ,
the Dallas-based managing director at Allianz Global Investors,
which oversees 291 billion euros ($366 billion), said in an Aug.
30 phone interview. “There’s an event that you can get your
teeth into, and then you get these huge reactions.”  Exceeding Forecasts  Stocks moved more after earnings even as analysts did a
better job forecasting the results. Profits  exceeded estimates 
by 4.5 percent on average last quarter, compared with 6.2
percent in the prior period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The increased focus on earnings is a challenge to investors
because analysts are too optimistic about 2012, according to
Chris Hyzy of U.S. Trust, which oversees about $325 billion. He
predicts S&P 500 profits will reach $100 a share this year,
compared with the $103.1 average of more than 10,000 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings were unchanged in the March-to-June period,
failing to grow for the first time since 2009, while the index’s
price-earnings ratio rose 2 percent to 14.3, compared with the
five-decade average of 16.4, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Profit Rebound  While profits may decline 1.7 percent this quarter, they
will rebound 11 percent in the final three months of 2012 and
rise 11 percent next year and 12 percent in 2014, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The anchor to stock-price movement is without question
profit,” Hyzy, New York-based chief investment officer of U.S.
Trust said in an Aug. 29 phone interview. “Earnings will be
good, but they won’t be as high as expected and the market
should fade.”  Investors are focusing more on earnings after being
whipsawed for four years by the financial crisis and Europe’s
struggle to manage sovereign debt. The  average daily move  in the
S&P 500 was more than 1.3 percent between April and December of
2011, twice the five-decade average, as concern about budget
deficits in Greece, Portugal and Italy drew attention away from
individual companies.  Greater sensitivity to earnings is reducing the degree by
which stocks rise and fall in unison. The so-called correlation
coefficient among S&P 500 companies fell to 0.58 on Aug. 31,
down 14 percent from a month ago, according to data on the 50-
day rolling average compiled by Westport, Connecticut-based
Birinyi Associates Inc. A reading of 1.0 indicates they’re all
moving in the same direction by the same amount.  Stock Correlation  Correlation reached a record 0.86 percent in October,
Birinyi data dating back to 1980 show, after S&P downgraded the
U.S. government’s AAA credit rating, sparking concern the
world’s biggest economy may slip into its second recession in
three years.  American equities  lost $1.51 trillion in value over
the two months through Oct. 4. Since then, more than $3 trillion
has been restored as U.S. bond yields hit record lows,
repudiating S&P’s decision.  The link among stocks usually increases when the market is
falling. The last two times correlation rose above 0.8 coincided
with the bull market’s biggest retreats, Birinyi data show.  Debt Crisis  The S&P 500 fell 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively,
in 2011 and 2010 as concern about Europe’s debt crisis led to
near-lockstep swings in equity prices. Correlation reached 0.83
in October 1987, when the S&P 500 plunged 29 percent over four
days.  Weakening correlations may lure back investors, who have
lost confidence in equities after the dot-com tumble, the U.S.
real-estate collapse, the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression and the so-called flash crash in May 2010 when $862
billion of market value was briefly wiped out, according to
Birinyi Associates.  Even as the S&P 500 doubled, investors pulled money from
mutual funds that buy U.S. stocks for a fifth year in 2011, the
longest streak in data going back to 1984, according to the
 Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group.
Withdrawals were $135 billion last year, the second-highest
total after 2008, and about $75 billion has been pulled in 2012,
ICI data show.  Bond Inflows  While investors were pulling money out of equity funds,
they were pouring it into bond funds, which have seen about $200
billion in inflows this year, ICI data show. Bond managers have
received about $910 billion since March 2009, even as the S&P
500 rallied 108 percent.  “Equity investors are exhausted, disappointed and in many
cases unfulfilled based on some excessive promises that were
made to them a decade or more ago,”  Lawrence Creatura , who
helps oversee $356 billion as a Rochester, New York-based fund
manager at Federated Investors Inc., said in an Aug. 30 phone
interview. “But the math which drives returns in the equity
market still exists, much like a physical law,” he said. “If
companies do continue to post higher profits, higher equity
returns will follow.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
