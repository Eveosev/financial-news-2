The  New Zealand dollar  may extend
its decline to the lowest level in three months after dropping
below its 200-day moving average last week, Commerzbank AG said,
citing trading patterns.  The so-called kiwi is poised to drop to 74.58 U.S. cents,
the weakest since June after breaching the moving average at
80.01 cents, technical analysts  Karen Jones  and Axel Rudolph in
 London , wrote in a note to clients today. The currency may find
initial support at previous lows of 79.69 and 79.28, they said.  “We would allow for some profit taking here, however given
that technical indicators are negative, rebounds should remain
tepid,” Jones and Rudolph wrote. “Once last week’s low at
79.69 cents is fallen through, the July low at 78.08 will be
back in play. Failure here will mean that a medium-term top has
been formed and that a drop back towards the 74.58 June low is
underway,” they said.  The New Zealand dollar weakened 0.7 percent to 79.76 U.S.
cents at 12:09 p.m. London time. The last time the currency
traded at 74.58 cents was on June 1.  The kiwi has depreciated 3.3 percent in the past month, the
second worst performer after the Australian dollar among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indices.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
