Saudi security forces arrested a man
on a list of 23 individuals wanted for security offenses,
including killing and injuring people and security personnel,
the Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an Interior Ministry
spokesman.  Hussain Hassan al-Rabia was arrested in the al-Qatif area
of the oil-rich  Eastern Province , the Riyadh-based  news service
said  today, citing spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki. He
was arrested yesterday as he was “selling a large amount of
drugs” in the town of Awwamiya, it said.  While Sunni Muslim-majority  Saudi Arabia  largely escaped
the unrest that spread across the Arab world last year, minority
Shiite protesters have clashed this year with security forces in
Awwamiya, al-Qatif and other eastern towns. In July, security
forces arrested dissident Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr in the al-
Qatif area.  Al-Rabia and a member of the Saudi security forces were
injured during an exchange of gun fire, it said  To contact the reporter on this story:
