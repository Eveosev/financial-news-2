Indian manufacturing expanded at the
slowest pace in nine months in August, a private survey showed,
adding to signs that the global recovery is faltering.  The purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8 from 52.9 in
July, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in a statement
today. A number above 50 indicates growth.  A similar gauge for China released today signaled its
manufacturing shrank last month by the most since 2009, while
indexes for  South Korea  and Taiwan also showed contractions as
Europe’s debt crisis crimps exports.  India  faces challenges from
a struggling economy and  inflation  close to 7 percent, a level
the central bank has said limits room for interest-rate cuts.  “The economy is likely to remain weak given the global
headwinds,” Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore, said before the release. “Price pressures still
remain high and that is constraining the  Reserve Bank  of India’s
ability to support growth by cutting rates.”  Higher import costs are among the inflation risks following
a 17.4 percent plunge in the rupee against the dollar in the
past year. The currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 55.435 per
dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in Mumbai. The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
rose 0.2 percent, while the yield on the 8.15 percent bond due
June 2022 declined to 8.22 percent from 8.24 percent on Aug. 31.  Indian  gross domestic product  rose 5.5 percent in the three
months through June from a year earlier, a pace close to the
three-year low of 5.3 percent in the first quarter. Inflation
eased to a 32-month low of 6.87 percent in July while remaining
the fastest among the largest emerging nations.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  faces further threats to his
development agenda from corruption allegations and political
gridlock over efforts to overhaul policies to spur investment.  Morgan Stanley today cut its projection for Indian
expansion to 5.1 percent in the fiscal year through March 2013
from 5.8 percent, citing the  budget deficit , a decline in
private investment, weakness in external demand and the impact
of a below-average monsoon on crops.  The HSBC and Markit PMI for Chinese manufacturing was at
47.6 last month. South Korea’s gauge was at 47.5, while Taiwan
posted 46.1.  Indonesia  registered 51.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
