Vinci SA (DG) , Europe’s biggest builder,
bought a majority stake in a New Zealand construction company
involved in the recovery of earthquake-damaged Christchurch, two
years after the first temblor struck the city.  Paris-based Vinci, through its Soletanche Freyssinet unit,
bought 55 percent of March Construction Ltd., a 40 year-old
Christchurch-based business, from the March family, according to
an e-mailed statement. No price details were disclosed.  New Zealand faces costs of at least NZ$30 billion ($24
billion) from earthquakes that struck the largest city on the
nation’s  South Island  the past two years. The first temblor in
September 2010 was followed by another in February 2011 that
killed 185 people and wrecked about 1,000 central city
buildings, some of which are still being demolished.  “Soletanche Freyssinet is investing in  New Zealand  for the
long-term,” March Managing Director Guy March said in the
statement. “This acquisition is an opportunity for us to grow
the company regionally and particularly into the Auckland
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
