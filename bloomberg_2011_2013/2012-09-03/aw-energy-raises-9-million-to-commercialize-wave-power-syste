AW-Energy Oy, the Finnish developer
of systems that generate power from the motion of waves, raised
$9 million from investors including the countryâ€™s biggest
utility  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  to commercialize its technology.  Sitra, an innovation fund that reports to the Finnish
parliament and Tekes, the national technology-investment agency,
also participated in the financing round, AW-Energy said today
in a statement.  AW-Energy, based in Vantaa, is seeking to commercialize its
 WaveRoller  device, which is affixed to the sea floor and
generates power as waves move a panel back and forth.  The company installed three WaveRoller units in a pilot
project off the coast of  Portugal  in August. The 5.4 million
euro-project ($6.8 million) has capacity of 300 kilowatts and
received 3 million euros of European Union funding.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
