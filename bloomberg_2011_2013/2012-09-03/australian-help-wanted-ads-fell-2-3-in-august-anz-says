Australian help-wanted notices
dropped for a fifth straight month in August as slumping
business confidence delays hiring plans in mining states, a
private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet declined
2.3 percent last month after a 0.8 percent fall in July,
according to an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
report released in Melbourne today. National vacancies
advertised in newspapers slumped 6.1 percent last month, and
Internet notices were down 2.1 percent, the report showed.  The figures showed weaker advertising for work in
Queensland, Western Australia and  Northern Territory  -- regions
with concentrations of mining and energy investment projects,
ANZ Bank said.  “Recent trends in job advertising suggests the labor
market continues to soften,” said Ivan Colhoun, ANZ Bank’s head
of Australian economies and property research, in the statement.
“A new element to the picture has been the softness in the
states of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which
adds to the general moderate upward pressure on Australia’s
unemployment rate.”  The  Australian Bureau of Statistics  is scheduled to release
August employment figures on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
