(Corrects production period in first paragraph.)  Iran  will boost oil production at
the Nargesi field by 120 million barrels by injecting gas into
underground crude deposits to enhance recovery, the official
 Islamic Republic News Agency  reported.  The project will cost $33 million, said the National
Iranian South Oil Co., an affiliate of state-owned National
Iranian Oil Co., according to IRNA. The report didn’t specify
current output levels at the field 30 kilometers (19 miles)
north of Borazjan in southern Bushehr province.  Iran pumped 2.75 million barrels a day in August, 350,000
barrels a day less than in July, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Persian Gulf country’s oil output is slipping
amid international sanctions on its energy and financial
industries. The U.S. and its allies accuse Iran of trying to
develop nuclear-weapons technology. Iran says its atomic program
is for civilian purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
