Russian stocks rose for the first
time in four days as steelmakers climbed on speculation central
banks from  China  to the U.S. may take steps to boost growth.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 0.2 percent to 1,425.99 by 10:18
a.m. in Moscow. OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel rallied 2.2
percent, while OAO Novolipetsk Steel rose 1.2 percent.  China’s factory output unexpectedly shrank for the first
time in nine months in August as orders decreased, a government
survey showed Sept. 1. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said Aug. 31 that he wouldn’t rule out more stimulus as the U.S.
jobless rate remained a “grave concern.”  “ Chairman Bernanke ’s justification of the merits of the
non-conventional monetary policies maintains the expectation for
QE3 to materialise sooner rather than later,” VTB Capital
analysts led by Alexei Zabotkin said in an e-mailed note.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 0.2 percent to
1,392.64.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, fell 0.2 percent
to $96.27 in  New York , after rising 2 percent on Aug. 31. Oil
and gas contribute about 50 percent to Russia’s state revenue.
 Brent crude  dropped 0.2 percent to $114.33.  Preferred shares of oil producer OAO Surgutneftegas fell
0.2 percent to 20.807 rubles. The stock was the biggest advancer
on the Micex last month, adding 11 percent. Morgan Stanley
initiated coverage of the shares with an equalweight
recommendation, according to today’s report.  Russian equity funds attracted $90 million in the week
ended Aug. 29, according to VTB Capital’s research note on Aug.
31, which cited EPFR data.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  and has
rallied 1.7 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
9.9 times and a 3.8 percent advance for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
