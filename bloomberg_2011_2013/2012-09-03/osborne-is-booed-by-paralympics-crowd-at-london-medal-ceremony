U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  was booed by spectators when he handed out medals
to winners at the London Paralympics.  Boos rang out around the 80,000-capacity athletics stadium
in the Olympic Park, as Osborne was introduced to the crowd at
the start of a ceremony for a menâ€™s 400-meter track event last
night, television pictures showed.  The incident took place as Prime Minister  David Cameron  was
finishing preparations for a revamp of his Cabinet, a
reorganization that will leave Osborne in his position. An ICM
poll for the Guardian newspaper last week found 48 percent of
respondents saying the chancellor should lose his job.  Britain is striving to climb out of its  second slump  in
three years, and calls for the government to do more to spur the
economy have intensified as the largest  budget reductions  since
World War II and the euro-area debt crisis have hurt demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
