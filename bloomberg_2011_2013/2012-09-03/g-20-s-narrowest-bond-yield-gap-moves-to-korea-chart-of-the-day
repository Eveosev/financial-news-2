The yield premium for  South Korea ’s
first-ever 30-year bonds will be the narrowest among Group of 20
nations, as dealers outbid each other to control a new market
segment that may lure pension funds managing $760 billion.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the yield spread between 10-
and 30-year local-currency sovereign notes for G-20 nations.
Korean bonds will trump those of  Italy  for the narrowest gap,
while the widest differentials are on U.K. and U.S. debt, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Korea ’s 30-year bonds, scheduled to
be sold Sept. 11, will be priced to yield three or six basis
points more than 10-year notes, the  finance ministry  said after
primary dealers made offers. The range among G-20 countries now
goes from Italy’s 39 basis points to the U.K.’s 148 points.  “Bidding was so competitive because these are Korea’s
first 30-year bonds,”  Peter Park , a Seoul-based fixed-income
analyst at Woori Investment & Securities Co., said on Aug. 30,
after initial bids were submitted. “We’ve advised clients not
to hurry to buy,” since the yield premium will be very narrow,
he said. Woori rates a gap of 22 basis points as “reasonable.”  Korean bonds gained for a fifth month in August as
economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted growth in  Asia ’s
fourth-biggest economy will probably slow to 2.85 percent in
2012 from 3.6 percent last year.  “There was definitely some overshooting in the spread, but
in the end, investors may be thinking the yield level is not so
bad considering there is a 30-year maturity period,” said Yoon Yeo Sam, an analyst in  Seoul  at Daewoo Securities Co., one of
the six dealers chosen to manage the sale.  Dealers were betting slower growth and an ageing population
will eventually push yields lower, the analyst said. Koreans 65
years and older will comprise about 16 percent of the population
by 2020, more than double the 2000 level, according United
Nations forecasts. Total assets managed by South Korea’s
National Pension Service and private retirement funds will reach
860 trillion won ($760 billion) by year-end, according to Oh Jin
Ho, a senior researcher at the Seoul-based pension research body
established by Mirae Asset Financial Group.  Korea is selling the 30-year notes to reduce revolving
risks by increasing the average maturity of debt and to boost
the country’s credibility in the financial market. Consumer
prices in August  rose  at the slowest pace in 12 years, 1.2
percent from the same period in 2011, the government said in a
report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
