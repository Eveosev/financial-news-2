Japanese  stocks  fell for a third day
after the nation’s capital spending rose less than expected and
the yen strengthened after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled further bond purchases.  Canon (7751)  Inc., a camera maker that gets 27 percent of its
revenue in the Americas, fell 1.7 percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a
producer of robotics for Chinese factories, lost 1.1 percent
after China manufacturing output contracted for the first time
in nine months.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  sank 6.1 percent after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the television maker offered to cut the price
of shares it’s selling to Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.6 percent to 8,783.89
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.6
percent earlier. Volume was 6.6 percent above the 30-day average.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index slid 0.4 percent to 728.63. Shares fell
after Japan’s companies spent less than expected in the second
quarter.  The capital investment data is “a catalyst for sluggish
earnings and is clouding domestic business sentiment,” said
 Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $70 billion. “The
yen’s strength has the biggest impact on the Japanese market
today. Bernanke’s remarks may have driven the appreciation.”  The Topix was 16 percent below this year’s peak on March 27
on concern economic expansion in China and the U.S. is slowing
and Europe’s debt crisis deepening. Stocks on the Topix were
 valued  at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the
 Standard & Poor’s  500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600
Index. A number less than one means companies can be bought for
less than the value of their assets.  Easing Prospects  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent today, with the
market shut for a holiday. The gauge advanced 0.5 percent in New
York on Aug. 31, capping its third monthly gain, after Bernanke
said at a symposium of central bankers on Aug. 31 he wouldn’t
rule out buying bonds to stimulate growth and fight joblessness.  The yen strengthened after Bernanke’s comments, rising as
high as 78.20 against the dollar in Tokyo today, compared with
78.46 at the close of  stock trading  on Aug. 31. A stronger yen
cuts overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Canon fell 1.7 percent to 2,550 yen. Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd., which makes Subaru cars and earns almost half its sales
from  North America , declined 1.4 percent to 617 yen.  Japan’s corporate capital spending excluding software
gained 6.6 percent in the second quarter, the  Finance Ministry 
said today in Tokyo, missing an estimate for a 7.8 percent rise
from six analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Spending declined
8.2 percent a year earlier after the record earthquake derailed
investment.  China Manufacturing  Exporters fell after the China’s Purchasing Managers Index
fell to 49.2 in August from 50.1 in July, the government
reported on Sept. 1. The last time the gauge contracted was in
November. The purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics had a final reading of 47.6
for August after a preliminary 47.8 provided Aug. 23. The
dividing line between expansion and contraction is 50.  “China’s manufacturing is deteriorating day by day as
inventories of steel and chemicals climb amid stalled demand,”
said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager of investment strategy
at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Fanuc slid 1.1 percent to 12,650 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a
manufacturer of electronic parts that gets more than 25 percent
of its revenue from China, declined 2.3 percent to 2,917 yen.  Sharp sank 6.1 percent to 186 yen, the biggest decline on
the Nikkei 225. The stock fell after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the company offered to lower the price of its shares to
Foxconn Technology Group and its ratings were cut by Standard &
Poor’s. The Taiwanese-based company’s founder left Japan last
week without concluding a deal to purchase a stake in Sharp.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editor:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporter on this story:
