Latvia has filed legal-assistance
requests in nine countries as police seek to identify assets
belonging to  Vladimir Antonov , who controlled defunct lender
Krajbanka AS, TV3 reported, citing unnamed officials.  Latvia may receive responses to the requests by year-end or
in early 2013, TV3’s investigative news program Neka Personiga
reported last night.  Plans to form a joint investigative team with  Lithuania ,
where Krajbanka’s parent was based, failed this year because the
two countries are competing to recover Antonov’s assets, the
news program reported, citing the unnamed officials.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
