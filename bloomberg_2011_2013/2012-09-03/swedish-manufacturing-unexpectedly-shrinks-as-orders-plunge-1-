Sweden’s manufacturing  unexpectedly
shrank in August at the fastest pace since May 2009 as the
krona’s appreciation sent export orders plunging amid sagging
demand from debt-stricken  Europe .  The purchasing managers’ index fell to a seasonally
adjusted 45.1 from 50.6 in July, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) ,
which compiles the gauge, said today. A reading below 50 signals
a contraction. The index was seen falling to 50.1, according to
the  average estimate  of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “ Sweden  won’t go unscathed through this period of an
international slowdown,” said  Roger Josefsson , chief economist
at Danske Bank A/S in Stockholm. “In contrast to data that’s
been published earlier, this is data that’s come in after the
still recent strengthening of the krona.”  Sweden’s central bank, which is set to announce its next
interest rate decision on Sept. 6, in July kept its key rate
unchanged and pushed back tightening plans because of turmoil in
Europe. The Nordic country relies on sales abroad for about half
of its output and sends 70 percent of its  exports  to Europe
where economies are contracting amid austerity measures.  The krona fell 0.6 percent to 8.3893 per euro and 0.7
percent to 6.6724 per dollar as of 9:55 a.m. in  Stockholm  after
strengthening more than 9 percent against the euro since May 17.  The currency hit a 12-year high of 8.17 per euro last month
as the largest Nordic economy emerged as a haven from Europe’s
debt crisis.  The PMI’s production sub-index fell to 45.8 from 54 while
the order index fell to 41.1 from 51.2. The employment index
declined to 45.1 from 47.7.  “This is an indication that things will look much weaker
going forward,” Josefsson said. “This probably can’t be
dismissed as a blip in the data since the reading was broad-
based if one looks at the details of the release.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
