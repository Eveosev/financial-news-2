European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  named Bernhard Gerwert head of Cassidian, its defense unit
whose Eurofighter Typhoon jet has suffered losses to rival
planes in competitions for international orders.  Gerwert, 59, takes over Cassidian as the company struggles
to restructure its businesses and boost exports amid cuts in
defense spending at its principal customers, the German and
French governments. Gerwert was Cassidian Chief Operating
Officer and previously headed the Military Air Systems unit.
Stefan Zoller will step down to pursue other opportunities, EADS
said today in a statement.  Zoller’s departure after seven years running the defense
business is the biggest personnel change since 53-year-old
German  Tom Enders  was promoted from chief executive of
commercial plane unit Airbus SAS in January to run all of EADS,
which includes helicopter, space and defense operations.
Cassidian-led campaigns promoting the Eurofighter have lost a
series of contracts over the last year with Switzerland and
India opting for rival offers from Saab AB and  Dassault Aviation
SA (AM)  respectively.  “India must have been a disappointment,” said  Sandy
Morris , a London-based analyst at Jefferies International, by
phone.  Cassidian sales were 5.6 billion euros last year out of 49
billion for EADS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
