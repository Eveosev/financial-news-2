Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)  said
police used tear gas to disperse protesting miners who had
blocked access to the company’s Modder East site after they were
dismissed for taking part in an illegal strike. Security
personnel used rubber bullets, it said.  The former employees of Gold One and Pamodzi Gold East Rand
(Pty) Ltd. had blocked access to the mine about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) east of Johannesburg, it said today in a statement.
They threw stones at vehicles and refused to leave the area, it
said. Gold One in April said it would buy some Pamodzi assets.  Police shot and killed 34 at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine
northwest of Johannesburg after a strike by workers demanding a
wage increase to 12,500 rand ($1,490) a month turned violent,
leading to the deaths of 10 people, including two policemen.  Julius Malema , who was expelled as the leader of the ruling
 African National Congress ’s youth league, told former Pamodzi
workers last week that mines would be “ungovernable” unless
employees were paid a minimum of a monthly 12,500 rand, the
South African Press Association reported on Aug. 30.  Malema today addressed about 3,000 workers at Gold Fields
Ltd.’s Kloof-Driefontein operation, Africa’s largest gold mining
complex, Sven Lunsche, a spokesman for the company, said by
phone. The gathering ended peacefully, Lunsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
