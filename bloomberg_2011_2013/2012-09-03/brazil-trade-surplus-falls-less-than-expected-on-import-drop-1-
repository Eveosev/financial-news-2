Brazil ’s  trade surplus  narrowed less
than analysts expected in August after slower economic growth
reduced imports.  Exports exceed imports by $3.23 billion, compared with
$3.89 billion a year earlier, the Trade Ministry said today on
its website. The figure compares with a median forecast of $3
billion in a Bloomberg survey of 22 analysts. Exports fell 14.4
percent to $22.4 billion, while imports slid 14 percent to 19.2
billion.  Global economic weakness has reduced exports even as policy
makers implement measures aimed at helping manufacturers.
 Industrial output  fell 2.5 percent in the second quarter on
Europe’s debt crisis and an economic slowdown in China, Brazil’s
largest trading partner. The administration of President  Dilma Rousseff  has taken steps that have weakened the real more than
any major currency this year in efforts to make local industry
more competitive.  Slower economic growth is also reducing demand for imported
goods. Gross domestic product will expand 1.64 percent in 2012,
according to the median estimate in a central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today, down from the previous
estimate of 1.73 percent.  Since August, government officials have reduced the
benchmark  interest rate  more than any other G-20 nation to
record lows, cut taxes on automobiles and  consumer goods  and
encouraged lending to spur growth. Government measures helped
boost vehicle sales to 364,196 in July from 257,887 in April,
while retail sales in June increased the fastest since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
