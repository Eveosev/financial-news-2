Michael Hussey  and Glenn Maxwell
struck half-centuries as Australia beat Pakistan by three
wickets to win their one-day cricket series 2-1.  Set 245 for the victory in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates,
Australia reached the target with 18 balls to spare after Hussey
top scored with 65 and Maxwell struck 56 not out off 38 balls,
hitting the winning runs with a six to lift his team to 250-7.  Pakistan, which had been seeking its first one-day series
victory against Australia in a decade, earlier made 244-7 off
its 50 overs after  Mohammad Hafeez  (78) and Nasir Jamshed (48)
shared 129 runs for the opening wicket.  The teams are also scheduled to play a three-match Twenty20
series starting tomorrow in Dubai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
