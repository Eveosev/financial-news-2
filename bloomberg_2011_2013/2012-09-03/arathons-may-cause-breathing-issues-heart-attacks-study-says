Marathon running may trigger a lung
condition that causes shortness of breath, severe coughing, and
in serious cases, heart attacks or respiratory failure,
according to a new study.  Half of 26 runners in the study who completed the 2011
Steamtown Marathon in  Pennsylvania  had some form of pulmonary
edema, where fluid builds up in the air sacs of the lungs, about
20 minutes after the race, according to research led by Gerald
Zavorsky of Marywood University. Twenty percent of the
participants had a moderate or severe form of the condition, the
study showed. The research was presented today at the  European
Respiratory Society  annual meeting in Vienna.  The research adds to previous studies that showed marathon
runners are at risk of high  blood pressure  and heart
complications. There was no relation between marathon race time
and the development of pulmonary edema, suggesting the condition
can occur across all abilities, the researchers said.  “While pulmonary edema can be a negative consequence of
marathon running, regular exercise can also keep you fit and
healthy,” Zavorsky said in a statement.  Researchers took chest X-rays of the runners the day before
the race and then at 19, 56 and 98 minutes after the race. Women
were at much higher risk compared with men in developing
pulmonary edema.  To contact the reporter on this story:
