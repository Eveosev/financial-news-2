Deliveries of air-to-air missiles
ordered by Finland from Raytheon Co. have been delayed because
of problems in their cold weather performance, newspaper
Helsingin Sanomat said.  Deliveries of as many as 300 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-
Air Missiles were set to start this year, Helsingin Sanomat
said, citing Colonel Kari Renko of the Finnish Air Force and
 John Patterson , a spokesman for Raytheon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
