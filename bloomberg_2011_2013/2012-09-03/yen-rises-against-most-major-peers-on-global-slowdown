The yen strengthened against higher-
yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars as signs the global economic slowdown is deepening
boosted demand for safer assets.  Japan ’s currency climbed to five-week highs versus both the
Aussie and kiwi after reports showed manufacturing in the euro
area and China contracted in August.  Australia ’s dollar dropped
to the weakest since July versus the greenback after retail
sales in the nation fell. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week a third round of bond purchases, or
quantitative easing, shouldn’t be ruled out to spur growth.  “The dollar is out of favor on QE risk from the Fed, so
that leaves the yen as the only proper safe-haven alternative,”
said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “There was generally a risk-on mood
during most of August and I think there may be a little
recoiling from that this week.”  The yen appreciated 0.9 percent to 80.20 per Australian
dollar at 5:15 p.m. London time after climbing to 80.07 yen, the
strongest since July 25. Japan’s currency gained 0.8 percent to
62.48 per New Zealand dollar after reaching 62.38, the highest
level since July 26.  The yen was little changed at 98.68 per euro and 78.28 per
dollar. The euro gained 0.1 percent to $1.2597.  U.S. financial markets are closed today for the Labor Day
national holiday.  ‘Grave Concern’  An index of manufacturing in the euro area climbed to 45.1
in August from 44 in July,  Markit Economics  said, still below
the level of 50 that shows a contraction. A Chinese  purchasing
managers’ index  of manufacturing compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit dropped to 47.6 last month, from 49.3.  The yen has appreciated 7.2 percent in the past six months
as the  European debt crisis  worsened, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro dropped 3.1 percent, and
the dollar rose 2.1 percent.  Bernanke told central bankers and economists at the Kansas
City Fed’s annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , on Aug. 31
that “nontraditional policies” shouldn’t be ruled out to boost
growth and reduce unemployment, which he called a “grave
concern.”  The U.S. Labor Department’s monthly jobs report on Sept. 7
will show employers added 125,000 workers last month, compared
with 163,000 in July, according to another Bloomberg survey.
Unemployment will remain at 8.3 percent, according to the
estimates. The jobless  rate  has stayed at or above 8 percent
since February 2009.  ‘Heighten Expectations’  “If the jobs numbers come in weak, that would
significantly heighten expectations of QE3,” said Kengo Suzuki,
a currency strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “The
dollar may test lower over the near term.”  Australia’s dollar weakened against all but one of its  16
major peers after the government said retail sales dropped the
most in almost two years in July. The so-called Aussie also slid
after  manufacturing  shrank in  China , the nation’s largest
trading partner.  “The Aussie dollar had double bad news,” said Audrey Childe-Freeman, head of foreign-exchange strategy at  Bank of
Montreal (BMO)  in London. “The currency has looked increasingly
vulnerable in the past few weeks and this is continuing that.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.0248 after
dropping to $1.0232, the lowest level since July 25.  Kiwi Declines  The New Zealand dollar also weakened, sliding 0.6 percent
to 79.84 U.S. cents.  The so-called kiwi may drop to a three-month low after
breaking below its 200-day moving average last week, Commerzbank
AG said, citing trading patterns.  The currency is poised to fall to 74.58 U.S. cents, the
weakest since June after breaking below the moving average at
80.01 cents, technical analysts  Karen Jones  and Axel Rudolph in
London, wrote in a note to clients today. The kiwi may find
initial support at previous lows of 79.69 and 79.28, they said.  The pound rose for a second day against the dollar after a
survey showed U.K. manufacturing shrank less than economists
forecast last month.  A gauge of factory output, based on a survey by Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ,
rose to 49.5 from a revised 45.2 in July, Markit said. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an
increase to 46.1.  “The pound has rallied at the margin following this
morning’s manufacturing data,” said Michael Derks, chief
strategist at FxPro Group Ltd. in London. “Recently, there have
been some slightly better numbers coming from the U.K. but at
best the economy is going sideways.”  The U.K. currency advanced 0.2 percent to $1.5890, and was
little changed at 79.27 pence per euro.  Sweden’s krona depreciated after a report showed
manufacturing shrank at the fastest pace since May 2009.  The purchasing managers’ index dropped to a seasonally
adjusted 45.1 for August from 50.6 in July, Stockholm-based
 Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said.  The krona weakened 1.1 percent to 8.4271 per euro, and
slipped 1.0 percent to 6.6897 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
