Spain ’s bank rescue fund said it
would inject immediately 4.5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) into
the  Bankia (BKIA)  group after the lender lost 4.45 billion euros in the
first half.  “With this measure, the regulatory capital situation of
the group as it completes the restructuring plan is
reestablished,” the fund, known as FROB, said in an e-mailed
 statement  today.  Bankia’s request in May for 19 billion euros of state aid
to clean up soured assets on its books focused investor concerns
about the state of Spanish lenders and helped push the
government into seeking a 100 billion-euro bailout for its
financial system in June.  Today’s disbursement of aid for Bankia is an advance of the
capital injection that FROB will make under the program agreed
with  Europe  and the final amount will be agreed in coming weeks,
the rescue fund said. Spanish and European authorities are
working closely with Bankia group’s management to finalize the
lender’s restructuring plan so it can be approved by the
European Commission in November, FROB said.  FROB first said on Aug. 31 that it would inject capital
into the Bankia group without specifying an amount. FROB planned
to inject from 4 billion euros to 5 billion euros into the
group, a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be
identified because those details weren’t public, said on Aug.
