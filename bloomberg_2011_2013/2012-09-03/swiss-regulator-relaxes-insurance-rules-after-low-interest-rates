The Swiss Financial Markets
Supervisory Authority said it will temporarily relax solvency
rules for insurers as low  interest rates  hurt earnings.  Finma plans to adjust the valuation yield curve temporarily
and adjust the supervisory intervention ladder to give insurers
“some breathing space,” Patrick Raaflaub, Finma’s chief
executive officer, said in a speech in Zurich today.  The solvency test, which was introduced in January last
year, requires insurers including  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  and
 Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  to provide a mark-to-market valuation of
assets and liabilities that for the first time takes into
account their investments.  “For 2013, Finma will make some temporary adjustments to
the SST, as a measure to alleviate the situation for insurance
companies, especially those in the life segment which have been
particularly badly hit by the persistently low interest rates,”
Raaflaub said.  The European Union, which wants to introduce similar
capital rules, said in June it’s considering phasing in the
regulation to ease the burden on insurers which had criticized
the changes.  The seven-year transition may buy the industry time to come
up with a long-term solution to its struggle with the low
interest-rate environment that reduces yields insurers earn on
their investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
