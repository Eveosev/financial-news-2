Los Angeles Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa  says the difference between President  Barack Obama 
and Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  is a choice between a
candidate who wants “to build the economy from the middle up”
and another who wants to build it from “the top down.”  Calling the Democratic National Convention “diverse in
every respect,” Villaraigosa, chairman of the party’s
convention opening Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, said at
a press conference today that Obama “wants to reclaim the
American dream.”  Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx says North Carolina isn’t
going to be an “easy state” to win for Obama. “This race is
going to go all the way down to the wire,” Foxx said at the
press conference today.  There are 5,556 delegates and 407 alternates, according to
Alice Germond, the Democratic National Committee secretary. Half
of the delegates are women, which Germond called “pretty darn
special.”  Romney has been trying to bridge a likeability gap with
women voters as well as Latino voters shown in national polls.
The Democrats have 100 more Hispanic and Latino delegates than
they had in 2008, Germond said. She called the 2012 convention
“the most open” and the “most transparent.” Caucuses and
committee meetings are all open to the public.  To contact the reporters on this story:
