Turkey will not be able to meet 2012
budget targets and its economic growth will fall short of the 4
percent official target, Vatan newspaper reported, citing
Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek .  Pay rises for civil servants, low privatization receipts
and losses from selling natural gas at below cost-price will
contribute to the failure, Vatan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
