The ruble weakened and yields on
one-year benchmark  government bonds  climbed to the highest level
in a week after a decline in Urals crude,  Russia ’s main export
blend.  The ruble depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 32.3700 per
dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow, extending a 1.5 percent decline last
week. Russia’s currency rose about 0.1 percent versus the euro
to 40.6525 today and was unchanged against the central bank’s
currency basket. An index of one-year domestic government bond
yields compiled by Micex rose more than seven basis points to
6.239 percent, the highest level since Aug. 24.  Urals dropped 0.5 percent to $112.60. Oil futures dropped
as much as 0.5 percent in earlier trading as manufacturing
unexpectedly contracted in  China  and crude production resumed in
the  Gulf of Mexico  after Hurricane Isaac. Brent rose 0.8 percent
to $115.49 per barrel. The ruble gained on Aug. 31 after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said he wouldn’t rule out
more stimulus.  “Despite Brent being above $114 per barrel, an emerging
negative trend will affect the national currency’s position,”
Alexey Egorov, an analyst at Nomos Bank in Moscow, said by e-
mail.  Non-deliverable forwards show the ruble at 32.8180 per
dollar in three months versus 32.8635 on Aug. 31.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 222, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
