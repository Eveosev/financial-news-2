Romania’s  Environment Ministry 
started an “emergency” investigation of an environmental
permit issued by a regional authority for a gold mine project
majority owned by Canada’s  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD)   Environment Minister Rovana Plumb asked Romania’s National
Agency for Environmental Protection and the Environment
Clearance Authority to check whether the local agency for
environmental protection in the western Timisoara county
followed the law when it issued a permit for the Certej mining
project, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The ministry will cancel the permit should it fail to
respect the country’s regulations, according to the statement.
Plumb also asked for the head of the local environmental agency
to be fired because he failed to inform the ministry about the
issuance of a permit for a project of “national and
international interest.”  Non-profit organizations, including Alburnus Maior, issued
a statement today challenging the permit for the Certej mining
project, citing “an extremely dangerous precedent for
 Romania ,” because of environmental issues caused by the use of
cyanide in extracting the gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
