Syrian consumer prices surged the
most in at least six months in June as sanctions gripped the
economy and violence intensified between President Bashar al- Assad’s army and rebels.  Consumer prices rose 36 percent from a year earlier and
climbed 2.9 percent from May, when annual inflation advanced
almost 33 percent, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics
in Damascus. The June figure is the highest this year, according
to Bloomberg calculations.  “The hike in inflation is due to the lagging impact of
sanctions,”  Nassib Ghobril , chief economist at Beirut-based
 Byblos Bank SAL (BYB) , said by phone today. “Sanctions, disruption of
trade routes, shortage of goods in the markets and the overall
turmoil are the main factors” that pushed prices up.  Assad and his government face mounting sanctions by the
international community. The latest was imposed last month by
the Obama administration cutting state-run  oil company  Sytrol
off access to the international banking system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
