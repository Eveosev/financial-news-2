OAO Bashneft, the Russian oil
producer controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK
Sistema, said second-quarter profit fell 24 percent as  oil
prices  fell and export duties rose.  Net income retreated to $337 million from $444 million in
the first quarter, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. That missed the $378 million mean estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $4.1
billion.  Russian oil company profits have fallen after they paid a
larger share of sales in export duties and crude prices dropped.
OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest producer, reported a second-
quarter loss. Earnings at OAO Lukoil slid 69 percent and TNK-BP
recorded a 63 percent decline in profit.  Russia’s benchmark Urals export blend prices fell 8.7
percent to $106.80 a barrel in the second quarter from the
previous, Bashneft said in a  presentation  on its website.
Average export duties for the company’s light and medium
distillate products rose 10.2 percent from the previous period,
Bashneft said.  Oil production slipped 0.8 percent to 3.81 million tons in
the second quarter, the company said. Adjusted net debt fell 10
percent to $2.1 billion from $2.35 billion in the previous
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
