Iran will offer the first phase of
its domestic Internet in all the Iranian provinces by the end of
the month, state TV reported, citing Telecommunications Minister
Reza Taghipour.  “After completion of the first phase, all Iranian
provinces will have access to both the Internet network and the
national network, separately,” Taghipour said, according to the
 report  published today.  The availability of the national network won’t affect
accessibility to the global Internet and the World Wide Web is
still usable in the country, the state TV news website cited
Taghipour as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
