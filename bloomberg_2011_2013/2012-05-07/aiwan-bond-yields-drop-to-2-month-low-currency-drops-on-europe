Taiwan ’s bonds rose, pushing yields to
the lowest level since March, and the island’s currency fell
after European voters favored leaders who vowed to move away
from austerity measures, fueling concern the region’s debt
crisis will worsen.  The currency retreated for a fourth day after French
Socialist leader  Francois Hollande , who defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy 
in the presidential poll, said yesterday that “austerity isn’t
inevitable.” His comments were echoed in  Greece , where voters
flocked to anti-bailout groups, leaving the two main parties
short of a majority. Global funds sold $609 million more
Taiwanese stocks than they bought today, trimming net purchases
for this year to $3.2 billion, exchange data show.  “Uncertainties in  Europe  are affecting the markets,” said
George Pu, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Sinopac
Securities Corp. “There is room for yields to go down more.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.967
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That was the
lowest level for benchmark five-year rates since March 13.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.4 percent to NT$29.382 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.409 earlier, the weakest level since April 27. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, rose 20 basis points to 4.5 percent.  Consumer prices on the island increased 1.44 percent last
month from a year earlier, compared with the median estimate of
1.41 percent in a Bloomberg survey, statistics bureau data
showed today. Official data also showed exports slumped 6.4
percent during the same period, worse than the 3.1 percent fall
analysts predicted in another survey.  “Taiwan’s inflation is still in control, personally I’m
not too worried about it,” Pu said.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.512 percent on May 4,
the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
