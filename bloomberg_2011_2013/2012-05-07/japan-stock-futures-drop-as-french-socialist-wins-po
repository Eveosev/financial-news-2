Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
 Topix (TPX)  Index to its biggest decline in nine months, after a
socialist was elected  France ’s president, raising concern
austerity measures will be rejected in Europe. Shares also fell
as U.S. employers added fewer jobs than expected.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc., a photo film maker that
counts Europe as its biggest market, slid 3.9 percent after the
euro fell against the yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that
counts  North America  as its biggest market, sank 5.6 percent.
 Gree Inc. (3632)  plunged 23 percent after the government said some
social network games use “questionable” sales methods.  “The situation in Europe is tough,” Khiem Do, Hong Kong-
based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset
Management Asia Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television. The firm
oversees about $10 billion. “Very few nations can stand
austerity. If the European Monetary Union stays the same,
something has to give.”  The Topix lost 2.6 percent to 772.06 at the 3 p.m. close in
 Tokyo , its biggest drop since Aug. 5. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY)  sank 2.8 percent to 9,119.14, with volume about 2.6
percent above the 30-day average.  The Topix has fallen about 12 percent since March 27, as
investors refocused on Europe’s debt crisis and as slowing
Chinese growth and signs of weakness in the U.S. recovery
weighed on global equities.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 1 percent
today. The gauge sank 1.6 percent in  New York  on May 4 after a
report showed payrolls missed estimates by climbing 115,000 in
April, the smallest gain in six months, as the labor force
contracted.  French Election  Concern on Europe’s debt crisis also pushed stocks down as
Socialist Francois Hollande was elected French president and
Greek voters flocked to anti-bailout parties, stoking concern
austerity efforts to tackle debt in Europe may be derailed as
discontent rises amid slowing growth.  Konica Minolta (4902)  fell 3.9 percent to 619 yen. Sony Corp.,
which depends on Europe for more than a fifth of its sales, slid
4.5 percent to 1,213 yen.  “There’s concern that the European debt problem may get
serious,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc. “The U.S. job recovery is getting sluggish,
fueling concern that it may have a bad impact on  consumer
spending  and housing markets.”  Honda sank 5.6 percent to 2,660 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
Asia’s largest automaker, fell 3 percent to 3,110 yen. The two
carmakers were the most active stocks by value in Japan today.  The euro fell to its lowest against the yen in almost
three months, weakening to as low as 103.24 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 106.20 yen at the close of stock trading on May 2,
the last day Japanese markets were open. The dollar depreciated
to 79.65 yen from 80.37 yen, cutting the value of overseas
income at some Japanese companies.  Gree Drops  Online game operators declined after the  Yomiuri  newspaper
reported Japan’s Consumer Affairs Agency concluded item
collection sales system used by some social-network game
operators violates the law and plans to ask such companies to
stop using the “questionable” sales methods.  Gree plunged by its daily limit of 500 yen, or 23 percent,
to 1,651 yen.  DeNA Co. (2432)  tumbled 20 percent to 1,990 yen. Konami
Corp., which produces games for social networks, lost 18 percent
to 1,890 yen, the biggest drop on the Nikkei 225.  Energy companies declined after oil fell to its lowest
level in more than four months.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s
largest oil explorer by market value, slid 5.3 percent to
499,000 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. slipped 5.4 percent
to 3,425 yen.  Oil Drops  Crude for June delivery retreated as much as 3.2 percent to
$95.34 a barrel in electronic trading in New York today. On May
4, oil fell below $100 a barrel for the first time in three
months.  Metal producers also fell after the London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial commodities including copper
and aluminum fell 0.4 percent on May 4.  Pacific Metals Co., which manufactures ferronickel, tumbled
7.5 percent to 371 yen.  Nippon Light Metal Co. (5701) , an aluminum
producer, retreated 6.7 percent to 112 yen.  -- With assistance from Satoshi Kawano in Tokyo. Editors: Jim Powell, Jason Clenfield.  To contact the reporters on this story:
