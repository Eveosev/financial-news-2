Egypt  may gradually scrap subsidies on
oil products by 2018, introducing coupons for gasoline and
diesel as part of the phaseout, the independent newspaper Al
Masry Al Youm reported, citing unidentified officials.  Among other proposals being considered is raising prices on
higher-octane gasoline grades, with the subsidies ending before
2015, the newspaper said.  The government is scheduled to meet this month to discuss a
proposal by the Egyptian General Petroleum Authority that aims
to cut the fuel subsidy outlay to 108.9 billion Egyptian pounds
($18.2 billion) in the next fiscal year from current levels of
111 billion pounds, the Cairo-based daily reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
