The U.S. government’s estimate for
 Florida’s orange  crop will be little changed from the April
forecast, a Bloomberg News survey shows.  The state will harvest 145.16 million boxes of oranges in
the 2011-2012 harvest, which ends in July, according to the
average estimate of five traders and analysts. That’s up 0.1
percent from 145 million projected last month.  The previous crop totaled 140.3 million boxes, each
weighing 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms. The agency will update its
forecast on May 10 at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Florida  is the world’s largest grower after  Brazil . The
figures below are in millions of boxes.  Source                                   Crop Estimate
