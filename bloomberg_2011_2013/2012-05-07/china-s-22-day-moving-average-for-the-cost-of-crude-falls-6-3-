China ’s 22-day moving average for the
three benchmark crude grades that the government monitors to set
fuel prices fell 6.3 percent as of May 4 from the last
adjustment on March 19, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Under a mechanism introduced by the government in 2008,
gasoline and diesel tariffs may be adjusted when the 22-day
moving average of Brent, Dubai and Cinta changes more than 4
percent from the last official price revision. While the
government hasn’t provided the weighting for the grades,
Bloomberg’s calculations assume all three are equally weighted.  Prices in the following table are in U.S. dollars a barrel
and are according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
