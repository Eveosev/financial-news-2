Koenig & Bauer AG (SKB)  plans to buy a
majority stake in a Chinese sheet-fed printing-machine maker by
the end of the year,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Claus Bolza-Schuenemann.  Bolza-Schuenemann, who declined to name the Chinese
company, said he sees potential to optimize the machines without
making them into “high-end German” devices, the newspaper
said. Koenig & Bauer, which gets about 15 percent to 20 percent
of sales from  China , doesn’t yet have a factory in the country,
FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
