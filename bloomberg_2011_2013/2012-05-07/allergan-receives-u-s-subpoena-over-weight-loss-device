  Allergan Inc. (AGN) , the maker of the
wrinkle treatment Botox, received a U.S. government subpoena
over its gastric banding device for obesity.  Allergan received the subpoena from the  Department of
Health  and Human Servicesâ€™s Inspector General this month, the
company reported today in a filing. Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman
for  Irvine , California-based Allergan, acknowledged the subpoena
but declined to comment further.  Allergan generated $203.1 million of its $5.42 billion
 revenue  last year from devices for obesity. The company acquired
the product, called Lap-Band, in 2006 with its purchase of
Inamed Corp. The adjustable silicon band helps people lose
weight by reducing the amount of food their stomachs can hold.  In January, House Democratic lawmakers called for hearings
on medical devices including Lap-Band, following a study in the
medical journal Archives of Surgery, that found almost half of
patients with a gastric band had no  weight loss  or needed the
device removed after six years. More than 40 percent had long-
term complications.  The Food and Drug Administration approved the device in
2001 for patients who were at least 100 pounds (45 kilograms)
overweight, had a body mass index of at least 40, or an index of
35 with obesity-related conditions such as heart problems.
Allergan gained clearance in February 2011 to expand marketing
of the device to people with lower body mass indexes and at
least one obesity-related condition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
