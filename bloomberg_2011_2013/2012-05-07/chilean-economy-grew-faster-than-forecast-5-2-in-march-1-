Chile’s economy expanded a faster-
than-forecast 5.2 percent in March from the previous year on
gains in the retail, corporate service and power generation
industries, the central bank said.  The median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the economy to expand 4.3 percent in March. The economy
grew 0.9 percent in March from the previous month on a
seasonally-adjusted basis, the central bank said today in a
report posted on its website.  Chile’s economy, as measured by the bank’s Imacec index
that serves as a proxy for gross domestic product, expanded 5.6
percent in the first quarter from last year, according to
calculations made by Bloomberg. Growth rates will slow this year
on lower gains in exports and investments, Mario Arend, chief
economist at Celfin Capital SA, wrote May 2.  “With our forecasts for slowing growth rates in coming
months, we do not foresee any major sources of price pressure on
core CPIs this year,” Arend wrote in a report for investors.
“At the same time, we see an appreciated peso as compensating
for increases in the price of non-tradable.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 484.40 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:40
a.m. Santiago time. Chile’s currency has gained 7.3 percent
against the dollar so far this year, and inflation has surpassed
the upper limit of the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent
target range in three of the past four months.  Exports in the world’s top copper producer will climb 4.3
percent in 2012 after growing 4.6 percent last year as the
average price of copper dips to $3.67 a pound from $3.99 a pound
in 2011, according to Celfin forecasts. GDP growth will slow to
4.6 percent this year from 6 percent in 2011, it said.  Chile had a trade surplus of $1.05 billion in April on $6.9
billion of exports and $5.85 billion of imports, the central
bank said in a report posted on its website today.  The Andean nation exported $3.58 billion of copper in
April.  The  median estimate  of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a trade surplus of $650 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
