Azeri police clashed today in the
capital with about 100 opposition activists challenging
restrictions on freedom of assembly before the country hosts the
Eurovision song contest later this month.  Protesters chanted “Freedom” and “Resignation” as
police and plainclothes security officers attempted to prevent
them from marching toward the mayor’s office in the center of
Baku. Some of the picketers were beaten by the police.  Emboldened by popular movements that have toppled
authoritarian leaders in the  Middle East , Azeri opposition
leaders want to seize the media spotlight in the weeks before
Baku hosts Eurovision, the world’s most watched singing
competition. Azerbaijan, a Caspian Sea nation of 9 million
people, is the third-biggest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan .  The Public Chamber, an alliance of major opposition parties
and groups, said it will continue protests in the run-up to the
pan-European song contest to demand greater democratic freedoms
and the release of imprisoned activists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
