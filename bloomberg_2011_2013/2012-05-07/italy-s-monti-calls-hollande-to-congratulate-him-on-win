Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
telephoned  Francois Hollande  to congratulate him on his victory
in France’s presidential election, according to a statement from
Monti’s office.  Monti and Hollande said they would seek to work closely
together, according to the statement. Monti also spoke with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss
European policy in light of the outcome of the French and Greek
elections.  Along with Hollande’s victory, the outcome of the Greek
vote, which failed to produce an outright winner, compels
European leaders “to reflect” and “urgently adopt concrete
policies for economic growth,” Monti said in the statement.  Stefano Fassina, head of economic policy for the  Democratic
Party  that supports Monti in the legislature, urged the premier
to delay parliamentary approval of Europe’s so-called “fiscal
compact” and slow a plan to reduce the budget deficit in order
to increase public investment, according to an interview with la
Stampa newspaper published today.  Hollande’s win marked “a defeat for the blind austerity
advocated by the European Central Bank that is dragging everyone
down,” Fassina told la Stampa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
