A Paris appeals court refused a bid by
the heiress to fashion designer Nina Ricci to end a tax evasion
investigation because it was based on account data stolen from
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Agence France-Presse said today, citing her
lawyer.  Arlette Ricci disputed the validity of using the data,
stolen by a former HSBC employee and seized from his home in
2009, in pursuing her for allegedly hiding wealth in HSBC
accounts in  Switzerland  to evade taxes, AFP said, citing Jean-
Marc Fedida, her lawyer.  Fedida didnâ€™t immediately respond to calls by Bloomberg
News for comment on the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
