Gruma SAB (GRUMAB) , the world’s largest maker
of corn and wheat tortillas, fell to the lowest price in more
than a month as Banco Santander SA removed the stock from its
top recommendations.  Shares fell 2.8 percent to 33.2 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the lowest since March 23. The benchmark IPC index
gained 1.6 percent.  “Gruma’s stock price had almost reached our target price
and margins were lower than we had expected,” Santander
analysts Gonzalo Fernandez and Arturo Espinosa wrote in a
research note dated today. The bank is replacing Gruma with
Fibra Uno in its top picks for Mexican stocks, the note said.  First-quarter net income fell 98 percent to 83.9 million
pesos ($6.4 million) from the year-earlier period, Gruma said
April 25 in a statement to the stock exchange. Costs jumped as
natural gas hedging losses boosted sales expenses by 17 million
pesos and financing costs rose by 207 million pesos because of a
writedown from a “mark-to-market currency valuation” on
hedging contracts linked to corn purchases, the company said.  After the earnings report, Santander cut Gruma to hold from
buy. In the past year, the San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico-based
company’s shares have gained 51 percent.  Gruma’s press office didn’t return e-mails and phone calls
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
