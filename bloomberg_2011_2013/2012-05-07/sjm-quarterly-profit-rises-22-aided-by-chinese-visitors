SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , the Macau casino
operator founded by billionaire  Stanley Ho , reported a 22
percent increase in first-quarter profit as Chinese tourists
drove up gambling revenue in the former Portuguese colony.  Net income climbed to HK$1.71 billion ($220 million) from
HK$1.41 billion a year earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong
stock exchange statement yesterday. Gambling revenue gained 8.5
percent to HK$19.7 billion.  SJM, which owns 20 of the 34  casinos in Macau , faces
growing competition from rivals such as  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and
 Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  which operate new resorts in the
city’s increasingly popular Cotai area. The gambling hub’s
casino revenue jumped 42 percent to $34 billion last year,
almost six times that of the  Las Vegas Strip .  The company’s market share slid to 27.3 percent in the
first quarter, from 31.9 percent a year earlier, it said in the
statement.  SJM shares fell 3.6 percent to HK$16.86 at the close of
Hong Kong trading yesterday, before the earnings announcement.
The stock gained 2.3 percent to $2.26 in over-the-counter
trading in the U.S., as of 12:11 p.m.  New York  time.  SJM, whose casinos include the Grand Lisboa and Ponte 16,
said earlier this year that it was in advanced talks with the
Macau government to build a new casino.  Wynn Macau Ltd., a unit of billionaire Steve Wynn’s Las
Vegas company, won a land grant from the Macau government to
build its second casino resort, the company said May 2. Galaxy
said April 26 that it plans to invest about $2.1 billion to
almost double the size of its resort.  Macau is the world’s largest gambling hub and the only
place in China where casinos are legal. The number of Chinese
tourist to the city soared  22 percent  to 16.2 million in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
