(Corrects date for foreign bond holdings in fifth
paragraph.)  Mexican peso bond yields held near an
eight-month low as investors seek to profit from the Latin
American country’s relatively higher  interest rates .  The yield on Mexican local currency bonds due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.17 percent at 4 p.m. Mexico City time. The
yield fell to 6.165 percent on May 4, the lowest close since
Aug. 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s central bank kept its benchmark rate unchanged at
4.5 percent on April 27 after inflation slowed and the outlook
for economic growth improved. To aid the economic recovery in
the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  has kept its target rate within a
record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  “We’ve got this amount of global liquidity and emerging-
market bonds look relatively attractive and  Mexico  fits into
that camp,” Vivienne Taberer, who helps manage about $10.3
billion in emerging-market assets including Mexican local-
currency bonds at Investec Asset Management, said by phone from
 Cape Town . “Mexico like South Africa and one or two other
limited markets don’t have anything in place to stop foreign
ownership.”  Global investors held 43.7 percent of outstanding Mexican
local-currency, fixed-rate bonds known as Mbonos on April 25,
compared with 33.2 percent a year earlier, according to the most
recent data available from the central bank.  The peso was little changed at 13.1632 per U.S. dollar,
from 13.1680 on May 4. It earlier touched 13.2990, the weakest
intraday level since Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
