OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s largest non-state
oil producer, gained after Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said he expects President  Vladimir Putin  to ease rules
restricting access to offshore fields to government-controlled
companies.  The  shares  rose 0.2 percent to 1,717.10 rubles as of 2:21
p.m. in Moscow, erasing losses of as much as 2.7 percent. Urals
crude, Russia’s benchmark export blend, lost 0.7 percent to
$110.19 per barrel.  The subsoil resources law is likely to be amended to
“remove the disbalance” between state and non-state producers,
Alekperov said today in an interview at the Kremlin after
Putin’s inauguration. Lukoil will probably gain direct access to
resources on the continental shelf in the coming years, he said,
declining to comment on talks with state-run OAO Rosneft about
offshore cooperation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
