China XD Electric Co. (601179)  rallied to a
five-month high in Shanghai trading after saying  General
Electric Co. (GE)  will invest 3.38 billion  yuan  ($536 million) for a
15 percent stake in the Chinese electrical-equipment maker.  The  shares  jumped 9.9 percent to 4.33 yuan, the highest
closing price since Dec. 8. The Xi’an, China-based company will
issue 768.9 million shares at 4.4 yuan each and will jointly
invest in a venture with GE, according to a Shanghai Stock
Exchange filing yesterday.  “By cooperating with GE, XD can expand its secondary
equipment business and develop comprehensive engineering
contracting capabilities,” Liu Jiangxiao, a Shanghai-based
analyst at Qilu Securities Co., said in a report today. “XD can
also leverage on GE’s brand name and sales network to develop
overseas markets.”  A tie-up with GE may help XD cope with slowing power-
equipment demand at home as  China  seeks to cool inflation and
restructure its economy. The nation’s power use is expected to
rise by an average 8.8 percent annually in the five years ending
2015, before slowing to 5.6 percent annually through 2020, the
China Electricity Council said in a report dated March 9.  GE will provide 258 million yuan and XD will invest 371
million yuan in the joint venture to develop electrical
transmission and distribution and grid automation solutions,
according to the filing. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE issued
a release that didn’t give financial details.  Energy Focus  GE Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  has retooled the
company in the past decade to focus on manufacturing businesses
led by energy, tapping rapid growth from new roads, airports and
hospitals in markets from China to  Brazil .  GE will buy the equity stake and make the joint venture
investment through a Singapore-based unit, XD said yesterday.
The venture will be formed under a 30-year contract and has a
total planned investment of 1.26 billion yuan, it said. XD said
it will hold 59 percent of the venture and GE 41 percent.  XD had 4.36 billion  shares  outstanding as of March 31, of
which 1.32 billion were in the public float, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock had been suspended from trading
in  Shanghai  since April 23 for the announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
