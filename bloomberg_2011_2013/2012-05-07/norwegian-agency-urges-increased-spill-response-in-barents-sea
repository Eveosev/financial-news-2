Norway’s Climate and Pollution Agency
urged increased spill response capability in the  Barents Sea  as
the country opens up for more exploration and production.  The agency also said that the seabed fauna on many of the
areas proposed for exploration hasn’t been studied properly and
urged operators to take heed of the bird populations on nearby
Bjoernoeya, according to an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
