French banks tumbled in Paris trading
after the election victory of Francois Hollande raised concern
that lenders will face higher taxes and may have to split off
some of their riskier operations.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  fell as much as 4.1 percent,  Societe
Generale SA (GLE)  declined as much as 4.5 percent, while Credit
Agricole SA slid as much as 5.4 percent.  Hollande yesterday defeated President  Nicolas Sarkozy  with
about 51.7 percent of the vote, becoming the first Socialist to
win the presidency in 17 years.  Hollande, who campaigned calling finance his “greatest
adversary,” had pledged that he would force banks to split
retail and  “speculative” investment operations, impose a tax on
all transactions and increase the levy on bank profits by 15
percent. The moves would come as the lenders struggle to shrink
after writing down Greek bonds in history’s largest debt
restructuring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
