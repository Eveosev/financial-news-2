Iran  is to get help from  China  in
making electric vehicles that will cut air pollution,  Press TV 
reported, citing Ali Mohammad Shaeri, the deputy head of Iran’s
organization for environmental protection.  During a May 5 visit to Shanghai, an Iranian delegation
reached agreement with Chinese company officials to cooperate in
building electric buses and minibuses, according to a report on
the state-run news channel’s website.  In Tehran, cars produce at least 4,400 tons of air
pollutants a day, according to a study by Iran’s Air Quality
Control Co., Press TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
