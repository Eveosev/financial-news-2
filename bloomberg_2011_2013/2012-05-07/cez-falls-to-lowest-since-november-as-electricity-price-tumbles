CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
fell for a fourth day, to its weakest in more than five months,
as the electricity price declined to its lowest in 17 months.  The stock retreated as much as 2.5 percent, to its weakest
intraday price since Nov. 29, before trading down 1.7 percent at
713 koruna by 12:37 p.m. in Prague. The  PX (PX)  equity index, in
which CEZ has a 20 percent weighting, dropped 1.3 percent.  Commodities fell globally after elections in France and
Greece showed voters rejecting austerity, while U.S. employers
added fewer jobs than forecast, driving investors from riskier
assets. Power for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ
exports part of its output, declined 0.2 percent to 49.6 euros
per megawatt-hour, the lowest price since December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
