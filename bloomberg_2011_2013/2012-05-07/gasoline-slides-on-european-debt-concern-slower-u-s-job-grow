Heating oil slid to the lowest level
this year on speculation that diesel use will slow as the
outcomes of elections in France and  Greece  raised concern that
euro-nation countries won’t agree how to address the region’s
debt crisis.  Futures sank as  Francois Hollande  was elected president of
France, pledging to push for less austerity and more growth. In
Greece, voters flocked to anti-bailout parties. Prices also fell
after Labor Department figures on May 4 showed the U.S. added
fewer jobs than expected during April.  “There’s concern that diesel demand will struggle due to
the weakness and uncertainty in  Europe ,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.  June-delivery heating oil dropped 2.74 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9814 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the fifth straight loss and lowest settlement
since Dec. 30.  U.S. deliveries of transportation and heating fuel to
wholesalers, in the four weeks ended April 27, fell 1.6 percent
below a year earlier, according to the Energy Department weekly
inventory report on May 2. Total fuel use was 1.7 percent less
than in 2011.  “The Greeks and the French stirred up fears there won’t a
cohesive policy coming out of Europe,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.
“The jobs report prompted some selling and added to fears we
are going to have a slowing global economy.”  U.S. Payrolls  Payrolls in the U.S. climbed 115,000, the smallest gain in
six months, after a revised 154,000 rise in March that was more
than initially estimated, department figures showed. The median
estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a 160,000 advance.  Hollande defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy , who became the first
French president in more than 30 years to fail to win re-
election. Hollande advocates a more aggressive European Central
Bank role in spurring growth -- a measure opposed by  Germany .  Citigroup Inc. said today that the risk of Greece leaving
the euro within the next 12 to 18 months is as high as 75
percent.  “The impetus today are the elections,” said  Andrew Lebow ,
a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .
“There’s concern about Europe. What happens if there is a
dramatic risk-off trade? The market could be vulnerable.”  Heating Oil Premium  Heating oil’s premium to gasoline has been narrowing since
reaching 8 cents on May 1. The gap slipped to 1.04 cents today
from 3.3 cents May 4.  Gasoline strengthened relative to heating oil “partly in
expectation that demand will pick up near the Memorial Day
holiday and that diesel demand will struggle due to the weakness
and uncertainty in Europe,” Flynn said.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.17 cent to settle at
$2.9741 on the exchange, the lowest settlement in three months.  U.S. gasoline consumption over the four weeks ended April
27 was 4.7 percent below a year earlier, according to an Energy
Department  report  released May 2. Exports averaged 412,000
barrels a day, down from 616,000 barrels a day in early March.  “U.S. demand has been lackluster to say the least,” Lebow
said. “A lot of the support for gasoline has come from export
demand.”  Gasoline has dropped 13 percent since reaching a 2012 high
of $3.4166 on March 26, paring its year-to-date gain to 11
percent from 27 percent.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6
cent to $3.777 a gallon yesterday, the lowest level since March
8, according to AAA. Prices have dropped 15.9 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Prices peaked in 2011
at $3.985 on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
