U.S. farmers accelerated corn and
soybean planting last week ahead of weekend rains in the Midwest
that will spur seed emergence and plant growth.  About 71 percent of the  corn  crop was sown as of yesterday,
up from 53 percent a week earlier and 32 percent a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . The
average for the previous five years is 47 percent, and the
record for the 17th week of the year was 81 percent in 2010.  An estimated 32 percent of the plants had emerged from the
ground, compared with 15 percent a week earlier and 6 percent a
year earlier, the USDA said. The average emergence for the prior
five years was 13 percent.  About 24 percent of the  soybean  crop was planted, compared
with 12 percent a week earlier and the previous five-year
average of 11 percent, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
