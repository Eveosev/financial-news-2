Bayerische Landesbank AG’s Hungarian
unit, MKB Bank Zrt., expects to become profitable in 2013 or
2014, state news service MTI reported, citing Pal Simak, the
lender’s chief executive officer.  MKB will post a loss in 2012 for the third consecutive
year, chiefly because of a special levy on banks and government
programs that’s intended to help foreign-currency mortgage
holders, the news service said.  The German lender won’t sell MKB within the next three to
five years, MTI cited Simak as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
