The number of people killed on U.S.
highways fell in 2011 for the sixth straight year, the longest
streak of declines in the nation’s history.  Crash fatalities dropped 1.7 percent to an estimated 32,310
from a year earlier, the  National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration  said today in a report. The fatality rate, or the
number of people killed for every 100 million vehicle miles
traveled, slid to 1.09 from 1.11 in 2010.  The report, which is preliminary until final figures are
released later this year, gave no reason for the decline. The
decline coincided with U.S. drivers traveling 1.2 percent fewer
vehicle miles as  gasoline  prices rose 6.7 percent, according to
motoring group AAA.  The U.S. government has tracked deaths on U.S. roads since
1899, when 26 people died in motor vehicle crashes.  Fatalities declined in all four quarters last year after
rising in 2010’s third and fourth quarters. Those increases
followed 17 consecutive quarters of decreases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
