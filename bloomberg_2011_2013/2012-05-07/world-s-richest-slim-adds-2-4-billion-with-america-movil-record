Billionaire  Carlos Slim  extended his
lead as the world’s richest man by $2.4 billion today as his
wireless carrier  America Movil  SAB rose to a record.  The shares advanced 4.9 percent to 18.66 pesos in Mexico
City, the highest closing price since America Movil’s 2001
spinoff from Telefonos de Mexico SAB, as the company overcame a
regulatory hurdle and showed improved profits in Brazil. That
boosted the net worth of Slim, who owns a 30 percent stake in
America Movil, to $76.2 billion, according to the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index . His fortune is up 23.8 percent year-to-date.  A settlement last week with Mexico’s antitrust regulator is
creating optimism that America Movil can grow in its biggest
market, said Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital USA
Inc. in New York. America Movil agreed to cut fees charged to
competitors as the government dropped a fine of almost $1
billion assessed last year for anticompetitive practices.  “Now you’ve got a relatively stable economy with improving
fundamentals and a more benign regulatory environment,” said
Smithen, who advises buying the shares. “We think there’s still
room to go on a big run.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
