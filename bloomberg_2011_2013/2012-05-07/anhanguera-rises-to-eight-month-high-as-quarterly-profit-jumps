Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA (AEDU3) , Brazil’s largest education company by market value, advanced
to an eight-month high after reporting profit that exceeded some
analysts’ forecasts.  Anhanguera rose 5.3 percent to 27.05 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the highest price since Sept. 1. The
benchmark Bovespa index climbed 0.7 percent.  The company reported first-quarter net income rose 34
percent from a year earlier to 62 million reais ($32 million),
exceeding an estimate for profit of 58.4 million reais by
analysts at Fator Corretora. The number of new undergraduate and
graduate students enrolled grew 46 percent to 146,900.  “Anhanguera posted a good result,” Fator analysts
including Jacqueline Lison wrote in a note to clients.
Enrollment figures were “excellent,” they said.  The number of students financed by the government loan
system known as FIES increased to 36,125 in the first quarter,
from 4,189 a year before, Anhanguera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
