Matt Simms, the younger son of former
 New York  Giants quarterback Phil Simms, was signed by the New
York Jets following a tryout.  Simms, who was an undrafted free-agent after playing for
the University of Tennessee last season, signed with the Jets
yesterday, a day after completing a team rookie minicamp, Bruce Speight, a spokesman for the Jets, said in an e-mail.  The 23-year-old Simms played in 18 games at quarterback for
the Volunteers the past two seasons, including 10 starts,
completing 140 of 257 passes for 1,779 yards and eight
touchdowns, with eight interceptions.  “The thing that you’re impressed with immediately is how
he can throw the football,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said at a May 5
news conference. “The kid has the arm talent, and he obviously
has the pedigree.”  Phil Simms played for the Giants from 1979 to 1993, leading
the team to a  Super Bowl  win during the 1986 season. He was
named to the Pro Bowl in 1985 and 1993.  Chris Simms, Matt’s older brother, was a National Football
League quarterback from 2003 to 2010. He played five seasons
with the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  and had stints with the Tennessee
Titans and Denver Broncos.  Mark Sanchez and  Tim Tebow  probably will be the Jets’ top
two quarterbacks next season. Quarterbacks Greg McElroy and G.J.
Kinne also are on the team’s roster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
