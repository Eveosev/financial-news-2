The  European Central Bank ’s  financing 
to Portuguese lenders fell in April from the previous month, the
Bank of  Portugal  said.  ECB  financing  decreased to 55.4 billion euros ($72.2
billion) from a record 56.3 billion euros in March, the Lisbon-
based Bank of Portugal said today on the BPStat portion of its
website.  Financing reached a record in March after the Frankfurt-
based ECB awarded 529.5 billion euros to 800 financial
institutions at the end of February. The central bank’s second
round of three-year loans was designed to avert credit paralysis
and ease concern that  Europe ’s banks would run out of cash or
curb lending as the debt crisis drove up borrowing costs.  In April last year, Portugal became the third euro-area
country after Greece and Ireland to require aid and will receive
78 billion euros under its agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The aid plan earmarks 12
billion euros for Portugal’s lenders, if needed.  As part of the plan, those lenders were required to raise
core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9 percent by the end of 2011 and
10 percent by the end of 2012. In addition, the EU banking
regulator ordered the region’s banks to have a 9 percent capital
ratio by the end of June after marking down their holdings of
sovereign debt to market prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
