The European Union and the world’s
poorest nations joined forces to call for more-ambitious
measures to reduce  carbon emissions  globally and to encourage
private investors to team up with public institutions to finance
the fight against  climate change .  Ministers from more than 30 least-developed countries and
EU officials pledged today at an informal gathering in Brussels
to push for an ambitious outcome of the next United Nations
climate summit in Doha toward the end of this year.  Countries worldwide should step up their emission-reduction
efforts and deliver on their pledge to iron out by 2015 a global
deal to cut pollution, EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard 
told a press conference today.  “It’s very clear we’re all in agreement: no
backtracking,” Hedegaard said. “It’s very important to get
more people on board.”  The UN Environment Program said in November that current
pledges to reduce  greenhouse gases  by 2020 need to double in
order to keep the planet on a trajectory that limits warming
since industrialization to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit).  “If we respect what science is saying, we should have much
better ambitions,” Fatou Gaye, Gambia’s Minister for Forestry
and Environment, told the news conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
