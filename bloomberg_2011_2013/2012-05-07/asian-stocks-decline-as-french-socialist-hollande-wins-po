Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index declining the most in six months, as concern
grew that the European debt crisis may worsen after  Francois
Hollande  was elected France’s first Socialist president in
almost two decades.  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s No. 1 maker of mobile
phones by sales, dropped 1.3 percent in Seoul after U.S.
employers added fewer jobs than expected. Sony Corp. sank 4.5
percent, leading losses among Japanese exporters on concern a
weaker euro will damp overseas income. Miner and oil producer
BHP Billiton Ltd. lost 4.1 percent in Sydney as copper and crude
futures fell.  “The situation in Europe is tough,” Khiem Do, Hong Kong-
based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset
Management Asia Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television. The firm
oversees about $10 billion. “Very few nations can stand
austerity. If the European Monetary Union stays the same,
something has to give.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 2.4 percent to 121.14
as of 5:30 p.m. in  Tokyo , its biggest drop since Nov. 10. About
10 shares fell for each that rose on the gauge. The measure lost
0.2 percent last week after Australia’s central bank cut its
economic growth forecast and U.S. services industries expanded
less than forecast, sparking concern the global recovery may be
faltering.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  sank 2.8 percent as Japanese
markets resumed trading after a four-day weekend. South Korea’s
Kospi Index slid 1.6 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
closed down 2.2 percent, its biggest loss since December.  Volatility Surges  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index declined 2.6 percent, while
 China ’s Shanghai Composite Index was little changed. Trading
volumes in  Japan , Hong Kong and China were at least 2.6 percent
above the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News.  Volatility rose as stocks tumbled. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI) ,
a measure of options prices on the Hang Seng, jumped 19 percent
to 22.29 for the biggest gain in six months. The Nikkei Stock
Average Volatility Index surged 14 percent to 22.58, the highest
since March 15.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
today. The gauge sank 1.6 percent in  New York  on May 4 after a
report showed payrolls climbed 115,000 in April, the smallest
gain in six months and below economists’ estimates for a 160,000
advance. The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a three-year low
of 8.1 percent as people left the  labor force .  Exporters Fall  Exporters to the U.S. declined. Samsung Electronics slid
1.3 percent to 1.342 million won in Seoul. Li & Fung Ltd., a
supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank 5.1
percent to HK$16.32 in Hong Kong. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker
that gets 44 percent of sales from  North America , dropped 5.6
percent to 2,660 yen in Tokyo.  “In the U.S., the job recovery is getting sluggish,
fueling concern that may have a bad impact on  consumer spending 
and housing markets,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst
at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “There’s concern that the European
debt problem may get serious. The euro is being sold in the
 currency market  and that’s negative for Japanese stocks.”  Japanese exporters also declined after the euro fell to its
lowest level against the yen in almost three months as French
voters elected Hollande president and Greek voters flocked to
anti-bailout parties, stoking concern austerity efforts in
Europe may be derailed.  Socialist President  Sony, which gets about 21 percent of sales from  Europe ,
dropped 4.5 percent to 1,213 yen, headed for its lowest close
since April 1987. Canon Inc., which counts Europe as its biggest
market, dropped 1.9 percent to 3,530 yen.  Hollande, the first Socialist in 17 years to lead Europe’s
second-biggest economy, pledged to push for less austerity. He
got about 52 percent of the vote against about 48 percent for
Nicolas Sarkozy, according to estimates by four pollsters.
Hollande’s platform calls for policies German Chancellor Angela
Merkel opposes, including increased spending and a delayed
deficit-reduction effort.  Energy companies posted the second-biggest decline among
the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Crude oil
for June delivery plunged as much as 3.2 percent in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Copper for July
delivery fell as much as 1.5 percent.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil
producer, slipped 2.5 percent to A$34.50. Oil explorer Inpex
Corp. declined 5.3 percent to 499,000 yen. Cnooc Ltd., China’s
largest offshore crude producer, decreased 4.2 percent to
HK$15.84 in Hong Kong.  BHP, Rio Drop  BHP dropped 4.1 percent to A$34.57.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the
world’s No. 3 mining company by market value, sank 4.5 percent
to A$62. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the
metal, slid 3.3 percent to HK$18.30.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 9 percent this year
through May 4, compared with a 8.9 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 3.5 percent increase for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are  valued  at 1.3 times book value,
compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number
below one means companies can be bought for less than value of
their assets.  Gree Inc. and DeNA Co. led declines among Japanese game
makers as the nation’s consumer agency said it’s probing whether
a sales method used by operators is illegal. Gree tumbled 23
percent to 1,651 yen. DeNA slumped 20 percent to 1,990 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
