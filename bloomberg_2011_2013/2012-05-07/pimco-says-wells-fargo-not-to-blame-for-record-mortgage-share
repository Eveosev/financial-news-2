Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, has seen its market share surpassing records
because of retreats by its rivals, not its own actions,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Scott Simon .  “It’s not Wells Fargo’s fault they got so big,” Simon,
the mortgage-debt head at Newport Beach, California-based Pimco,
which runs the world’s largest bond fund, said today at a
Mortgage Bankers Association conference in New York.  Wells Fargo made 33.9 percent of the $385 billion of
mortgages originated in the first quarter, up from 30.1 percent
in the preceding three months, according to industry newsletter
Inside Mortgage Finance. That’s more than triple the share of
the closest competitor, JPMorgan Chase & Co., with 10.6 percent.  Lenders including  Bank of America Corp. , the former market
leader whose share fell to 4.2 percent, have scaled back after
losses and lawsuits sparked by faulty home lending and
servicing, as well as so-called Basel III regulations that are
set to require banks to hold more capital when owning relatively
large amounts of servicing contracts.  “If Wells Fargo went back to 20 percent, tried to cut
themselves back more, it’d be hugely restrictive on credit,”
Simon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
