India  plans to cut its oil imports
from Iran by 20 percent this financial year, four Indian
government and refinery officials with direct knowledge of the
matter said.  Asia’s third-biggest importer of crude will curtail its
purchases from the Persian Gulf nation to 14 million tons from
17.5 million tons in the 12 months ending March 31, the
officials said. They asked not to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak on the subject.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in  New Delhi 
today, where she will urge Indian officials to assist the U.S.-
led campaign to pressure Iran over its disputed nuclear program.  Clinton is pressing India to cooperate with U.S. sanctions
that call for countries to “significantly reduce” purchases of
Iranian oil in order to squeeze  Iran  economically.  To contact the reporter on this story:
