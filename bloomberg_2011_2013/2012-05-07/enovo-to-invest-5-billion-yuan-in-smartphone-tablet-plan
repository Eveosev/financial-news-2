Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of personal computers, said it will invest 5
billion yuan ($792 million) to set up a plant to research and
produce mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.  The plant in Wuhan, China, will open in October 2013 and
create 10,000 jobs, Lenovo said in a statement today. The plant
will generate sales of 10 billion yuan by 2014 and that will
rise to 50 billion yuan within five years, the company said.  The Chinese company, which bought the personal computer
division of International Business Machines Corp. in 2005, is
diversifying into tablets and smartphones under Chief Executive
Officer Yang Yuanqing to compete with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which
dominates the global tablet market with its iPad.  Lenovo, with headquarters in Beijing and North Carolina,
had 13.4 percent of the global PC market in the first quarter,
trailing  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s 18 percent, according to data
from researcher IDC. Apple leads the world in tablets with 68
percent market share in the quarter, according to IDC.  Lenovo fell 2 percent to HK$7.51 at 9:50 a.m. in trading on
the Hong Kong stock exchange. The  shares  have gained 45 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent advance in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
