Trakcja-Tiltra SA (TRK) , the Polish railway
and road builder, declined the most in two weeks after Maciej Radziwill said in an interview with  Parkiet  newspaper that he
may “soon” step down as chief executive officer.  The shares fell as much as 4.7 percent to 1.02 zloty, the
steepest loss since April 23, and traded 0.9 percent weaker at
9:28 a.m. local time, valuing the company at 246 million zloty
($76.3 million).  Radziwill may take a post of a chairman or a member of the
company’s supervisory board, Parkiet cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
