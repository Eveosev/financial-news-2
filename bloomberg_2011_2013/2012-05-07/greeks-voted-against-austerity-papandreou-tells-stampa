Greeks voted yesterday against
financial austerity and not against the European Union, former
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  told Italian newspaper la
Stampa in an interview.  “This is not a vote for or against  Europe , this is a vote
for or against austerity,” Papandreou said, according to the
Turin-based daily. Greeks are suffering “from the tough
austerity measures” taken so far, he said.  “This is not a vote that marks the end of Pasok,” said
Papandreou, referring to his socialist party. Europe needs
project bonds to finance infrastructure, he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
