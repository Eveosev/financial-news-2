Diamond Foods Inc. (DMND) , the snack company
planning to restate two years of earnings, appointed Brian J.
Driscoll chief executive officer as it works to strengthen its
balance sheet.  Driscoll, who also will be president and a company
director, was CEO of Hostess Brands Inc. until March, San
Francisco-based Diamond said today in a statement. He spent 15
years at Nabisco and  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) , which acquired the
biscuit maker. Driscoll, 53, also worked at Procter & Gamble Co.  The producer of Diamond walnuts and Kettle Chips is looking
to rebuild its  balance sheet  after saying in February that the
company reported certain costs in the wrong quarters and that it
would need to restate earnings. The snack maker replaced CEO
Michael Mendes and its chief financial officer and now is trying
to repair the business.  Diamond rose 5.1 percent to $22.27 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have fallen 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
