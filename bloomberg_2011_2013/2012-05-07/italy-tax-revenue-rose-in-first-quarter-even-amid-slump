Italian tax revenue rose 0.7 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry 
said in a report published today.  Tax revenue amounted to about 88 billion euros ($115
billion) in the first three months of the year, according to the
report. Direct taxes rose 0.1 percent over the same period,
while indirect taxes rose 1.4 percent.  The increase came after the government of Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  raised value-added tax and levies on gasoline last
year as part of a 20 billion-euro austerity plan that seeks to
eliminate the budget deficit in 2014. Tax revenue held up even
with the economy slipping into its fourth  recession  since 2001
in the final three months of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
