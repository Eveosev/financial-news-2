Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co. said
a “big gap” remains with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  after the U.S. company
offered compensation to settle their dispute over ownership of
the iPad trademark in  China .  Apple proposed an amount of money to resolve the legal case
as part of the mediation process being directed by the Higher
People’s Court of Guangdong, Roger Xie, a lawyer for Proview,
said by phone today. He declined to disclose the amount or when
Apple made the offer.  “The Guangdong Higher People’s court is trying to mediate
this, and both parties are trying to negotiate and come to a
settlement,” Xie said. “Right now, there is still a big gap
between the two sides on the settlement amount.”  Carolyn Wu, a spokeswoman for Apple in Beijing, declined to
comment on Xie’s remarks. Apple has said it acquired the rights
to the iPad trademark in China from a Proview sister company in
2009 and that the company has refused to honor that agreement.  On Feb. 29, the Guangdong court heard Apple’s appeal of a
lower court ruling last year that Proview owned the iPad
trademark in China. Proview, a failed maker of computer
displays, has filed separate complaints alleging that Apple’s
sale of iPad tablets in the country infringed intellectual-
property laws.  Proview Technology is a unit of Hong Kong-listed  Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334) , whose shares have been suspended
from trading since 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
