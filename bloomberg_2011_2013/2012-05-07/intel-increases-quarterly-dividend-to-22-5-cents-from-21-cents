Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, increased its quarterly dividend 7.1 percent to 22.5
cents as it anticipates growth in the mobile-phone market may
help make 2012 a year of “record revenues.”  “Strong demand in our core business and significant
progress in smartphones” will help drive the gains, said  Paul
Otellini , president and chief executive officer, in a statement
today. “This latest dividend increase is one more example of
our commitment to return cash to our stockholders.”  Intel expects to be a “big player” in smartphones over
the next five years, after debuting its chips in the devices
last month, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said at the
time. The company is trying to take advantage of the growth in
computing through mobile devices to help weather waning demand
in personal computers -- where it has more than 80 percent of
the market.  Intel’s quarterly dividend increased three times in the
last 18 months. The shares fell 0.5 percent to $27.76 at the
close in  New York . The stock has climbed 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
