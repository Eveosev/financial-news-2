India ’s  12-year bonds  fell for a
second day on speculation investors will sell existing notes to
make room for purchases when the government issues a new 10-year
benchmark security.  The yield on the most-traded notes climbed to a one-week
high as a finance ministry official said a new 2022 bond may be
auctioned as early as in two weeks, asking not to be identified
as the information isn’t public. Bonds gained earlier on
optimism a decline in  oil prices  will help ease inflation.  “The plan to issue a new security means interest in
existing securities would fade and demand would drop,” said
R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer for debt and currencies
at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ)  “Yields may harden till it’s
known what the government’s borrowing plans are.”  The yield on the 9.15 percent note due November 2024 added
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.70 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the highest level since April 30. It dropped to as low as 8.63
percent earlier.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell three basis points today to 8.04 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
