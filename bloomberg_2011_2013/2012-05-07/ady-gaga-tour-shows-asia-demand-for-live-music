Last week was Lady Gaga's first set of 
concerts in Hong Kong and the second stop on the Asian leg of 
her world tour. These days chart successes join niche bands and 
regional artists in planning concert dates in multiple 
countries across the region. With growing demand and spending 
power, Asia is becoming a bright spot as the music industry 
grapples with falling sales and stalling economies elsewhere.
