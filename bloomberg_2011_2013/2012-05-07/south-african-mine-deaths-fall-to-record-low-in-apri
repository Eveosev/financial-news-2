Mine deaths in  South Africa , the
nation with the deepest gold and platinum mines, fell to a
record low in April.  “There has been a significant improvement on health and
safety since the Department has intensified the enforcement
measures at the mines,” Mines Minister Susan Shabangu said in a
copy of a May 3 speech on her department’s website. Three
fatalities were reported last month compared with typically more
than 11 deaths monthly, she said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
