Singer Lady Gaga raised 6 million yen
($75,000) as part of a U.S.-sponsored effort to support  Japan ’s
recovery from last year’s earthquake and tsunami by auctioning
off a tea cup with her autograph and a lipstick kiss.  The blue, white and gold cup hasn’t been washed since the
pop star drank  Diet Coke  from it at a press conference with U.S.
Ambassador John Roos last June in Tokyo. The auction, on  Yahoo
Japan Corp. (4689) , ended at midnight and proceeds will go to the
Tomodachi Arts Fellowship Program that sponsors young Japanese
to study in the U.S.  Lady Gaga came to Tokyo 10 weeks after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami struck northern Japan, which left almost
20,000 people dead or missing and spawned the worst nuclear
disaster in 25 years. She wrote “We Pray for Japan” on the
Narumi-brand cup, and pledged to sell it to support relief
efforts.  The singer of “Born this Way” returns to Japan to give
three concerts on May 10th, May 12th and May 13th at the Saitama
Super Arena near  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
