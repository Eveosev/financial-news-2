The  Ivy League  signed a two-year
renewal agreement with the  NBC Sports Network  to show as many as
10 football, 10 men’s basketball and four men’s lacrosse games a
year, the league and network said.  The agreement also calls for the Comcast Corp. unit to
televise the annual football game between  Harvard University  and
Yale University known as “The Game” in 2012 and 2013. This
fall’s contest will be the 129th in the series. Yale leads 65-
55-8.  Financial details were not disclosed.  “We are proud to again partner with the  Ivy League , a
conference whose institutions and student-athletes consistently
comport themselves with great distinction while attracting an
audience with a favorable demographic for our growing sports
network,” Jon Miller, president of programming for NBC Sports
and the NBC Sports Network said in a statement.  Starting this fall, the NBC Sports Network will show six to
10 football and men’s basketball games, and as many as four
men’s lacrosse games.  The network has also acquired the rights to sublicense
additional football and men’s basketball games.  The NBC Sports Network was known as Versus before it was
rebranded on Jan. 2. It is in almost 80 million U.S households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
