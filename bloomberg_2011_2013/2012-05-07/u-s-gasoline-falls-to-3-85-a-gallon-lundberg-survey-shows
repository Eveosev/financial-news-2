The average price for regular gasoline
at U.S. filling stations fell 6.75 cents to $3.8452 a gallon,
according to  Lundberg Survey Inc.   The survey covers the two-week period ended May 4 and is
based on information received from about 2,500 stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The price is 15.49 cents
lower than a year earlier, when the average was $3.9998. The
highest average this year was $3.9671, during the period ended
April 6.  “It is crude oil that has delivered this retail gasoline
price decline,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey,
said yesterday in a telephone interview. “This is good news for
motorists.”  The price of gasoline has become an issue in the 2012  U.S.
presidential election . Republicans have said President  Barack Obama ’s decision to delay construction of the $5.3 billion
Keystone XL oil pipeline has contributed to higher prices at the
pump.  Obama rejected the pipeline after Nebraska state officials
and environmental groups objected to the route that crosses the
Ogallala aquifer, a drinking-water source for 1.5 million
people. TransCanada reapplied for a U.S. permit for the pipeline
May 4.  Crude Oil Prices  Prices at the pump fell as West Texas Intermediate crude in
New York slid 4.4 percent in the two weeks ended May 4. Crude
for May delivery on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange fell $4.56
to $98.49 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Feb. 7.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex fell 16.69 cents, or 5.3
percent, to a two-month low of $2.9758 a gallon in the two weeks
ended April 20. Since March 26, when gasoline reached $3.4166,
the front-month contract has fallen 13 percent.  Oil may decline next week after U.S. and European data
signaled that economic growth and fuel demand will slow, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Eighteen of 33 analysts, or 55 percent, forecast oil will
decline through May 11. Eleven respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted prices will rise and four estimated there will be
little change.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline fell to $4.06 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.18.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average was $4.32 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa,  Oklahoma ,
where customers paid an average of $3.40 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
