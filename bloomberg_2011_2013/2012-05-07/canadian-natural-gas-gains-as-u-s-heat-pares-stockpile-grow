Canadian natural gas rose amid
speculation that hotter-than-normal weather in the U.S. reduced
additions to stockpiles, decreasing a record surplus.  June gas in  Alberta  rose 1.6 percent. Cooling demand across
the U.S. was more than double normal levels in the week ended
May 4, according to Weather Derivatives. Temperatures surged in
the Midwest, the biggest consuming region for  Canada ’s gas
output. Chicago’s high May 3 was 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30
Celsius), 20 above normal, AccuWeather Inc. said.  “If our estimated storage change is correct, this would
mean a cumulative decline of 186 billion cubic feet from the
peak storage level of five weeks ago,” said Stephen Smith, an
energy analyst and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates
in Natchez, Mississippi. Smith estimates storage rose 21 billion
cubic feet, compared with a five-year average of 25 billion.  Alberta gas for June delivery gained 2.75 cents to C$1.785
a gigajoule ($1.71 per million British thermal units) as of 2:50
p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas has declined 37 percent this year.  Natural gas for June delivery advanced 5.7 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $2.336 per million Btu on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
6.66 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.3534 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 1.52 cents to $2.0721 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices increased 8.34 cents, or 4 percent, to $2.1735.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 378 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.06 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.25 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.37 billion cubic feet today, or 52 percent
of its capacity of 2.23 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.88
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
