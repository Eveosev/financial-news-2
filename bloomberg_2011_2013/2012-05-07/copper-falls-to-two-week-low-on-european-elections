Copper declined to a two-week low in
 New York  after Socialist Francois Hollande was elected president
of France, prompting concerns that austerity efforts may be
derailed, and U.S. payrolls rose by the least in six months.  July-delivery metal on the Comex fell as much as 1.5
percent to $3.6665 a pound, the lowest for the most active
contract since April 24, and traded at $3.687 at 3:57 p.m.
Shanghai time. August-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 1.2 percent lower at 57,590  yuan  ($9,128) a
metric ton. The London Metal Exchange is closed for a holiday.  “The elections in Europe indicate uncertainties in
resolving Europe’s debt issues, which has led to a broad market
reaction,” said  Li Peng , an analyst at Guotai Junan Futures Co.  Hollande defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy  to be the first Socialist
president in 17 years, and told his supporters “austerity isn’t
inevitable,” after he got about 52 percent against about 48
percent for Sarkozy last night. His comments were echoed in
 Greece , where voters flocked to anti-bailout groups, leaving the
two main parties a seat short of a majority if they govern
together, an Interior Ministry projection showed.  U.S. payrolls climbed 115,000 in April, the smallest gain
in six months, according to Labor Department data on May 4.  Net-long  positions , or wagers on rising prices, held by
funds were 15,582 futures and options contracts as of May 1,
compared with 2,217 a week earlier, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
