Japan  has none of its 50 reactors
operating as of today after its sole operating nuclear unit was
halted for planned maintenance last week.  Hokkaido Electric Power Co. shut the No. 3 unit at its
Tomari plant in northern Japan on May 5 as scheduled, leaving
the country without an operating reactor for the first time
since May 1970.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.  removed  the four reactors at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station from its operational list on
April 19 due to damage caused by the March 11 quake and tsunami.  The following table shows the status of the 50 reactors
with capacity of 46,148 megawatts operated by Japanese power
companies. Capacity figures are in megawatts.
