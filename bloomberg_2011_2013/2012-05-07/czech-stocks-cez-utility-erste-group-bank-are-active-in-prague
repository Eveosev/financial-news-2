The Czech  PX (PX)  stock index fell for a
fourth day, sliding 0.3 percent to 916.1 at its close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power producer, slid
0.7 percent to 720.1 koruna, the lowest close since Nov. 29.
Electricity for next-year delivery in  Germany , where the company
exports part of its output, declined 0.2 percent to 49.6 euros
per megawatt-hour, the weakest since December 2010.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of Austria lost as much as
3.3 percent to 405.8 koruna after voters in France and Greece
rejected fiscal austerity, raising concern the euro area’s debt
crisis won’t be contained.  European stocks reversed earlier decline after a German
report showed factory orders in the region’s largest economy
rose more than expected. Erste closed up 0.1 percent to 420
koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
