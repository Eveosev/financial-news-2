Support for the Muslim Brotherhood’s
candidate almost doubled in an opinion poll published in Al-
Ahram newspaper two weeks before  Egypt ’s presidential election,
while the two longstanding front-runners ceded ground.  Mohamed Mursi, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom
and Justice Party, rose to fourth place with 7 percent,
according to the weekly poll conducted by the Al Ahram Center
for Political and Strategic Studies. It interviewed 1,200 people
between April 27 and May 1, and cited a margin of error of three
percentage points.  Former Arab League chief  Amre Moussa  slipped to 39 percent
from 41 percent a week before, and second-placed Abdel-Moneim
Aboul Fotouh, an Islamist who parted ways with the Brotherhood
earlier in the year, fell 3 percentage points to 24 percent.
Ahmed Shafik, prime minister in the waning days of  Hosni Mubarak ’s government, jumped to 17 percent from 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
