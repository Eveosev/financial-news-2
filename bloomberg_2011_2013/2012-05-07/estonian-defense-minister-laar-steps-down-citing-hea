Estonia’s Defense Minister Mart Laar
resigned, citing health reasons.  Laar, 52, who suffered a stroke in February, submitted his
resignation to Premier  Andrus Ansip  yesterday, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit junior
coalition partner. His party is due to meet today to propose a
new candidate for the post.  Laar, Estonia’s first elected prime minister after the
country regained independence in 1991, liberalized prices in the
Baltic nation and began privatizations. Under him, Estonia
became the first country Eastern Europe to introduce a flat
income tax in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
