South Korean producer-price inflation
cooled to the slowest pace in 26 months on a decline in meat and
fish costs, according to a report released two days before a
monetary-policy meeting.  Prices climbed 2.4 percent in April from a year earlier,
the smallest gain since February 2010, after a 2.8 percent
increase in March, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in
Seoul today. Prices fell 0.1 percent from March.  “Waning price pressures will give policy makers more room
to stay pat for a long time or even cut  interest rates ,” said
 Park Sang Hyun , chief economist at HI Investment & Securities
Co. in Seoul. “Without a clear sign of growth momentum at home
and overseas and a limited government budget, they may consider
monetary easing as early as July.”  The Bank of Korea will keep its benchmark rate unchanged
for an 11th straight month, according to all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Samsung Securities Co. says that the
first cut since 2009 may come next quarter as waning inflation
allows policy makers to focus on spurring growth.  Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in 21 months, a government report
showed on May 1.  South Korea’s economy expanded at the fastest pace in a
year during the first quarter, boosted by  government spending 
and investments by semiconductor chipmakers. Still, the Bank of
Korea reduced its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.5
percent from 3.7 percent on April 16, citing downside risks from
the European debt crisis and high  oil prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
