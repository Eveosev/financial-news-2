Qatar Railway Co., which is building a
$35 billion metro and railway system in the Gulf emirate, plans
to award contracts for the elevated metro sections in the second
quarter of next year.  Track contracts, currently scheduled to be awarded in the
first quarter of 2014, may be brought forward to next year,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Geoff Mee said at a conference in
Doha, the Qatari capital. He declined to give the value of the
contracts, while saying they will be financed from government
revenue.  The company had to advance the first phase of the project
by 18 months to ensure key parts of the metro will be ready
should Qatar be awarded the 2020  Summer Olympics , Mee said on
Feb. 6. The emirate is hosting the 2022 World Cup soccer
tournament and will use the metro to transport fans to matches.  The first phase of the project, including metro lines
linking the airport to planned sporting venues, is scheduled to
start operating by the fourth quarter of 2019, Mee said.  Qatar Railway is evaluating bids submitted by 18 groups for
five packages of work that include digging tunnels and
constructing stations, and contracts for those projects will be
awarded in the fourth quarter, he said.  Drilling work for the metro will start at the beginning of
2013, Saad Al Mohannadi, Qatar Railwayâ€™s chief executive
officer, said Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
