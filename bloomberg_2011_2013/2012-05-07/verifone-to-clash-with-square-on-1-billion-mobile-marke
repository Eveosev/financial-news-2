(Corrects penultimate paragraph to say PayPal has 106
million accounts).  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , the largest
maker of credit-card terminals, will offer an attachment that
lets mobile devices accept credit and debit cards, making a
deeper push into a market pioneered by Square Inc. and  EBay
Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal.  Like Square, the current leader in the small-business
payment processing market, VeriFone will offer a matchbox-sized
attachment for mobile devices made by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  or those that
feature Google Inc.’s Android software to merchants for free.
VeriFone’s version will allow partners such as banks to
customize the service to transmit coupons and loyalty points to
consumers, said Greg Cohen, a senior vice president at  San Jose ,
California-based VeriFone.  The strategy could help VeriFone grab as much as 30 percent
of the micro-merchant processing market, set to reach $1 billion
in 2016 and up from $30 million last year,  Rick Oglesby , a
senior analyst at researcher Aite Group LLC, said in a phone
interview.  “It’s a new way of looking at commerce for VeriFone,”
Cohen said in a phone interview. “We’re not only providing the
hardware but also the payment processing and ability to do
social media.”  Square processes transactions at an annualized rate of $5
billion, Chief Operating Officer Keith Rabois said in an
interview last month. PayPal serves 106 million active accounts
in 190 markets and 25 currencies, according to its website.  VeriFone’s attachment integrates with stores’ existing cash
registers, loyalty and inventory systems. The device and the
related software, known as the SAIL application, was the first
product created by VeriFone’s new SMB Commerce division. The
unit includes staff from VeriFone’s acquisition of bills-payment
provider  ChargeSmart  and focuses on smaller merchants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
