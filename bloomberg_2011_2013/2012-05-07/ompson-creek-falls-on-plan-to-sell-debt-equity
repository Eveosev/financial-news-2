Thompson Creek Metals Co. (TCM) , a producer
of molybdenum from mines in  Canada  and the U.S., fell the most
in more than three years after saying it will sell debt and
shares to finance completion of a project in British Columbia.  Thompson Creek  dropped 16 percent to C$4.61 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since Nov. 7, 2008. The Littleton,
Colorado-based company has lost 35 percent this year.  Thompson Creek will sell $200 million of senior notes due
2019 and 8 million so-called tangible-equity units of $25 each,
it said in a statement today. The new units comprise a prepaid
stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note due May 15,
2015.  The proceeds will be used to complete construction of the
Mt. Milligan copper and gold project and for working capital,
the company said. The cost to build the mine may be as much as
C$1.5 billion ($1.51 billion), compared with an earlier estimate
of C$1.27 billion, because of higher prices for materials and
labor, the company said Feb. 27.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Thompson Creek’s
corporate family rating and probability of default rating one
level to Caa1 from B3 and assigned a Caa2 rating to the proposed
new notes.  While the financing plans today offer some short-term
relief from the company’s liquidity pressure, the company may
need to raise additional funds should the Mt. Milligan project’s
costs increase, Moody’s analysts led by Anna Zubets-Anderson
said in a statement.  Thompson Creek will generate negative free  cash flow  over
the next 12 to 18 months, which will “erode” the company’s
liquidity position, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
