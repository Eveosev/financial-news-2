VTB Bank OJSC attracted more than 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) in deposits from German savers, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified
persons in the financial industry.  VTB Bank’s German unit is led by the same managers who ran
Icelandic bank Kaupthing’s German subsidiary before its Sept.
2008 bankruptcy, the FTD said. VTB now has almost three times as
many customers and deposits in Germany as Kaupthing did,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
