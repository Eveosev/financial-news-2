Citigroup Inc.’s (C)  head of equities in
 South Africa , Quintus Kilbourn, and its director of sales
trading, Matthias Jost, have quit, according to country manager
Donna Oosthuyse.  Citigroup will announce successors shortly, Oosthuyse said
in an e-mailed response to questions today. “We are in the
fortunate position to have a strong team with a deep bench and
our talent is widely respected by other participants in the
market,” she said.  Citigroup is South Africa’s sixth-largest bank by assets
and has almost 400 staff in the country with offices in
Johannesburg, Durban and  Cape Town . Oosthuyse has been a part of
the South African operations since 1995 and was named head of
the lender’s local unit last year.  Kilbourn, whose mobile number did not ring, has been with
Citigroup for eight years and previously worked for HSBC
Holdings Ltd. and Barnard Jacobs Mellet Holdings Ltd. Jost
