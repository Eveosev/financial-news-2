Shipments from Richards Bay Coal
Terminal, Africa’s largest export facility for the fuel, rose
7.7 percent to 5.17 million metric tons in April from a year
earlier.  RBCT, whose owners include  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , received 5.97 million tons of coal in the month,
and had stocks of 3.6 million tons, according to a statement
published on its website today. It has capacity to export 91
million tons a year.  Transnet SOC Ltd. plans to shut the Richards Bay coal
railway line for maintenance May 15 to May 24 to improve
operational efficiency, it said Apr. 16.  Deliveries from the port on  South Africa ’s north-east coast
fell 17 percent compared with March as increased shipments from
the U.S. depressed demand from  Europe  and  Asia .  “There is an oversupply of coal in Europe,  China  and
India,” Xavier Prevost, analyst at XMP Consulting, said by
mobile phone. “The U.S. market is very depressed, and shale gas
is taking an increasing market share from coal. As a result,
U.S. coal is going to  India , China and Europe.”  Prices for coal traded through RBCT declined slightly to an
average $101.83 a ton in April from $103.53 a month earlier,
according to Hampshire-based IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg. It
has dropped 17 percent from $123.32 a ton in April last year.  “I think South African producers have been waiting, hoping
the price will recover,” Prevost said. The latest available
data show Richards Bay prices of $99.48 a ton for the last week
of April, according to IHS McCloskey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
