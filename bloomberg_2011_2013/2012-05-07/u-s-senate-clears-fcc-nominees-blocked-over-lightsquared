The  U.S. Senate  approved two Federal
Communications Commission nominees who were held up by a
Republican lawmaker challenging the agency’s handling of  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared wireless venture.  Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, and Ajit Pai, a
Republican, will bring the commission to its full membership of
five for the first time since a Republican commissioner left in
June to join  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and a Democrat retired. The nominees
cleared the Senate by unanimous consent.  The Senate Commerce Committee approved Rosenworcel and Pai
in December to join the independent agency led by Chairman
 Julius Genachowski , a Democrat.  Senator  Charles Grassley  had prevented a vote by the full
Senate because he said the FCC didn’t answer questions about
whether it gave favorable treatment to LightSquared. The Reston,
Virginia-based company sought FCC approval for its planned
nationwide wireless network that critics said would interfere
with satellite-based navigation gear. Grassley said on April 27
he would lift his hold because the FCC had begun producing
documents.  Pai, 39, a partner at Jenner & Block, joined the  law firm 
last year after leaving the general counsel’s office at the FCC,
where he had worked since 2007, according to a Senate staff
memo.  Rosenworcel, 40, is senior communications counsel to the
Commerce Committee, where she has worked since 2007, according
to the memo. She worked at the FCC from 1999 to 2007, including
as a legal adviser to Democratic Commissioner Michael Copps,
whom she will replace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
