Indian  government bonds  rallied,
pushing the 12-year yield to the lowest level in more than week,
as falling oil prices eased concern inflation will accelerate.  Crude traded in  New York  declined for a fourth day to
$97.06 a barrel after European election results stoked
speculation austerity efforts will be derailed and weaker-than-
expected U.S. jobs data underscored concern the recovery in the
world’s largest economy may be losing momentum. Oil is now 8.6
percent cheaper than it was on May 1.  India  imports more than
three-quarters of its fuel requirements.  “The oil-price decline is significant and therefore has
had a bearing on bond yields,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a
fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Yields may extend their slide this week.”  The yield on the 9.15 percent note due November 2024
declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.64
percent as of 9:42 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since April 25.
It may reach 8.62 percent this week, Dash forecast.  Wholesale prices  rose  6.89 percent in March from a year
earlier, the same as in January which was the least since
November 2009.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell four basis point to 8.03 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
