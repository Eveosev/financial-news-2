Almost half of graduates working in
financial services are looking for new opportunities as firms
struggle to retain their younger employees, according to a
survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  The study found 48 percent of employees in financial
services born since about 1980 are actively looking for new jobs
and 42 percent are open to offers, the accounting firm said in
an e-mailed statement today. About 21 percent said they would
prefer not to work in the industry as its reputation suffered
during the financial crisis, PricewaterhouseCoopers said.  “Financial-services companies might have a tougher time
competing against other industries for the reputation-conscious
millennial generation, whose experience and expectations have
been marred by the financial crisis,” said Jon Terry, a partner
at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “This generation of graduates
actively seek out employers whose values reflect their own, so
the sector’s ability to restore trust and re-engage with society
will be critical in attracting the best talent from current and
future graduates.”  In the U.K., Prime Minister  David Cameron  in January urged
banks to show “proper regard” in limiting bonuses and
demonstrate how pay is related to performance as the government
executes the tightest fiscal squeeze since World War II. Banks
have tried to assuage public anger following the financial
crisis by limiting cash bonuses and cutting salaries.  The accounting firm’s survey analyzed 221 graduates working
in financial services across 75 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
