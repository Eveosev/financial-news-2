Buoyed by seven Tony Award nominations
and tickets as high as $425, the Broadway revival of “Death of
a Salesman” starring Philip Seymour Hoffman grossed $944,000
last week, up 5 percent from a week earlier and up 50 percent
from the take of eight weeks earlier.  Ticket sales jumped 16 percent for “Once,” the musical
with 11 Tony Award nominations, to $707,000. “Newsies” and
“Nice Work If You Can Get It,” which are also competing for
the best musical Tony, had box-office bounces as well.  Tony Awards nominations were announced on May 1. The
winners will be named on June 10 in a ceremony to be broadcast
by CBS-TV.  Rewards weren’t bestowed on all the nominees for the
“best” awards for musical and play.  “Leap of Faith,” the adaptation of the 1992 Steve Martin
film that was nominated for a single Tony following mostly
negative reviews, saw grosses slip 24 percent, to $171,381.
Running costs for a Broadway musical typically top $500,000 a
week, suggesting pressure on its producers (three dozen are
listed) to close the $15 million show.  Sales for “ Peter and the Starcatcher ,” a Peter Pan
prequel competing for the best-play award, fell 5 percent to
$286,000. Two of its competitors for best drama, “ Other Desert
Cities ” and “Venus in Fur,” also dipped. “Clybourne Park,”
the fourth nominated new play, had a 7 percent increase, to
$410,000.  To contact the writer of this column:
