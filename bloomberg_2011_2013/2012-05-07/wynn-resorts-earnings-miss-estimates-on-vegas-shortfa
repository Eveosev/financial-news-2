Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , the casino company
founded by billionaire  Steve Wynn , reported first-quarter
earnings fell 19 percent, missing analysts projections on lower
winnings in Las Vegas.  Net income fell to $140.6 million, or $1.23 a share, from
$173.8 million, or $1.39, a year ago, Las Vegas-based Wynn said
today in a  statement . Excluding items, profit of $1.33 a share
missed the $1.41 average of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue declined 8.1 percent in Las Vegas to $362.8
million. Casino revenue dropped 19 percent, the company said.
Wynn does more of its business in  Macau , where sales rose
9.8 percent to $951 million, according to the statement. Wynn
recently gained government approval for a new resort there.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization would have been as much as $18 million higher in
Macau had the company experienced a normal win rate in its
casino, Wynn, the company’s chief executive, said on a
conference call today. Last year’s winning percentage in  Las
Vegas  was the highest he’d ever seen.  “The comparative metrics look strange,” he said.  Industry gambling revenue in Macau rose 26 percent to 99.3
billion patacas ($12.4 billion) in the fourth months through
April, according to the Gaming Inspection and Coordination
Bureau Macau.  Quarterly Revenue  Wynn’s revenue for the quarter rose 4.2 percent to $1.31
billion, missing analysts’ projections of $1.34 billion. Revenue
totaled $1.26 billion in last year’s first quarter.  In February, Wynn redeemed a  20 percent  stake in the
company at an almost $800 million discount from Japanese
billionaire Kazuo Okada after the board declared him unsuitable
to remain an investor. Okada denied the charges and sued the
company for breach of contract.  Wynn called the Okada suit “mostly foolish” and said he
will fight in court “with great gusto.” In response to a
question, Wynn said settling would be up to Okada.  “It is a very serious question for him,” Wynn said.  This quarter, Wynn Resorts will release designs and a cost
estimate for its new casino in Macau, which will take more than
three years to build, the CEO said.  The company had “some big days,” including a one-day
gross of $30 million in the wake of the April 11 opening of  Las
Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s Sands Cotai Central resort as customers came
to town to see the new property, Wynn said.  Wynn fell as much as 3.2 percent to $121.16 in extended
trading after results were announced. The stock lost 1.7 percent
to $125.19 at the close in  New York  and has gained 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
