Belarus’s international reserves
dropped in April for the first time in six months as the former
Soviet republic tapped the stockpile to service its liabilities
denominated in foreign currency.  The gold and foreign-currency holdings  shrank  1.6 percent
to $7.96 billion last month, the central bank in the capital,
Minsk, said in a statement published on its website today,
citing calculations under International Monetary Fund standards.  “The decline in gold and currency reserves was influenced
by the government and the Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus
covering its external and internal liabilities in foreign
currency,” the regulator said in the statement.  Belarus wants to maintain the reserves at between $6.1
billion and $7 billion by the beginning of 2013, according to
monetary policy  guidelines  approved by President Aleksandr Lukashenko and published on the central bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
