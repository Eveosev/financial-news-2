JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  lost a motion to
dismiss a suit filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. accusing Bear
Stearns & Co. of making false and misleading statements
connected with a mortgage-backed securities transaction.  The bond insurer sued JPMorgan Securities LLC, formerly
Bear Stearns, in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan in
June 2011 over the transaction, known as GreenPoint Mortgage
Funding Trust 2007-HE1.  JPMorgan moved to dismiss the complaint, saying that
Syncora already tried to litigate the claims in federal court in
Manhattan. Justice Charles E. Ramos denied the motion, saying
the state law claims being asserted in the suit aren’t within
the jurisdiction of the federal court.  “Syncora, in this case, deserves its day in court against
JPMorgan,” Ramos wrote in a ruling dated May 4.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokewoman for JPMorgan, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. JPMorgan Securities
LLC, 651566/2011,  New York  state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
