Hess Corp. (HES) ’s Port Reading oil refinery
in New Jersey had a minor compressor issue that caused flaring,
the company said.  The issue affected the fluid catalytic cracker, which
produces gasoline, the  New York  City-based company said in an e-
mailed statement. It didn’t disrupt the unit’s output.  The refinery flared “black smoke” for about 10 minutes,
reports filed with the state Department of Environmental
Protection show.  The department began receiving reports of smoke coming from
the 70,000-barrel-a-day refinery at 9:24 a.m. local time today,
according to reports posted on the agency’s  website .  Hess reported a “10-minute flare-up” at the plant at
about 9:30 a.m. local time, Bob Considine, a spokesman for the
state environmental department in Trenton, New Jersey, said in a
telephone interview. Considine said the company didn’t provide
the cause of the flaring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
