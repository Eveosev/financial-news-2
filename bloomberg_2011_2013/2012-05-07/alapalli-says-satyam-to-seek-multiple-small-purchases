Hari Thalapalli, chief marketing
officer at  Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (SCS) , comments on the
company’s acquisition plans. Thalapalli spoke in an interview in
the southern city of Hyderabad.  “The idea is to look for specific companies, which can
help us build our capabilities in some areas. You saw us acquire
vCustomer in retail. Similarly, we are looking at reinforcing
our engineering services capabilities in aerospace. We are
looking at some target companies there. We are looking at health
care as an area where we want to look at potential acquisitions.  ‘‘We probably are not looking for a large bulk-up deal.
Multiple, smaller acquisitions are definitely something that we
would aim to do.  ‘‘We are one of the better companies in terms of cash
reserves. We intend to leverage that to be able to grow faster.  ‘‘vCustomer was a $27 million acquisition. I don’t think
that our acquisitions will be dramatically bigger than that.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
