New York Knicks point guard  Baron Davis  will miss next season after suffering torn knee ligaments
that require surgery and about 12 months of recovery time.  Davis was injured two days ago, when his knee buckled as he
planted his foot while driving to the basket on a fast break
during the third quarter of the Knicks’ 89-87 playoff win over
the  Miami Heat . He suffered a partial tear of the patella tendon
and complete tears of his anterior cruciate and medial
collateral knee ligaments, the Knicks said.  Davis, 33, will have surgery this week and the expected
rehabilitation means he’ll miss the 2012-13 National Basketball
Association season. Davis was limited to 29 of the Knicks’ 66
games this season, as he signed in December and was out until
Feb. 20 because of a herniated disk in his back.  Davis is the third Knicks guard lost to knee injuries.
Jeremy Lin remains out after having surgery in March to repair a
small meniscus tear in his left knee, while rookie Iman Shumpert
suffered a torn left ACL in the playoff opener.  The Knicks trail the Heat three-games-to-one in the best-
of-seven first-round playoff series, with Game 5 scheduled for
tomorrow in Miami.  Mike Bibby  will probably start at point guard and third-
year player Toney Douglas, who has been used sparingly since
coach  Mike Woodson  took over the team in mid-March, also could
see playing time. Woodson said he’s not counting on Lin being
ready to play in Game 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
