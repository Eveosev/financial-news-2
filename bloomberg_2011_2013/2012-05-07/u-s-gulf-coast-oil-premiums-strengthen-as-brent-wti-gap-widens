U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
strengthened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent widened.  Brent crude’s premium to WTI, based on June futures prices,
widened 57 cents to $15.26 a barrel over WTI at 2 p.m. in New
York. When Brent rises versus WTI, it typically strengthens the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Gulf Coast oils also strengthened after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
started a portion of its 22-inch North Line in  Louisiana  that
helps supply Louisiana refineries. The line was shut April 28
after about 1,900 barrels of oil were spilled.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI added 10 cents to
$16.60 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased
$1.20 to $17.50 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI widened $1.05 to $11.35 a
barrel. Poseidon’s premium added $1.25 to $11, while Southern
Green Canyon’s increased $1 to $10.25.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased $1 against
WTI to a premium of $15.25.  Bakken oil weakened $1.50 to a $1 discount to WTI.
Syncrude’s premium to WTI widened 20 cents to $2.20 a barrel.
Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed 15 cents to $14.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
