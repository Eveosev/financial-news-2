Beef Products Inc., the maker of a
meat product dubbed “pink slime” by food activists, is
shutting three U.S. plants and cutting 650 jobs.  The plants in Amarillo,  Texas ;  Garden City , Kansas; and
Waterloo, Iowa, were temporarily shuttered as the company
“attempted to rebuild markets following the unfounded and
misguided attacks” on the ammonia-treated beef, Rich Jochum, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. “While
we had hoped to be able to resume operations at those plants,
that is not going to be possible.”  The jobs will be eliminated effective May 25, Jochum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
