Oil options volatility jumped to the
highest level in three weeks as underlying futures fell on
concern that the outcome of elections in  France  and  Greece  will
slow that region’s recovery.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.7 percent at 3:24 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 26.9 on May 4. Volatility was at a
12-month low of 20.7 percent on April 27.  “There’s fears about  Europe , that all the problems they
had agreements to resolve are gone after the elections,” said
 Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Futures fell as  Francois Hollande  was elected president of
France, promising to push for less austerity and more growth. In
Greece, voters flocked to anti-bailout parties.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 55 cents to settle at
