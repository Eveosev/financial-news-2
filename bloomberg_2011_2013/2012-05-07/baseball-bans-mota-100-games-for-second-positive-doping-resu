San Francisco Giants relief pitcher
Guillermo Mota will file an appeal after receiving a 100-game
suspension from  Major League Baseball  for a second violation of
the sport’s drug policy.  Mota, 38, tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned
performance-enhancing substance, the office of baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday in an e-mailed release.  “A 100-game suspension for taking a children’s cough
medicine that contains trace amounts of a prohibited substance,
which is what happened here, is severe and unfair and does not
reflect the intention of the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment
Program,” Mota’s agent, Adam Katz, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We will appeal it.”  The Giants said in a statement that they were
“disappointed” to learn of Mota’s suspension and support
baseball’s drug prevention and treatment program.  Mota, who received a 50-game suspension for drug use
following the 2006 season, has an 0-1 record with a 5.06 earned
run average in nine relief appearances this season. He’s allowed
13 hits and six earned runs in 10 2/3 innings.  Mota is 39-45 with a career 3.92 ERA in 14 seasons with the
Montreal Expos,  Los Angeles Dodgers ,  Florida Marlins ,  Cleveland
Indians ,  New York  Mets, Milwaukee Brewers and Giants.  Clenbuterol is a decongestant intended for use by people
with breathing disorders. It has been linked to several high-
profile doping cases in sports and was the drug that got cyclist
Alberto Contador stripped of his victory in the 2010 Tour de
France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
