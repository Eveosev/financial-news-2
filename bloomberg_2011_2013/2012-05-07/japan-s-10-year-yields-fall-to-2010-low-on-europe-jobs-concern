Japanese  government bonds  advanced,
sending 10-year yields to a 19-month low, amid concerns that
 Europe ’s debt crisis and dwindling U.S. jobs growth will weigh
on global growth, supporting demand for refuge assets.  Socialist candidate Francois Holland defeated French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and Greek voters flocked to anti-
bailout parties, stoking concern European governments will drop
deficit-cutting plans. Yields on Japan’s 5-, 20- and 30-year
securities fell to levels unseen since October 2010 as domestic
markets reopened after two holidays and responded to worse-than-
forecast U.S. jobs data from last week.  “The jobs numbers out of U.S. announced during the long
holiday in Japan were weak, confirming a slowdown,” said
Tadashi Matsukawa, who oversees 130 billion yen ($1.63 billion)
as head of fixed-income securities at Tokyo-based PineBridge
Investments  Japan  Co. “Investors who cut some of their
positions in Japanese government bonds before the holiday may be
buying them back.”  Japan’s 10-year yields dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.855 percent at 5:54 p.m. in  Tokyo , the
sharpest decline since Jan. 26. Yields on 20-year bonds fell
three basis points to 1.645 percent, and the 30-year rate
declined four basis points to 1.82 percent.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery closed 0.3 higher
at 143.28 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average tumbled 2.8 percent. Japan’s markets were closed on
April 30 and May 3-4 for holidays known as Golden Week.  Hollande got about 52 percent of the vote in the French
presidential election against about 48 percent for incumbent
Sarkozy, according to estimates by four pollsters. In  Greece ,
Socialist Pasok, which partnered with  New Democracy  in securing
a second rescue package for the country, were two seats short of
the 151 seats needed to win a majority.  Global shares sold off on May 4 when U.S. data showed
employers added 115,000 jobs in April, compared to an 160,000
increase projected by a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
