The yield on  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) ’
benchmark 2015 note fell the most in three weeks as investors
scaled back bets on the risk of a default in the world’s largest
wind turbine maker.  The yield on Vestas’ 600 million-euro ($785 million) bond
maturing in 2015 fell as much as 87 basis points, or 0.87
percentage point, to 12.46 percent, the biggest decline in three
weeks, according to Composite Bloomberg Bond  Trader prices. The
company’s stock fell as much as 5.6 percent, making it today’s
biggest loser in the Copenhagen 20 Index.  Vestas’ bonds have the potential to return investors about
14 percent over one year thanks to an estimated 1 billion euros
in unused credit facilities, according Janne Vincent Kjaer, an
analyst at  Jyske Bank A/S. (JYSK)  The shares, which had lost 28 percent
this year before today, are unlikely to yield any returns as
Vestas fights to keep down costs for developing its new V112
turbine, she said. Kjaer recommends investors reduce their share
holdings and buy the bonds.  “We think that as a bond investor you’ll get a good return
compared with the credit risk,” Kjaer said in an interview.  The Aarhus-based turbine maker is struggling to make money
as competition from Chinese manufacturers intensifies. Vestas’
bonds, which don’t have a  credit rating , are trading as though
they were graded worse than B-, according to Kjaer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
