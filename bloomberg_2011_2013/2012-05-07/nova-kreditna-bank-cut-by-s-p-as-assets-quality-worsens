Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d.,
Slovenia’s second-biggest lender by assets, had its rating cut
by one level at  Standard & Poor’s  because of a deteriorating
asset quality.  The ratings service lowered the unsolicited public
information rating of the Maribor-based bank to BBpi from BBBpi,
S&P said in a statement today. The banks’s 2011 larger than
previously estimated loss also contributed to the cut, analysts
including Pierre Gauter said in the statement.  “We anticipate that Nova Kreditna non-performing loans
will continue to rise in 2012,” as the number of corporate
bankruptcies rises weakening the bank’s credit quality, the
statement said.  Slovenia’s second-biggest bank after Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. reported a 81 million-euro ($106 million) loss last month,
revising an earlier figure of 53.8 million euros reported on
March 1 on increased bad loan reserves. The lender, which last
month confirmed Ales Hauc as the new chief executive officer,
may suffer further losses as the export-driven economy slides
into its second recession in three years.  Nova Kreditna is likely to report another loss for this
year, “though smaller than the one in 2011,” S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
