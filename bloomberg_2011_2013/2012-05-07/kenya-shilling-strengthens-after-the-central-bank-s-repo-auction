Kenya ’s shilling gained, reversing an
earlier decline, after the central bank’s sale of repurchase
agreements.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
less than 0.1 percent to close at 83.13 per dollar in Nairobi,
after falling 0.2 percent.  Kenya’s central bank offered and accepted bids for 5
billion shillings ($60 million) in its one-week repo auction at
a weighted average rate of 17.363 percent after receiving offers
for 6.1 billion shillings, an official in the bank’s money
market department, who asked not to be identified citing policy,
said in a phone interview today from Nairobi. The bank has
accepted bids for 16 billion shillings since April 27 through
repo auctions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ugandan shilling weakened for the second day,
depreciating 1 percent to close at 2,485 per dollar, the biggest
decline since April 11.  Tanzania’s shilling declined for the first day in three,
retreating 0.4 percent to close at 1,584.50 against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
