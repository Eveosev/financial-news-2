Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose on
speculation the decline in the past eight days was overdone
given higher first-quarter earnings and before  Dubai Financial
Market PJSC (DFM)  reported results.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the Middle East’s biggest discount
airline, gained the most in more than a month after posting a 12
percent profit increase. Dubai Financial Market, the only
publicly traded Gulf Arab stock market, climbed 1.9 percent. The
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.3 percent, the first gain since April
24, to 1,564.15 at the 2 p.m. close. The measure slumped 6.6
percent in the eight days through yesterday. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index (BGCC200)  fell 0.5 percent.  “We had seen some good profit-taking after a strong
rally” even after companies including Emaar Properties PJSC
posted improved earnings, said Sebastien Henin, who helps
oversee $100 million at The National Investor in  Abu Dhabi .
“Internationally, the world picture is not improving, the
downtrend may continue even if the outlook for Dubai looks far
better. Dubai may follow the international path.”  Dubai’s stock index has returned 16 percent so far this
year, the best performer in the Persian Gulf, as companies
including  Emaar (EMAAR)  posted quarterly profit that beat estimates.

600 Index. (SXXP)  The  volumes of shares  traded in Dubai was 185 million
compared with this year’s peak of 835 million shares.  Europe Risk  Air Arabia rose 1.9 percent, the most since March 28, to

million) from 42.7 million dirhams a year earlier.  Dubai Financial Market advanced 1.9 percent, the most since
April 24, to 1.09 dirhams. The company, whose shares are up 30
percent in 2012 after a slump of 44 percent last year, is
scheduled to announce quarterly results today.  Elsewhere in the  Persian Gulf , stocks retreated after

will be derailed. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  tumbled 1.3
percent at 1:36 p.m. in  London .  Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  fell 1 percent, Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
