Swiss consumer prices dropped for a
seventh straight month in April as the Swiss franc’s gains
lowered costs of imported goods.  Consumer prices declined 1 percent from a year ago after
falling by the same rate in March, the Federal Statistics Office
in Neuchatel said in an e-mailed  statement  today. In the month,
prices gained 0.1 percent. Costs of imported goods fell 3.6
percent from the previous year.  The franc’s surge to record levels prompted the  Swiss
National Bank (SNBN)  to impose a cap of 1.20 per euro in September to
protect the economy and fight deflation. Swiss central bank
president Thomas Jordan last month said policy makers are
prepared to take “further measures” should the “threat of
deflation require it.”  The year-on-year decline was more than forecast as
economists projected a decrease of 0.9 percent, the median of 14
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Under a European Union harmonized method, Swiss consumer
prices were unchanged from the previous month and dropped 1.1
percent in the year, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
