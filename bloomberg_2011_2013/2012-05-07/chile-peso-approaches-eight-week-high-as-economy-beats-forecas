Chile’s peso gained as economic growth
and the  trade surplus  beat economists’ forecasts and copper
gained, making the nation’s assets more attractive to
international investors.  The peso extended its rally this year to 7.7 percent, the
second-best performance against the dollar after the Colombian
currency among major Latin America counterparts. The gains today
may have been limited as European election results cast doubt on
the global economic recovery.  “The external news wasn’t very good, but the local data
far surpassed expectations,” said Andres de la Cerda, a money
markets trader at Bice Inversiones in Santiago.  Chile’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 482.22 per  U.S.
dollar , from 483.24 on May 4, when it touched 480.12, the
strongest level since March 16. Copper, the nation’s biggest
export, gained 0.3 percent to $3.7325 a pound for July delivery.  The Chilean  economy  expanded 5.2 percent in March from a
year earlier, beating the 4.3 percent median forecast of 16
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Chile had a trade surplus
of $1.05 billion in April, exceeding the $650 million median
projection of 12 analysts.  The dollar rose against the euro for a sixth day as
investors sought refuge after French Socialist Francois Hollande
defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy  to win the country’s presidency and
Greek voters supported anti-bailout parities.  One-year  interest-rate swaps  increased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.17 percent. The two-year rate
rose two basis points to 5.16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
