South Korea  said it will strengthen
inspections aimed at preventing the smuggling from northeast
China of capsules containing powdered flesh of dead infants.  The pills also have potentially lethal substances including
so-called superbacteria and have been sold in South Korea as
supplements that increase stamina or cure diseases, according to
a statement the Korea Customs Service posted on its website. The
notice didn’t say how the capsules’ contents were determined or
whether the infants’ origins were known.  The agency began a crackdown on the pills, allegedly made
of human fetuses and the remains of dead infants, last year
after a documentary aired on  Seoul Broadcasting System. (034120)  The
program, broadcast last year, accused Chinese drugmakers of
collaborating with abortion clinics to make the pills, according
to the SBS website.  South Korean customs has uncovered 35 cases and more than
17,000 capsules since August, according to the Korea Customs
Service statement. The contraband is being smuggled by ethnic
Koreans from northeastern  China  in luggage or through
international mail, the agency said in the statement.  Superbacteria are harmful microbes that resist antibiotics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
