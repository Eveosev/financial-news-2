Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest maker
of hybrid autos, said its electric RAV4 sport-utility vehicle
with batteries and motor from  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  will cost more
than twice as much as the gasoline version.  Toyota will sell the RAV4 EV for $49,800 this year in
 California , and plans to deliver 2,600 units over the next three
years, the company said yesterday at the  Electric Vehicle
Symposium  in Los Angeles. The base price of a 2012 RAV4 with a
2.5-liter gasoline engine is $22,650 on Toyota’s website.  “We think the 2,600 unit figure is reasonable for this
product. We want to set a precedent to see how the market
develops,”  Bob Carter , Toyota’s group vice president of U.S.
sales, said in an interview. “This is going to be the market’s
only electric SUV.”  Toyota, which bought a $50 million  stake  in Palo Alto,
California-based Tesla in 2010, is under pressure to sell the
most rechargeable vehicles in California to meet state pollution
rules. Along with the electric RAV4, Toyota has already begun
selling a plug-in version of its Prius hybrid and also plans to
deliver battery-powered iQ minicars to fleet customers.  From this year through 2014, Toyota,  General Motors Co. (GM) ,
 Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and Chrysler
Group LLC have to deliver about 60,000 plug-in hybrid and all-
electric cars combined to meet California’s zero-emission
vehicle mandate. Toyota must deliver the most rechargeable
vehicles because it has the largest market share in the state.  Recharging Time  The company, based in Toyota City,  Japan , said the RAV4 EV
travels 100 miles (161 kilometers) per charge, and needs six
hours to fully recharge at a 240-volt outlet. Toyota will
warranty the lithium-ion battery pack supplied by Tesla for
eight years or 100,000 miles.  The base price of the vehicle, which will vie with Nissan’s
Leaf and Ford’s electric Focus, doesn’t include a $7,500 federal
tax credit and $2,500 California rebate, said Jana Hartline, a
Toyota spokeswoman.  Both Carter and J.B. Straubel, Tesla’s chief technology
officer, declined to elaborate on the cost of the battery, motor
and other parts for the electric RAV4. The model will be built
at Toyota’s Woodstock, Ontario, plant, with Tesla components
made in California.  Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is in Torrance, California. The
company’s American depositary receipts rose 0.1 percent to
$78.69 at the close in  New York . Tesla gained 2 percent to
$32.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
