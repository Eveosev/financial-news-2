Wheat inventories in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest shipper, will probably hold above average
this year even as handlers seek to maximize exports following a
record harvest.  Reserves may be 8 million tons at Sept. 30, according to
 David Johnson , general manager of risk and pricing at Emerald
Group Australia Pty. That compares with the average of 6.23
million tons over the past decade, according to data from the
 Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and Resource Economics and
Sciences. Holdings were 8.97 million tons last year.  Global wheat inventories may gain to an all-time high of
210 million tons this year, according to the London-based
International Grains Council. Increased supply may help prices
to extend declines for a second year, cutting costs for
importers such as  Indonesia , Australia’s biggest buyer.  “We just physically can’t get it out quick enough,” Alan Winney, chairman of the Melbourne-based grain marketer, said in
an interview on May 4. “There’s going to be a significant
carryover again,” said Winney, who’s got more than 35 years
experience in the industry.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade dropped 18
percent in 2011 and lost a further 7.2 percent this year to
yesterday. The July-delivery contract traded at $6.0575 a bushel
at 5:21 p.m. in  Singapore  on May 7.  The stockpiles estimate from Emerald is lower than rival
forecasts, with Rabobank International predicting on April 10
holdings of 9.5 million tons and  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
looking for about 10 million tons. Stockpiles may total 10.5
million tons, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said
March 14. The record figure is 9.98 million tons in 2005-2006.  Harvest Outlook  Output from the Australian wheat crop now being sown may be
24.5 million tons, with shipments in the year starting Oct. 1
set to be 18 million to 19 million tons, Johnson said.  Abares in March forecast a harvest of 25.7 million tons, 13
percent below last year’s record 29.5 million tons as the crop
area was seen declining. Exports in the year from July 1 may
total 21 million tons, from the record 21.2 million tons a year
earlier, according to the Canberra-based state forecaster.  Australia shipped 2.4 million tons in February, the third
month exports were above 2 million tons, and 32 percent more
than a year earlier, the  Australian Bureau of Statistics  said on
April 4. Stockpiles were 21.3 million tons at March 31, 13
percent more than a year ago, it said April 24.  ‘Already Half Full’  “ Port  capacity is over 2 million tons a month but you
can’t run it at that,” said Winney. “Some storage sites have
gone into the most recent harvest already half full from the
year before.”  Emerald bought the Australian Bulk Alliance network from
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  for A$120 million ($122 million) last year, to
compete with Cargill Inc. and  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , eastern
Australia’s largest handler, in offering receival and port
services. Emerald is 50 percent owned by Sumitomo.  Consecutive La Nina events that brought heavy rains to
eastern Australia spurred last season’s record harvest, while
wet weather this year has boosted soil moisture for crops
currently being sown. Australia was drought-free for the first
time in more than a decade, the government said April 27.  “There’s enough moisture around that people will try to
put in a big crop,” said Winney, who previously held positions
at Louis Dreyfus and the Australian Wheat Board. “Acreage will
be there that gives us capacity for a big crop.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
