Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) , the developer of
the $6.2 billion Cobre  Panama  copper mine, plans to sell $1
billion of bonds to help fund the operation instead of selling a
stake in the project.  The senior unsecured notes will mature in 2020, the
Toronto-based company said in a statement dated yesterday. Inmet
owns 80 percent of the mine and the balance is held by Korea
Panama Mining Corp., a venture between LS-Nikko Copper Inc. and
Korea Resources Corp.  Inmet Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk said in March
2011 the company would reduce its equity stake in the project as
it sought financing alternatives. Since then, the risk of
building the mine, which is 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of
Panama City, has decreased and Inmet’s capability to fund it has
increased significantly, the company said in the statement.  “Cobre Panama is a massive project that will take four
years to build and could face capex, regulatory and
environmental challenges over that time,”  Greg Barnes , a
Toronto-based analyst at TD Newcrest, said in a note today.
Barnes cut his recommendation on the shares from buy to hold.  Inmet fell 8 percent to C$46.25 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest decline since March 5. Inmet has  dropped  29 percent
this year.  Korea Panama has committed $1.4 billion to the project and
Inmet will pay the balance, Inmet said. The mine will produce
266,000 tons of copper and 87,000 ounces of gold annually, it
said. Cobre Panama will run for 31 years based on current
reserves and first ore will be processed in the last quarter of
2015 with the first shipment in early 2016.  “We’re not precluding the sale of an additional minority
stake in the project as we believe that project becomes
increasingly more attractive as construction progresses,” Tilk
said today on a conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
