The State Oil Fund of  Azerbaijan , also
known as Sofaz, expects its assets will grow to $176 billion by
2024 from the current $32.4 billion, Respublika  reported 
yesterday, citing Sofaz President Shahmar Movsumov.  Sofaz’s assets accounted for 75 percent of the country’s
strategic monetary reserves of $43.2 billion as of March 31,
Movsumov said, according to the state-run daily newspaper.  Sofaz has received $70.8 billion since it was established
in 1999 to manage state income from oil and gas sales,
Respublika said. Of the total, it has kept $32.4 billion, while
$34.35 billion has been transferred to the state budget, the
newspaper reported.  The fund has also allocated $1.15 billion to build houses
for refugees from the war with neighboring  Armenia  over the
disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Movsumov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
