Serbia ’s central bank sold euros today
to prop up the dinar, which fell 0.3 percent past 112 to the
euro a day after election results showed a narrow victory for
opposition Progressive Party.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 20 million
euros ($26.1 million) to “ensure smooth functioning” of the
market, it said in a statement on its website. The dinar was
trading at 112.0537 to the euro at 4:00 p.m. in Belgrade, its
lowest in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has spent a total 748.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which has fallen
10 percent against the euro compared with the same period last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
