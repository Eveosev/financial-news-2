Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) , Japan’s second-
biggest developer, said full-year profit fell 12 percent because
of declining rental income and a drop in apartment sales. Shares
retreated to a three-month low.  Net income decreased to 56.5 billion yen ($708 million) in
the year ended March 31 from 64.2 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said today. Sales gained 2.5 percent to 1.01
trillion yen from 988.4 billion yen.  The company said it expects profit to drop 12 percent this
business year to 50 billion yen. Sales will decline to 927
billion yen in the current fiscal year, according to the
statement. The operating profit for its office leasing and sales
business is expected to slip 13 percent next year.  Mitsubishi Estate and its competitors are facing record
high vacancy rates in  Tokyo  at a time when the supply of  office
space  is expected to reach a nine-year high. Tokyo’s office
vacancy rate rose to a record high of 9.23 percent in January,
according to Miki Shoji Co. New supply will gain 42 percent this
year, the highest since 2003, according to a  survey  by Mori
Trust Co., a Tokyo-based developer.  Mitsubishi Estate  shares  fell 3 percent to 1,306 yen at the
close in Tokyo, the lowest since Feb. 13.  Operating profit, or sales minus operating costs, rose 3
percent to 146 billion yen in the company’s sales and office
leasing businesses, reflecting the sale of Asakasa Park Building
in central Tokyo, the company said.  Mitsubishi Estate sold the building in November for 60.8
billion yen to  Japan  Real Estate Investment Corp. The sale
helped the owner of about 30 buildings in Tokyo’s most expensive
business district offset declines in leasing revenue because of
falling occupancy rates.  Rental income declined 2.7 percent to 378.8 billion yen for
the year ended March 31 from a year earlier, the company said.
Mitsubishi Estate’s office vacancy rate dropped to 3.6 percent
in March, after rising to 5.1 percent in October, when it
reached the highest in more than seven years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
