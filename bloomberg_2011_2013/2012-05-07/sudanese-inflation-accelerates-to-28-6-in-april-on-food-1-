Sudan â€™s inflation rate increased to
28.6 percent in April from 22.4 percent a month earlier, spurred
by rising food prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.  Prices of food and drinks, the biggest component in the
consumer price index, advanced 5.5 percent from the previous
month, the Khartoum-based agency in an e-mailed statement today.
Sugar, corn and red meat costs recorded increases of 12 percent,
9.1 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, it said.  The highest inflation rate was recorded in the state of
North Darfur, where the figure was 48.3 percent.  Sudan has targeted inflation of below 17 percent this year,
while its  budget deficit  is forecast to narrow to 3 percent of
gross domestic product from about 5 percent in 2011, Finance
Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
