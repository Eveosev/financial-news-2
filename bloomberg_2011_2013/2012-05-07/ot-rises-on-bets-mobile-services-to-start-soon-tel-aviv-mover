Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT)  rose
the most in three weeks on speculation Israel’s second-largest
fixed-line operator will start offering mobile phone services in
the coming weeks.  Shares of Hot, which also provides cable television
services, rallied 3.4 percent, the largest advance since April
17, to 39.69 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Hot acquired MIRS Communications Ltd. last year to compete
in the cellular services market. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is encouraging new players in the mobile
and fixed-line markets while forcing providers to cut fees.
Incumbent cellular companies  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) ,  Partner
Communications Co. (PTNR)  and Pelephone Communications Ltd., a unit of
 Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) , have lowered prices and
subsidized handsets to compete with Hot and other wireless
providers.  “We are getting close to the moment when Hot Mobile will
start,” Tsahi Avraham, an analyst at Clal Finance Brokerage
Ltd. “MIRS has a market share of around four percent. Hot’s
challenge will be to get market share without subsidizing every
new subscriber.”  Motti Scherf, a spokesman for Hot and MIRS, declined to
give a date for the start of the services.  Cellcom, Partner and Bezeq control about 95 percent of the
telecommunications market, according to data from the Ministry
of Communications. Cellcom shares rose 1.2 percent, while
Partner advanced 1.5 percent today. Bezeq dropped 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
