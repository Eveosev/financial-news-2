Democratic Republic  of Congo’s prime
minister, Matata Ponyo, called for better governance to attract
private investment in his first address to lawmakers since
naming a new government on April 28.  “One of the biggest challenges for the government is the
improvement of the business climate,” he said in a speech in
Kinshasa, the capital, today. “The private sector must be the
motor of economic growth.”  Ponyo, who was appointed prime minister on April 18,
pledged to continue the economic policies he pursued as finance
minister since 2010 that have seen the Central African country
achieve annual growth of about 7 percent. The government will
reduce obstacles for private enterprise, including the lowering
of tariffs, he said.  Congo produces about 4 percent of the world’s copper and
around half its cobalt and is currently exploring for oil.
 Transparency International  ranked the country the 168th most
corrupt nation in the world out of 183 countries surveyed in its
2011 annual report.  Ponyo also called for parliament to pass a new law to
regulate the oil industry and revise the country’s mining code
to increase revenue and to standardize fiscal regimes for mining
companies. Any new sales of mining assets should be open to
competitive bidding, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
