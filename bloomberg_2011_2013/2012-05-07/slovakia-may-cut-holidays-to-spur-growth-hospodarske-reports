The Slovak government may eliminate
one of the 15 national holidays to spur economic growth,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing premier  Robert Fico .  Such a move would favor companies, so the government would
introduce the measure in exchange for employersâ€™ consent to a
higher income-tax rate, the newspaper quoted Fico as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
