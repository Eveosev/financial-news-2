Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of the oil it consumes, increased purchases in April to
support refining at Formosa Petrochemical Corp.  Shipments climbed 32 percent from a year earlier to 29.6
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s April oil bill increased 45 percent
to $3.7 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil
refiner, processed 143,000 barrels more crude a day on average
in April than a year earlier as it operated naphtha crackers at
full capacity, the company said in a statement on May 3. The
facilities process naphtha, distilled from crude, into
petrochemicals including ethylene for manufacture of plastics
and chemicals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
