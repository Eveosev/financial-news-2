Amwins Group Inc. will hold a lender
meeting tomorrow at 11 a.m. in  New York  to discuss $645 million
in loans the company is seeking to back its buyout by New
Mountain Capital LLC, according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
distributor of insurance products, which will consist of a $295
million first-lien term piece maturing in seven years and a 7.5-
year, $350 million second-lien term portion, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  First-lien lenders are being offered one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents on the dollar, meaning the company would
have to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt
during the first year, said the person.  The company is offering second-lien lenders call protection
of 103 cents during the first year, the person said. The premium
to refinance the debt will drop to 102 cents more than face
value in the second year and 1 cent the following year.  Amwins management and employee shareholders reached an
agreement to partner with New Mountain Capital in a growth-
oriented recapitalization valued at $1.3 billion, according to
an April 17 company statement.  William Nichols , director of business development at
Amwins, didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, while second-lien debt is repaid next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
