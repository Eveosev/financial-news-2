PetroSA expects to earn a profit of
198 million rand ($25 million) in the current financial year,
from an estimated 1.4 billion rand in the previous fiscal year,
 Sake24  reported, citing Chief Financial Officer Nkosemntu Nika.  The South African state-owned oil and gas company plans to
shut various plants for upgrades and maintenance, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Nika. It will also
spend on Project Ikwhezi, its offshore gas exploration project
to find new feedstock for its Mossel Bay plant, and the design
of the planned Mthombo refinery, it said.  Project Ikwhezi is expected to produce its first gas in the
second half of 2013, the newspaper said. PetroSAâ€™s expected
profit of 1.4 billion rand for the 2011-12 year has not yet been
audited, the newspaper reported Nika as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
