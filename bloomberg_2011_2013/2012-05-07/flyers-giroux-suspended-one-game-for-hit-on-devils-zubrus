Philadelphia Flyers forward  Claude Giroux , the leading scorer in this year’s  National Hockey League 
playoffs, was suspended one game for a check to the head of New
Jersey forward Dainius Zubrus in a 4-2 loss to the Devils
yesterday.  The action against Giroux, 24, was announced today by the
NHL’s Department of Player Safety in e-mailed release. The teams
play Game 5 tomorrow in Philadelphia. New Jersey leads the best-
of-seven second-round series 3-1.  Giroux skated in front of Zubrus with six seconds remaining
in the second period and hit the New Jersey player in the jaw
with his shoulder. Zubrus had already played the puck forward
and Giroux was given a two-minute penalty on the play.  An All-Star the past two seasons, Giroux had 28 goals and
65 assists this year, finishing third in the NHL with 93
regular-season points. He has 17 points in the playoffs,
including two goals and an assist against the Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
