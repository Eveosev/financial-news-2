Africa Oil Corp. (AOI)  surged to the highest
point in more than 15 years after the exploration company found
additional oil in  Kenya .  The shares rose 35 percent to C$7.82 at the close in
Toronto, the highest price since Oct. 28, 1996. The Vancouver-
based company said more oil than previously reported was found
at the Ngamia-1 well where it holds a 50 percent working
interest, according to a statement today.  The block is operated by the U.K. explorer  Tullow Oil Plc. (TLW) ,
which holds the remaining 50 percent, according to the
statement. Markets were closed in  London  today for a holiday.  Four additional “good quality, oil-bearing reservoir
zones” have been discovered since an initial announcement on
March 26. The well has been deepened almost 500 meters (1,640
feet) from 1,041 meters, Africa Oil said. The well will now be
drilled deeper to about 2,700 meters, it said.  Africa Oil’s shares have quadrupled in the past 12 months,
valuing the company at C$1.71 billion ($1.72 billion).  Oil and natural-gas explorers have taken notice of  East
Africa , which sits on the Great Rift Valley, spurred by the
discovery of oil in Uganda in 2006, deposits in Tanzania and
Kenya’s recent find. While Tullow plans to start small-scale oil
production this year in Uganda and Tanzania produces gas from
two offshore fields, no commercial discoveries have been made
yet in Kenya.  To contact the reporters on this story:
