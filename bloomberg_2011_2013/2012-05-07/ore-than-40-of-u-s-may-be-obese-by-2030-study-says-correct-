The obesity rate may rise to 42
percent from about a third of the  U.S. population  by 2030, 
according to a report.  Preventing that increase may save about $550 billion in
medical costs over the next 20 years, Eric Finkelstein, the
study author and an associate research professor at  Duke
University , said during a press briefing. The findings,
presented today at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s Weight of the Nation obesity conference, also
suggest the surge in obesity may be slowing.  Two-thirds of U.S. adults are overweight and one-third are
obese, according to the Atlanta-based CDC. The findings predict
that the number of people who are severely obese, or about 100
pounds overweight, will double to 11 percent. Those people are
at the highest risk for health conditions caused by excess
weight, including diabetes and heart disease.  “Obesity rates have been skyrocketing,” Finkelstein said.
“If we can keep obesity rates flat, we save about $550
billion.”  Obesity is defined as having a  body mass index  of more than
30. A 6-foot tall adult man weighing 221 pounds (100 kilograms)
or more is considered obese, as is an adult woman standing 5
feet, 6 inches tall weighing 186 pounds or more, according to
the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  Study Variables  Previous studies had assumed the rate of change would
remain the same over time, with obesity prevalence reaching 51
percent of the population by 2030. This study takes into account
a number of variables including the cost of fuel, alcohol, fast
food, the  unemployment rate  and changes in demographics.  New drugs and technologies, increased access to
recreational facilities and a reduction in  childhood obesity  may
help lower the obesity rate in the total population, the authors
wrote in the study published today in the  American Journal of
Preventive Medicine.   Even a 1 percentage point decrease from the current trend
would lead to 2.9 million fewer obese adults in 2030, about the
same as the  population of Chicago , which was 2.7 million in
2010, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
