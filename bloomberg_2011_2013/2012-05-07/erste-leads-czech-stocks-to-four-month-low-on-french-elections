Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led Czech shares
to the lowest in nearly four months after French Socialist
Francois Hollande was elected president and Greek voters picked
anti-bailout parties, driving investors from riskier assets.  The Austrian lender slid 2.1 percent to 411 koruna by 11:48
a.m. in  Prague , its fourth day of declines. The 14-member PX
equity index, where Erste has a 19 percent weighting, dropped
1.4 percent to 906.2, poised for its lowest close since Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
