Colombia ’s peso bonds gained, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a record low, after a report
showed inflation quickened less than analysts forecast last
month.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.03 percent, according to the central bank. That’s
the lowest level on a closing basis since the bonds were issued
in 2009. The price rose 0.187 centavo to 123.726 centavos per
peso.  Consumer prices rose 0.14 percent in April, the national
statistics agency said in a May 5 report, less than the 0.17
percent median estimate among 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation was 3.43 percent, within the central
bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  “Yields remain on a downward trend following the report,
which for now adds to lower inflationary risks,” said William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage unit in Bogota.  Colombia’s peso rose, erasing earlier losses. 0.2 percent
to 1,755 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,758.70 on May 4. The peso has
rallied 10.5 percent this year, the second-best performance
after the Hungarian forint among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
