Nigeria ’s naira erased declines after
the central bank’s currency auction today.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer was unchanged
at 157.3 per dollar by 4:02 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital. It depreciated as much as 0.9 percent earlier.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $120 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on
offer, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed statement.
Dollars were sold for between 155.71 naira and 155.87 naira
each. The marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, was 155.75, compared with 155.70 at the previous
auction on May 2.  Nigeria depends on crude exports for more than 95 percent
of its foreign income, with the central bank the main supplyier
of foreign-currency to the market through twice-weekly auctions.
Energy companies that pump Nigeria’s oil are the second-biggest
suppliers to the market after the central bank.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened, down 0.13 percent to 1.8650 per
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
