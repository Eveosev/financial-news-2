U.S. soybean stockpiles are poised to
drop to the lowest relative to consumption since at least 1965
after the worst drought in five decades decimated crops across
South America, driving  China  to buy more from Midwest farmers.  Inventories will decline 20 percent to 172 million bushels
(4.68 million metric tons) before next year’s harvest in the
U.S., the largest grower, according to the average of 31 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This year’s 19 percent rally
may extend another 11 percent by the end of June to $16 a
bushel, according to Linn Group, a brokerage and researcher
based in  Chicago . Prices reached a record $16.3675 in 2008.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its forecasts for
the South American crop four times in as many months after
predicting record supplies as recently as December. The
estimates are scheduled to be updated May 10. Imports by China,
where demand doubled since 2004, will advance to a record 55
million tons this year as farmers feed a hog herd expanding 4.4
percent to a record 690 million animals, USDA data show.  “Prices may top the 2008 peak if Chinese demand doesn’t
slow or there are any threats to the U.S. crop this summer,”
said Christopher Narayanan, the head of agricultural commodities
research for  Societe Generale  in  New York . “China’s soybean
imports have grown at a rate of more than 17 percent annually
the last 10 years, and the biggest risk is that demand won’t
slow.”  World Index  Soybeans traded on the Chicago Board of Trade led gains in
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities this
year and reached a 45-month high of $15.125 a bushel on May 2.
Today, July futures fell 1.9 percent to close at $14.3825 at
1:15 p.m. on the CBOT. The GSCI advanced 0.6 percent since Dec.
30, as the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 6.1
percent. Treasuries returned 0.45 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  Production across  Brazil ,  Argentina ,  Paraguay ,  Uruguay  and
 Bolivia  will drop 16 percent this season, the most since a
drought in 2009, according to Newedge USA Clearing, part of the
second-biggest broker on U.S. exchanges. Craig Huss, the chief
risk officer at Decatur, Illinois-based  Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) 
Co., the world’s largest grain processor, told analysts on a
conference call May 1 that fewer South American exports would
make it “difficult to buy beans going forward.”  Before the 2013 harvest, U.S. reserves will be the
equivalent of 2.6 percent of projected consumption of 3.363
billion bushels, said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president
at the Linn Group. The lowest stockpiles-to-use ratio was 4
percent in 1965, the earliest that government data is available,
when production was 77 percent smaller than in 2011.  Smaller Inventory  The USDA probably will forecast on May 10 that global
inventories will drop 23 percent to 52.96 million tons as of
Oct. 1, the biggest pre-harvest slump in 16 years, according to
the average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hedge funds  are making their biggest bet on higher prices
since at least June 2006, according to data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. They held a net-long position of
253,889 contracts as of May 1. Speculators were wagering on a
retreat as recently as December, the data show.  The rally will spur farmers to plant more and importers to
buy less, said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for
AgriVisor LLC, a consultant in Bloomington,  Illinois . Production
probably will rebound 21 percent in the year that starts Sept. 1
to a record 284.4 million tons,  Memphis , Tennessee-based Informa
Economics Inc. said in a report May 4. That would be the largest
output gain in three years.  Financial Incentive  Shortages before the U.S. harvest starts in September mean
futures for July delivery are trading at a premium of $1.41 a
bushel to the March 2013 contract. That compares with 2 cents
three months earlier, exchange data show.  “The market is telling U.S. livestock producers and
Chinese buyers to slow purchases because there is little
incentive to accumulate high-priced inventories,” Durchholz
said. “China already has enough on the books for post-harvest
delivery to get them through two months of consumption. We will
shift from perceived tightness to burdensome supplies very
quickly if Mother Nature cooperates for U.S. growers.”  Chinese farmers aren’t keeping up with demand for soy-based
 animal feed , vegetable oil and biofuel in the world’s most-
populous nation, where the economy expanded 9.2 percent last
year. The harvest was 13.5 million tons last year, down from a
peak of 17.4 million in 2004. Consumption is up 36 percent in
the past three years to an estimated 70.1 million tons, or 28
percent of global use, USDA data show.  The Asian nation bought 921,642 tons of U.S. soybeans in
the four weeks ended April 26, almost three times the amount a
year earlier, the USDA said May 3. About 7.12 million tons have
been booked for shipment in the year that starts Sept. 1, 21
percent more than at this time last year. Today, the USDA
announced that exporters sold 225,000 metric tons to China for
delivery before Aug. 31, 2013.  Global Stockpiles  China has led an expansion of world soybean  consumption 
that was almost four times the pace of population growth in the
past decade, government data show. Global stockpiles will drop
to about 51.4 days of use on Oct. 1, the lowest ratio in 15
years, according to  Bill Gary , the president of Commodity
Information Systems Inc. in Oklahoma City, who has worked in the
grain market for a half century. Supplies may be tightest around
March 2013, before the South American harvests, he said.  U.S. farmers probably will increase production by about 5.2
percent to 3.214 billion bushels this year, according to the
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That may
not be enough to keep up with demand. The ratio of U.S soybean
reserves to demand will fall to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 48
years, predicts Doane Advisory Services Co., a farm and food-
company researcher based in  St. Louis .  Profitable Corn  Corn, the biggest U.S. crop, is still more profitable to
plant than soybeans. Farmers are expected to boost corn planting
to 95.864 million acres this year, the most since 1937, the USDA
said March 30. That may limit gains in soybean planting while
boosting corn output by 7.7 percent to 14.395 billion bushels,
according to the average estimate in the Bloomberg survey.  “We need a big crop in the U.S. to offset losses in  South
America  this year,” said Bill Nelson, a senior economist at
Doane Advisory Services who expects prices to approach $16 no
later than August. “There is just no leeway when there are any
crop problems. The anxiety has never been greater.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
