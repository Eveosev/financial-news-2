Ethanol futures fell for the first
time in three days in  Chicago  on concern that elections in
 Europe  will slow efforts to quell the region’s debt crisis,
tempering energy demand.  Futures followed crude oil and gasoline lower after France
elected Francois Hollande president, the first Socialist in 17
years to control Europe’s second-biggest economy. His platform
includes plans for less austerity and more growth.  “Pretty much, the energy markets as a whole are weak,”
said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “Ethanol kind
of followed suit. The French voted the Socialist in and there’s
kind of doubts in the Euro zone.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery slipped 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.201 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Ethanol
has fallen 1 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol on the West Coast increased
2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.315 a gallon and in  New York 
the biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.245, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.16
a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive gained 1 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $2.225.  Crude for June delivery slid 55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$97.94 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Feb. 6. Prices have fallen 11 percent since
Feb. 24, when they reached the 2012 high of $109.77.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.17 cent to settle at
$2.9741 a gallon on the exchange, the lowest settlement price
since Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
