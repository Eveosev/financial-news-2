The  European Central Bank  said it
didn’t settle any government bond purchases for an eighth
straight week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will take seven-day term
deposits tomorrow to absorb the 214 billion euros ($279 billion)
of liquidity created since the program started in May 2010, a
practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation.  The ECB halted the bond-buying program after its two three-
year loans to banks totaling more than 1 trillion euros helped
debt markets to rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
