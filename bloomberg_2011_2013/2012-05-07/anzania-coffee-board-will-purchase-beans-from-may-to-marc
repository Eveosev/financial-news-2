The Tanzania Coffee Board said its
coffee-buying season will begin this month and continue until
March, according to a statement published today in Dar es
Salaam-based Daily News newspaper.  The board cut its production forecast for the 2011-12
marketing season by 18 percent to 37,000 metric tons after a
drought reduced yields, the board said Jan. 30.  The East African nation grows both the robusta and arabica
varieties of coffee in the western Kagera region, while the
northern Kilimanjaro and southern regions mainly produce
arabica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
