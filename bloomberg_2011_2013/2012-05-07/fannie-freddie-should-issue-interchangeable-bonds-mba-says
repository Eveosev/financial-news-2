Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  should work
toward issuing interchangeable mortgage-backed securities, said
David Stevens, the head of the Mortgage Bankers Association.  Taking the step would increase the liquidity of Freddie Mac
bonds, boosting their prices, and protect securities from both
government-backed companies as volumes decline once interest
rates rise, Stevens said today at a conference in New York
hosted by the group. A common security could also be used as the
mortgage-finance market is reformed, he said.  “It creates an opportunity for transition,” Stevens said.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, has made exploring ways to combine the
firms’ securities among goals for their executives this year.
The companies, which guarantee about $4 trillion of mortgage-
backed notes, were seized by the U.S. in 2008.  “It’s still quite a ways away,” Paul E. Mullings, senior
vice president of single-family sourcing and securitization at
Freddie Mac, said during a speech at the conference. “We at
Freddie Mac still have a lot of questions around the scope and
scale of this initiative. Right now, we’re assessing the pros
and cons of various approaches.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
