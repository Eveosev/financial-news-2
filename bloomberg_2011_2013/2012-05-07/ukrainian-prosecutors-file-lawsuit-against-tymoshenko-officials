The Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s
Office filed a lawsuit in court against officials from the
government of jailed former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko ,
accusing them of embezzling state budget money.  Five Cabinet officials who worked for the Ministry for
Emergency Situations in 2007-2010 were charged with stealing
funds allocated to purchase 27 ambulances, causing a loss of
33.8 million hryvnia ($4.2 million) to the state, the office,
based in the capital, Kiev, said today on its  website . The
officials are under arrest, according to the statement.  Tymoshenko, 51, was sentenced in October to seven years in
prison for abuse of office when signing a 10-year natural-gas
supply and transit agreement with  Russia  in 2009. She says
President  Viktor Yanukovych  engineered the case to prevent her
from participating in parliamentary elections scheduled for
October. The European Union has sought Tymoshenko’s release.  Three members of her Cabinet have been jailed this year.
Tymoshenko began a hunger strike 19 days ago over claims of
abuse in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
