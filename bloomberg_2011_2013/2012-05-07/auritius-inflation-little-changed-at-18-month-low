Mauritius’s annual inflation was little
changed in April at the lowest since October 2010.  The inflation rate fell to 3.84 percent in April from 3.85
percent in March, the Port Louis-based Statistics Mauritius  said 
on its website today. Prices rose 0.2 percent from the previous
month. The average headline inflation rate for the 12 months
through April declined to 5.6 percent from 5.9 percent.  The Bank of Mauritius has cut its key  interest rate  by 0.6
percentage point since the start of December to 4.9 percent as
it seeks to boost economic growth. Mauritius’s $9.8 billion
economy may grow 3.6 percent in 2012, the slowest pace for three
years, according to the official data agency.  “The inflation rate provides leeway to leave the interest
rate on hold,” said Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at city-based
Axys Capital Management Ltd., in a phone interview.  The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 29.20 per dollar as of 10:45
a.m. in  Port Louis  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
