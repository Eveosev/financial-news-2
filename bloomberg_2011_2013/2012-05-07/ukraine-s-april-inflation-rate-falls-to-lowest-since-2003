Ukraine’s  inflation rate  fell in April
for a 10th month to the lowest since January 2003 after a good
harvest of vegetables damped price growth, the state statistics
committee said.  Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier, less
than economists forecasted, compared with 1.9 percent in March,
the committee, based in the capital Kiev, said in a statement
today. The median estimate of nine economists in Bloomberg
survey was 1 percent. On the month, prices were unchanged.  Slowing inflation allowed the central bank to cut its main
 interest rate  on March 22 for the first time in two years to
spur the former Soviet nation’s economy. The rate was lowered
0.25 percentage point to 7.5 percent. Gross domestic product
rose 1.8 percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since
the 2009 recession, data showed on April 28.  “Inflation will speed up from July as the vegetable and
fruit harvest will be smaller this year,” said  Olena Bilan ,
chief economist at Kiev-based Dragon Capital investment bank.
“Higher social payments will also spur domestic demand, pushing
consumer prices up” and helping “the economy to grow.”  President  Viktor Yanukovych  promised to start raising
social spending this month before parliamentary elections
scheduled for October as the government seeks to strengthen
domestic demand to boost the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
