A unit of  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the
second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider, sold $1.9
billion of bonds to refinance debt maturing in 2013 and 2014.  The company, which reported earnings yesterday that missed
analyst estimates, issued $900 million of 4.625 percent, five-
year notes at a spread of 384 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $1 billion of 5.875 percent, 10-year
bonds at 400 basis points via its unit Dish DBS Corp., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The size of the transaction was
increased from an originally planned $1.5 billion.  Deutsche Bank AG managed the sale, while proceeds will be
used to pre-fund $1.5 billion in bonds maturing in 2013 and
2014, according to a person familiar with the offering, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t public.  Dish Network  reported first quarter sales of $3.58 billion,
missing analyst estimates of $3.62 billion, according to
Bloomberg data. The company, based in Englewood,  Colorado , last
issued dollar-denominated bonds in September 2011, when it sold
$2 billion of 6.75 percent, 10-year securities. The notes,
maturing in June 2021, dropped 1.175 cents to 109.125 cents on
the dollar for a yield of 5.46 percent at 5:33 p.m. yesterday in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company’s debt includes $500 million of 7 percent, 7-
year bonds maturing in October 2013 and $1 billion of 6.625
percent 10-year bonds maturing in October 2014, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
