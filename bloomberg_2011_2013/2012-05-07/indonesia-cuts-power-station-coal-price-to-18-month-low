Indonesia, the world’s largest
exporter of power-station coal, cut its  benchmark  price for the
fuel to the lowest level in 18 months.  Coal with a gross heating value of 6,322 kilocalories per
kilogram cost $102.12 a metric ton on a free-on-board basis in
May, down 3.3 percent from $105.61 in April, the Directorate
General of Coal and Minerals at the ministry said today in a
statement on its  website . That is the lowest price since
November 2010, according to the ministry’s data.  Below is a list of price references used to calculate the
cost of coal of similar quality in Indonesia, compiled by the
energy ministry. Grades are in kilocalories a kilogram and
prices are in dollars a ton.  Note: Percentage changes are calculated by Bloomberg News. The
price reference is an average of the  Indonesia  Coal Index,
Platts-1, Newcastle Export Index and the globalCOAL NEWC Index
from the previous month. The average of the price reference for
the last three months is used to set prices for a one-year
contract for the following year. For sales in barges, the
reference price excludes the cost of barging and transshipment
into the vessel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
