Sony Corp. (6758)  dropped to its lowest in 25
years in Tokyo trading on concerns that a weaker euro may damp
the repatriated value of Japanese exporters’ sales in  Europe .  The stock  dropped  as much as 4.4 percent to 1,214 yen and
changed hands at 1,222 yen as of 10:07 a.m. That’s the lowest
level for the stock since April 25, 1987, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average declined 2.6 percent.  Sony led declines of Japanese electronics makers as the
euro fell to a three-month low against the yen after French
Socialist Francois Hollande was elected president and Greek
voters flocked to anti-bailout parties, stoking concern
austerity efforts in Europe may be derailed.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which
generates about 30 percent of its revenue in Europe, fell as
much as 2.9 percent while  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  fell by 3.5 percent.  “The French election is causing concerns that a weaker
euro will bring negative impacts to exporters and uncertainties
over Europe’s economy going forward,” said Keita Wakabayashi,
an analyst at Mito Securities Co. “Sony’s impact from the
euro’s decline is fairly large compared to others.”  Sony, which makes about 21 percent of its annual revenue in
Europe, loses about 6 billion yen of annual operating profit for
every 1 yen decline in the value of the euro, according to Mami Imada, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
