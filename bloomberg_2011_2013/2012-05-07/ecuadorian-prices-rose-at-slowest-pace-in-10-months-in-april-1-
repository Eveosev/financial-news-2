Ecuador ’s consumer-price index rose in
April at the slowest monthly pace since June, easing pressure on
the government to impose more price controls on food and other
staples.  Prices increased 0.16 percent from March and advanced 5.42
percent from a  year  earlier, the National Statistics and Census
Institute said today in a report on its  website . Producer prices
rose 0.31 percent from the previous month and climbed 4.3
percent from April 2011, the report said.  The government, which has said it will intervene in markets
to slow price increases if necessary, doesn’t expect inflation
of more than “one digit” this year, central bank President
Pedro Delgado said April 19. The government already controls the
cost of some types of bread, wholesale rice and bus tickets.  The fastest annual inflation was in the coastal city of
Manta, where prices jumped 7.06 percent in April from a year
earlier, while they rose 4.35 percent in Guayaquil, the nation’s
largest city.  Ecuador last week renewed an emergency decree allowing
authorities to send aid to seven coastal provinces where rains
damaged crops, disrupted supply chains and led to electricity
shortages.  Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the
domestic use of natural gas.  Year-on-year consumer price increases are forecast to
average 5.14 percent this year, compared with 4.47 percent in
2011, according to the  Finance Ministry ’s 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
