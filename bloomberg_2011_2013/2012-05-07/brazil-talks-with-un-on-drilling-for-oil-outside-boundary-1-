Brazil is in talks with the  United
Nations  to get recognition for so-called pre-salt  oil deposits 
that stretch outside the country’s continental shelf.  A “small” portion of the resources, buried under a layer
of salt in the Atlantic Ocean, are located outside the country’s
maritime borders, Marco Antonio Almeida, the Energy Ministry’s
oil and natural gas secretary, said today in  Rio de Janeiro .  “The UN has already approved a large section of the
continental platform for Brazil to include. There are three
areas still under discussion,” Almeida told reporters in Rio de
Janeiro. “These three things need to be resolved for a
definitive solution.”  Brazil has found more oil than any other country over the
past decade with the biggest discoveries located in the pre-salt
area. The country plans to more than double crude output by 2020
as state-controlled  Petroleo Brasleiro (PETR4)  SA and other producers
start pumping oil from miles below the seabed.  The country also has “big” potential for oil discoveries
near the equator in northern Brazil where the government plans
to auction exploration areas. The energy ministry is waiting for
President Dilma Rousseff to authorize the bidding round, known
as Round 11, for the area and it may occur as early as this
year, Almeida said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
