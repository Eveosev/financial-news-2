Fuel-oil shipments to  Singapore 
rebounded from May, with 16 tankers carrying 3.38 million metric
tons scheduled to arrive in Singapore from outside  Asia  in June,
vessel-charter data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The tankers, including 10 very large crude carriers, have
been booked to collect the fuel for ships and power generators
from ports in  Europe  and the Caribbean, according to data from
shipbrokers including Poten & Partners Inc. in  New York . The
cargo volume compares with 2.68 million tons reported for June
arrival as of last week.  Nineteen vessels carrying 2.99 million tons will arrive in
May at Singapore, Asia’s oil-trading hub and the region’s
largest port for fuel-oil cargoes, Asia’s oil-trading hub and
the region’s largest port for  fuel-oil  cargoes. That compares
with 2.9 million booked as of last week, according to the data.  The volumes are below the 3.6 million tons in March and 4
million tons in February, the most since at least July.  The following is a summary of tankers reported as
contracted to carry fuel oil to Singapore. Cargoes are in
thousands of tons. Arrival time is calculated based on
information on the e-ships.net website and assuming a total of
four days for loading and unloading at ports. A VLCC can carry
about 2 million barrels of oil. Charters are subject to
cancelation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
