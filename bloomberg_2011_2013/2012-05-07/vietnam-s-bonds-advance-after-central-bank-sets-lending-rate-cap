Vietnam ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the benchmark five-year yield to the lowest level since
October 2009, after the central bank set a limit on short-term
interest rates for some sectors. The dong was steady.  Short-term dong lending rates will be capped at 3
percentage points above the deposit rate limit, or at 15 percent,
effective tomorrow, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a May 4
statement on its website. The restriction applies to the export,
agriculture and some industrial sectors, as well as small- and
medium-sized businesses. The  overnight interbank deposit rate 
dropped 35 basis points to 3.95 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Bond yields followed declines in market  interest rates ,”
said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh City-based money-market
dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “When
banks have surplus funds and can’t lend out to companies just
yet, they will buy bonds and Treasury bills.”  The  yield  on five-year government notes fell 19 basis
points to 10.05 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 16, 2009,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
Yields have dropped 250 basis points, or 2.5 percentage points,
this year.  Short-term lending rates for agriculture and export sectors
at commercial joint stock banks ranged from 16 percent to 18
percent between April 23 and April 27, according to a statement
today on the central bank’s website.  The dong was little changed at 20,850 per dollar as of 3:35
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
