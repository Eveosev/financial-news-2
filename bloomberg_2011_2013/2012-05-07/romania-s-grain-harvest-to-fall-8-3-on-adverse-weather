Romania â€™s grain harvest will decline
this year by 8.3 percent to 18.8 million metric tons from 20.5
million tons last year after an autumn drought and winter
frosts, Ukrainian agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Still, it will be the third-biggest harvest in Romania
after those of 2002 and 2011, the Kiev, Ukraine-based researcher
said today in e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
