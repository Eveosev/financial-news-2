 Miners will probably boost
exploration spending 5 to 15 percent this year after a record
$18.2 billion was budgeted last year, according to a study by
Metals Economics Group.  The growth will slow from 50 percent last year and 44
percent in 2010 unless equity markets improve over the first
quarter, Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Metals Economics said in an
e-mailed report today. Smaller miners “have had trouble raising
the funds needed to sustain or increase exploration spending in
2012,” it said.  The study includes gold, most industrial metals, platinum,
palladium, diamonds, uranium, silver, rare earths, potash and
phosphate for about 3,500 companies and excludes  iron ore , coal,
aluminum and oil and gas, according to the report. Spending on
iron ore was probably more than $2.5 billion in 2011, it said.  Exploration budgets last year were a record in all regions,
and  Africa  saw the biggest percentage increase with 15 percent
of the world total, it said. Burkina Faso rose from 12th place
in spending in Africa in 2009 to third in 2011 because of more
interest in gold, it said.  Interest in diamonds in Africa was at an all-time low due
to waning diamond spending in Sub-Saharan Africa and bigger
diamond budgets in Russia and  India , the company said.  In  Latin America , industrial metals had the smallest share
of spending in more than a decade while budgets increased for
gold in  Colombia , Guyana, Brazil and Mexico, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
