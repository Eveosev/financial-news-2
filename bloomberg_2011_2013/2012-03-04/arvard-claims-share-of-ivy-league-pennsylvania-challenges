Harvard University defeated Cornell
University 67-63 to earn at least a share of its second Ivy
League Conference title in menâ€™s college basketball.  The Crimson can earn the title outright and a National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament spot if the
University of Pennsylvania loses to  Princeton University  on
March 6. Penn defeated Yale 68-47 tonight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
