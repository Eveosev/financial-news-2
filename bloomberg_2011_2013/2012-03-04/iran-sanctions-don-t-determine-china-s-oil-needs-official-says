Sanctions imposed on Iran won’t
influence  China ’s oil imports from the country, the nation’s
former energy head said.  “China’s crude import costs may be pushed up by tension in
Iran as oil prices could rise on supply concern,”  Zhang Guobao ,
former head of China’s National Energy Administration, said at
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in
Beijing today. Zhang said prices determine how much the country
imports.  China opposes trade restrictions against Iran and said oil
sanctions aren’t “constructive,” the official Xinhua News
Agency cited the foreign ministry as saying on Jan. 26, after
the European Union and the U.S. announced curbs against crude
exports by the Islamic republic. The world’s second-biggest oil
importer is expected to raise crude purchases to a record this
year to bolster emergency stockpiles and to feed additional
refining capacity.  China will bring online two emergency crude oil reserve
sites this year, Zhang said, without elaborating. China finished
the first phase of its emergency stockpile of 103.2 million
barrels of oil in 2009 and the second phase is scheduled to be
completed by early 2013. The country is still in gas supply
talks with  Russia , Zhang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
