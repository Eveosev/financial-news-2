German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
leaders of other European states run by conservative parties are
snubbing French Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande,  Der Spiegel  reported.  Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, Spanish Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti
have agreed not to host Hollande before this year’s French
election, the magazine reported today without saying how it
obtained the information.  The political leaders are angry about Hollande’s announced
plan to renegotiate the European Union’s new budget pact if he
wins the French presidency, according to  Der Spiegel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
