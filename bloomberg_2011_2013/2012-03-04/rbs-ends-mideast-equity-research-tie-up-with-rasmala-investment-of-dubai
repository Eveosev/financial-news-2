Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest state-owned lender, ended an arrangement with
Dubai-based Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd. for equity research on
Middle Eastern companies.  “There is no further requirement for the joint arrangement
with Rasmala” following RBS’s announcement on Jan. 12 to exit
its cash equities business globally, Simon Penney, chief
executive officer for the  Middle East  and  Africa , said in an e-
mail today. The tie-up was meant to support RBS’s cash equities
and equity capital markets business, Penney said.  “RBS is committed to its other businesses in the  United
Arab Emirates ,” including corporate banking and the debt
capital markets, Dubai-based Penney said.  RBS was one of the managers for Abu Dhabi-based Dolphin
Energy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion bond sale in February and the $500
million Islamic bond offering of Dubai’s Emirates Islamic Bank
PJSC in January.  The National newspaper earlier today reported that RBS
ended its research tie-up with Rasmala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
