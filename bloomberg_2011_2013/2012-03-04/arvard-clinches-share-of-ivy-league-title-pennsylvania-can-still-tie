Oliver McNally ’s four free throws in
the final 20 seconds gave  Harvard University  a share of the Ivy
League Conference regular-season title with a 67-63 men’s
college basketball win over  Cornell University .  The Crimson (26-4, 12-2 Ivy) can clinch the title outright
and earn a National Collegiate Athletic Association berth if the
 University of Pennsylvania  loses to  Princeton University  on
March 6. Penn beat Yale University 68-47 last night to remain in
contention for the title.  Should Penn (19-11, 11-2 Ivy) win its remaining game, it
would force a one-game playoff to decide which team receives the
conference’s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. Harvard
hasn’t reached postseason play for 65 years.  At Newman Arena at the Fieldhouse in Ithaca,  New York ,
Harvard, the preseason favorite to win the conference, took a
27-21 halftime lead.  McNally scored 17 points, Brandyn Curry had 12 points, all
3-pointers, and  Kyle Casey  added 11 for the Crimson, who saw a
12-point lead evaporate in the second half.  McNally’s 3-pointer gave Harvard a 54-42 lead with seven
minutes, 23 seconds left in the game before Cornell narrowed the
gap to two points during the next four minutes.  McNally scored the Crimson’s final nine points to keep the
lead.  Chris Wroblewski had 19 points for the Big Red.  At Palestra in Philadelphia, Zach Rosen scored 20 and Rob
Belcore had 11 points for the Quakers who had a 30-22 halftime
advantage over the Bulldogs (19-9, 9-5 Ivy).  The Quakers shot 55 percent from the floor, 41 percent from
outside the 3-point line and 83 percent of their free throws.
The Bulldogs hit 28 percent of their field goal attempts, 8
percent of their 3-point tries and 78 percent of their foul
shots.  Jeremiah Kreisberg and Greg Mangano were high scorers for
Yale with 10 points each.  In other Ivy League games, Columbia defeated Dartmouth 61-
55 and Princeton beat Brown 81-47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
