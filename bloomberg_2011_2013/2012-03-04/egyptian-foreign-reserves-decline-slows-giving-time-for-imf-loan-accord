Egypt ’s foreign-currency reserves
declined in February by the smallest amount in more than a year,
giving the Arab country additional time to secure a $3.2 billion
loan from the  International Monetary Fund .  Net official reserves  fell about $640 million to $15.7
billion, according to central bank data released today. The
average estimate of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for a $1.1 billion decline.  Reserves have fallen for 14 straight months since last
year’s uprising. Economists such as Jean-Michel Saliba of Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch said a slower drop may improve
investors’ confidence as the government seeks external financing
to contain record borrowing costs, which spiraled as foreign
investors fled following the revolt that toppled  Hosni Mubarak .  The pace of decline eased “on the back of a bit of
confidence in the markets this month and optimism over the IMF
deal and political progress,” Liz Martins, Dubai-based senior
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc said by phone. “It’s good news
but it doesn’t change any of our fundamental views that Egypt’s
external position is still under pressure and that the currency
is still under pressure.”  Egypt’s  benchmark stock index  gained about 15 percent in
February. The measure has soared about 47 percent this year,
making it the best-performing among global markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound was unchanged in February. It has
fallen 3.8 percent since the start of last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
