Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, said Arab Light crude sold to  Asia  will
be priced at a premium of $2.80 a barrel to the regional
benchmark for April loading compared with $1.55 for March.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-run company is known, raised the
premiums for other light grades sold to Asia, as well as its
Arab Medium crude, and narrowed the discount for Arab Heavy, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Aramco also raised the differentials for most grades sold
to U.S. customers while cutting the formulas for deliveries to
Northwest Europe, the statement showed. Each of the three
regions is priced against a different benchmark.  The following table gives differentials for the regions
into which Aramco sells in relation to benchmark prices, the
month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as defined by
the  American Petroleum Institute . Differentials are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
