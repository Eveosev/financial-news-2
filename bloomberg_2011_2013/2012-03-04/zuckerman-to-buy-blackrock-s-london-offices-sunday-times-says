Mort Zuckerman, the billionaire
owner of the New York Daily News, has reached an agreement to
buy the London headquarters of fund manager  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  for
285 million pounds ($451.3 million), the Sunday Times said.  The office block known as Drapers Gardens is owned by Evans
Randall Investment Management Ltd., a private equity firm and
investment bank that paid 242.5 million pounds for the property
less than two years ago, the London newspaper said, without
saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
