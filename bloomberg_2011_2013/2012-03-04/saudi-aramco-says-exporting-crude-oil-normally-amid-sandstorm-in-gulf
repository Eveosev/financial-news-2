Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is shipping
crude normally today from terminals in the  Persian Gulf , the
world’s largest oil exporter said, even as sandstorms stop other
kinds of cargo from leaving the nation’s main eastern port.  “There was no interruption to company export operations”
since the bad weather struck on March 1, the state producer,
known as  Saudi Aramco , said today in an e-mailed statement.
Aramco operates six ports and terminals independently of the
government, with two of them -- Ju’aymah and Ras Tanura -- on
the kingdom’s Gulf coast, according to the company’s website.  Operations at King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam were suspended
yesterday, the commercial port’s General Director Naim al-Naim
said, according to the newspaper al-Eqtisadiah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
