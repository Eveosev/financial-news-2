Asian  stocks  fell, paring gains from
last week that saw the benchmark index post its longest weekly
winning streak on record, after  China  said it will target the
slowest economic growth since 2004.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest lender by market value, fell 2.7 percent. ICBC was the
biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, followed by  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, which fell 0.8
percent in Sydney on lower metal prices.  Hiwin Technologies
Corp. (2049) , a ball-bearing maker, declined 6.9 percent in Taipei
after saying its February unconsolidated sales slumped 23
percent from a year earlier.  “Asia is all about moderation now,” said  Andrew Pease ,
Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific
region at Russell Investment Group, which manages about $150
billion. “It’s a much more challenging market to be bullish in.
While the risk of financial Armageddon in  Europe  is gone, Europe
is still going to have a large recession. Europe is China’s
biggest export market. That tempers optimism on how much the
risk rally can continue.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.9 percent to 127.04 as
of 5:58 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has risen for the past 11
weeks, extending its record winning streak on signs the  U.S.
economy  is recovering and China is loosening monetary policy.  Stocks in the benchmark are valued at 14.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1 times for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.8 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 0.9 percent.  China Growth Target  China’s Shanghai Composite Index sank 0.6 percent. The
nation’s government will target economic growth of 7.5 percent
this year, and set an inflation target of 4 percent, unchanged
from last year’s goal, that Premier Wen Jiabao said today at the
annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing.  ICBC fell 2.7 percent to HK$5.47 in  Hong Kong , while  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s No. 2 lender by market
value, slid 2 percent to HK$6.43.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 1.4 percent, led by
banks and developers. The city’s stock exchange reduced its
lunch break from today by 30 minutes to an hour.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the third-largest Asia-based insurer by
market value, was suspended from trading today. American
International Group Inc., a bailed-out insurer, said it’s
selling its shares of AIA to unidentified institutional
investors to repay a U.S. government rescue.  Profits Drop  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2 percent after
government reports showed the nation’s services industry
declined in February to the lowest level in almost a year and
company profits unexpectedly dropped in the three months through
December.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped 1.4 percent. Hiwin
Technologies slumped 6.9 percent to NT$316.5, the second- biggest
drop  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  futures retreated 0.4
percent today. The index fell 0.3 percent in  New York  on March
2, trimming a weekly advance, amid concern a rally that drove
the benchmark gauge to the highest level since 2008 has outpaced
global economic growth prospects.  Measures of material and energy companies had the  biggest
drops  among the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups.
BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$35.39 in Sydney, while Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s the world’s third-biggest mining company,
lost 1.3 percent to A$65.09. Inpex Corp., Japan’s No. 1 energy

industrial commodities including copper and aluminum lost 0.5
percent on March 2, while crude oil for April delivery fell 2
percent to settle at $106.70 a barrel in New York.  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) , a South Korean supplier of batteries for
General Motors Co.’s Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car, slid 4.8
percent to 384,500 won in Seoul. General Motors, missing sales
goals for the Volt, will stop production of the sedan at its
Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant from March 19 until April 23,
Chris Lee, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail March 2.  Among stocks that rose, Fast Retailing Co., an apparel
chain, increased 1.4 percent to 17,080 yen in Tokyo after saying
same-store sales gained 1.2 percent at its Uniqlo Japan stores
