President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is losing
ground against Socialist Francois Hollande in their battle for
the French leadership as candidates from smaller parties
garnered more support, a poll showed.  Sarkozy would get 23 percent of votes and Hollande 30.5
percent in a first round of the election on April 22. The gap
between the two candidates widened to 7.5 percentage points in
the survey conducted on March 2-3 from six points on Feb. 19,
the poll published today by LH2 poll for Yahoo! showed.  Support for anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen rose one
point to 15 percent while centrist  Francois Bayrou  gained two
points to 15 percent.  Under the French system, the top two vote-getters in the
first round face off if nobody wins a majority. Sarkozy is also
increasingly trailing Hollande in the May 6 second round of the
election with support at 42 percent, against 58 percent for his
Socialist rival. That 16-point gap is more than the 10-point
difference measured on Feb. 19.  Lh2 interviewed 971 registered voters by telephone. The
margin of error ranged between plus or minus 2.5 percentage
points and 4 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
