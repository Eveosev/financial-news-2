German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may
be prepared to increase the size of Europe’s permanent rescue
fund, though she faces opposition from her junior coalition
partner, the  Christian Social Union ,  Der Spiegel  reported.  Both Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may be
ready to bow to international pressure to increase the 500
billion-euro ($660 billion) European Stability Mechanism, the
magazine reported today. Schaeuble recommends running the fund
in parallel with its temporary predecessor, the European
Financial Stability Facility, to create a 750 billion-euro fund,
Spiegel reported, without citing anyone.  The proposal is opposed by the CSU, the Bavarian sister
party of Merkel’s  Christian Democrats , because the group views
the 211 billion euros pledged by Germany to the temporary fund
as the upper limit, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
