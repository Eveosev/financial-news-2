Britain’s Financial Services
Authority has ordered Co-Operative Group Ltd. to overhaul its
structure as it prepares to take over  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
Verde branches, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Co-Op may have to provide an additional 3 billion-pounds
($4.8 billion) of capital and add members to the board with FSA-
approved experience to get consent for the 1.5 billion- pound
deal, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
