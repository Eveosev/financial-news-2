The  African Development Bank  will
invest $50 million in the Carlyle Sub Saharan  Africa  Fund, the
Tunisia-based bank said.  The fund is the first investment vehicle that the U.S.-
based  private equity firm  has raised to expand into sub-Saharan
Africa. The fund plans to invest a total of $500 million, with
the potential to double the investment through co-investment
with other Carlyle funds, the bank said in a statement. It said
the equity investment was approved on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
