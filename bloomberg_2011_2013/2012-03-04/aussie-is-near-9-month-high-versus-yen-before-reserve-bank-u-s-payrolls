Australia ’s dollar was within 0.4
percent of a nine-month high against the yen before a central
bank meeting tomorrow where policy makers are expected to keep
the highest interest rates among major developed economies.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose against most of its 16 major
peers before U.S. data this week which economists expect to show
services industries expanded and employers increased payrolls.
Demand for the so-called kiwi was limited amid speculation
recent gains have been excessive.  “There’s a good chance the RBA removes its conditional
easing bias and moves to a neutral bias,” said  Joseph Capurso ,
a currency strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia . “Some of the mining-related data has been very, very
strong and the downside risk to  Europe  has eased considerably as
well. Aussie could get a bit of a kick along.”  Australia’s dollar fetched 87.71 yen as of 10:39 a.m. in
Sydney from 87.80 on March 2, when it touched 88.01, the highest
since May 11. The currency was little changed at $1.0737 from
$1.0733 on March 2. New Zealand’s dollar was at 67.80 yen from
67.83, and bought 83 U.S. cents from 82.91.  RBA Meeting  RBA policy makers will keep the overnight  cash rate target 
at 4.25 percent, according to all 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Traders expect Australia’s central bank to reduce borrowing
costs by 40 basis points within a year, according a Credit
Suisse AG  index  based on swaps. That compares with 104 basis
points in cuts predicted on Feb. 1.  In the U.S., the  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-
manufacturing index probably fell to 56.2 last month from 56.8
in January, the highest since March 2011, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the data today. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Payrolls probably increased by 210,000 last month after
rising 243,000 in January, according to economists in a separate
Bloomberg poll.  The payrolls number is “going to be a solid number,”
CBA’s Capurso said. “That will probably be supportive of the
Aussie.”  The kiwi-dollar’s 14-day relative strength index against
the yen was at 73 on March 2, above the 70 level that some
traders see as a sign that an asset may be about to reverse
direction. The Aussie’s 14-day RSI against the yen was at 78.  The Aussie dollar “remains overvalued on the basis of
fundamental relationships with Australia’s terms of trade and
 interest rates ,”  Mike Jones  a foreign-exchange strategist at
 Bank of New Zealand  in Wellington, wrote in a research note
today. The Aussie’s “close below $1.0710 would pave the way for
a move back to $1.06 and below. We still favor a gradual decline
to $1.01 by year-end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
