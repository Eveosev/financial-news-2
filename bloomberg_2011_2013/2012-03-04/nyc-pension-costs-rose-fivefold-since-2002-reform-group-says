New York City  pension costs have
risen more than fivefold to $8 billion since 2002 and changes to
the system are needed to keep budgets in check, said a
bipartisan coalition for pension reform.  The increase in pension costs has squeezed funding for
other programs,  New York Leaders for Pension Reform  said today
in an e-mailed statement. The coalition supports a plan by New
York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  to lower pension costs in New York
City and state through changes to plans for future employees.  Pensions will account for an estimated 28 percent of all
New York City workforce expenses in fiscal year 2013, said the
group, composed of mayors from  Albany , New York City, Rochester
and other cities, as well as county executives. That’s up from 9
percent in 2002. The group backs a plan for future New York
state and New York City employees that would “reasonably”
raise retirement age and exclude overtime from formulas that use
salary to determine pension payments, it said in the statement.  “The data released today details the extremely, extremely
generous benefits of the pensions the City provides,” New York
City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in the statement. “We will
continue to provide those generous packages to all current
employees, but the stark reality is we simply cannot afford it
for new employees. The reforms we support would save local
governments billions, while still providing outstanding benefit
packages to our future employees.”  Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
