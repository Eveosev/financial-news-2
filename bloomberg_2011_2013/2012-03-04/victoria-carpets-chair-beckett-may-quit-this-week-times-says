Nikki Beckett, chairwoman of
Kidderminster, U.K.-based Victoria Carpets, may resign this week
after calls from the firm’s founding family, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  A group of investors backed by the Anton family has
demanded Beckett and Peter Jensen, a non-executive director,
depart, claiming the company’s 22 million-pound ($35 million)
market value is half that of net assets, the newspaper said.  Lady Katherine Innes Ker, currently a non-executive at Rail
company  Go-Ahead Group Plc (GOG)  and  St Modwen Properties Plc (SMP) , is set
to take over the role, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
