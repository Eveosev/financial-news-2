Alex Webster, a former running back
for the  New York Giants  who took over as head coach, died
yesterday in Port St. Lucie Hospital in  Florida  at the age of 80,
the National Football League team said.  Webster played for the team from 1955-64, including six
championship games. He scored two touchdowns in the Giants’ 47-7
NFL Championship win over the  Chicago Bears  at Yankee Stadium in
1956. He coached the squad from 1969-73.  “Alex was one of the all-time great Giants,” team
President and Chief Executive Officer  John Mara , said in an
e-mail. “He contributed so much to our team as a player,
assistant coach and head coach. He was an even better person. We
shall miss him dearly.”  Webster joined the Giants in 1955 after two seasons with
the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He led
the Giants with 634 rushing yards that season. The following
year, his 694 yards on the ground were second to Hall of Famer
Frank Gifford’s 819 yards.  “He came down from  Canada  when we were in a lot of
trouble,” Gifford said. “He turned everything around for us.
He played on the other side from me. The same things I was doing
at the left halfback, he was doing at the right halfback.”  Ring of Honor  Webster, who was inducted into the Giants’ Ring of Honor on
Dec. 4, is fifth on the Giants’ career rushing list with 4,638
yards, averaging 3.9 yards a carry and running for 39 touchdowns.
He is also 14th in franchise history with 240 receptions for
2,679 yards and 17 touchdowns. With 336 points, Webster is 10th
on the Giants’ career scoring list.  “Some of my greatest memories growing up were my father
taking me and my brother and sister to Giants’ games at Yankee
Stadium,” team Chairman Steve Tisch said. “I knew early in
life what a great Giant Alex Webster is and was and what he
meant to our organization.”  Webster became an assistant coach in 1967 and then followed
head coach Allie Sherman who was fired two years later after a
preseason loss to the  New York Jets . Webster led the Giants to a
9-5 record and resigned following a 2-11-1 season in 1973.
Overall, he earned a 29-40-1 record.  “He inherited a team without much talent,” Gifford said.
“He didn’t have anyone like himself. And he was really too good
of a guy to do it. He was a guy’s guy. He was a hell of an
assistant coach. But to make some of the decisions he had to
make as a head coach would be very tough for Alex.”  Born on April 19, 1931, Webster grew up in Kearny,  New
Jersey . Webster played college football at North Carolina State.
His wife of 58 years, Louise, died in 2009.  “He was a great guy,” Gifford said. “He was easy to get
along with. Alex made you laugh all the time. He was fun and he
had a great sense of humor. He was really a classy guy.”  Funeral arrangements were incomplete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
