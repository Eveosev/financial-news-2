South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  will debate changes to the constitution that
include altering the  Reserve Bank ’s mandate, City Press
reported.  The ANC will distribute documents detailing the proposal
tomorrow to party members for discussion ahead of a policy
conference in June, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said,
citing the documents. The paper didn’t disclose how it obtained
the proposals.  The ANC wants to change the “narrow mandate” of the
Reserve Bank, create a state-owned publishing company and
recruit children for the ANC from birth, the newspaper said. The
current constitution needs to be reviewed because it is an
“impediment to social and economic transformation,” the
newspaper said, citing the document.  The ANC won 65.9 percent of votes in the 2009 election, shy
of a two-thirds majority necessary to make constitutional
changes unilaterally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
