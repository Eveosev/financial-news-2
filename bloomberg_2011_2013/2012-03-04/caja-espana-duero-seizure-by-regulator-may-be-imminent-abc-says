Spain ’s financial authorities may
take over Caja Espana-Caja Duero, a Spanish lender, if Unicaja,
another bank, doesn’t merge with it,  ABC reported .  New rules requiring Caja Espana-Caja Duero to recognize
losses on its real estate holdings have made Unicaja wary about
completing a merger the two agreed to in September, the
newspaper said, citing people close to Unicaja it didn’t
identify. Bank of Spain, the nation’s central bank and financial
watchdog, is demanding to know the status of the planned union,
according to the report.  Telephone calls for comment to media relations officials at
Caja Espana-Caja Duero and Unicaja went unanswered today. A
spokesman for the Bank of Spain, who asked not to be identified
by name in line with the agency’s policy, declined to comment by
phone on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
