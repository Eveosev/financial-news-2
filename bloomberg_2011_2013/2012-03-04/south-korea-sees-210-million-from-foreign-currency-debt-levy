South Korea  estimates $210 million
in yearly receipts from a tax on holdings of foreign-currency
debt introduced by the government to restrain short-term
external borrowing.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  paid $760,000,
the first fee under the so-called “macro-prudential stability
levy,” to the central bank on Feb. 28, the Bank of Korea and
finance ministry said in a joint e-mailed statement today.  South Korea adopted the tax last August on non-deposit
foreign-currency liabilities held by both domestic and foreign
banks, and will use the funds to help ease liquidity crunch at
financial companies in a crisis. Debt of less than one year is
subject to a levy of 0.2 percent and those with longer
maturities subject to lower rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
