Military intervention in  Syria  isn’t
on  France ’s agenda and the country isn’t supplying arms to
rebels, the daily Le Parisien said, citing French Defense
Minister Gerard Longuet.  International political pressure and sanctions need to be
increased in order to try to get President Bashar al-Assad to
step down, the newspaper said, citing Longuet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
