Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR) , the
Bangalore-based carrier struggling with losses and a cash
shortage, asked pilots not to walk off the job and pledged to
pay salaries as soon as possible.  Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Aggarwal met with pilots to
“appeal to them not to stay away from flying duties,” the
airline said in an e-mailed statement today.  Kingfisher is also cooperating with tax authorities to lift
a freeze on its accounts so that it can pay wages, according to
the statement. The tax department froze 40 Kingfisher bank
accounts after it failed to pay 400 million rupees ($8 million)
it owed by a Feb. 29 deadline, the  Press Trust of India  reported
yesterday, citing Service Tax Commissioner S.K. Solanki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
