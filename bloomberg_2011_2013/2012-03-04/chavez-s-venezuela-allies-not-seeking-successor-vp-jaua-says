Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua
says no one among President  Hugo Chavez ’s allies aspires to
succeed him and no divisions exist between military and civilian
factions that support the president.  “None of us aspires to succeed Chavez,” Jaua said in an
interview on the  Televen  network. “Our only commitment is to
accompany him.”  Chavez is recovering in Cuba from an operation to remove a
lesion from the same pelvic area from which doctors removed a
cancerous tumor last year. Chavez, who is seeking re-election in
October after 13 years in power, has declined to say exactly
what kind of cancer he has or allow access to his medical
records.  Chavez isn’t seeking to use his health to delay this year’s
presidential vote, Jaua said.  “With or without cancer, we are going to win the
presidential election,” Jaua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
