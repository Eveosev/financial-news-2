The U.K. government should do more
to rally  consumer confidence , Justin King, chief executive
officer of  J Sainsbury Plc, (SBRY)  the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket
owner, said today on  Sky News .  British shoppers “are not confident in the future,” King
told Sky News’s Murnaghan program. “I don’t think we’ve seen
the government inspiring confidence on the part of the average
consumer on the street that things are going to get better.”  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has said he
won’t borrow money to fund tax cuts or increase spending in his
next budget, which is to be announced March 21. Sainsbury in
January reported third-quarter sales growth that beat analyst
estimates as the grocer sold more luxury food and budget
ingredients to win a battle for Christmas customers.  “We have been doing well for a good period of time.” King
said. “We’ve been keeping our nose ahead of the marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
