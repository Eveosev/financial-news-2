Doncasters Group Ltd., an
engineering company owned by Dubai International Capital LLC,
asked banks to relax the terms of its debt totaling more than
700 million pounds ($1.1 billion), the Independent said.  The Burton-upon-Trent, England-based company asked Oriel
Securities Ltd. to increase the amount of debt it can have for
the next two years, the London newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified individual. Banks led by  Royal Bank of Scotland 
must approve the agreement, the report said. A spokeswoman for
Doncasters didnâ€™t immediately respond to telephone messages and
an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
