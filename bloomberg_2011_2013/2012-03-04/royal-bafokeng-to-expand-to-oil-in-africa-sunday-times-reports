Royal Bafokeng Holdings Ltd., which
manages the holdings of the 300,000-strong Bafokeng community,
may invest in the oil and gas industry in  Africa  as it expands
investments beyond  South Africa , the Sunday Times reported.  Royal Bafokeng will sell some of its smaller holdings and
use the revenue to purchase stakes in projects outside South
Africa, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Chief
Executive Officer Niall Carroll. Assets under management rose to
35 billion rand ($4.7 billion) this year from 8 billion rand in
2006, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
