Albaraka Banking Group BSC (BARKA) , a
Bahraini Islamic lender, is seeking to buy about 75 percent of
an Indonesian bank before the end of this year, Chief Executive
Officer Adnan Yousif said.  Albaraka is in talks with the Chinese shareholders of the
non-Shariah compliant bank and expects to invest as much as $100
million in the deal, Manama-based Yousif said in a phone
interview today. He declined to provide the bank’s name.  “We would like to do it before the end of the year,” he
said. Albaraka will “inject new capital and turn it into an
Islamic bank.”  Albaraka has 400 branches in countries such as  Egypt ,
Turkey, Syria and Tunisia. It plans to raise the branches this
year by 50, including 20 in  Turkey , Yousif said. The bank’s 2011
profit increased 12 percent to $118 million.  Albaraka shares, traded on Bahrain’s stock exchange, fell
2.8 percent this year compared with a 4.3 percent gain for the
 benchmark stock index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
