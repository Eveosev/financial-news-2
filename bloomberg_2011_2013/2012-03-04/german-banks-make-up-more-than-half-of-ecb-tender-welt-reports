More than half of the 800 lenders
that tapped the  European Central Bank ’s Feb. 29 tender of three-
year loans were German, mainly small savings and cooperative
banks,  Die Welt  newspaper reported.  Germany ’s biggest 15 so-called systemically relevant banks
were underrepresented in the tender with fewer than half tapping
the loan and, while numerous, the savings and cooperative banks
borrowed small sums, the newspaper said in a pre-released
report. It didn’t say where it got the information.  In all, German banks borrowed less than 10 percent of the
tender, worth 529.5 billion euros ($699 billion), compared with
26 percent, or 140 billion euros, borrowed by Italian banks, Die
Welt said. German banks make up a quarter of the euro-area’s
total bank balance sheet while Italian banks have a 12 percent
share, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
