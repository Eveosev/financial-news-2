An Egyptian lawmaker called for the
dismissal of a cabinet minister he said was behind the case
against foreign non-governmental organization workers, the
official Middle East News Agency reported today.  Mohamed  Anwar Sadat  said International Cooperation and
Planning Minister Fayza Aboulnaga was the “main reason in this
crisis” MENA reported, citing a statement released by the
lawmaker. The trial sparked the worst rift between  Egypt  and the
U.S. in decades.  Sadat, head of the Human Rights Committee in the lower
house of parliament, called on the prime minister and Field
Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt’s military ruler, to
dismiss Aboulnaga.  Egypt lifted a travel ban against the foreign defendants
last week and 13 of them left the country on March 1. The
defendants included Sam LaHood, son of U.S. Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
