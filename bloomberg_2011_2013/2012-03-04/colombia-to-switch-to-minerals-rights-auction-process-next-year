Colombia, the largest coal supplier
in  South America , will change the way it awards mineral
exploration rights from next year -- forcing prospective
companies to take part in auctions.  The changes will increase the benefits Colombia receives
from mining as it seeks to boost production of minerals
including gold, silver, platinum and copper, Mines and Energy
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said in an interview in Toronto.  “It’s going to be a more competitive process, a selection
based on objective criteria rather than first come, first
served,” Cardenas said yesterday in an interview in Toronto at
the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention.  President Juan Manuel Santos has attracted companies owned
by billionaires  Carlos Slim  and  Eike Batista  to  Colombia  by
cracking down on guerrilla groups and opening new areas to
exploration amid rising global demand for energy and gold.  The selection criteria for the auctions that will begin in
2013 haven’t been fixed yet, Cardenas said, who added that gold
output may increase under the new regime.  “Our early victory, I think, is going to be gold,” he
said. “That’s where we are going to have more reserves and we
are going to have more production soon,” he said.  The government is willing to debate proposed changes to
mineral taxes and royalties but its preference is to maintain
“stability” and he doesn’t anticipate any major changes to
legislation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
