South Africa ’s rand is overvalued
and the central bank needs to weaken the currency, City Press
reported, citing the director general of the nation’s trade
ministry, Lionel October.  Weakening the currency would ensure the rand was “stable
and competitive,” October told the Johannesburg-based
newspaper. The rand has gained 7.6 percent this year against the
dollar, the third-best performer among the 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The currency plunged 18 percent last year,
the worst of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
