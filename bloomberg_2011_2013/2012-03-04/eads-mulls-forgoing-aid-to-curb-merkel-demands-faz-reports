The  European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Co . is considering forgoing development aid for its civil
aircraft programs as a means of curbing German government
influence in its business decisions, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported.  In a letter to incoming EADS Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders , Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government objected to a plan
to make Toulouse,  France , the company’s sole headquarters, the
newspaper said without attribution in a preview of a report to
be published tomorrow. At present, the headquarters role is
shared with a site in Ottobrunn near Munich, FAZ said.  Enders is now examining whether his company has enough cash
to forgo drawing on 500 million euros ($659 million) in aid for
the A350 Airbus SAS aircraft, FAZ said. Merkel’s government
approved 1 billion euros in development aid for the project and
has paid out half, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
