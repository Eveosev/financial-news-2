Scotland  First Minister  Alex Salmond 
said he will start campaigning for Scottish independence after
local elections in May, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  If an independent Scotland uses the British currency it
would need a fiscal stability pact with the U.K., including
limits on borrowing, he said. Salmond’s Scottish National Party
plans to hold a referendum on independence in late 2014,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
