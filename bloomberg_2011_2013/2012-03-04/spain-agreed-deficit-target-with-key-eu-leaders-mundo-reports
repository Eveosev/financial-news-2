Spain  agreed a new, wider budget
deficit target of 5.8 percent of gross domestic product with key
European Union leaders,  El Mundo  reported.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos informed the European Commission and government
officials of the main points of the adjustment, the newspaper
said. Spain had also informed the European Central Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve that it
wouldn’t be able to meet its previous 4.4 percent target for
this year, El Mundo reported.  Spain’s new economic targets are an exercise in realism and
good sense, the newspaper said, citing people in the government
it didn’t identify by name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
