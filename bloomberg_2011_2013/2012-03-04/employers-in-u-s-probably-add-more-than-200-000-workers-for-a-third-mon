Employers probably added more than
200,000 workers for a third straight month in February amid
optimism about the U.S. expansion, economists said before a
report this week.  Payrolls increased by 210,000 last month after rising
243,000 in January, the most in nine months, and 203,000 at the
end of 2011, according to the median projection of 55 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. It would mark the strongest three-
month stretch in almost a year. The jobless rate probably held
at an almost three-year low of 8.3 percent.  Bigger employment and wage gains would go further in
bolstering household spending, which accounts for about 70
percent of the economy and is threatened by higher fuel costs.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that
while the labor market is making progress restoring the 8.7
million jobs lost as a result of the recession, it’s “far from
normal.”  “There is a much more encouraging labor-market backdrop
for the consumer in early 2012,” said Conrad DeQuadros, senior
economist at RDQ Economics LLC in  New York . “But economic
growth is moderate, which leaves the unemployment rate fairly
elevated by year-end, and that’s the Fed’s main focus.”  The Labor Department report is due March 9. Payroll
estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from increases of
130,000 to 275,000. The January gain was the biggest since last
April, when employers hired 251,000 more employees. Employment
in December rose 203,000.  Another report may show the services industry, which makes
up almost 90 percent of the economy, expanded near the fastest
pace in a year.  Private Payrolls  Private payrolls are forecast to expand by 220,000, after a
257,000 gain in January that was also the highest in nine
months, according to the survey median. Factory payrolls are
projected to rise by 20,000 after a 50,000 gain.  Caterpillar Inc., based in Peoria,  Illinois , is building
and expanding factories as demand for trucks and shovels used in
mines rises and old equipment is replaced in the U.S. and
 Europe . The world’s largest maker of construction and mining
equipment said it will build a one-million-square-foot factory
in  Georgia , which will employ 1,400 workers. The plant, which
will make tractors and excavators, will support an additional
2,800 positions in the U.S.  “We are making a series of investments around the world,”
 Doug Oberhelman , chairman and chief executive officer of
Caterpillar, said in a Feb. 17 statement. Oberhelman is shifting
production of the machines to the U.S. from  Japan  to be closer
to customers, the company said in November.  Since August  The labor-market recovery has gained momentum in recent
months. Since August,  unemployment  has dropped 0.8 percentage
point in five months. It was last below 8.3 percent in January
2009, when 7.8 percent of the  labor force  was unemployed.  Dismissals have also waned, a sign companies may be growing
more confident about the economic outlook. Applications for
 unemployment benefits  declined last week to 351,000, matching
the lowest level since March 2008. Five months ago they were
consistently above 420,000, Labor Department data show.  Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-biggest U.S. department-store
chain, may hire about 4,000 new employees this year, matching
the number of additions it made last year.  “Given that our business is growing, we are of course
hiring,”  Jim Sluzewski , a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based
retailer, said in a Feb. 17 e-mail.  Wage Gains  The payroll gains are translating into growing incomes,
laying the groundwork for a pickup in household spending. Wages
and salaries in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 grew a
combined $197.3 billion, the most since the six months ended
March 2007, according to the Commerce Department’s revised
figures released last week. At the least, the wage gains will
help Americans weather gasoline prices that have  increased  46
cents this year through March 1 to $3.74 a gallon, according to
AAA, the nation’s largest motoring organization.  Higher stock prices alongside an improving labor market are
helping push up  consumer confidence . The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has gained almost 9 percent so far this year.  Even with “positive developments” in the job market,
Bernanke told lawmakers last week the “modest and uneven”
expansion needs the support of monetary policy. The central bank
said in January that economic conditions are likely to warrant
low  interest rates  at least through late 2014.  Bernanke on Jobless Rate  “The  unemployment rate  remains elevated, long-term
unemployment is still near record levels and the number of
persons working part time for economic reasons is very high,”
Bernanke said during a Feb. 29 testimony to Congress. Fed policy
makers judge “that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for
monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives”
for stable prices and maximum employment, he said.  The so-called  underemployment  rate, which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and those who
want work but have given up looking, was 15.1 percent in
January.  Also this week, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s gauge
of non-manufacturing companies eased in February to 56.2 from
56.8 the prior month, which was the highest since February 2011,
according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg survey.
Measures greater than 50 signal growth. The Tempe, Arizona-based
group will release the figures tomorrow.
