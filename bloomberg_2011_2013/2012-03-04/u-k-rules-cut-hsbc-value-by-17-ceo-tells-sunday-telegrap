HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Stuart Gulliver  said that the bank is “permanently
undervalued” by as much as $28 billion due to U.K. financial
regulations introduced after the debt crisis, the Sunday
Telegraph said.  The U.K. banking levy and the Treasury’s demand that banks
set aside capital to absorb a loss of as much as 20 percent of
their balance sheets will cost HSBC $700 million and $2.1
billion, respectively, in 2012, the newspaper quoted the CEO as
saying. At a price-earnings ratio of 10, that would shave about
17 percent off the bank’s market capitalization, Gulliver told
the newspaper.  Gulliver has asked the Treasury to make the banking levy a
windfall tax, which would make it tax-deductible and protect
HSBC’s dividend, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
