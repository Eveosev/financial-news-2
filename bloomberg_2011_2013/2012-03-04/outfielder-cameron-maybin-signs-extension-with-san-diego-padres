Outfielder Cameron Maybin signed a
contract with the  San Diego Padres  that carries him through the
2016 season, with a club option for the following year.  The Padres didn’t release terms of the deal. The contract
is worth $25 million over five years, ESPN reported.  “It means a lot that these guys want me to be the face of
the franchise, which I’m ready to be,” Maybin told the sports
network.  Maybin, 24, started 132 games in center field last season
and led the team in runs, triples, stolen bases and multihit
games, earning him the Padres’ 2011 Most Valuable Player
designation.  “Cameron has certainly emerged as a core player,” General
Manager Josh Byrnes said on the team’s website. “He has shown
us that he is committed to the Padres, and we are happy to
secure his rights through 2017.”  Last season, Maybin hit .264 with 24 doubles, eight triples,
nine home runs, 40 runs batted in and 82 runs scored. He also
stole 40 bases in 48 attempts, posting an 83.3 percent success
rate that ranked 12th in the National League.  Maybin, the Detroit Tigers 10th overall pick in the 2005
First-Year Player Draft, made his Major League Baseball debut in
2007. He was traded to the  Miami Marlins  before the 2008 season
before going to the Padres in a trade for righthanded pitchers
Ryan Webb and Edward Mujica on Nov. 13, 2010.  Over his career 305 Major League games, Maybin has a .255
batting average with 48 doubles, 13 triples, 22 home runs, 85
RBIs, 175 runs scored and 59 stolen bases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
