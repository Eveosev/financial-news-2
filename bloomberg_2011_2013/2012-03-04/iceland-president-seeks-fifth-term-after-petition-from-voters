Iceland’s President Olafur R. Grimsson said he will seek a fifth four-year term as head of
state in elections due to take place in June.  Grimsson said he was responding to a petition signed by
more than 30,000 Icelanders urging him to run, according to an
e-mailed statement from the president’s office.  The incumbent president twice blocked a parliamentary
accord that sought to repay British and Dutch depositors
following the failure of Landsbanki Islands hf in 2008.
Icelandic voters subsequently rejected the agreement in a
referendum last year and Iceland has yet to settle the dispute
through an international court case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
