Greek police  arrested 44 people in
connection with ongoing investigations in northern and central
 Greece  into suspected antiquities smuggling, the Athens News
Agency said, citing the police force.  Those arrested had in their procession more than 8,000
ancient gold and silver coins as well as metal detectors and
books that showed the history of the coins and their monetary
value, the state-run agency said.  Officers are now checking the identity, origin and value of
the coins, ANA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
