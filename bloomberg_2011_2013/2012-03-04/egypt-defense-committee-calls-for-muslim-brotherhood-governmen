An Egyptian parliamentary committee
demanded a new coalition government to be headed by the Muslim
Brotherhood’s party, the Middle East News Agency reported.  The Defense and National Security committee said that a
government statement to parliament last month “does not meet
the aspirations of the Egyptian people,” and provided no “real
plan” to restore security and revive the economy, the state-run
agency reported. They urged the withdrawal of confidence from
the government of Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, it said.  The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice party alliance makes
up the largest bloc in parliament.  The lawmakers also criticized  Egypt ’s decision to lift a
travel ban on U.S. and other foreign defendants prosecuted by
the country in relation to foreign funding of non-governmental
organizations, the agency reported.  Parliament will hold a session on March 11 to discuss the
“violations to Egypt’s sovereignty and dignity,” the news
agency cited committee deputy Farid Ismail as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
