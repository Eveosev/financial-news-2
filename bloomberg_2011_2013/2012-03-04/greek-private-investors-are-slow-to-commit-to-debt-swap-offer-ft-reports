Private holders of Greek debt are
being slow to take up the government’s planned debt swap offer,
and even Greek creditors aren’t committing promptly to the deal,
the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation.  The  Institute of International Finance , representing
private bondholders in the negotiations over the debt swap, said
today that it endorsed the final terms of the deal, while
leaving it up to individual investors to decide whether or not
to participate in the deal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
