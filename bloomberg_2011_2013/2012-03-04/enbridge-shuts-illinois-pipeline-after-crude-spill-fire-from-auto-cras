Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said there is no
timetable to restart a pipeline in  Illinois  that was shut down
early yesterday following a fire and crude oil release at a
company facility.  A vehicle collision near New Lenox, Illinois, is being
investigated for damage at a pipeline facility that forced
Enbridge to shut down lines 14/64 and 6A, Enbridge said. The 6A
line has since been restarted, the company said.  The collision is unrelated to Enbridgeâ€™s operations in the
area, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
