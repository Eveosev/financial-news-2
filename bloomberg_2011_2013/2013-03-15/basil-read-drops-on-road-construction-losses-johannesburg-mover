Basil Read Holdings Ltd. (BSR) , a South
African construction company, dropped the most in more than six
months after it said unprofitable road-building projects will
weigh on full-year earnings.  The stock  fell  as much as 9.3 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since Aug. 24, and was 7.2 percent lower at 11
rand by 12:51 p.m. in Johannesburg. About 164,000 shares were
traded, or 1.7 times the daily three-month average.  Earnings excluding one-time items will probably be “185
percent to 195 percent” lower, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement today. Basil Read provided for losses of 210
million rand ($23 million) on two road construction projects.  The company will pay a special dividend of 1.75 rand a
share following the 900 million rand sale of its TWP Holdings
(Pty) Ltd. division to a unit of  Australia ’s  WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR) 
The net receipt of the sale was 877 million rand, Basil Read
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
