Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  informed President Shimon Peres he signed coalition
deals that give him the majority to form a new government, the
president’s office said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We face a decisive year in everything that has to do with
security, the economy and in advancing the  peace process ,”
Netanyahu told Peres, according to the statement. “This
government will work together to deliver in all of these
areas.”  The new government probably will be officially sworn in by
Peres on March 18, Likud party spokeswoman Noga Rappaport said.
Obama is scheduled to begin a three-day visit, his first trip to
Israel as president, on March 20.  The new government, comprised of Likud, Yisrael Beitenu,
Yesh Atid and Hatenuah, will hold 68 seats in  Israel ’s 120-
member parliament, the Knesset. The coalition’s makeup would
enable the incoming government to make the budget cuts necessary
to keep spending in check, after last year’s deficit came in
above target.  Netanyahu called for early elections last year after his
coalition partners refused to approve 14 billion shekels ($3.8
billion) in budget cuts to meet a deficit target of 3 percent of
economic output. The premier’s coalition partners would also
support his previously failed efforts to limit the number of
military draft exemptions given to ultra-Orthodox men so they
can pursue religious study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
