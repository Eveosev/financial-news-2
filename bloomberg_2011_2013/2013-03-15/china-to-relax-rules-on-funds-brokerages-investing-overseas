China plans to make it easier for
fund managers and brokerages to invest in overseas  capital
markets  to help local firms boost international competitiveness.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission is seeking
feedback on revised rules for the Qualified Domestic
Institutional Investor program that has allowed local firms to
invest on foreign markets since 2007, the regulator said in a
statement yesterday.  The rule changes include the removal of financial
restrictions such as a 200 million- yuan  ($32 million) minimum
net capital requirement for fund management companies to take
part in the program, also known as QDII, the CSRC said. A
requirement that brokerages have at least 800 million yuan in
net capital will also be scrapped, it said.  Fund managers and brokerages will only need to meet
requirements in areas such as staffing, corporate governance,
internal controls and operational standards, the regulator said.  The CSRC will relax rules for fund management companiesâ€™
use of their fixed capital, it said in a separate statement
yesterday. The watchdog is seeking feedback on the revision in
the next two weeks, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
