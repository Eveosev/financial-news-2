Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chairman  Eric Schmidt 
is visiting Myanmar this month, part of a push by the provider
of the world’s biggest search engine to promote the use of the
Internet in developing countries.  Schmidt will also be in India for a Web summit in New
Delhi, where he is  scheduled  to speak.  The trip follows a visit in January to North Korea, where
Schmidt called for the totalitarian country to end its ban on
Internet access.  “Eric is visiting several countries in Asia to connect
with local partners and Googlers who are working to improve the
lives of many millions of people across the region by helping
them get online and access the world’s information for the first
time in the next few years,” Taj Meadows, a spokesman for
 Mountain View , California-based Google, wrote in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
