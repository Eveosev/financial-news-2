New York police said they’re
searching for a man who placed a fake explosive device on a
barrier on  Wall Street  this morning, forcing the shutdown of
part of the road.  Police were called to the area of 40 Wall Street at about
9:30 a.m. after a woman saw a man attaching a device to a street
barrier,  Paul Browne , a spokesman for the  New York City Police
Department , said today in a phone interview.  The inert device turned out to be a thumb drive wrapped in
putty and clay that was “probably intended to cause some kind
of disruption,” Browne said. No evacuations were required and
the street was reopened at around 11 a.m., he said.  “The way it was done, where it was placed and its
components were done in a way to give the impression of some
sort of explosive device,” Browne said.  The barrier was in front of the Trump Building at 40 Wall
Street, which is described on its website as the tallest office
building in downtown New York.  The 70-story structure, located across the street from the
New York Stock Exchange, was completed in 1930 and was the
tallest building in the world until it was eclipsed by the
Chrysler Building,  according  to Emporis.com, which collects
building data.  It was purchased by real estate developer  Donald Trump  in
December 1995 for a price estimated below $8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
