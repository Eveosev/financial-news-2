Kickoff return record-holder Leon Washington signed a free-agent contract with the  New England
Patriots  after three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.  Washington, who played for the  New York Jets  from 2006 to
2009, has eight career kickoff returns for touchdowns, a
National Football League mark he shares with free-agent Josh Cribbs. The Patriots didnâ€™t reveal terms of the agreement in a
statement on their website.  The 30-year-old Washington, listed as a running back, also
tied an NFL record with the Seahawks in 2010 when he returned
two kicks for touchdowns in a single game. He was selected to
the Pro Bowl in 2008 and 2012.  Washington averaged 29 yards per kickoff return last
season, including one touchdown. He carried the ball from
scrimmage 23 times for 83 yards and one score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
