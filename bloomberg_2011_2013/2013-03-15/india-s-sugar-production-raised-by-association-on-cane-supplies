Sugar output in  India , the world’s
second-biggest producer, is expected to be higher in 2012-13
than an earlier estimate because of increased cane supplies in
Maharashtra, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said.  Output is expected to be 24.6 million metric tons in the
year ending Sept. 30, compared with a January estimate of 24.3
million tons, the industry association said in an e-mailed
statement today. That compares with the Food Ministry’s estimate
of 25 million tons.  The output would bolster inventory, New Delhi-based Abinash
Verma, ISMA’s director general, said by phone today. Sugar
stockpiles may total 7.5 million tons on Oct. 1, enough to meet
demand in the world’s top-consuming nation for four months, he
said.  India’s sugar production may drop to 24 million tons in
2013-14, as dry weather curbs planting, Farm Minister Sharad
Pawar said March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
