Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said euro-area leaders should avoid imposing
losses on bondholders as part of a bailout package for Cyprus
because a so-called haircut would risk unsettling financial
markets.  “We mustn’t apply a Greece-type solution to Cyprus because
this could trigger massive uncertainties in financial markets if
it seemed that we don’t care about our credibility because we
would do the same in Cyprus than in  Greece ,” Juncker said today
in Brussels after a summit of European Union leaders. “There
are other possibilities.”  Finance ministers from the 17 nations using the euro will
discuss an aid program for Cyprus at a meeting starting at 5
p.m. in Brussels. The finance chiefs didn’t receive specific
instructions from the EU leaders, Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said.  Cyprus, the fifth euro-area nation to request international
assistance, has been debating the contours of a bailout package
since last June. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who
leads the group of euro finance chiefs, said two days ago that
the so-called eurogroup aims to cut the size of a Cypriot rescue
to about 10 billion euros ($13.1 billion) from an estimated 17
billion euros.  “The statements he made are going in the right
direction,” Juncker said today.  “The Eurogroup has to find a solution tonight,” Juncker
said. “I expect that this will happen because time is
pressing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
