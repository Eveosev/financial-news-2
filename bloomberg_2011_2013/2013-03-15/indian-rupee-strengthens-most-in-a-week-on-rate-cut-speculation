India ’s rupee rose the most in a
week on speculation a slowing inflation measure that excludes
food will allow the central bank to reduce  interest rates  next
week, spurring buying of the nation’s stocks.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower its  repurchase rate  by
25 basis points to 7.50 percent at a March 19 review, according
to 24 of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Three predict
no change. Core wholesale prices advanced 3.8 percent in
February after a 4.1 percent increase in January, according to a
government report published yesterday.  “An RBI rate cut next week can lead to the rupee
outperforming in  Asia ,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The currency is one of our
favorites in the longer term.”  The rupee climbed 0.5 percent to 54.0875 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, taking the week’s gain to 0.4 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used
to price options, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point,
to 9.15 percent. The rate dropped three basis points this week.  The rupee’s gains will be limited by importers’ purchases
of dollars, according to Federal Bank Ltd.  The S&P BSE  Sensex Index (SENSEX)  of shares rose for a second day as
exchange data showed overseas funds bought a net $1.1 billion of
the nation’s stocks this month through March 13.  Fuel Subsidies  While Barclays Plc says prices of manufactured goods
excluding food increased less than 4 percent for the first time
in almost three years, headline  wholesale-price inflation 
accelerated to 6.84 percent last month from a year earlier after
a 6.62 percent gain in January. The pickup is due to higher fuel
costs as the government looks to reduce subsidies, the U.K. bank
estimated in a report yesterday, adding that stripping this out
would provide a number closer to 6.3 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.15 per
dollar, compared with 55.32 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.09 versus 55.33. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
