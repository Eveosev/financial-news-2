Crude options volatility fell below
17 percent as the underlying oil futures remained within a
trading range that has held for almost two weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 16.95 percent, the lowest level since
Feb. 14, at 1:15 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It
was 17.15 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery rose 41
cents to $93.44 a barrel on the Nymex. Since Feb. 26, the May
contract has traded in an intraday range from $90.04 to $94.20.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $125 calls, which rose 1 cent to 2 cents a barrel on volume
of 1,652 contracts. April $93 puts were the second-most active
with 1,612 lots. They dropped 37 cents to 6 cents a barrel.  Electronic-trading volume was almost evenly divided between
puts and calls. In the previous session, calls made up 52
percent of the 145,184 contracts traded.  May $90 puts were the most active options traded yesterday,
with 5,410 contracts changing hands. They fell 23 cents to 80
cents a barrel. May $83 puts declined 4 cents to 11 cents a
barrel on 4,927 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,208 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,170 and June
$90 puts at 32,223.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
