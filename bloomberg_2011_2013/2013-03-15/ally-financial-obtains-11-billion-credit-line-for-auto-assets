Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the U.S.
government-owned auto-finance firm, got $11 billion of credit
lines to fund automotive loans and leases.  The funding, being provided by a group of 19 lenders, was
reduced by $4 billion as the company has become less reliant on
raising money in the capital markets due to growth in deposits
at its banking subsidiary Ally Bank, according to a statement
from Ally Financial distributed today by PR Newswire.  “Supporting continued growth of our leading U.S. auto
finance franchise through diversified funding sources remains an
important priority at Ally, and renewal of these facilities is a
key component of that strategy,” Chris Halmy, Ally’s corporate
treasurer, said in the statement.  The Detroit-based company, which received a $17.2 billion
bailout that left the U.S. Treasury Department with a 74 percent
stake, had its capital plan rejected by the  Federal Reserve 
after regulators deemed its  capital ratios  didn’t meet
standards.  The $11 billion of financing consists of an $8.5 billion
credit line for  Ally Financial  that will mature in two years,
and $2.5 billion of credit due in June 2014 that will be
available to Ally Bank, according to the statement.  The loans replace two revolving credit lines totaling about
$15 billion, one that was set to mature this month and the other
maturing in March 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
