Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will probably reduce  duties  on most oil shipments
abroad by 4.5 percent on April 1, down from a 10-month high,
after Urals crude prices fell.  The standard export duty is likely to decline to $401.50 a
metric ton, or about $54.80 a barrel, from $420.60 a ton this
month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on oil price
data from the economy and finance ministries. The March duty
has been at the highest level since May 2012.  The government is reviewing the export duty structure to
encourage producers meet President  Vladimir Putin ’s goal of
keeping output at more than 10 million barrels a day. Production
was 10.46 million barrels a day in February, near a post-Soviet
high, according to preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s
CDU-TEK unit. Oil and gas provide about half of Russia’s budget
revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades may drop to $197.10 a ton from $211.40 this month.
The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the standard
duty, would be $40.10 in April.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $110.02 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said today by phone. In the previous
monitoring period, it averaged $114.38, according to the
ministry.  The Economy Ministry will publish the levies on its website
before they come into effect, he said.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as  fuel oil , may fall to $265 a ton from $277.60.
A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude oil duty since
May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, may be reduced to
$361.40 a ton in April from $378.60 this month.  The government may lower the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $70.50 a ton from $131.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
