President  Barack Obama  is preparing to tell all federal agencies for the first time that they should consider the impact on global warming before approving major projects, from pipelines to highways.  The result could be significant delays for natural gas- export facilities, ports for coal sales to Asia, and even new forest roads, industry lobbyists warn.  “It’s got us very freaked out,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of the  National Association of Manufacturers , a Washington-based group that represents 11,000 companies such as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Southern Co. (SO)  The standards, which constitute guidance for agencies and not new regulations, are set to be issued in the coming weeks, according to lawyers briefed by administration officials.  In taking the step, Obama would be fulfilling a vow to act alone in the face of a Republican-run House of Representatives unwilling to pass measures limiting  greenhouse gases . He’d expand the scope of a Nixon-era law that was first intended to force agencies to assess the effect of projects on air, water and soil pollution.  “If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” Obama said last month during his  State of the Union  address. He pledged executive actions “to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”  Illinois Speech  The president is scheduled to deliver a speech on energy today at the Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont,  Illinois . He is pressing Congress to create a $2 billion clean-energy research fund with fees paid by oil and gas producers.  While some U.S. agencies already take  climate change  into account when assessing projects, the new guidelines would apply across-the-board to all federal reviews. Industry lobbyists say they worry that projects could be tied up in  lawsuits  or administrative delays.  For example, Ambre Energy Ltd. is seeking a permit from the  Army Corps  of Engineers to build a coal-export  facility  at the  Port of Morrow  in  Oregon . Under existing rules, officials weighing approval would consider whether ships in the port would foul the water or generate air pollution locally. The Environmental Protection Agency and activist groups say that review should be broadened to account for the greenhouse gases emitted when exported coal is burned in  power plants  in Asia.  Keystone Pipeline  Similar analyses could be made for the  oil sands  that would be transported in  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline, and leases to drill for oil, gas and coal on federal lands, such as those for  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  and  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)   If the new White House guidance is structured correctly, it will require just those kinds of lifecycle reviews, said Bill Snape, senior counsel at the  Center for Biological Diversity  in  Washington . The environmental group has sued to press for this approach, and Snape says lawsuits along this line are certain if the administration approves the Keystone pipeline, which would transport oil from Canada’s  tar sands  to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  “The real danger is the delays,” said Eisenberg of the manufacturers’ group. “I don’t think the answer is ever going to be ‘no,’ but it can confound things.”  Lawyers and lobbyists are now waiting for the White House’s  Council on Environmental Quality  to issue the long bottled-up standards for how agencies should address climate change under the  National Environmental Policy Act , signed into law by President  Richard Nixon  in 1970.  Environmental Impact  NEPA requires federal agencies to consider and publish the environmental impact of their actions before making decisions. Those reviews don’t mandate a specific course of action. They do provide a chance for citizens and environmentalists to weigh in before regulators decide on an action -- and to challenge those reviews in court if it’s cleared.  “Each agency currently differs in how their NEPA reviews consider the climate change impacts of projects, as well as how climate change impacts such as extreme weather will affect projects,” Taryn Tuss, a Council on Environmental Quality spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “CEQ is working to incorporate the public input we received on the draft guidance, and will release updated guidance when it is completed.”  ‘Major Shakeup’  The new standards will be “a major shakeup in how agencies conduct NEPA” reviews, said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity in  San Francisco .  The White House is looking at requiring consideration of both the increase in greenhouse gases and a project’s vulnerability to flooding, drought or other extreme weather that might result from global warming, according to an initial proposal it issued in 2010. Those full reports would be required for projects with 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide  equivalent  emissions or more per year, the  equivalent  of burning about 100 rail cars of coal.  The initial draft exempted federal land and resource decisions from the guidance, although CEQ said it was assessing how to handle those cases. Federal lands could be included in the final standards.  The White House guidance itself won’t force any projects to be stopped outright. Instead, it’s likely to prompt lawsuits against federal projects on these grounds, and increase the probability that courts will step in and order extensive reviews as part of the “adequate analysis” required in the law, said George Mannina, an attorney at Nossaman LLP in Washington.  Next Administration  “The question is: Where does this analysis take us?” he said. “Adequate analysis may be much broader than the agency and applicant might consider.”  While the Obama administration’s guidance could be easily rescinded by the next administration, the court rulings that stem from these cases will live on as precedents, Mannina said.  Lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  American Petroleum Institute  and the National Mining Association weighed in with the White House against including climate in NEPA, a law initially aimed at chemical leaks or air pollution.  “Not only will this result in additional delay of the NEPA process, but will result in speculative and inaccurate modeling that will have direct impacts on approval of specific projects,” the National Mining Association in Washington wrote in comments to the White House in 2010.  Leases Challenged  The group represents  Arch Coal (ACI)  and Peabody, both based in  St. Louis . Leases that the  Department of Interior  issued for those companies to mine for coal in Wyoming are facing lawsuits from environmental groups, arguing that the agency didn’t adequately tally up the effect on global warming from burning that coal.  Given Obama’s pledge to address global warming, “this is a massive contradiction,” said Jeremy Nichols, director of climate at WildEarth Guardians in Denver, which filed lawsuits against the leases.  Arch Coal referred questions to the mining group.  Beth Sutton, a Peabody spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, “We believe the current regulatory approach to surface mine permits is appropriate and protects the environment.”  Since CEQ first announced its proposal, more than three dozen federal approvals were challenged on climate grounds, including a highway project in North Carolina, a methane-venting plan for a  coal mine  in Colorado, and a research facility in California, according to a chart compiled by the Center for Climate Change Law at  Columbia University .  Next Target  The next target is  TransCanada (TRP) ’s application to build the 1,661-mile (2,673-kilometer) Keystone pipeline. The  Sierra Club  and 350.org drew 35,000 people to Washington last month to urge Obama to reject the pipeline. Meanwhile, the NEPA review by the State Department included an initial analysis of carbon released when the tar sands are refined into gasoline and used in vehicles.  It stopped short, however, of saying the project would result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. With or without the pipeline, the oil sands will be mined and used as fuel, the report said. That finding is likely to be disputed in court if the Obama administration clears the project.  “Keystone is ground zero,” said Snape, of the Center for Biological Diversity. “Clearly this will come into play, and it will be litigated.”  Any actions by the administration now on global warming would pick up on a mixed record over the past four years.  Cap-and-Trade  While Obama failed to get Congress to pass cap-and-trade legislation, the EPA reversed course from the previous administration and ruled that carbon-dioxide emissions endanger public health, opening the way for the agency to regulate it.  Using that finding, the agency raised mileage standards for automobiles and proposed rules for new power plants that would essentially outlaw the construction of new coal-fired power plants that don’t have expensive carbon-capture technology.  Environmentalists such as the  Natural Resources Defense Council  say the most important action next will be the EPA’s rules for existing power plants, the single biggest source of carbon-dioxide emissions. The NEPA standards are separate from those rules, and will affect how the federal government itself is furthering global warming.  “Agencies do a pretty poor job of looking at climate change impacts,” Rebecca Judd, a legislative counsel at the environmental legal group Earthjustice in Washington. “A thorough guidance would help alleviate that.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at  mdrajem@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at  jmorgan97@bloomberg.net
