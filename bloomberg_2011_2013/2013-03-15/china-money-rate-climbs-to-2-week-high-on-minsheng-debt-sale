China ’s money-market rate climbed
to a two-week high as China Minsheng Banking Corp. started
selling convertible bonds, boosting demand for capital.  The Beijing-based  lender  plans to raise 20 billion  yuan 
($3.2 billion) in the sale that began today, according to a
statement published March 12. Guotai Junan Securities Co.
estimated the issuance will lock up 450 billion yuan of capital
before funds are returned to unsuccessful bidders from March 20.  “The pressure from Minsheng sale will probably ease next
Wednesday,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China
Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 31 basis points to 3.40 percent as
of 10:26 a.m. in  Shanghai , the highest level since March 5,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The rate climbed 91 basis points this
week.  The People’s Bank of China withdrew 44 billion yuan ($7.1
billion) of capital from the financial system this week selling
repurchase contracts, a fourth weekly withdrawal, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank hasn’t issued
reverse-repurchase agreements, which add funds to the financial
system, since Feb. 7.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined one
basis point to 3.27 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate rose five basis points in the week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
