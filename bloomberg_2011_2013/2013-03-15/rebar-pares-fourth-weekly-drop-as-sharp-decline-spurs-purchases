Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed for the first time in eight days, paring a fourth weekly
drop, as the lowest prices in three months spurred purchases.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 3,791  yuan  ($610) a
metric ton and was at 3,773 yuan at 9:55 a.m. local time. The
price has dropped 4 percent this week, the most since the week
ended Feb. 22.  “The slump in the rebar futures was too far and too
swift,” Dang Man, analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone
from Xi’an today. “We think rebar futures will remain weak for
a while as bearish fundamentals have to run their course.”  Steel stockpiles at Chinese ports are the highest in almost
a year, according to data from Shanghai Steelhome Information, a
researcher based in the city. Raw material  iron ore  dropped the
most yesterday since Jan. 16 to the lowest level since Dec. 18
amid concern curbs on construction in  China  will reduce demand
for the commodity used to make steel.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell for a ninth day
yesterday, declining 0.7 percent to 3,684 yuan, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
