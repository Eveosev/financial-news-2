Eurocopter SAS, the world’s largest
helicopter maker, had a German government order for attack and
transport rotorcraft curtailed after more than a year of
discussions over how to restructure the deal.  An agreement signed today cuts  Germany ’s Tiger attack
helicopter program to 57 units from 80 and the number of NH90
troop transports to 82 units from 122, the Defense Ministry said
in a statement. Germany will add 18 NFH90 maritime helicopters
under the terms of the agreement, it said.  The German government has sought to amend the deal with
Eurocopter, the helicopter arm of Toulouse, France-based
 European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , to cut spending and
bring the number of rotorcraft in line with a smaller military.
The company, on the other hand, had been trying to assure its
production capacities would not be undermined.  “The outcome is a clear win-win situation for both
parties, and provides those involved with a resilient and
sustainable solution for the future,” Eurocopter spokesman
Christoph Mueller said by e-mail. “We took a tough stance in
our negotiations, but our discussions were most constructive.”  Eurocopter has agreed to buy back 11 Tiger attack
helicopters already handed over, the ministry said. The contract
change, which still needs to be finalized, will free up
significant budget, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
