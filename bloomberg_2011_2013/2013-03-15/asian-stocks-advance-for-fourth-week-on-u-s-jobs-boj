Asian stocks rose for a fourth
week, the longest streak of gains this year, as U.S. jobs data
beat estimates and the Japanese parliament approved Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s nominees to the central bank board.  Nissan Motor Co. advanced 2.4 percent, leading gains among
companies that get sales in the U.S. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest publicly traded bank, rose 7.7
percent amid speculation Abe will implement policies to
stimulate the economy and end 15 years of falling prices. Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd. fell 7.6 percent, relinquishing its
place as Asian’s biggest developer by value, as Hong-Kong-listed
real estate companies tumbled on concern policy makers are
stepping up efforts to cool  home prices  and as local  mortgage
rates  were increased.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 0.8 percent to 136.66.
The gauge has climbed 5.6 percent this year as data signaled the
world’s biggest economy is recovering and investors bet the  Bank
of Japan  will loosen monetary policy. Chinese shares fell this
week amid concern about government efforts to control prices.  The U.S. jobs data “has shown the world’s largest economy
is really starting to gain momentum and, of course, that’s all
positive for financial markets,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of
investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments,
which manages about $25 billion. “The biggest part of the
global economy, namely the U.S., is doing well and continues to
do well, whereas there’s a small question mark over  China .
That’s containing the rally.”  Relative Value  Gains in 2013 left the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index trading at

according to data March 14 from the Labor Department in

fiscal year, 13 percent more than the mean of analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  rose for a fourth week, adding

developers, as data showed China’s consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in 10 months and People’s Bank of China Governor
 Zhou Xiaochuan  said monetary policy is “no longer relaxed.”

level since October.  New World Development Co. (17) , controlled by
billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , dropped 5.2 percent to HK$13.26.  China is set to complete a once-a-decade handover of power

analyst Alex Yeung.  To contact the reporters on this story:
