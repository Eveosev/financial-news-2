Japan  added 1,178 megawatts of
mostly solar clean-energy capacity in the nine months to the end
of December as the country curbs its reliance on nuclear power.  Japan added 1,119 megawatts of solar to the 4,800 megawatts
already installed, according to data released by the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry on March 13. Wind rose 34 megawatts
and biomass 22 megawatts, according to the government  figures .  The country began an incentive program for clean energy in
July to boost use of renewables after the 2011 Fukushima atomic
disaster. The ministry approved applications for above-market
rates for clean energy worth 5,236 megawatts until the end of
December, including 3,857 megawatts of non-residential solar.  The northern island of Hokkaido accounts for 26 percent of
approved applications by capacity for solar plants 1 megawatt or
larger, the most among Japanâ€™s 47 prefectures, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
