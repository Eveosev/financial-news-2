United States Bakery Inc. won the
auction for four of Hostess Brands Inc.’s bread brands with a
bid of $30.85 million, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  United States Bakery raised its offer by $2 million for the
Sweetheart, Eddy’s, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie’s bread
brands, four bakeries, 14 depots and certain equipment, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the auction
results aren’t yet public.  Danny Pettey, spokesman for United States Bakery, didn’t
immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the auction
results.  Hostess, founded in 1930, is liquidating after failing to
reach an agreement with striking bakers on concessions to help
the company emerge from its second bankruptcy.  No rivals challenged McKee Food Corp.’s $27.5 million bid
for the Drake’s snack-cake brand and an auction planned for
today for those assets was canceled.  Previously known as Interstate Bakeries Corp., Hostess left
an earlier bankruptcy in 2009 under the control of buyout firm
Ripplewood Holdings LLC and lenders. The company, based in
Irving,  Texas , entered bankruptcy again in January 2012.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-bk-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporters on this story:
