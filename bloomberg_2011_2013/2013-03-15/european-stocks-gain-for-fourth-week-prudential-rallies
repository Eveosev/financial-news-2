European stocks  advanced for a
fourth week, the longest winning streak in almost three months,
as the region’s leaders eased constraints on national budgets
and U.S. retail sales and jobless-benefit claims pointed to a
recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  SBM Offshore NV surged the most since 2008 after settling a
dispute with Talisman Energy Inc.  Prudential Plc (PRU)  led insurers
higher, gaining 14 percent, after raising its dividend.
Commerzbank AG tumbled the most in almost four years after
Germany’s second-largest lender said it will sell shares to
repay stakes owned by Allianz SE and a government fund.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  gained 0.7 percent to 297.46
this past week. The gauge slipped 0.4 percent yesterday,
retreating from the highest level since June 2008. Spain sold
803 million euros ($1.05 billion) of debt at an extraordinary
auction on March 14 and Italy issued 6.99 billion euros of
securities the previous day. Ireland sold its first 10-year bond
since receiving a European Union-led bailout three years ago.  “The key driver is still of course the international
monetary policy from central banks,” said Andreas Lipkow, a
senior market strategist at Kliegel & Hafner AG in Berlin. “The
auctions for government bonds out of Spain, Italy and Ireland
were a sign for investors that the situation in Europe is not as
bad as they maybe thought. ‘Go with the flow’ is the theme right
now.”  Bond Buying  The Stoxx 600 has surged 6.4 percent this year as U.S.
politicians agreed on a compromise budget and the Federal
Reserve continued its bond-buying program. On March 14, the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares climbed to within two
points of its 1,565.15 record close set in October 2007.  European Union leaders meeting in Brussels endorsed
“structural” budgetary assessments, using code for granting
countries such as France, Spain and Portugal extra time to bring
down deficits. Still, balanced budgets remained the goal and
there was no talk of large-scale spending programs.  In the U.S., applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly
dropped to the lowest level in almost two months in the week
ended March 9.  Retail sales  and industrial production rose more
than forecast in February, separate reports showed.  National benchmark indexes climbed in in 12 of the 18
western European markets. Germany’s DAX Index rallied 0.7
percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100
Index added 0.1 percent. The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  advanced 1.5
percent to the highest level since January 2008.  SBM Offshore  SBM Offshore surged 22 percent as the world’s biggest
supplier of floating oil-production platforms settled a dispute
over its Yme operation with Talisman. SBM will pay Talisman $470
million and book a $270 million charge on top of the $200
million set aside in December after the Yme platform was
evacuated in July because of cracks found in the structure.  Prudential rallied 14 percent, the biggest gain in 15
months. The U.K.’s biggest insurer by market value boosted its
dividend by 16 percent as profit beat  estimates  on rising income
from Asian economies such as Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.
Operating profit climbed 25 percent to 2.53 billion pounds ($3.8
billion) in 2012, the insurer said. That beat the 2.32 billion-
pound median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Assicurazioni Generali SpA rose 2.1 percent after Italy’s
biggest insurer also reported increased operating income.  A gauge of insurers was the  best performer  among the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600, gaining 2.4 percent.  Saipem, Rentokil  Saipem SpA (SPM)  surged 13 percent, the biggest jump since
December 2008. Europe’s largest oil-service provider won
contracts in north and west Africa valued at $1.1 billion.  Rentokil Initial Plc (RTO)  added 8.4 percent after the world’s
biggest pest-control company said adjusted pretax profit jumped
16 percent in the fourth quarter. Chief Executive Officer Alan
Brown said he expects Rentokil will sustain the growth seen in
the period throughout 2013.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG gained 5.7 percent, the largest
increase since January. Europe’s second-biggest airline agreed
to renew its short-haul fleet with 100 mostly fuel-efficient
jets from Airbus SAS, as the airline seeks to cut costs.  Commerzbank plummeted 17 percent, the most since May 2009,
after saying it will sell 2.5 billion euros of shares.
Shareholders in the bank, which is 25 percent government-owned
after receiving an 18.2 billion-euro bailout in 2009, will be
asked to approve a reverse stock split on April 19 that will
reduce the number of shares to 583 million from 5.83 billion.  Commerzbank Chief Executive Officer Martin Blessing bought
120,900 euros of shares on March 14.  ASM International NV dropped 10 percent, the biggest
decline since August 2011. The Dutch semiconductor-service
company sold an 11.9 percent stake in ASM Pacific Technology
Ltd. for HK$4.27 billion ($550 million), falling short of
investor anticipation of a full spinoff of the majority-
controlled Asian business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
