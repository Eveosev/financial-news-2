Cattle futures declined to the
lowest price since July as U.S. meat processors slowed purchases
on signs of weakening demand for beef. Hogs also fell.  Meatpackers processed about 481,000 cattle in the first
four days of this week, down 2.2 percent from the same period a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agricultural data show.
Wholesale  beef  fell 0.6 percent to $1.9632 a pound yesterday,
the biggest decline in a month, USDA data show. Prices are still
up 1.1 percent this year, while wholesale  pork  is down 5.9
percent, government data show.  “Demand is still sluggish at the consumer level, and as
such, buyers are reluctant to take on additional product,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC in
Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report. “Cattle futures
continue to succumb to pressure on demand concerns and the deep
discounts in the pork market.”  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$1.21625 a pound at 10:20 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching $1.21475, the lowest for the most-
active contract since July 18.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 1.4
percent to $1.4135 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for June settlement slumped 1.6 percent to
89.075 cents a pound on the CME. The contract was down 1 percent
this month through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
