Argentina ’s economy last year
expanded at the slowest pace since 2009 as drought hit grains
and oilseeds harvests and factories trimmed output.  South America’s second-biggest economy  grew  1.9 percent in
2012 after expanding 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency reported today in
 Buenos Aires . In 2009, the economy expanded 0.9 percent. Growth
averaged 7.8 percent from 2003 to 2011.  “We have grown at very high rates and that doesn’t seem to
be sustainable,” said Roberto Drimer, an economist at Vatnet
research company in Buenos Aires. “The slower growth was a
result of a mediocre harvest and a lower rate of investment.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  will seek to
revive growth ahead of mid-term congressional elections in
October, Drimer said. Industrial output fell 1.2 percent last
year, after expanding 6.5 percent in 2011, led by a 7.8 percent
drop in  automobile production .  Fernandez is forcing banks to boost lending for investments
that increase production, while the state-run social security
agency is financing loans for home construction to spur growth
and employment.  Last year’s expansion was below the threshold required to
trigger a payment on  government securities  linked to economic
expansion. The GDP warrant was unchanged at 5.53 cents as of
4:14 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
