Porsche AG, the  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  unit
that builds the 911 sports car, plans to expand its sales
network 33 percent by 2018 as demand for upscale vehicles jumps
in  emerging markets  such as China and its model line grows.  Porsche will invest 200 million euros ($260 million)
annually to increase the number of dealerships to 1,000 outlets
in five years from 750 today, Chief Executive Officer  Matthias Mueller  said today at a press conference at the brand’s
Stuttgart, Germany-based headquarters.  The division is adding to its line-up after Volkswagen,
 Europe ’s biggest carmaker, integrated Porsche as a brand in
August. Porsche introduced revamped versions of the Boxster
roadster and the Cayman sports car last year, making them
lighter and faster to shore up its reputation for performance,
and will roll out the compact Macan sport-utility vehicle in
showrooms in early 2014.  “Our international dealership network is being expanded at 
a high pace,” Mueller said in a speech at the carmaker’s museum. 
“In China alone, there’s a new Porsche Center opening almost 
every month,” and the country will account for about 10 percent 
of dealerships by 2018 under the growth strategy.  The third-generation Cayman, which debuted at the Los
Angeles Auto Show in November, can accelerate to 60 miles (100
kilometers) per hour in as little as 4.6 seconds, 0.2 second
faster than its predecessor. The top speed of the updated model
is 283 kilometers per hour compared with 277 kph for its
predecessor.  Delivery Targets  The expansion is part of a push by Porsche to boost annual
sales to at least 200,000 cars and SUVs by 2018, when Volkswagen
has a target of becoming the world’s biggest automaker. Porsche
delivered a record 143,096 vehicles to customers in 2012, an
increase of 22 percent, it said today. Its global sales in
February jumped 18 percent to 10,454 cars.  “Apart from  China , we’re expanding our dealership network
in important growth regions like  South Korea ,  Brazil  and
 Russia ,” Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said at the press
conference.  Porsche’s operating profit last year increased 19 percent
to 2.44 billion euros as sales rose 27 percent to 13.9 billion
euros, with the margin narrowing to 17.6 percent of revenue from
18.7 percent.  European Risk  The division is “cautiously optimistic” about this year,
when earnings will probably match the 2012 figure, Meschke said.
At the same time, the European sovereign-debt crisis poses a
“risk potential” for carmakers, and the region’s auto market
in the mid term will remain a “major challenge.”  Volkswagen forecast yesterday that group operating profit
will grow in 2014 after remaining unchanged this year from the
2012 level. Earnings before interest and taxes at the Wolfsburg,
Germany-based carmaker increased 2.1 percent last year to 11.5
billion euros.  Porsche’s integration with Volkswagen gives the sports-car
division “the opportunity to use existing resources, capacity
and competencies together with other company brands,” Mueller
said today. He reiterated that cost savings from becoming part
of VW will beat an initial 700 million-euro target.  After the Macan, Porsche is considering adding two more
vehicles, including a smaller version of the Panamera four-door
coupe and a $250,000 sports-car to challenge the Ferrari 458
Italia. The 918 Spyder, an $845,000 limited-run hybrid supercar,
will be Porsche’s most expensive model ever when deliveries
start later this year.  “The Macan will lead to a tangible growth push from 2014
on and by 2018 we will reach the defined goals of our
strategy,” Mueller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
