The difference in yields between
Indonesia’s two- and 10-year bonds widened to the most in more
than eight months after investors pushed up borrowing costs at a
debt auction on concern inflation will accelerate.  The finance ministry’s sale on March 13 attracted the
 smallest amount  of bids this year as funds asked for interest
rates as high as 5.53 percent for the 2023 notes, compared with
5.45 percent in the secondary market. Consumer prices rose 5.31
percent in February, the biggest increase since June 2011,
official data showed March 1. Measures to control subsidized-
fuel usage are a priority, while raising the cost is a last
option, Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo said yesterday.  “The yield curve will likely steepen further as investors
focus on shorter-term notes,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt
capital markets at PT BCA Sekuritas in Jakarta, a unit of the
nation’s largest lender by market value. “There are
expectations inflation will accelerate, especially now with talk
of fuel-subsidy adjustments.”  Ten-year yields climbed nine basis points this week to 5.45
percent, widening the gap with two-year securities to 113 basis
points as of 3:21 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since June 27, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The longer-term rate may rise as
high as 5.8 percent by the end of June, Wibowo forecast.  Volatility Surges  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent today to 9,706 per dollar
and fell 0.2 percent for the week, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency traded at a 0.3 percent
premium to one-month non-deliverable forwards, which fell 0.2
percent in the five days to 9,731, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,704 per dollar by the Association of Banks in Singapore,
compared with 9,702 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 58 basis
points, or 0.58 percentage point, to 6.37 percent today, the
highest level since Jan. 22. The gauge rose 53 basis points for
the week.  Indonesian lawmakers approved Perry Warjiyo as the central
bank’s new deputy governor for monetary operations yesterday.
His appointment has yet to be confirmed by Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
