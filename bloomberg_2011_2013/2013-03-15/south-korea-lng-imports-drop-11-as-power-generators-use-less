Imports of liquefied natural gas
into  South Korea , the world’s second-largest buyer of the fuel,
fell 11 percent in February, the biggest drop since October as
power generators cut consumption.  Shipments dropped to 4.14 million metric tons from 4.64
million tons a year earlier, data on the Korea Customs Service’s
 website  showed today. The monthly volume rose from 3.92 million
tons in January.  The total cost of the February purchases declined to $3.23
billion from $3.45 billion in the same month a year earlier, the
data showed. The average price paid per ton rose to $778.84 from
$743.84 a year ago, according to the data.  South Korea buys most of its LNG under multiyear contracts
from suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia and Oman. Last month’s
purchases included a spot shipment of 61,632 tons from
 Equatorial Guinea  at $885.80 a ton, the data showed.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said March 12 that its February domestic sales of natural gas
fell 6.8 percent to 3.91 million tons from a year earlier.
Demand from electricity producers slipped 8.4 percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
