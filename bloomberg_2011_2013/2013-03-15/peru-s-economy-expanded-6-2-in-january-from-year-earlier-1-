Peru ’s economy expanded 6.2 percent
in January from the year earlier as construction activity offset
a slide in demand for its metal exports.  The growth in  economic activity  accelerated from 4.3
percent in December, the government’s statistics agency said in
a report issued today in Lima. The median forecast of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth of 6.4 percent.
The construction industry expanded 18.4 percent.  A consumer spending boom and investment in housing, malls
and transport infrastructure have shielded South America’s
fastest-growing economy from a slump in exports, which fell 20
percent in January. Domestic demand isn’t stirring inflationary
pressures, allowing the central bank to leave its benchmark
lending rate unchanged for a 22nd month on March 7.  The Peruvian sol was little changed at 2.593 per U.S.
dollar at 10:16 a.m. in  Lima . The currency fell to a three-month
low of 2.6120 on March 7 after the central bank increased
reserve requirements to counter rising dollar inflows.  Peru’s Finance Ministry, which had forecast 7 percent
growth for January, projects a 6.3 percent expansion in the
first quarter after a 5.9 percent rise in the previous three
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
