Cyprus’s natural gas reserves in
its territorial waters could be as much as 60 trillion cubic
feet, the head of the country’s state hydrocarbons company said.  The country has already granted licenses for exploratory
drilling in six blocks that could contain as much as 40 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, according to Charalambos Ellinas,
chairman of Kretyk, as the company is known, in Nicosia today.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  will begin exploratory drilling in block
12 of the Economic Exclusion Zone, which has reserves of as much
as 8 trillion cubic feet, in the third quarter, Commerce and
Industry Minister George Lakkotrypis said on March 13.  Cyprus has so far given gas exploration licenses to Noble,
 Total SA (FP)  and a venture of  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)   To contact the reporter on this story:
