The  New York  Jets lowered prices to
$50 on about 3,000 seats in the upper level of the National
Football League team’s MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey, and cut the cost of some club-seat tickets.  The move increases the number of $50 season tickets
available in the upper deck to about 9,000, team President Neil Glat said. The tickets don’t require a personal-seat license.  “That’s something we wanted to expand, and we think is
fan-friendly,” Glat said in a telephone interview.  The Jets finished 6-10 and out of the playoffs for the
second consecutive season. They reached the American Football
Conference championship game the previous two years.  While about 94 percent of ticket prices in the building
will be unchanged, the Jets will also cut the price of about
2,000 club seats, Glat said. Some tickets in the mezzanine clubs
went to $295 and $255 from $395 and $295. Some tickets in the
Coaches Club area will fall to $255 from $700 as they are
converted to a new Lower Prime Club, with access to the Lexus &
Chase clubs.  Renewals are due May 15, Glat said. Fans who renew early
will be entered in a contest with 2013 prizes ranging from a
football to Super Bowl tickets.  MetLife Stadium, which the Jets share with the New York
Giants, opened in 2010 and is set to host the NFL’s championship
game in February 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
