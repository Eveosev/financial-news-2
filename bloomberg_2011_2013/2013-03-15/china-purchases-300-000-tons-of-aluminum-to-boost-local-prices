China’s state reserves manager
signed agreements today with six smelters to buy 300,000 metric
tons of aluminum at 15,137  yuan  ($2,434) a ton in a bid to
bolster local prices.  The State Bureau of Material Reserve will pay about 4
percent more than the spot price for the metal to be delivered
in April and May, data provider SMM Information & Technology Co.
said on its website today. That compares with a spot price of
14,550 yuan on Shanghai’s Changjiang Nonferrous Metal Market.  “The stockpiling plan could help tighten the market in
April and May,” Huang Fulong, an analyst at Citic Securities
Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen. “The agreed price was
slightly lower than market expected.”  The sellers include  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , better
known as Chalco, China Power Investment Corp., Yunnan Aluminum
Co. and Henan Shenhuo Coal & Power Co., according to SMM. The
reserves manager last bought 100,000 tons in November.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $1,983 at 11:52 a.m. in  Shanghai . The most-
actively traded contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was at
14,855 yuan a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
