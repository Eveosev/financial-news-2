Jacques Begle and Philippe Steiner,
formerly of  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , are starting a company to help
bridge a gap in loans for smaller commodity merchants after
banks stepped up lending rules because of new regulations.  Geneva-based Commodity Trade Invest LLC will structure
trade finance deals for Swiss funds, individual investors and
trading companies, said Begle, former co-head of trade finance
at BNP. It will target borrowers with revenues of $50 million to
$500 million and will focus on coal, metals and oil products
from the  Commonwealth of Independent States , he said.  “There seems to be quite a lot of interest from both
sides,” Begle said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The
deals are here. Our main job now is to find investors, willing
to give us a mandate to structure deals for their account.”  Begle, who left BNP in November after 30 years at the bank,
said  CTI  will help find investors for standalone transactions.
Steiner was previously a relationship manager for commodity
finance at BNP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
