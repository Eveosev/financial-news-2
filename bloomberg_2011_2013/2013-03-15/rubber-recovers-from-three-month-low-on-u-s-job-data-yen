Rubber recovered from a three-month
low after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell and the Japanese
currency traded near a 3 1/2 year low, improving the appeal of
yen-denominated contracts.  The contract for delivery in August on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange rose as much as 2.4 percent to 284.2 yen a kilogram
($2,962 a metric ton), before trading at 280.5 yen at 10:49 a.m.
local time. Futures settled 277.6 yen yesterday, the lowest
settlement for a most-active contract since Dec. 14. August
futures have fallen 6 percent this week.  Global equities  rallied this week after employment reports
in the U.S. and Australia topped estimates, building confidence
the economic recovery is gaining strength. Japan’s upper house
is preparing to vote on Haruhiko Kuroda’s nomination as  Bank of
Japan  governor.  “The U.S. jobs data increased investor confidence in the
nation’s economic recovery, spurring purchases of rubber
futures,” said Kazuhiko Saito, analyst at broker  Fujitomi Co (8740)  in
Tokyo. “Rubber also rebounded as it’s drop to a three-month low
attracted buyers.”  The number of people filing claims for jobless benefits
averaged 346,750 over the past four weeks, the lowest level
since March 2008, according to data from the Labor Department in
Washington.  The contract for September delivery added 0.2 percent to
22,820  yuan  ($3,669) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board lost 2.3 percent to 86.30 baht ($2.92)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
