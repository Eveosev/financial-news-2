Gasoline rose for the first time in
five days, narrowing a weekly loss, after U.S. economic data
signaled improvement in demand.  Futures gained 0.7 percent as U.S. industrial production
increased 0.7 percent in February, the most in three months,
Federal Reserve data showed. Manufacturing, which accounts for
about 75 percent of industrial output, advanced 0.8 percent for
the third month in the past four. The fuel’s premium to crude
rose for the first time this week and heating oil was higher.  “Products are leading the way on the back of better
economic data portending growth in demand,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for April delivery increased 2.25 cents to settle
at $3.1638 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading
volume was 21 percent below the 100-day average for the time of
day. The contract is for reformulated gasoline to be blended
with ethanol, or RBOB. Prices declined 1.2 percent this week,
the first drop since Feb. 22.  Gasoline demand in the week ended March 8, measured by
 deliveries  to wholesalers, increased 3.1 percent and over the
past four weeks was 1.1 percent above a year earlier, according
to Energy Information Administration data.  “We’re getting a boost off economic optimism,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“The manufacturing data is another sign the economy is
improving and will play into the better-demand scenario the
market is trying to price in.”  Crack Spreads  The April  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
oil widened 52 cents to $39.43 a barrel. The May  spread  against
Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe Exchange widened 0.5 cent to
$22.49.  Gasoline volatility has increased even as crude oil has
moved little. The 30-day average historical volatility for RBOB
was 33.1 percent today compared with 17.1 percent for crude.
That’s up from 19.9 percent for gasoline on Feb. 25, when crude
volatility was 15.5 percent.  Volatility in gasoline is also higher amid swings in the
cost of Renewable Identification Numbers for 2013 vintage that
refiners must buy in lieu of blending ethanol into gasoline. The
price of 2013-vintage RINs fell 8 cents to 78.5 cents yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline prices touched $3.1783 a gallon at 9:17 a.m., then
narrowed gains after the release of the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment
index for March showed a decline to 71.8, the lowest level since
December 2011, from 77.6 in February. Equities fell after the
report.  Battered Market  “Consumer sentiment is not good and equity markets went
down with it,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market
continues to get battered back and forth by the economic numbers
that come out. And this is the volatile season for gasoline.”  Heating oil for April delivery gained 0.95 cent to $2.939 a
gallon on volume that was 29 percent below the 100-day average
for the time of day. Prices dropped 1.2 percent this week and
have fallen four of the past five weeks.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to
$3.695 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 12.6
cents below a year ago and have dropped 9.1 cents from the year-
to-date high of $3.786 on Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
