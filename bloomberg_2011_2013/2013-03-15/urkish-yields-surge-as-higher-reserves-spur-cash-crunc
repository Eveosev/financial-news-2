Turkish  yields  rose to as high as 6
percent for the first time since January as banks sold bonds to
deposit higher  reserve requirements  at the central bank.  Yields on two-year notes jumped 13 basis points earlier
today and traded 6 basis points higher at 5.93 percent at 1:32
p.m. in Istanbul, the highest since Jan. 28 as the central bank
raised lender’s reserve requirements effective from today.  “Cash is tight in the market because it is the first day
of reserve payments,” said Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager at
Garanti  Asset Management (APAM)  in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  The Turkish central bank raised on Feb. 19 reserve
requirement ratio by 25 basis points on banks’ lira liabilities
of as long as one year as it seeks to curtail loan growth to 15
percent from 20 percent. The measure will drain about 320
million liras ($177 million), $200 million of gold and $430
million from the market, as banks have options to keep lira
reserves in gold, dollars and euros, it said. The reserve
requirement ratio on banks’ foreign-currency liabilities of as
long as three years was also raised 50 basis points to withdraw
$940 million.  The central bank lent banks 6.5 billion liras in one-week
repo and 1.5 billion liras in one-month repo, after getting bids
of 13 billion liras and 6.53 billion liras, respectively, today.  Next week’s debt sales are also contributing to the
increase in yields today, said Bilgi. “People are selling the
benchmark bonds and the back-end of the curve in particular
because auctions are starting next week.”  The Treasury is seeking to raise 38.5 billion liras ($21
billion) in March, April and May in the biggest three-month
borrowing program since early 2011 to service 43.7 billion liras
of domestic debt falling due. It will hold four domestic
borrowing auctions next week, including two-year and 10-year
debt, after selling 1.61 billion liras of 15-month zero-coupon
bonds this week.  The lira weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8104 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
