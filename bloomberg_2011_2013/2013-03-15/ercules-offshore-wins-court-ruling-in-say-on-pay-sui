Hercules Offshore Inc. (HERO) , a drilling-
rig supplier, won the dismissal of a lawsuit challenging its
executive pay decisions that a judge said was based on “flawed
premises.”  A shareholder, Pinchus E. Raul, sued the Houston-based
company in 2011 in federal court in Delaware saying the board
wrongly ignored an investor vote for “say on pay” that
rejected increases in executive compensation, including a raise
to $2.5 million in 2010 from $1.3 million for Chief Executive
Officer John T. Rynd.  The claims are based on “flawed premises,” U.S. District
Judge Leonard P. Stark wrote in an opinion yesterday dismissing
the case.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010 requires publicly traded companies to request
shareholder approval of compensation for executive officers,
Stark said. The votes aren’t binding and shouldn’t be seen “as
overruling a decision by a company or its board of directors,”
he said.  Hercules Offshore operates a fleet of more than 100 utility
boats and provides drilling, boat and barge services in the  Gulf
of Mexico ,  Latin America , the  Middle East , Africa and Asia. The
company said Feb. 27 that it agreed to buy a boat in Cameroon
from  KS Energy Ltd. (KST)  for $42 million.  Son Vann, a Hercules spokesman, and Eduard Korsinsky, a
plaintiff’s lawyer, didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment on the ruling.  The case is Raul v. Rynd, 11-cv-00560, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
