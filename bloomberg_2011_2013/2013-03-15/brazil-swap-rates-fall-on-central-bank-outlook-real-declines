Brazil ’s swap rates dropped as
central bank minutes indicating an increase in borrowing
costs isn’t imminent overshadowed the fastest monthly economic
growth in almost five years.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 8.57 percent at 12:06 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, erasing an earlier increase and extending the weekly
decline to nine basis points. The real dropped 0.3 percent to
1.9768 per dollar and has fallen 1.7 percent since March 8, the
biggest five-day loss since November.  “At first, the swap rates reacted to the economic activity
indicator, but now the message from the central bank minutes is
prevailing,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil in Sao Paulo. “The swap rates curve previously
priced in a big rate hike in April, and the central ban made
clear that it won’t raise rates now.”  The central bank said in minutes of last week’s meeting,
published yesterday, that a “cautious management of monetary
policy” is needed. Policy makers held the target lending  rate 
at a record low 7.25 percent on March 6 and eliminated
a pledge made in October to leave borrowing costs unchanged for
a “prolonged” period.  Brazil’s seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a
proxy for gross domestic product, climbed 1.29 percent in
January after falling 0.45 percent in the prior month,
the central bank reported today. The increase was the biggest
since June 2008 and exceeded the 0.8 percent median forecast of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
