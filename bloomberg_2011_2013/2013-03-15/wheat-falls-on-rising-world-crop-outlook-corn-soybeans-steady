Wheat fell, halting the longest
rally since July, on speculation that a rebound in global output
will reduce demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest
shipper. Corn and soybeans were little changed.  Soft-wheat production in the European Union may rise 2.6
percent to 127.77 million metric tons, the Brussels-based grain-
industry lobby Coceral said today. SovEcon raised its Russian
grain-crop forecast to 84 million to 89 million tons from 80
million to 87 million last month and up from 70.9 million a year
ago.  “Global wheat production will be higher this year,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief feed-grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Weather appears more
conducive for producing bigger crops.”  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$7.2125 a bushel at 11:02 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price rose in the previous six sessions.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $7.17 a
bushel in Chicago.  Soybean futures for May delivery climbed less than 0.1
percent to $14.3575 a bushel on the CBOT.  U.S. export  sales  of soybeans for delivery before Aug. 31
increased 68 percent from a week earlier to 657,724 metric tons
in the week ended March 7, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said yesterday. At major ports in  Brazil , 195 ships set to haul
soybeans and oilseed products were berthed, arrived or expected
as of yesterday, 14 more than a week ago, SA Commodities and
Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
