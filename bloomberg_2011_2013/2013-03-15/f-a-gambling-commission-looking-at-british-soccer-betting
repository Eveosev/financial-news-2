English soccer’s governing body and
Britain’s Gambling Commission are looking into suspicious
betting on games in one of the nation’s lower divisions.  The  Football Association  has been made aware of the
activity involving games in the sixth-tier  Football Conference 
South Division, the group said today in a  statement , without
giving specific details.  The governing body is contacting all 22 clubs in the league
to ask each to remind players and officials of their
responsibility under the F.A.’s betting-and-integrity rules.
Anyone with information regarding possible breaches of these
rules is being urged to come forward to either the F.A. or
Gambling Commission, the soccer body said.  The F.A. also said it and the commission are continuing to
work to further assess the evidence regarding the suspicious
betting.  The U.K. investigation comes among wider concerns about
match-fixing in soccer. Last month, FIFA, the sport’s global
governing body, suspended people in Italy,  South Korea  and  China 
for involvement in match-fixing.  Later in February, the Europol police agency said a
Singapore-based operation tried to fix games across Europe,
including  World Cup  and European Championship qualifiers, to
generate more than 8 million euros ($10.5 million) in profit.  An 18-month investigation, Operation VETO, found 425 match
officials, club executives, players and criminals in 15
countries worked to cheat in more than 380 matches, with another
300 targeted in other regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
