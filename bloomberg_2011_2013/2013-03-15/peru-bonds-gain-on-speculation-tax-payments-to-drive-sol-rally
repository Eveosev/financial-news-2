Yields on  Peru ’s benchmark bonds
due in 2020 fell as investors bought the securities on a bet the
currency will appreciate as companies sell dollars to make tax
payments.  The yield fell four basis points to 3.78 percent, the
lowest in a week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
sol closed little changed at 2.593 per  U.S. dollar , according to
prices from Datatec, close to the two-week high reached
yesterday.  “We have seen renewed demand for sovereign bonds this week
on expectations of a moderate appreciation in the sol because of
the tax payment period,” said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at
Scotiabank Peru SA.  Peruvian companies have until March 21 to make monthly tax
payments and until early April to meet their obligations for the
2012 tax year.  The central bank has been buying dollars to slow the
appreciation of the sol. The central bank bought $100 million
today at an average of 2.5929 per dollar, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
