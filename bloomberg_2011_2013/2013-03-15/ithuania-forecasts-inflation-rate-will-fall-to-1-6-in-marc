Lithuanian inflation under European
Union methodology will probably slow in March to 1.6 percent
from a year earlier, compared with 2.3 percent in February.  Consumer prices may increase 0.2 percent from the previous
month as clothing and footwear retailers unveil their spring
collections, the statistics office, based in the capital,
Vilnius, said today in a statement on its website.  Lithuania’s 12-month average inflation rate, as measured by
the EU’s harmonized consumer-price index, will probably be 2.8
percent in March, down from 3.0 percent in February, the office
said.  The Baltic nation’s government is seeking to slow inflation
to below an EU limit, which is based on the 12-month average
inflation rate, in order to quality for euro adoption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
