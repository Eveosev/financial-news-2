Martin De Ville, formerly a trader
of securitized assets at  UBS AG (UBSN) , has joined  Cantor Fitzgerald  &
Co. in  London  as managing director of its European debt capital
business.  De Ville will focus on U.K. prime residential mortgage-
backed securities and European consumer and sterling fixed-rate
asset-backed securities, Sheryl Lee, a spokeswoman for Cantor
Fitzgerald in New York, said in an e-mail.  The New York-based securities brokerage firm hired De Ville
as soaring demand for core European securitized debt drives down
yields. Investors demand a premium of 62 basis points to hold
senior bonds backed by U.K. prime home loans over government
debt, the tightest spread in more than five years, according to
data from JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Asset-backed securities pool home and consumer loans that
can be sold to investors as notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
