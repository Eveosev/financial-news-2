Bovespa stock-index futures
advanced as higher commodities prices boosted the outlook for
Brazilian raw-material producers.  Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia (MRVE3)  & Participacoes SA may move
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that trailed analysts’
forecasts. Paper maker  Klabin SA (KLBN4)  may be active after its credit
rating was raised to investment grade by Standard & Poor’s.  Bovespa-index  futures contracts  expiring in April advanced
0.1 percent to 57,440 at 9:07 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
climbed 0.1 percent to 1.9700 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24 raw materials added 0.7 percent as industrial
metals climbed on signs of faster economic growth in the U.S.  Consumer stocks may move as Brazil’s seasonally adjusted
economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product,
rose 1.29 percent in January from a month earlier, the country’s
central bank said today. The number was higher than predicted by
all but one of 21 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg, with the
median forecast for a 0.8 percent rise. The figure for December
was revised to a contraction of 0.45 percent from an increase of
0.26 percent.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  has dropped 9.5 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil,  Russia , India and China
has slid 4 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.6 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.76 billion
reais ($3.94 billion) yesterday, which compares with a daily
average of 7.6 billion reais this year through March 13,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
