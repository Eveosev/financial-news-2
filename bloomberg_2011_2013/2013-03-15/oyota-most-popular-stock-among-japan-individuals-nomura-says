Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest automaker, is the most popular stock among Japanese
individual investors, according to a  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) 
survey.  Toyota was the top pick for 140 respondents, the highest
number since June 2007, when  Japan ’s biggest brokerage started
polling retail investors, Nomura spokesman Kenji Yamashita said.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  and  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)  ranked
second and third, respectively.  The monthly survey was held March 4 to March 5, targeting
24,000 individuals. Nomura then chooses 3,000 investors at
random, and picks the first 1,000 responses, it said.  Toyota  shares  have risen 25 percent this year, compared
with the 21 percent gain by the nation’s benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
