India’s bonds advanced for a second
day on speculation the slowest economic growth in a decade will
spur the central bank to cut  interest rates .  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
25 basis points to 7.5 percent on March 19, according to 24 of
27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Three expect no change.
Weakening growth, the government’s adherence to its fiscal-
deficit target, easing  core inflation  and a narrowing trade
deficit will provide “enough space” for cutting rates, said
Standard Chartered Plc analysts including Anubhuti Sahay.  “On the back of rate-cut expectations, we recommend that
investors stay long on 10-year  government bonds ,” Mumbai-based
Sahay wrote in a research note.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.85 percent as of
9:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate rose one basis point this week.  Asia’s third-largest  economy  will expand 5 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 6.2 percent in the
prior 12 months, the  Central Statistical Office  said last month.
That would be the slowest pace since 2003.  The government has “firmly embraced” fiscal
responsibility, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said this week,
after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram vowed on Feb. 28
to cut the budget  deficit  by 0.4 percentage point to 4.8 percent
of gross domestic product in the year starting April 1.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.53 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
