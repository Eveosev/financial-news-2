Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest clothing retailer, reported sales that dropped
more than analysts anticipated.  Revenue from stores and operations open at least a year
dropped 3 percent, the Stockholm-based company said today,
exceeding the SME consensus of a 1.9 percent drop.  H&M, the purveyor of 10-euro ($13) studded T-shirts, is
trying to expand its customer base by diversifying its brand
portfolio. To compete with Spain’s  Inditex SA (ITX) , H&M is bringing
the more upscale ‘& Other Stories’ brand to 10 European markets.
After earlier overtaking H&M by total sales, Inditex last year
also passed H&M by market value as its shares surged 67 percent,
outpacing the Swedish clothing company’s 1.5 percent gain.  Revenue including value added taxes rose 2 percent to 33.1
billion kronor ($5.2 billion) in the three months through
February, H&M said today. The total number of outlets increased
to 2,818 as of Feb. 28 compared with 2.491 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
