Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s commercial vehicles
division plans to strengthen its position this year in the
declining European market and grow its global market share.  “We aim to exploit all growth potentials in  Europe  and
secure our top position,” Eckhard Scholz, the unit’s head, said
in the text of a speech to be delivered at today’s annual press
conference in Hanover,  Germany . The unit’s deliveries in the
first two months declined 6.6 percent to 74,400 vehicles.  Volkswagen is forging an alliance between the commercial
vehicles unit and heavy truckmakers MAN SE and  Scania AB (SCVB) , which
it also controls, and has promoted former Scania CEO Leif Oestling to oversee the collaboration. To counter the European
slump, the division is looking at expanding in new markets such
as  China  or North America.  VW is developing its own Crafter model, Schulz said, adding
that there’s no decision yet where it will be built. The current
Crafter, together with the Sprinter van, is built by Daimler AG.
The contract runs out at the end of 2016.  Operating profit declined 6.1 percent to 421 million euros
($548 million) as revenue climbed 5.2 percent to 9.45 billion
euros. The percentage of profit to sales contracted to 4.5
percent from 5.0 percent. The unit delivered 550,370 vehicles in
2013, an increase of 4.1 percent, on demand for the Amarok pick-
up.  Deliveries of the Amarok pick-up increased 27 percent to
84,100 vehicles last year. The Crafter delivery van posted
49,200 deliveries, an increase of 24 percent. The T5 transporter
was the best-selling model with 160,300 deliveries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
