The  Philadelphia Eagles  moved
training camp to their home stadium and practice facility, the
first time in 70 years that they will stage preseason in the
city.  The move ends the team’s 17-year run of preparing for the
National Football League season at  Lehigh University  in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  The Eagles became the 21st NFL franchise to move training
camp back to their own facility, the  team said  on its website.  The team will hold practices both at Lincoln Financial
Field and the NovaCare Complex, its training facility near the
stadium in South Philadelphia.  “The interaction with our fans during the training-camp
period remains a huge priority,” team President Don Smolenski
said in a statement. “As such, we are currently planning to
utilize the opportunities available to us at Lincoln Financial
Field to have a number of open practices (which will be free)
available to all of our fans.”  The Eagles’ final year at Lehigh was marked by the drug-
overdose death of Garrett Reid, a son of then-coach  Andy Reid ,
in a university dorm room. Andy Reid was fired after the team
went 4-12 last season and was succeeded by Chip Kelly.  The Eagles last held training camp in Philadelphia in 1943
at St. Joseph’s University. They’ve been at Lehigh since 1996,
while other locations include West Chester University (1980-95),
 Widener University  (1973-79), Albright College (1968-72) and
Hershey, Pennsylvania (1951-67).  To contact the reporter on this story:
