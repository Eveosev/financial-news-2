Consolidated Water Co. (CWCO) , the largest
seawater desalination plant operator in the Caribbean, reported
a 52 percent increase in profit, buoyed by bulk water sales and
the expansion of the Blue Hills facility in the Bahamas.  Net income rose to $9.3 million in 2012 compared with $6.1
million a year earlier, the Georgetown, Cayman Islands-based
water company that trades on the  Nasdaq  said in a statement. The
Blue Hills plant in Nassau is the biggest seawater reverse-
osmosis facility operating in the Bahamas.  The company, whose management is based in Grand Cayman and
Florida, said itâ€™s pursuing new projects that include a proposed
100 million gallon per day water-purifying plant in Baja
California, Mexico, and is nearing completion of its first
desalination facility in Bali, Indonesia.  Consolidated Water operates water production and
distribution facilities in the  Cayman Islands , the British
Virgin Islands, Bahamas and Belize. It produces about 27 million
gallons of drinking water a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
