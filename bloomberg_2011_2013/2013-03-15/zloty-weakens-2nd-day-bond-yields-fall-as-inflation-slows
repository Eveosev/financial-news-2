Poland’s currency headed for the
lowest close in more than two weeks after a sharper-than-
expected slowdown in price growth fueled bets record-low
 interest rates  will be reduced further.  The zloty depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.1620 against the
euro at 10:15 a.m. in Warsaw today, after weakening 0.5 percent
yesterday, the most among emerging-market currencies after  South
Korea ’s won. Two-year bond  yields  fell for a fourth day,
dropping one basis point to 3.27 percent.  The currency’s decline is “the aftermath of lower CPI and
fears of new rate cuts,” Karol Zaluski, ING Bank Slaski’s chief
foreign exchange dealer, said by e-mail today. “The relatively
weak current account and expectations of weak data in the
future” adds to the negative picture, he said.  Polish  consumer prices  rose 1.3 percent in February from a
year earlier, the smallest advance since October 2006, missing
the 1.5 percent median estimate from a Bloomberg survey of 36
economists. Poland’s  current account  deficit widened to 1.5
billion euros in January from 1.2 billion euros in the prior
month.  The  Finance Ministry  is due to publish budget data at about
3 p.m. in Warsaw. Next week Poland’s  Central Statistics Office 
will publish data on February wages, industrial output and
retail prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
