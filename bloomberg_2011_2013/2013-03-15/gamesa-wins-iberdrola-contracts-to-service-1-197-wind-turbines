Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , the
biggest Spanish wind-turbine maker, won deals with  Iberdrola SA (IBE) 
to service 1,197 of the machines in Spain, Portugal and Hungary.  The three-year contracts cover 1,143 two-megawatt Gamesa
turbines across 80 parks on the Iberian peninsula and another 54
in three Hungarian farms, the Zamudio-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement, without giving its value.  Gamesa is expanding its servicing under a strategy that
includes cutting 100 million euros ($131 million) of fixed costs
and closing more than a third of its offices through 2015.  The contracts “reinforce Gamesa’s presence in the activity
of operation and maintenance, a key area for the potential
growth of the company,” it said. Gamesa now has deals to
maintain about 6,000 megawatts of turbines for Iberdrola.
Worldwide it maintains 19,000 megawatts for 180 clients.  Iberdrola owns about 19 percent of Gamesa, according to
 shareholding  data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
