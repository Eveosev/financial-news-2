The U.K. needs to provide an extra
256,000 school places, including 240,000 at primary schools, for
the 2014-15 academic year, the  National Audit Office  said.  A rise in the number of babies born between 2001 and 2011
has led to increased demand, outstripping the 81,500 extra
places provided in the past two years, the spending watchdog
said in a report published in London today. Primaries are the
British equivalent of elementary schools. The  Department for
Education  used incomplete information to assess requirements,
the NAO said.  “The department needs a better understanding of costs to
improve value for money, as well as a better understanding of
the impact its funding contribution is having on the ground,”
Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said in an e-mailed statement.  More than 20 percent of schools were full or had more
children than intended in May last year, and the number of
infant classes with more than 31 children has doubled since
2007, the NAO said. About 37 percent of the primary places
needed are in  London .  The Department for Education assessed the cost in 2010 of
providing 324,000 school places at 5 billion pounds ($7.5
billion), including contributions from local governments. That
estimate failed to account for the cost of land acquisition and
assumed that most places would be provided by extending existing
schools, the NAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
