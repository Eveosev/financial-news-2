Italy ’s  10-year bonds  advanced for
a second day after  Europe ’s leaders signaled they would give the
region’s most-indebted nations more time to bring down their
budget deficits.  Italian  five-year notes  led gains as the nation bought back
government debt maturing in 2015 and 2017. Spain’s 10-year bonds
fell on speculation a rally that pushed yields to the lowest in
more than two years this week was excessive. German bunds were
poised for a weekly gain after a euro-area report showed the
inflation rate fell for a second month.  “Italy is up a touch, which I would primarily attribute to
the leeway being given by the European council to  France  and
Italy to spend a bit more on capital investments and
infrastructure, which takes the edge off the austerity
element,” said  Marc Ostwald , a rates strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in  London . “Italy is outperforming largely on
the back of the short-end buyback.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.60 percent at 11:44 a.m. London time
after dropping two basis points yesterday. The 5.5 percent bond
due November 2022 gained 0.37, or 3.70 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 107.335.  The nation’s five-year yield declined six basis points to
3.31 percent.  European Union leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels
yesterday endorsed “structural” budgetary assessments, using
code for granting countries such as France, Spain and Portugal
extra time to trim their deficits. They are meeting again today.  Flexibility ‘Necessary’  “If there is too much austerity, there will be too much
unemployment,” French President  Francois Hollande  said at the
summit yesterday. “Flexibility is necessary if we want to make
growth the priority.”  Spain’s 10-year bond  yield  climbed three basis points to
4.89 percent after falling to 4.70 percent on March 12, the
lowest since November 2010.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.48 percent,
having dropped five basis points this week.  The euro-area inflation rate fell to 1.8 percent in
February from 2 percent the previous month, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said. The annual core inflation
rate held at 1.3 percent.  Italian bonds returned 0.4 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 1.1 percent, while Germany’s fell 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
