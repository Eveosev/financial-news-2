The ratio of Canadian household
debt to disposable income rose to another record last quarter,
calling into question Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney ’s
assertion that families are listening to his warnings about the
risks of borrowing too much.  Credit-market debt such as mortgages rose to 165.0 percent
of disposable income, compared with 164.7 percent in the prior
three-month period, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  In his previous two policy statements, Carney weakened
language about the need to raise the central bank’s 1 percent
policy interest rate, partly on evidence a housing boom was
slowing and consumer debt burdens are stabilizing. Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules in July on
concern some regional housing markets were overheating.  National net worth rose 1 percent to C$6.87 trillion ($6.73
trillion) in the fourth quarter,  Statistics Canada  said. On a
per capita basis the increase was to C$195,900 from C$194,300.  To contact the reporter on this story:
