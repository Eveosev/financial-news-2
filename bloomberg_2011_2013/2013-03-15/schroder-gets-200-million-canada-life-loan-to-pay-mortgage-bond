Schroder Real Estate Investment
Trust Ltd. (SREI)  is borrowing about 130 million pounds ($197 million)
from Canada Life Investments to repay debt packaged into a
mortgage-backed bond named Real Estate Capital (Foundation).  The 15-year property loan expects to pay an interest rate
of about 5 percent, according to a statement from the Guernsey-
based company. The outstanding loan will be repaid next month,
more than a year before it matures in July 2014.  Property firms in  Europe  are turning to insurers and bond
investors to raise money, as banks cut lending to the sector.
The shift is an opportunity for these investors to get higher
returns than offered by government debt.  Real Estate Capital (Foundation), also known as REC 3, is a
single-loan commercial mortgage-backed security secured by 53
U.K. properties, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
CMBS was first sold to bond investors in 2005, the data show.  Dido Laurimore, a spokeswoman for Schroder Property
Investment Management, has said previously the loan was part of
REC 3 CMBS.  Canada Life is a unit of  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , the
countryâ€™s second-largest insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
