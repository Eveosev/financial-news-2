Jefferies Finance LLC, a
commercial-finance company linked to  Jefferies Group LLC (JEF) , plans
to raise $500 million with a sale of seven-year notes.  Jefferies Finance intends to issue the senior securities
for general corporate purposes, according to a person familiar
with the offering who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. Jefferies Group, the New York-
based investment bank, created the firm as a joint venture in
2004 with Babson Capital Management LLC and Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Co., according to a January regulatory filing.  The company originates and syndicates primarily secured
loans to corporate borrowers. Loans are mostly originated
through Jefferiesâ€™s investment banking business, with Babson
Capital providing credit analytics and portfolio management
services, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
