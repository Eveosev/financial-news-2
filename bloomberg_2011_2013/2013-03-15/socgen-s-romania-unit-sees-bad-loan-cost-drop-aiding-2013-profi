BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA (BRD)  said
it sees bad-loan costs declining “significantly” this year
from a peak in 2012, helping  Romania ’s second-largest bank
return to profitability.  Bucharest-based BRD plans to improve its cost-income ratio,
a measure of bank profitability, by bringing it down 1
percentage point to 45.5 percent, according to its  2013 budget
plan  posted on its website today. Shareholders are expected to
vote on the plan in a general meeting on April 18.  BRD posted its first loss last year since at least 2003,
according to  stock exchange data , mainly because of a 62 percent
jump in bad-loan charges as a stagnating economy made it
difficult for citizens to repay loans. The Romanian banking
industry posted the third consecutive year of losses in 2012.  “Last year was an accident and the losses must remain
exceptional,” BRD Chief Executive Officer Philippe Lhotte said
at a news conference on Feb. 13, when he presented the bank’s
2012 earnings.  The bank targets a 2 percent growth rate in net banking
income, its main source of revenue, this year, after posting a 6
percent decline in 2012, according to the budget plan. Operating
expenses are expected to remain stable this year, while the bank
plans to “adjust its network size in a pragmatic manner” and
close 30 branches in 2013.  BRD plans to raise funds from the market through its 3
billion-euro ($3.9 billion) medium-term notes program, which is
valid until 2015, “if conditions are favorable enough” and to
increase deposits to diversify its funding sources, the budget
plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
