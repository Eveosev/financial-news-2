Bear Stearns, the investment bank
acquired by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in 2008, won an appeal
overturning a ruling that certified a class of plaintiffs in a
lawsuit over its work for a brokerage accused of fraud.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  New York  ruled today the class
of plaintiffs didn’t show wrongdoing by Bear Stearns. The case
relates to Bear Stearns’s work as a clearing broker for Sterling
Foster & Co., a brokerage accused of manipulating stock prices.  “The Levitt plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence at
the class certification stage that indicates that Bear Stearns
directed or instigated sham or fraudulent trades, or that it
otherwise departed from the performance of normal clearing
functions,” the panel of judges said in the ruling.  Brokers at Sterling Foster duped investors out of more than
$70 million in what prosecutors described as one of the most
successful boiler rooms in history. Randolph Pace, who secretly
controlled the firm, was sentenced to more than eight years in
prison. More than a dozen Sterling Foster brokers were also sent
to jail.  “It’s a very sad decision that they would in effect ignore
the overwhelming facts in this case that were shown,” the
plaintiffs’ lawyer, Leslie Trager, said in a phone interview.  The case is Levitt v. J.P. Morgan Securities, 10-4596,  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
