A unit of  Bayer AG (BAYN) , Germany’s
largest drugmaker, sued  India ’s Glenmark Generics Ltd. seeking
to stop sales of a generic form of its  Finacea  gel used to treat
 rosacea .  Glenmark, based in Mumbai, is seeking U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval for a generic version of the drug before
Bayer’s patent expires in 2018, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Plaintiffs will suffer “irreparable harm for which they
have no adequate remedy at law” unless Glenmark is prohibited
from using the technology before the patent expires, Bayer said
in court papers.  “Based on available information, Glenmark believes it may
be a first applicant” to file for the generic version of
Finacea “and may be entitled to 180 days of generic market
exclusivity,” Glenmark said in a statement today.  Finacea had U.S. sales of about $95 million for the
12 months ending Sept. 30, according to data compiled by  IMS
Health , a provider of health-care information, Glenmark said.  The case is Intendis GMBH v. Glenmark Generics Ltd., 13-cv-
00421, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,534,070.  To contact the reporter on this story:
