The  European Central Bank  said
banks will repay 6.82 billion euros ($8.91 billion) of three-
year loans next week.  Five banks will return 385 million euros borrowed in the
first of the so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operations, and
15 will hand back 6.43 billion euros of the second offering, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That takes the
total amount of money repaid early to 235.8 billion euros, or 23
percent of the overall lending.  The ECB flooded financial markets with three-year loans
totalling more than 1 trillion euros a year ago after banks
stopped lending to each other because of  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Banks now have the option of repaying the loans, which were
offered at the average of the ECB’s  benchmark rate  over their
duration.  The central bank still allows banks to borrow as much money
as they want against eligible collateral for periods of one
week, one month and three months. Its monetary policy “will
remain accommodative for as long as needed,” President  Mario Draghi  said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
