David Warner hit an unbeaten half-
century as  Australia  reached 109 without loss against  India  as
the third cricket Test in Mohali got under way after rain wiped
out day one.  Warner was 54 not out at lunch on day two with fellow
opener  Ed Cowan  on 43 as the touring team scored at three runs
an over in the extended morning session after captain Michael Clarke won the toss.  Trailing 2-0 in the four-match series, Australia made four
changes with Brad Haddin, Steve Smith, Nathan Lyon and Mitchell
Starc coming in for Matthew Wade, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell
and James Pattinson, respectively.  Australia only had 12 players available for selection after
Watson, Pattinson, Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Johnson were
suspended for failing to submit feedback on how they and the
team could improve. Wicketkeeper Wade was ruled out because of
an ankle injury.  India, which would regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy by
avoiding defeat in either of the remaining two matches, handed
opening batsmen Shikhar Dhawan his Test debut in place of the
dropped Virender Sehwag and picked Pragyan Ojha ahead of
Harbhajan Singh.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
