Canadian  stocks  rose for a second
day as rising gold and energy prices sent resource producers
higher.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Suncor Energy Inc.
advanced at least 0.8 percent, as the price of crude rose to a
three-week high. Colossus Minerals Inc. and Banro Corp. gained
more than 4.5 percent after gold headed for a second weekly
rise.  Pacific Rubiales (PRE)  Energy Corp. dropped 4.2 percent as a
Salman Partners Inc. analyst lowered his rating for the stock.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 42.72
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,842.63 at 12:34 p.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX has risen less than 0.1 percent this week, erasing
earlier losses.  “The market today is reflecting higher commodity prices,”
said Michael O’Brien, director and fund manager with TD Asset
Management Inc. in Toronto. He manages about C$3 billion ($2.94
billion). “Whether it’s natural gas, or oil with the
differential narrowing, it’s been helping the gassy and oily
names react positively. With gold, maybe we’ve had the point of
maximum pessimism so there’s room for gold stocks to recover.”  West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 0.2 percent to $93.22
a barrel, as the dollar weakened and inventories fell at a major
storage hub. The U.S. benchmark was on track to settle at its
highest since Feb. 20. Natural gas jumped to a 16-week high,
heading for a fourth straight weekly gain, on speculation that a
late cold blast will boost heating demand.  Energy Rallies  Energy shares rose the  most  in the S&P/TSX, advancing 0.9
percent as a group. Six of 10 groups in the benchmark index
advanced. Trading volume was 18 percent higher than the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  Suncor Energy added 1.3 percent to C$31.91 and Canadian
Natural Resources increased 0.8 percent C$33.53.  Encana Corp. (ECA) , the nation’s largest natural gas producer,
rose 1.7 percent to C$20.78. Crew Energy Inc., an oil and
natural gas company, increased 7.4 percent to C$6.99.  Colossus Minerals jumped 12 percent to C$3.25 and Banro
climbed 4.5 percent to C$2.10. Gold rose 0.1 percent to
$1,592.10 an ounce in New York. The metal has added 1 percent
this week, with demand rising as a hedge against inflation.  Pacific Rubiales lost 4.2 percent C$22.42 after Justin Anderson, analyst with Salman Partners, lowered the stock’s
rating to hold from buy and decreased his price target to C$25
from C$32.  Latin America’s largest non-state oil producer by market
capitalization yesterday reported adjusted  earnings  of 13 cents
a share, lower than the 60 cents expected from seven analysts
