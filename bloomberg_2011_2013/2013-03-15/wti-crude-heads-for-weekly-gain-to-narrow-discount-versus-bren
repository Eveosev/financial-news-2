West Texas Intermediate crude
gained for the sixth time in seven days as the dollar weakened
and inventories fell at a major storage hub. The U.S. benchmark
narrowed its discount to  Brent crude  for a fifth week.  WTI rose to a three-week high as the dollar slid to a one-
week low against the euro after a report showed U.S. inflation
is contained. Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , decreased last
week to the lowest level since December, according to the Energy
Information Administration. Futures pared their advance as U.S.
stocks retreated after an index of  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly slipped.  “WTI’s been holding strong and the Brent-WTI spread is a
big mover here,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist
at commodities trading firm Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “It’s a
currency trade. The confidence number and the equities are
putting pressure on oil.”  Futures for April delivery rose 42 cents to $93.45 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Feb. 20. Prices gained 1.6 percent this week. Volume was
3.3 percent below the 100-day average for the time of day at
2:35 p.m.  Brent for May delivery gained 86 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$109.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 6.5 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent Spread  The May Brent contract was $16 more expensive than WTI
futures for the same month. April Brent expired yesterday at
$109.42 a barrel, $16.39 higher than the same-month WTI
contract.  The gap between Brent and WTI will average about $16 this
year and narrow to $9 in 2014 as new pipeline capacity lowers
the cost of moving crude to Gulf Coast refiners from the central
U.S., the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
March 12. The spread will average $7.50 in the second quarter of
this year,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said March 11.  The dollar headed for its first weekly loss against the
euro since the start of February after the Labor Department
reported that U.S. consumer prices increased 2 percent in the 12
months ended in February, after a 1.6 percent year-over-year
gain the prior month.  Fed Meeting  The report showing inflation is contained may give the
Federal Reserve scope to maintain its monetary stimulus program,
known as quantitative easing, when the  Federal Open Market
Committee  meets next week to review policy.  The dollar slipped as much as 0.8 percent today to $1.3107,
the lowest level since March 8. A weaker dollar and stronger
euro increase oil’s appeal as an investment alternative. The
euro also rose as European leaders paved the way for a deal on
financial assistance for Cyprus.  “The dollar is pretty weak and the U.S. market looks a
little tighter after the Cushing inventory report,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “It looks like the path of
least resistance is higher in the short term.”  Stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for  New York  WTI
futures, dropped 1.53 million barrels to 49.3 million last week,
the lowest level since Dec. 21, according to the EIA.  Demand for
gasoline  jumped 3.1 percent to 8.63 million barrels a day, the
most since Nov. 16.  Cushing Stockpiles  “The big drop in Cushing inventories is telling people
that maybe the  bear market  is over,” said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “It does seem like it’s bringing WTI up.”  Confidence among American consumers slumped in March. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary sentiment
 index  fell to 71.8, the lowest level since December 2011, from
77.6 in February. The gauge was projected to increase to 78,
according to the  median  estimate of 67 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  each dropped as much as 0.5 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May slid to 17.4 percent at 3:26 p.m. in New York
from 17.2 percent yesterday. The figures are down from 24.7
percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 435,491
contracts as of 3:26 p.m. It totaled 442,295 contracts
yesterday, 19 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.71 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
