Indonesian  stocks  rebounded for the
first time in four days, as PT  Astra (ASII)  International climbed the
most in two weeks after data showed vehicle sales in the country
advanced last month.  The benchmark Jakarta Composite  Index (JCI)  rose 1.1 percent to
4,837.38 as of 11:01 a.m. local time, snapping a three-day, 1.8
percent slump. The gauge is heading for its steepest increase
since March 6. Astra,  Indonesia ’s largest company by market
value, rose 1.3 percent. PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, the
nation’s biggest telephone company, added 2.8 percent. The two
stocks accounted for almost a third of the index’s gain.  “The rebound happened across the board, led by Telkom
Indonesia,” John Teja, a director at PT Ciptadana Securities,
said by phone. “But it was just a small rebound. The market
still needs to consolidate as it has gained so much this year.”  The Jakarta Composite  surged  12 percent this year, and is
valued at 19.1 times reported earnings. It traded at 19.3 times
profit on March 8, the highest level since December 2010.  Indonesia’s domestic car sales gained to 103,284 units in
February from 96,705 units in the previous month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Motorcycle sales rose to 649,434
units last month compared to 646,082 in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
