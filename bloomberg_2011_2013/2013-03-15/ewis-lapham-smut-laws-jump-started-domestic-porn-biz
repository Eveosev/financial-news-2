The U.S. government cracked down on
the importing of sexy pictures in 1842, adding obscene books in
1857. As a result, Congress jump-started the domestic porn
industry.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  New technologies made it simple to reproduce a single copy
of an illicit text, while photography created life-like sexual
images more cheaply. Railroads and mail deliveries enabled
simpler and easier distribution than ever before.  Congress passed tough new laws in 1873, called the
“Comstock Act,” after anti-vice zealot Anthony Comstock.
Empowered by federal law and made a special agent of the U.S.
Mail, Comstock created sting operations by posing as a customer.  By the time he died in 1915, Comstock had nabbed 4,000 smut
lovers and peddlers. He’d also seized 50 tons of books and 4
million pictures.  I spoke with Peter Andreas, author of “Smuggler Nation:
How Illicit Trade Made America,” on the following topics:  1. Colonial Rum Trade  2. Revolutionary Privateers  3. Illicit Industrial Revolution  4. Prohibition  5. War on Drugs  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
