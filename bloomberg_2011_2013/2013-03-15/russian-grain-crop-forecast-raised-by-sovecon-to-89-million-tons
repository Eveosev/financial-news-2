Russia’s 2013-14 grain crop is
expected to be as much as 89 million metric tons because winter
grains, which make up most of the total crop, are in
“relatively good” condition,  SovEcon  said.  SovEcon raised its forecast to 84 million to 89 million
tons from 80 million to 87 million tons, Andrey Sizov Jr.,
Moscow-based agricultural consultancy SovEcon’s managing
director, said by e-mail today.  Winter grain losses are seen at about 9 percent, compared
with an average 9.5 percent, SovEcon said.  Russia’s grain crop fell by about 25 percent year-on-year
to 70.9 million tons in 2012-13 due to drought, according to the
state statistics data.  The country’s grain exports are expected to fall to 15
million tons in the season ending June 30, from 28 million tons
in 2011-12, Sizov Jr. said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
