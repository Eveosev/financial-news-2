Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the maker
of almost half the cars sold in  India , named Kenichi Ayukawa
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer to succeed Shinzo Nakanishi on his retirement at the month-end.  Ayukawa, a director on Maruti’s  board , led  Suzuki Motor
Corp. (7269) ’s Pakistan unit almost a decade ago, according to the
company’s website.  Ayukawa will take charge at a time when the New Delhi-based
company is struggling with a demand slump that led it to close
one of its factories for a day earlier this month. India’s
annual car sales are poised to decline for the first time in a
decade as faster inflation, slowing economic growth and high
interest rates continue to keep buyers from showrooms, according
to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.  Industrywide local deliveries fell 4.6 percent to 1.71
million cars in the 11 months ended February, according to the
automakers group. Annual deliveries last declined in the year
ended March 2003, the group said. The Indian unit of Suzuki said
March 1 that domestic deliveries fell 9 percent in February, led
by a 16 percent drop in its mini-car sales.  Maruti fell 0.9 percent to 1,406.70 rupees at the close in
Mumbai trading, extending its drop this year to 5.6 percent. The
benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is unchanged in the period.  The carmaker is projected to post a profit of 18.5 billion
rupees in the year ending March 31, according to the median of
nine  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
