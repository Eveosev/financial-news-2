The cost of cocoa butter relative
to beans held steady in  Europe  in the past three weeks after
slumping last month as processing accelerated, according to
three traders with direct knowledge of the sales.  The so-called butter ratio was 1.85 to 1.9 times the cost
of cocoa futures on the NYSE Liffe exchange, said the traders,
who asked not to be identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to
speak to the media. It was 1.8 to 1.85 on Feb. 20 and 2.05 to
2.1 a month earlier.  The ratio jumped 65 percent last year as processors slowed
output, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit of researcher
 Commodities Risk Analysis  in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . It slid
this year after processors including Delfi Cocoa (Europe) GmbH
and Cargill Inc. said they would grind more beans.  While global cocoa production will be little changed at
3.99 million metric tons in the 2012-13 season that started Oct.
1, processing will rise 3.4 percent to 4.05 million tons,
Rabobank International estimates. That will leave the market
with a shortage of 58,000 tons and help lift prices, according
to Keith Flury, an analyst at the bank in  London .  Cocoa for May delivery gained 0.1 percent to 1,443 pounds
($2,189) a ton by 12:34 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
