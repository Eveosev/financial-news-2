Perry Capital LLC asked a judge to
dismiss Solus Alternative Asset Management LP’s lawsuit accusing
Perry of making a “willful breach” of obligations to sell an
interest in $195 million of claims on Bernard L. Madoff’s
estate.  Solus sued Perry for $20 million in July in New York
Supreme Court in  Manhattan , saying the trade was sealed over the
telephone and in Bloomberg LP’s “instant messages.” Rejecting
Solus’s claim that all trades are sealed that way on Wall
Street, Perry said in a letter to a judge yesterday that the
preliminary agreement was always dependent on a final contract,
as it had emphasized to Solus.  “There was no bilateral deal between Solus and Perry,”
because the transaction involved a third party, Deutsche Bank
AG, which hadn’t yet worked out how it would reassign the claims
to Solus after previously pledging them to Perry, the hedge fund
said.  In the letter to Judge Barbara Kapnick, Perry cited
evidence produced in the case by Solus, including three
recorded phone calls between Perry and Deutsche Bank about the
three-party transaction. Perry used the letter to back up a
previous bid to get the suit dismissed.  The case is Solus Alternative Asset v. Perry Corp.,
652341/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
