Confidence among American consumers
unexpectedly slumped in March, which may signal a cooling in
spending, the biggest part of the economy.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
sentiment  index  for March fell to 71.8, the lowest level since
December 2011, from 77.6 in February. The gauge was projected to
increase to 78, according to the  median  estimate of 67
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Concern may be starting to mount over the damage that
automatic across-the-board federal spending cuts will cause the
economy and hiring. That may keep tempering optimism created by
record stock prices, a hiring pickup, and a housing rebound that
have so far helped propel bigger-than-forecast gains in
spending.  “There was a little bit of a sequester-news related dip
in confidence,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. Economist at
High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. “Certainly on
the minus side you have fiscal tightening, but on the plus side
you’ve got the improving labor market.”  Forecasts ranged from 70 to 82.5, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The index averaged 64.2 during the recession
ended in June 2009, and 89 in the five years prior to the 18-
month slump.  Shares Fall  Stocks fell after the report. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,557.21 at 10:14 a.m. in New York.  The Michigan survey’s current conditions index, which
measures whether Americans think it’s a good time to make big
investments and gauges consumers’ view of their personal
finances, dropped to a preliminary 87.5 in March from 89 in
February.  The preliminary index of  expectations  six months from now,
which more closely projects the direction of consumer spending,
slumped to 61.7 in March, the lowest since November 2011, from
70.2 the month before.  Consumers in today’s confidence report said they expect an
inflation rate of 3.3 percent over the next 12 months, the same
as in the prior two months. Over the next five years, Americans
expected a 2.9 percent rate of inflation, down from February’s 3
percent.  Today’s report runs counter to other measures. Bloomberg’s
Consumer Comfort Index has risen for six straight weeks to reach
its highest level since April.  Retail Sales  The outlook for confidence may bear on whether recent
strength in spending can be sustained. Retail sales  increased 
1.1 percent in February, double the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the most in five months,
Commerce Department figures showed this week.  A better job outlook may be help underpin spending even as
confidence wanes. Payrolls rose by 236,000 workers in February
and the number of people let go in January dropped to the lowest
level in records going back 12 years, according to figures from
the Labor Department. The jobless rate dropped to a four-year
low of 7.7 percent last month from 7.9 percent.  Also, the housing market rebound is boosting consumers’ net
worth. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 U.S.
cities increased 6.8 percent in December from the same month in
2011, the biggest year-to-year gain since July 2006.  Nonetheless, consumers are contending with a higher payroll
tax. The levy that funds Social Security reverted to its 2010
level of 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent as of January, and an
American who earns $50,000 is taking home about $83 less a month
as a result.  Fuel Costs  Households are also facing higher fuel costs.  The price  of
a gallon of regular gasoline is hovering around $3.70 after
hitting a low of $3.22 on Dec. 19, according to figures from
AAA, the largest U.S. auto group. At the same time, the price
has fallen from a recent high of $3.79 on Feb. 26.  David C. Novak, chief executive officer of Louisville,
Kentucky-based  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , which operates and franchises
restaurants such as Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, said their
research indicates consumers remain uneasy.  “Nobody is really taking a victory lap,” Novak said in a
Mar. 13 presentation. “People want to have confidence, but I
don’t think they necessarily have it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
