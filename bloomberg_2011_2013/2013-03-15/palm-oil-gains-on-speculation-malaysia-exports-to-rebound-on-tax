Palm oil  advanced for the first
time in four days on speculation that exports from  Malaysia  may
climb this month after the government left a tax on shipments
unchanged, potentially reducing stockpiles.  The contract for May delivery surged as much as 1.8 percent
to 2,406 ringgit ($771) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and was at 2,404 ringgit at 4:26 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures, which closed at the lowest level in almost three months
yesterday, are poised to drop 1.8 percent this week.  Malaysia kept the tax at 4.5 percent for April as the
reference price fell in the band for the minimum duty to be
applied, according to a Customs Department  statement . The
government cut the levy to between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent,
from about 23 percent, starting Jan. 1, to clear record reserves.
Shipments were duty-free in the first two months as the
reference price was below the threshold that triggers the tax.  “Stockpiles may fall a bit more by the end of this
month,” said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options
at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We’ll still have
a chance to see improvement in the full-month export figure
because of the additional days” compared to February, he said.  Shipments were little changed at 675,210 tons in the first
15 days of this month, compared with 673,555 tons in the same
period in February, surveyor Intertek said today. Exports fell
14 percent to 1.4 million tons in February for a fourth monthly
decline, while  inventories  dropped to 2.44 million tons, the
board said March 11. Reserves reached an all-time high of 2.63
million tons in December.  Soybean oil  for May delivery climbed 1.1 percent to 49.89
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May delivery gained 0.4 percent to $14.4125 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September advanced 1.6
percent to close at 6,362  yuan  ($1,023) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month
climbed 1.6 percent to end at 8,136 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
