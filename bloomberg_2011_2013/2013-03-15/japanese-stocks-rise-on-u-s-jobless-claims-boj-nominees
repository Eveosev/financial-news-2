Japanese  shares  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average extending a four-and-a-half year high,
after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell and Japan’s upper
house approved Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s nominees to lead the
central bank.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 44 percent of its
sales in  North America , climbed 2.6 percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, jumped 11 percent after
 Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  recommended buying the stock.
AltPlus Inc., which makes social games for smartphones and
tablets, soared 212 percent after going untraded in its debut
yesterday.  The Nikkei 225 added 1.5 percent to 12,560.95 in  Tokyo , the
highest close since Sept. 8, 2008. The gauge capped a 2.3
percent advance this week for a second week of gains. The
broader  Topix (TPX)  Index advanced 1.3 percent to 1,051.65, with more
than three stocks rising for each that fell.  “Confidence is rising about the  U.S. economy  on strong
economic data,” said Kenichi Kubo, a senior  fund manager  at
Tokio Marine Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5
trillion yen ($52 billion). “I’m hearing talk of a possible
emergency meeting for the  Bank of Japan. (8301)  If it happens, it could
introduce drastic measures.”  The Topix rallied 46 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that returned Abe to power, fueling optimism the
new government will do more to beat deflation. The gauge is
trading at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.3 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BOJ Leadership  Haruhiko Kuroda was confirmed as central bank governor by
the upper house today following approval by the lower house
yesterday, with Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso to serve as
deputy governors. Sitting BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his
deputies step down on March 19. The next central bank policy
meeting is scheduled for April 3-4. Kuroda has pledged to do
whatever it takes to end 15 years of deflation.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent today. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  yesterday extended its longest
rally since 1996 as Labor Department data showed the number of
Americans filing for initial  unemployment benefits  dropped last
week to the lowest level in almost two months.  Exporters to the U.S. gained, with Honda adding 2.6 percent
to 3,820 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory robotics that gets
14 percent of its sale in North America, rose 2.1 percent to
14,410 yen.  Sony Jumps  Sony surged 11 percent to 1,668 yen after its rating was

untraded in its debut yesterday.  Nippon Meat Packers Inc. jumped 6.5 percent to 1,552 yen,
the highest since October 2008. Prime Minister Abe may sacrifice
protections for  Japan ’s beef and wheat farmers as he joins the
Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, said a former government
adviser on farm policy.  Shipping lines rose the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups on the TPP negotiations and as the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a
measure of shipping costs for commodities, added 0.6 percent
yesterday.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
