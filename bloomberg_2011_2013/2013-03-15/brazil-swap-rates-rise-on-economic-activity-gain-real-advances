Brazil ’s swap rates climbed after a
gauge of the nation’s economy had its biggest increase in almost
five years, bolstering speculation that the central bank will
raise borrowing costs to contain inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2016 rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 9.12 percent at 10:04 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, extending their increase this week to five basis points.
The real gained 0.1 percent to 1.9692 per dollar, paring its
drop since March 8 to 1.3 percent, still the biggest five-day
decline since November.  “The market is looking at monthly economic activity, which
was above expectations, and caused swap rates to rise,” Luiz Eduardo Portella, managing partner at Modal Asset Management in
 Sao Paulo , said in a phone interview.  Brazil’s seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a
proxy for gross domestic product, climbed 1.29 percent in
January after falling a revised 0.45 percent in the prior month,
the central bank reported today. The increase was the biggest
since June 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
