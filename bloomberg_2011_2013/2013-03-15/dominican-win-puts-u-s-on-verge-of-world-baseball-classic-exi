The U.S. is on the verge of
elimination from the World Baseball Classic after a 3-1 loss to
the  Dominican Republic , which advanced to the semifinals.  Erick Aybar and  Jose Reyes  had run-scoring singles off
reliever Craig Kimbrel in the ninth inning to give the
Dominicans the win against the U.S. last night in a second-round
game in Miami.  The winner of tonight’s game between the U.S. and Puerto
Rico will join the Dominican Republic, Japan and the Netherlands
in the semifinals.  “Both clubs played well, both clubs had great pitching,
and they beat us,” U.S. manager  Joe Torre  told reporters.
“They earned their victory and they beat a heck of a pitcher
coming out of that bullpen.”  The U.S. played without its hottest hitter, third baseman
 David Wright  of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets. Wright,
who was hitting .438 with a tournament-leading 10 runs batted in,
was scratched from the lineup with sore ribs.  The two Dominican runs in the ninth inning came off the
 Atlanta Braves ’ Kimbrel, who led the National League in saves
the past two seasons. Aybar, who plays for the Los Angeles
Angels, singled as a pinch-hitter to break a 1-1 tie and Reyes
of the Toronto Blue Jays made it 3-1.  Fernando Rodney of the Tampa Bay Rays got three outs in the
bottom of the ninth to save the win for Pedro Strop of the
Baltimore Orioles.  The U.S. scored in the first inning when Eric Hosmer of the
Kansas City Royals walked to force in a run. Hanley Ramirez of
the Los Angeles Dodgers hit a solo home run in the second inning
to tie the score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
