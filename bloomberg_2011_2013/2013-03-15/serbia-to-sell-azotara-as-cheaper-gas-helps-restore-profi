HIP Azotara DOO, a Serb fertilizer
maker controlled by state-run gas monopoly Srbijagas JP,
returned to profit in 2012 after years of losses and will be
sold this year.  “Azotara managed a 78 million-dinar ($909,000) profit for
the first time in 25 years, due to cheaper gas and cost
reduction,”  Srbijagas chief Dusan Bajatovic said at a
conference in Kopaonik yesterday. There are investors interested
in taking over Azotara and it will be sold by the end of 2013,
he said without naming the potential buyers.  Azotara’s 2006 sale to a group of Lithuanian and Serbian
companies failed in 2009 and the government took it back,
allowing Srbijagas to gain control through a debt-for-equity
swap. The Lithuanian investors accused Serbia of violating the
sales contract and sought arbitration before the London-based
 International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ,
which is expected to announce its ruling in April.  -Editor:  To contact the reporters on this story: Misha Savic at
