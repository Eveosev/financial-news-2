Cotton futures jumped to the
highest in 11 months on speculation that  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, will increase imports.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  last week raised its
estimate for Chinese consumption this year to 36 million bales,
up by 1.4 percent from a month earlier. The USDA also boosted
its forecast for the Asian nation’s imports by 7.1 percent. The
Chinese government may boost import quotas by April, Reuters
reported.  “Talk continues of additional Chinese cotton-import quotas
being issued,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior market specialist at
Knight Futures in Roswell, Georgia, said in a report.  Cotton for May delivery advanced 1.8 percent to settle at
92.5 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached 93.93 cents, the highest for a most-
active contract since March 30, 2012. This week, the commodity
soared 6.5 percent, the most in five months.  This year, the fiber has surged 23 percent, the most among
24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. The
cotton increase today led gains in the commodity gauge.  In the week ended March 7, U.S.  exports  of upland cotton
rose 25 percent from a week earlier with demand increasing in
 Turkey ,  Indonesia  and China, the USDA said yesterday.  “Anticipation of, and then confirmation of, continued
strong interest in U.S. cotton” boosted prices, Johnson said.  The U.S. is the top exporter. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or
218 kilograms.  U.S. planting of the fiber may slump 27 percent this year
as farmers shift to more-profitable crops, the National Cotton
Council said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
