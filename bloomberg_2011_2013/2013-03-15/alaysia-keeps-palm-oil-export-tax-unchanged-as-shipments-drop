Malaysia  left the tax on crude palm
oil exports unchanged for April as the world’s second-largest
producer seeks to boost shipments and cut near record
inventories. Futures in Kuala Lumpur rallied.  Shipments will be taxed at 4.5 percent next month, the same
as this month, as the reference price was set at 2,383.84
ringgit ($762) a metric ton, within the minimum band for a levy
to be applied, according to a Customs Department  statement . The
tariff was set at zero in January and February as the reference
price was below the threshold that triggers the tax.  Malaysia said in October it would cut the export tax to
between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent from about 23 percent, to
help trim record stockpiles and compete with  Indonesia , the
largest producer. Futures, which slumped to a three-year low of
2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13, have lost 29 percent in the past year
because of falling demand.  “Palm oil investors are still counting on a seasonal drop
off in production that could ease stocks and support prices,”
Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, director at Mumbai-based Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt., wrote in a report today. “However,
export data remains unimpressive so far. Malaysia’s move to keep
the April CPO export tax rate unchanged may mean a tepid export
demand trend in April.”  Shipments from Malaysia were little changed at 675,210 tons
in the first 15 days of this month from 673,555 tons in the same
period in February, surveyor Intertek said today.  Exports fell 14 percent to 1.4 million tons in February for
a fourth monthly drop and  output  shrank 19 percent to 1.3
million tons, while  inventories  declined to 2.44 million tons,
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said March 11. Reserves reached a
record 2.63 million tons in December. Indonesia raised export
duty to 10.5 percent this month from 9 percent in February.  The contract for delivery in May climbed 2.1 percent to
2,414 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the biggest
gain at close for the most-active price since Feb. 19. Futures
dropped 6.3 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
