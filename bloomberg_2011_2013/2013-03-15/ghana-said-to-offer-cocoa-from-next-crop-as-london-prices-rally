Ghana , the second-biggest cocoa
producer, offered beans from its next crop after prices rose in
 London , according to three traders with direct knowledge of the
sales proposals.  The Ghana Cocoa Marketing Co., which manages sales on
behalf of industry regulator the Ghana Cocoa Board, offered
beans from its 2013-14 crop starting in October this week, said
the traders, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. Futures traded on the NYSE
Liffe exchange in London gained 2.5 percent last week.  Joe Forson, deputy marketing manager at the CMC, declined
to comment when phoned today in  Accra , Ghana. Asante Poku,
deputy chief executive officer in charge of operations at the
Ghana Cocoa Board, said yesterday he had no knowledge of the
sales proposals, when contacted by Bloomberg.  Cocoa purchases from farms in Ghana reached 594,000 tons
since the start of the season through Feb. 28, 17 percent lower
than a year earlier, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit of
researcher Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .  Deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast were 649,249 tons from
Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, according to the government. That’s a
7.5 percent decline from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
