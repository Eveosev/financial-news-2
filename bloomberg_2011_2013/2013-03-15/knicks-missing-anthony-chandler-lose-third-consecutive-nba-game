The  New York Knicks , playing
without leading scorer Carmelo Anthony and All-Star center  Tyson Chandler  because of injuries, lost their third straight game
with a 105-90 defeat at the Portland Trail Blazers in a National
Basketball Association game.  The Trail Blazers (30-34), led by Damian Lillard with 26
points and 10 assists, finished the first half with a 13-0 run
to take a 51-48 halftime advantage on their home court last
night at the Rose Garden and never trailed again. LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points and 10 rebounds.  J.R. Smith had 33 points and Kenyon Martin contributed 12
points for the Knicks.  The Knicks (38-25) had their lead atop the Eastern
Conference’s  Atlantic Division  cut to a game over the Brooklyn
Nets (38-27).  New York  has lost by a total of 67 points while
dropping the first three games of a five-stop western road trip.  Anthony underwent a procedure in New York yesterday to
remove fluid from the back of his right knee. The team said he
had “soft-tissue fluid collection” and no structural damage.  Anthony, who has averaged 27.5 points and 6.2 rebounds this
season, will return to the team March 17 at the  Los Angeles
Clippers , although he may not play until the following day in
Utah.  Chandler missed last night’s game because of a bruised knee
suffered a night earlier in a loss at Denver. Forward Amar’e Stoudemire is out for six weeks following knee surgery.  In San Antonio,  Tim Duncan  had 28 points and 19 rebounds as
the Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks 92-91 to clinch a
playoff berth for the 16th straight year. The team improved to
50-16 to extend its streak of winning at least 50 games to 14
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
