Spain ’s 10-year bonds were set for
a weekly decline as some investors judged gains that pushed
yields to the least in more than two years this week were
excessive amid concern the economy will struggle to grow.  Italy ’s 10-year bonds advanced as a report showed the  euro-
area inflation rate  fell for a second month in February. German
bunds were set for a weekly gain after European Union leaders
meet again today after yesterday endorsing “structural”
budgetary assessments, using code for granting countries such as
France, Spain and Portugal extra time to bring down deficits.  “Challenges in Spain remain in terms of the deficit,
prospects for economic growth are not so positive and the high
 unemployment rate ,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “We cannot say that
Spain will easily decouple from Italy. The rally has been very
strong, especially the outperformance versus Italy.”  Spain’s 10-year  yield  was little changed at 4.85 percent at
10:45 a.m. London time, having climbed nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, this week. The 5.4 percent bond due
January 2023 traded at 104.235. The rate fell to 4.70 percent on
March 12, the least since Nov. 22, 2010.  The yield headed for its first weekly increase since the
period through Feb. 8, when it rose 16 basis points.  Annual consumer-price growth in the 17-nation bloc slowed
to 1.8 percent from 2 percent in January, in line with an
initial estimate on March 1, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today.  Inflation Outlook  The  European Central Bank  last week maintained its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent as
President  Mario Draghi  described the inflation outlook as
“broadly balanced.”  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German securities widened
14 basis points this week to 337 basis points. The spread
narrowed to 320 basis points on March 12, the least since March
21, 2012.  Italian bonds advanced even after a  Bank of Italy  report
showed the nation’s government debt increased in January to a
record 2.02 trillion euros ($2.64 trillion) from 1.99 trillion
euros in December,  Foreign ownership of Italy’s debt rose to 35.1 percent in
December from 34.8 percent in November, the Rome-based central
bank said today in its public-finances supplement.  Italian 10-year yields fell three basis points to 4.61
percent, paring this week’s increase to two basis points.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.48 percent,
leaving it five basis points lower this week.  Spanish bonds returned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 0.1 percent, while Germany’s fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
