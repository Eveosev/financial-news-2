Kazakhstanâ€™s Pavlodar refinery
plans to put red dye in its diesel to discourage thieves.  The plant will color 159,500 metric tons of the fuel,
destined to be sold at a discount to farmers through May,
KazMunaiGaz National Co., which owns the refinery, said in a
statement e-mailed today.  The company took similar measures in 2004 and 2006 when it
found some fuel was stolen and sold at the full market price,
the company said. Diesel fuel naturally ranges in color from
clear to amber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
