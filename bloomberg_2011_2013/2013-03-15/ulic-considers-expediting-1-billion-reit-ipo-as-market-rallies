Hulic Co., a Japanese developer, is
looking to accelerate the listing of a 100 billion yen ($1.04
billion) real estate investment trust as the market gains amid
optimism the government will end deflation and boost the economy.  Hulic had said it plans to list the REIT, which includes
office and commercial buildings in central Tokyo, and nursing
homes, by the middle of 2014. The developer is considering a
listing as early as March next year, said Takaya Maeda, general
manager of business planning department at Tokyo-based Hulic.  “It is possible we may seek an early listing of a REIT in
2014,” said Maeda in an interview on March 13. “We will need
to examine the market conditions.”  The  Tokyo Stock Exchange (1345)  REIT Index, which rose 34 percent
in 2012, has gained 36 percent this year after Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe introduced policies to boost the economy and end
deflation. Funds raised by REITs through public offerings
reached 337.8 billion yen so far this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The total may exceed the 679 billion yen
in 2007 because of measures introduced by the government to
boost the market, said Junichi Tazawa, a REIT analyst at
Barclays Plc in Tokyo.  Hulic, the owner of 163 properties, said it tripled the
number of nursing homes to 17 from six last October. It plans to
sublease the nursing homes to operators in order to receive
stable rental income and avoid operating risks, Maeda said.  Hulic acquired Shoei Co. last year, boosting its leasing
space for office, apartments and nursing homes by 62 percent
after the acquisition, the company said.  J-REITs raised 480 billion yen last year through initial
share sales and additional offerings, according to a report by
Barclays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
