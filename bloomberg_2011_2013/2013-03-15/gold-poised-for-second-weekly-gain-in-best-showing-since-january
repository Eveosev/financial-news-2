Gold futures rose, capping the
biggest weekly gain in two months, as demand improves for the
metal as an inflation hedge, including by retail buyers of
coins, bars and jewelry.  The U.S. consumer-price index rose more than projected in
February after gasoline surged, a government report showed
today. Physical demand remains robust, mainly from the  Far East ,
Afshin Nabavi, a senior vice president at MKS ( Switzerland ) SA,
a metal refiner in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. Gold
is down 5 percent this year.  “Physical demand is providing support after the huge price
slump,” Frank Trotter, the chief executive officer of EverBank
Wealth Management in Jacksonville,  Florida , said in a telephone
interview. “The government is not concerned about inflation,
even though the CPI is rising, and that may be a problem long
term.”  Gold futures for April delivery added 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,592.60 an ounce at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
extending the weekly gain to 1 percent, the most since Jan. 18.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
$28.851 an ounce. Prices are down 4.6 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery gained 0.2 percent to $1,592.40 an ounce, ending
a four-day slide. Prices have risen 3.2 percent this year.  Palladium futures for June delivery jumped 0.6 percent to
$775.65 an ounce, narrowing the week’s loss to 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
