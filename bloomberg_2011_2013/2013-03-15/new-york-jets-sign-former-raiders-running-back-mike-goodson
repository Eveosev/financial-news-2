The  New York  Jets signed former
Carolina and Oakland running back Mike Goodson, two days after
losing  Shonn Greene  to free agency.  Goodson, 25, is entering his fifth year in the National
Football League after playing for the Panthers for three seasons
and the Raiders in 2012. He has gained 772 yards on 160 carries
and caught 59 passes for 524 yards in his career. His deal is
for three years, $6.9 million, according to ESPN, which didn’t
say where it got its information. The Jets didn’t disclose terms
of the contract in its announcement on Twitter.  Greene, who gained more than 1,000 yards each of the past
two seasons, signed with the Tennessee Titans on March 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
