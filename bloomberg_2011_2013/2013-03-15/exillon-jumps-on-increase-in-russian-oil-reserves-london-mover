Exillon Energy Plc (EXI) , a U.K. company
drilling for oil in  Russia , climbed the most in more than 16
months in London trading after saying total production rose 45
percent in 2012 and its reserves beat targets.  Total proven reserves rose 56 percent to 196 million
barrels last year versus 2011, the Isle of Man-based company
said today in a statement. Proven and probable reserves,
referred to as 2P, increased by 96 percent to 520 million
barrels, it said.  “Our target was to double our 2P reserves within three
years,” Mark Martin, Exillon’s chief executive officer, said in
the statement. “We have done this in one year.”   The shares rose 10 percent to close at 162 pence, the
biggest gain since Oct. 28, 2011. That values the company at 262
million pounds ($396 million).  “Exillon has achieved a significant milestone in
approximately doubling its audited 2P reserves well ahead of
schedule,” according to a note by  Investec Plc. (INVP)  “We maintain
our view that Exillon offers investors a low-risk growth story
in geological terms and is well placed financially to grow
production.”  Exillon plans to drill 24 wells this year, 50 percent more
than last year, it said. The company operates in Western Siberia
and Timan Pechora.  To contact the reporter on this story:
