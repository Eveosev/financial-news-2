A fund backed by revenue from
Bangkok’s sky train is raising as much as 62.5 billion baht
($2.1 billion) in  Thailand ’s biggest initial public offering.  BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund is
offering 5.79 billion units at 10.4 baht to 10.8 baht apiece,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The
fund will use the proceeds to buy rights to net fare revenue
from the sky train from parent  BTS Group Holdings Pcl. (BTS)   At $2.1 billion, the deal would surpass Thai Oil Pcl’s
October 2004 IPO, which raised 32.5 billion baht, or about $1.1
billion at current exchange rates, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. BTS Group has climbed 24 percent in Bangkok since Dec. 31,
adding to last year’s 63 percent  rally  and giving the company a
market value of 97.9 billion baht.  “The company has a very good outlook with strong ridership
growth,” Jintana Mekintharanggur, who helps oversee about $170
million as the director of equities investment at Manulife Asset
Management Co. in Bangkok, said today by phone. “The worsening
traffic and network extension will continue to boost passenger
and revenue growth.”  The  BTS sky train , consisting of 32 stations with a
combined track length of 32.7 kilometers (20.3 miles), carried
176 million passengers in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012,
according to the  prospectus . It posted sales of 4.3 billion baht
for the period, up from 3.5 billion baht a year earlier.  BTS plans to use proceeds from its sale of the sky train
fare rights to invest in future mass transit projects as well as
to buy a third of the fund, the document shows.  Thai citizens are driving equity gains as the economy grew
at the fastest pace since at least 1993 in the fourth quarter
and local incomes climb. The  SET Index (SET)  is up 15 percent this
year, beating the  MSCI Southeast Asia Index (MXSO) ’s gain of 4.7
percent, and it was  Asia ’s second-best performing benchmark in
2012 with a 36 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
