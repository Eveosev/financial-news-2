Natural gas jumped to a 16-week
high in  New York , capping its biggest weekly gain in almost two
months, on speculation that a late cold blast heading into
spring will boost heating demand.  Gas rose 1.6 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC said
below-normal temperatures in northern states over the next five
days will spread across the East from March 20 through March 29.
Prices climbed 3.6 percent yesterday as open interest jumped
close to last April’s record after a government report showed a
bigger-than-forecast  supply drop .  “You have the continuation of colder weather expected into
the balance of next week and it looks like the start of April
might also be cooler,” said Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “With that
consistent pattern of colder weather coupled with a heavier-
than-anticipated storage withdrawal last week, you are seeing
some follow-through buying.”  Gas for April delivery rose 6 cents to $3.872 per million
British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Nov. 23. Volume was more than double
the 100-day average at 2:43 p.m. Prices climbed 6.7 percent this
week, the fourth straight gain and the biggest weekly increase
since Jan. 18. Prices are up 70 percent from a year ago.  The discount of April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, narrowed 0.4 cent to 14.1 cents,
smallest differential since Oct. 19.  May $3.40 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They fell 0.5 cent to 1.9 cents per million
Btu on volume of 2,137 contracts as of 2:46 p.m. Puts accounted
for 44 percent of the volume. May $4.35 calls, the second most
active options, gained 0.8 cent to 3.4 cents on volume of 2,062
contracts.  Options Volatility  Implied volatility for at-the-money gas options expiring in
April was 33.87 percent at 3:15 p.m., down from 34.32 percent
yesterday. May options volatility was 31.77 percent, up from
31.19 percent.  The low in  New York City  on March 20 will drop to 28
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), 8 below the usual reading.
 Detroit  may be 8 below normal at 22 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Gas demand typically slumps
between the peak heating-demand season and before hot weather
drives power demand to run air conditioners.  Stockpile Report  Gas stockpiles  fell by 145 billion cubic feet to 1.938
trillion in the week ended March 13, declining below 2 trillion
for the first time since May 2011, the EIA report yesterday
showed. The five-year average drop for the period is 74 billion.  A  surplus  to the five-year average dropped to 11.4 percent
from 14.8 percent the previous week. A  deficit  versus year-
earlier levels widened to 18.5 percent, the most since April
2008, from 14.8 percent a week earlier.  Output from U.S. nuclear plants slipped 845 megawatts to
82,464 megawatts today, or 81 percent of capacity, the least
since Nov. 30, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
data compiled by Bloomberg. Generation was 2.7 percent below the
five-year  average  of 84,716 megawatts for the day.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall, when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  U.S. gross gas production in December declined for the
first time in four months, capping the slowest annual growth
rate in three years, according to the monthly  EIA-914  report on
Feb. 28. Output slipped 0.7 percent to 82.57 billion cubic feet
a day as operators in  Louisiana ,  Texas  and the  Gulf of Mexico 
shut wells. Production was up 0.6 percent from December 2011.  Rig Count  The  gas-rig count  rose by 24 this week to 431, the most
since Jan. 25, data from Baker Hughes Inc. show. The total is
down 35 percent from a year ago.  The relative strength index jumped to 74.809 as of 3:21
p.m., the highest level since May 2011. A number above 70 is
considered by some traders to be a signal to sell contracts
while a number below 30 may be a sell signal.  “It’s definitely overbought, but as of yet there is no
bearish RSI divergence,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical
strategist at United-ICAP, a brokerage in  Jersey City ,  New
Jersey .  Right now, RSI is moving higher in sync with gas futures,
unlike last October, when the RSI started to drop while prices
continued to rally into late November, he said. “It was a
leading indicator, not a signal for an immediate exit.”  Nymex gas  open interest  jumped to 1,306,769 contracts
yesterday, near the all-time high of 1,308,114 contracts on
April 20, 2012. Open interest has risen 7.7 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
