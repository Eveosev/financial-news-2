A rule change by ICE Futures U.S.
is raising the cost of cocoa deliveries to exchange warehouses
and widened the discount of May futures to an eight-month high
compared with the July contract, according to Newedge Group.  In a bid to boost the quality of certified stockpiles, the
 New York  exchange will impose a penalty for bean counts that
exceed a specified amount per kilogram, starting with the July
contract. While ICE  announced  the change in June 2011, a
reminder notice issued March 13 sent the price spread between
the May and June contracts up 40 percent over three days.  “This will make it more expensive to deliver,” Joe Mallaney, a senior director of soft commodities at Newedge
Group, said in a telephone interview from New York. “That’s why
the May-July spread widened. Stockholders have an incentive to
deliver in May as they will be using the previous fixed formula.
Come July, the percentage discount will be bigger at current
price levels.”  Cocoa futures for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
settle at $2,115 a metric ton in New York, while the July
contract dropped to $2,129. The discount on May futures was $14,
the most since July 16 and wider than $10 on March 12.  The current rule specifies a maximum penalty of $72 a ton
for bean counts above the standard. The new rule will impose a
maximum penalty of 4 percent of the value, so the current July
contract would carry a penalty of $85.16. The standard bean
counts ranges from 1,000 to 1,200 per kilogram. Bigger beans
tend to yield more of the cocoa liquor, butter and powder used
in foods including chocolate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
