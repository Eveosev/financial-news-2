Clarus Securities Inc., a Toronto-
based investment bank, hired former Canaccord Genuity analyst
Eyal Ofir as the company bolsters technology coverage.  Ofir covered companies including  Wi-Lan Inc. (WIN) ,  Open Text
Corp. (OTC) ,  CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A)  and  Sandvine Corp. (SVC)  at Canaccord until late
last year. He begins at Clarus March 19, Mark Pavan, managing
director of corporate finance said. Pavan did not identify which
companies Ofir will cover.  Clarus, which has focused mostly on the mining sector, is
expanding in non-resource industries including technology.
Institutional investors have been looking for so-called
diversified and growth stocks to counter slower growth in
resource companies, Pavan said,  “I’ve had no less than half a dozen fund managers tell me
‘I don’t want to see another resource name in my office; we’re
exiting the exploration, if not the production space’,” Pavan
said today in a telephone interview. “They’re replacing it with
diversified and growth products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
