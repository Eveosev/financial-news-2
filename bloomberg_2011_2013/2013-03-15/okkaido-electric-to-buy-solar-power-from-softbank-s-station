Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509)  agreed
to buy solar power generated from a plant  Softbank Corp. (9984)  plans
to build in northern Japan.  Softbank plans to set up the plant in Hokkaido with a total
capacity of 111 megawatts, Kenichi Yuasa, a Softbank spokesman,
said by phone today. Of that, 79 megawatts will be connected to
Hokkaido Electric’s grids, he said.  The company said in July it plans to build a 111 megawatt
solar power station in Tomakomai, Hokkaido. Yuasa said the plant
will be built in the neighboring town of Abira.  Softbank aims to start operations of the plant by the end
of March 2015, he said. The spokesman declined to say how much
