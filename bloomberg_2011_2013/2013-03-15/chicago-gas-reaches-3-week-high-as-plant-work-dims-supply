Chicago gasoline strengthened to
the highest level in three weeks as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  and  BP Plc (BP/) 
conducted maintenance amid an  erosion  of the area’s supplies.  Phillips 66’s Wood River,  Illinois , refinery, has been
conducting a turnaround on several units since late February,
according to the company. BP was working on a desulfurization
unit at its Whiting, Indiana, plant a person familiar with
operations said March 4, without adding how long it would take.  With a combined capacity of 776,000 barrels a day, Wood
River and Whiting are the two largest refineries in the Midwest,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The work may be drawing
from Midwest supplies of motor fuel, which slipped to  53.8
million barrels  in the week ended March 8, Energy Information
Administration data showed.  The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline in
 Chicago , or CBOB, gained 7.5 cents 13 cents a gallon below
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:39
p.m., the narrowest differential since Feb. 22. Conventional
gasoline in the Midcontinent, or Group 3 region, rose 1.25 cent
to trade at a discount of 23.75 cents.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased $2.39 to $33.71 a
barrel, a second consecutive advance, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The Group 3 crack spread rose for the first time in five
days, climbing  61 cents  to $30.84 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
