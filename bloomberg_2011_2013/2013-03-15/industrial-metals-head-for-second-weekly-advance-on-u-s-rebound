Copper prices fell for the second
time in three days as confidence among American consumers
unexpectedly slumped in March.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
sentiment index fell to the lowest since December 2011 after
analysts anticipated an increase. The consumer-price index
posted the biggest gain since June 2009, while industrial
production rose more than forecast in February.  “The confidence index was a blow, and the market will be
closely watching the CPI numbers to see if there is any
indication about a rise in inflation,”  Tim Evans , the chief
market strategist at Long Leaf Trading Group in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “People have largely ignored the better-
than-expected data.”  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
settle at $3.5205 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
leaving prices down 3.6 percent this year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months declined 0.6 percent to $7,752 a metric ton ($3.52 a
pound).  Combined inventory monitored by exchanges in the U.S.,
London and  Shanghai  has climbed to the highest since 2003.  Aluminum, nickel, zinc, tin and lead prices fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
