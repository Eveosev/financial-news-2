GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and  Nissan
Motor Co. (7201)  led sales of at least $34 billion this week with
investors allocating money to corporate bond funds as relative
yields declined.  Glaxo, the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, sold $3 billion in its
first U.S. sale in more than 10 months and Yokohama, Japan-based
Nissan raised $1 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offerings increased from  $31.6 billion  last week and
compare with a 2013 weekly average of $31.4 billion.  Investors deposited $2.3 billion into U.S. investment-grade
bond funds in the week ended March 13, the strongest inflow
since November, according to Bank of America Corp. research. The
inflows into company debt came even as the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  reached an  all-time high  of 14,539 points yesterday,
Bloomberg data show.  “Investors think the  bond market  still has a little room
to run,” Timothy Cox, executive director of debt capital
markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “Some of the names that are coming to
market, especially the bonds with a little bit of spread,” are
catching attention, he said.  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 212 basis points
yesterday from 214 basis points on March 8, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  Glaxo Offering  Glaxo issued $1.25 billion of 0.7 percent, three-year debt
yielding 35 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and a $1.25 billion portion of 2.8 percent, 10-year securities
paying a relative yield of 90 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
The London-based company also sold a $500 million piece of 4.2
percent, 30-year debentures with a 105 basis-point spread.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $27.7
billion, compared with  $22.8 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $23.7 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade debt fell to 2.86 percent
yesterday from 2.89 percent on March 8, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads declined 1
basis point to 144 basis points.  Nissan,  Japan ’s second-largest automaker, sold $400 million
of 1.8 percent, five-year notes with a 95 basis-point spread and
$600 million of 1 percent, three-year securities with a relative
yield of 65 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The transaction
was doubled from $500 million in earlier discussions, according
to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be
identified, citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Speculative Grade  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.2
billion, compared with  $8.9 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $7.7 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on junk debt decreased to 6.41 percent yesterday
from 6.48 percent on March 8, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads declined 5 basis
points to 471 basis points.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Issuers planning sales include H.J. Heinz Co., the ketchup
maker being acquired by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
and 3G Capital Inc., with $2.1 billion of 7.5-year bonds,
