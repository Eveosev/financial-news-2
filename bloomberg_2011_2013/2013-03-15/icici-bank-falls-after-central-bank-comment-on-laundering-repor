ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s second-
largest lender by assets, is poised for the biggest daily fall
in more than a year after the central bank said it’s “in
touch” with banks named in a money-laundering news report.  ICICI’s shares  dropped  4.2 percent to 1,064 rupees at 1:14
p.m. in Mumbai trading today, headed for the lowest close since
Feb. 27 last year. The  S&P BSE Bankex index , a gauge for the
country’s banking stocks, fell 1.9 percent.  ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank Ltd. and  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  are running a
nationwide “money laundering racket,” violating multiple rules
including tax and banking regulations, news website Cobrapost
reported after a sting operation. The  Reserve Bank  of India is
“collecting information” on the report, Deputy Governor Urjit Patel told reporters in Mumbai yesterday.  ICICI and  HDFC Bank (HDFCB)  said yesterday that they are
investigating the news report. The allegation comes as financial
regulators and law enforcement agencies worldwide step up
efforts to tackle fraud. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest
bank, in December agreed to pay $1.92 billion to settle a money-
laundering case with regulators including the  U.S. Department of
Justice .  “The central bank official’s comment that it is collecting
information on the money laundering report is reason for the
fall,” said Hatim Broachwala, Mumbai-based banking analyst at
Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “The market is waiting for some
clarity on the issue.”  HDFC shares fell 2.2 percent to 635 rupees, while Axis Bank
fell 1.8 percent to 1,328 rupees in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
