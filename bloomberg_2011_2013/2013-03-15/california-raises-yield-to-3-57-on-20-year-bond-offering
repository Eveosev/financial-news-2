California  was forced to raise
yields on some longer bond maturities to complete a $2.1 billion
general-obligation sale, the state’s first debt offering since
 Standard & Poor’s  boosted its credit-rating in January.  The sale came in the worst week for state and local debt
this year. Yields on benchmark 10-year munis rose 0.24
percentage point this week through yesterday to 2.08 percent,
the highest since April,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. Bonds
are losing appeal as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed
for a 10th straight day to a record, the longest winning streak
since 1996, amid signs of a strengthening U.S. economy.  California’s 10-year bonds were priced yesterday to yield
2.56 percent, up from 2.54 percent a day earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on longer maturities rose
even more. Twenty-year securities were offered with a 3.57
percent yield, up from 3.39 percent.  “All factors considered, including investor sentiment that
has become less accommodating to issuers in the last couple of
weeks, we’re very pleased with the results,”  Tom Dresslar , a
spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer said yesterday. “We came
into a tough market with a large amount of new supply and
obtained a good result for taxpayers.”  Investors made net withdrawals of about $113 million from
muni mutual funds in the week through March 13, the most this
year, according to Lipper US Fund Flows data. It’s the second
straight week of net withdrawals.  Investors’ Thirst  Individual buyers ordered $795.4 million of the $888.9
million in tax-exempt debt offered to them by California. Those
orders accounted for 37 percent of the total $2.1 billion. The
state will use $1.1 billion of the proceeds to refinance older
debt and lower borrowing costs.  The yield offered on the 10-year segment was about 0.48
percentage point above a Bloomberg Valuation  index  of AAA munis.
The premium was about 0.77 percentage point on the 20-year
bonds.  The most-populous U.S. state earned its first upgrade from
S&P since 2006 after Governor  Jerry Brown , a Democrat, curbed
pension costs, won voter support for a tax boost and proposed a
budget for the next fiscal year that projects a surplus. New
York-based S&P raised California to A, its sixth-highest rank,
lifting it out of a tie with  Illinois  as the lowest-rated state.  Taxable Sale  Lockyer also sold $100 million of taxable bonds this week
maturing in 2015 to yield 0.64 percent, or 38 basis points more
than two-year Treasuries; and $264 million of three-year taxable
securities priced to yield 0.93 percent, a spread of 52 basis
points, Dresslar said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Separately, Lockyer remarketed $228 million of taxable
 Build America (BAB)  Bonds March 13. The Build America program, which
expired in 2010, gave states and cities a federal subsidy on
interest as part of an economic stimulus plan. California and
its local governments sold more than $39 billion of the debt.  The relative borrowing cost for issuers in the state has
been cut in half since Brown took office in 2011.  The extra yield over top-rated municipal bonds that
investors demand to own 10-year debt of the state and its
localities stood at  0.57 percentage point  yesterday. It was as
low as 52 basis points March 11, the narrowest since November
2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
