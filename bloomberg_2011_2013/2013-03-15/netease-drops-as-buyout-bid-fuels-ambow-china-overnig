Chinese equities  sank to the lowest
level since November in New York, led by  NetEase Inc. (NTES) , after the
nation’s new leaders failed to announce specific policy measures
to stoke growth in Asia’s largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. slid 0.8 percent to 91.95 by 12:52
p.m., posting a 3.3 percent slump in the week, the most in five
weeks. NetEase slid the most since December after Chinese state
television said the Internet company collects users’ private
information. Aluminum Corp. of China declined after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. recommended avoiding the stock.  Ambow Education
Holding Ltd. (AMBO)  surged 21 percent after receiving a buyout offer.  China’s legislature named Xi Jinping the nation’s new
President and Li Keqiang premier this week at its annual meeting
to end March 17. While the nation emerged from a seven-quarter
slowdown at the end of 2012, the new leaders face manufacturing
expanding at the slowest pace in five months and quickening
inflation. The central government tightened housing market
restrictions March 1 to curb rising prices.  “Beijing didn’t announce anything that the market was
looking forward to,” Michael Ding, lead manager of the  China
Region Fund (USCOX)  at U.S. Global Investors Inc. in  San Antonio , Texas,
which oversees $2.2 billion, said by e-mail. “The January to
February numbers disappointed, with inflation exceeding
estimates. Market speculation is taking over for the short
term.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., declined 0.6 percent to $37.52
in New York, losing 4 percent in the week. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,562.79, paring its
third weekly advance to 0.8 percent.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  sank 0.7 percent to
11,020.89 yesterday, bringing its weekly loss to 4 percent. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares advanced 0.4
percent to 2,278.40, trimming its decline for the week to 1.7
percent, the second consecutive weekly slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
