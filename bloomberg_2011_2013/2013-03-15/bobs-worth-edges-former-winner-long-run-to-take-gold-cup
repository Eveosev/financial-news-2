Favorite Bobs Worth, ridden by
Barry Geraghty, outlasted former winner Long Run to capture the
the Gold Cup, the showcase event at horse racing’s  Cheltenham
Festival .  The Irish-bred eight-year-old, the 11-4 favorite, went in
front at the last of 22 fences and ran past 2011 champion Long
Run, who had been leading from the start, on the final stretch
up the hill in the 3 1/4-mile (5.2-kilometer) race.  Long Run, ridden by Sam Waley-Cohen, ran out of steam and
finished third behind Sir Des Champs with AP McCoy on board.
Giant Bolster was fourth.  “He’s got a great attitude, he struggled on the ground but
he kept fighting,” Geraghty, who bought Bobs Worth as yearling
then sold him to trainer Nickey Henderson, told U.K. broadcaster
Channel Four. “He’s as game as a lion, he just loves the job.”  It was the first Gold Cup in seven years run without  Kauto
Star . The two-time Gold Cup and five-time King George VI Chase
winner, who is being trained in dressage following his
retirement in October, was paraded around the paddock at
Cheltenham shortly before the start of today’s race.  Other winners on the final day of the 27-race festival, the
most prestigious in the U.K. jumps-racing calendar, were Our
Conor in the Triumph Hurdle, Ted Veale in the Handicap Hurdle
and At Fischers Cross in the Novices’ Hurdle.  Amateur jockey JT McNamara is still in a Bristol hospital
in an induced coma after sustaining a neck injury in a fall at
Cheltenham yesterday, the Press Association quoted his uncle
Andrew McNamara as saying.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
