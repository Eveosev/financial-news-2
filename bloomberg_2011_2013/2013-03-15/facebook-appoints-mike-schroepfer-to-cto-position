Facebook Inc. (FB)  appointed Mike Schroepfer as chief technology officer, promoting an executive
steeped in the software and hardware that runs the world’s
largest social network.  Schroepfer, who joined Facebook in 2008, has been involved
in many of Facebook’s recent upgrades as vice president of
engineering. He replaces Bret Taylor, who stepped down last year
and left the company following its initial public offering.  The promotion helps fill Facebook’s executive ranks as it
seeks to ramp up sales and user growth amid pressure from
investors to generate more money from its more than 1 billion
users. The company’s shares have  declined  30 percent since the
IPO in May.  “Mike Schroepfer’s new designation as Facebook’s CTO
reflects the unique and important role he plays across the
company,” Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Menlo Park,
 California-based Facebook , wrote in an e-mailed statement.  Prior to joining Facebook, Schroepfer was vice president of
Mozilla Corp., the company behind the Firefox Web browser. He
was also at Sun Microsystems, now part of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
