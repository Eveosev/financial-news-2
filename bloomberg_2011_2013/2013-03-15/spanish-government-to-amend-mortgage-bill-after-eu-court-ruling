Spain’s government plans to revise
its mortgage rules after the European Union’s highest court
ruled that they lead to unfair evictions of some consumers
challenging the terms of their home loans.  Two aspects of Spanish mortgage law that have been
questioned most will be changed by amending a bill under
discussion in parliament to restrict evictions and assist those
who lose their homes, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters in  Madrid  today after the weekly
Cabinet meeting.  Spanish law must better protect borrowers who claim the
terms of their mortgage are unfair, the Luxembourg-based
European Court of Justice said yesterday. The ruling was
triggered after a Spanish court examining an eviction case
sought guidance on whether local law met the bloc’s requirements
on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  Spain will cap interest charges for late payments and
prohibit the start of foreclosure proceedings before three
mortgage payments have been missed, Saenz said.  The government will also seek to resolve foreclosure cases
involving unlawful mortgage contracts and prevent the inclusion
of illegal provisions in lending agreements, she said, without
giving more details.  The fact that homeowners in foreclosure must repay
mortgages even after ceding properties to lenders doesn’t break
any laws, Saenz said. While some agreements enable homeowners to
walk away from their debt in the event of foreclosure, such
deals are scarce because they’re only available for lower
borrowing amounts and carry higher interest rates, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
