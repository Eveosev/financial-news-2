Wallabies flanker  David Pocock  was
ruled out for as long as nine months following surgery to repair
a ligament in his left knee, the Australian Rugby Union said.  Pocock, who along with  James Horwill  had been a candidate
to captain Australia this year, underwent a two-hour
reconstruction last night after rupturing his anterior cruciate
ligament March 9 playing for his ACT Brumbies Super Rugby team.  “Now I need to rest up and get myself ready to start the
rehabilitation process,” Pocock, 24, said in an e-mailed
statement. “The key thing is that I’m patient and don’t try to
rush back. If that means season over, in terms of playing any
more rugby this year, then so be it.”  Pocock, who’s played 45 Tests and captained the national
team last year when Horwill was injured, will miss the three-
match series against the British and Irish Lions, the southern
hemisphere’s Rugby Championship and the Wallabies’ end-of-season
tour to  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
