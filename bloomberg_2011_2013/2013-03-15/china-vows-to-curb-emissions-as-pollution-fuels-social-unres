Chinese environmental protection
officials pledged to step up their efforts to curb emissions as
rising levels of pollution spurs social unrest in the world’s
second-biggest economy.  “We need to continuously speed up implementation of plans
to prevent air pollution,” Wu Xiaoqing, vice environmental
protection minister, said at a briefing held as part of annual
legislative meetings in Beijing and aired nationwide by  China ’s
state broadcaster today. “We hope to ease worsening air
pollution in a short period.”  Chinese authorities have sought to appease public anger
after smog in Beijing hit hazardous levels on 20 days in
January. Pollution has surpassed land disputes as the biggest
cause of protests in China, Chen Jiping, a former leading member
of the Communist Party’s Committee of Political and Legislative
Affairs, said this month.  The nation will implement pilot projects to control coal
consumption in the cities of Beijing and  Shanghai  and the
provinces of Shandong and Guangdong, Wu said today. Authorities
will also require large state-owned companies to report their
pollution emissions publicly this year, he said.  China plans to build more than 440 air monitoring stations
in 116 cities this year, Wu said. The State Council, China’s
cabinet, estimated in August that it may spend 2.37 trillion
 yuan  ($380 billion) on conservation and emissions cuts in the
five years through 2015.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
