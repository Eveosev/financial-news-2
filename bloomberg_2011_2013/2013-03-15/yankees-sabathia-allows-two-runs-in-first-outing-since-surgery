New York  Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia allowed two runs in five innings in his first spring-
training appearance after offseason elbow surgery.  Sabathia allowed three hits and his only walk in the first
inning of a 7-3 win today against the Miami Marlins. He left
after giving up eight hits and striking out two while throwing
64 pitches at Tampa, Florida.  The 32-year-old left-hander had arthroscopic surgery to
remove a small bone spur from his pitching elbow in October
after going 15-6 with a 3.38 earned run average in 2012.  The Yankees are counting on Sabathia’s health at the start
of the season to overcome injuries. First baseman  Mark Teixeira ,
outfielder  Curtis Granderson  and pitcher  Phil Hughes  all could
miss at least the first month of the campaign. Teixeira has a
strained tendon in his wrist, Granderson a broken forearm and
Hughes a bulging disk in his upper back. Third baseman Alex Rodriguez is out until midseason following hip surgery.  The Yankees open their season at home on April 1 against
the Boston Red Sox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
