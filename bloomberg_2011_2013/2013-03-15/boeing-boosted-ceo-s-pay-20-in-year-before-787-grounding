Boeing Co. (BA)  boosted Chief Executive
Officer Jim McNerney’s compensation 20 percent to $27.5 million
last year, before the planemaker’s marquee 787 Dreamliner was
grounded by overheating batteries.  McNerney, 63, received $10.8 million of incentive pay in
addition to his $1.93 million salary and $840,775 in other
compensation, Chicago-based Boeing said yesterday in proxy
materials filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. He earned $23 million in 2011.  While Dreamliner deliveries last year helped Boeing
overtake Airbus SAS as the world’s largest planemaker for the
first time since 2002, handing over more aircraft wasn’t enough
to keep full-year profit from falling 2.9 percent to $3.9
billion. The stock’s 2.7 percent gain for 2012 lagged behind the
13 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The 787, whose completion was among McNerney’s signature
achievements, has been grounded since Jan. 16 as Boeing and
regulators led by the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  probe
the battery malfunctions.  Boeing climbed 2.1 percent to $86.43 yesterday, the highest
close since May 2008, after executives said safety upgrades may
allow commercial 787 flights to restart within weeks. The plane
entered service in 2011 after three years of delays amid supply-
chain disruptions, assembly problems and a Machinists’ strike.  Incentive Pay  McNerney’s incentive pay for last year, in which Boeing
said it exceeded both 2012 and three-year profit targets,
included a $4.44 million annual bonus and $6.38 million from a
long-term program.  The value of his pension increased $6.37 million, according
to the filing, and he received $7.53 million in stock and option
awards.  McNerney’s realized compensation, or income reported to the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the period, was $20.1 million,
compared with $12.4 million a year earlier.  Jim Albaugh , who served as head of Boeing’s commercial
airplanes division until his retirement last year, earned $9.63
million in 2012, versus $8.49 million in 2011, according to the
filing.  Albaugh will receive $708,543 annually from Boeing’s
supplemental executive retirement plan, according to the filing.  The planemaker said he also was due to receive service-
based equity and performance awards that had a value of $5.54
million as of Dec. 31. Under Internal Revenue Service rules, the
final value of that package can’t be calculated until after
April 1, six months following his retirement, Boeing said.  Aircraft deliveries are important to planemakers because
that’s when customers typically make large bulk payments on the
purchase price of a jet. Boeing handed over 601 planes to buyers
last year versus 516 for its Toulouse, France-based rival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
