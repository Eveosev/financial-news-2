Former Democratic congressman
Howard Berman, who was chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, is joining Covington & Burling LLP’s global public
policy and government affairs practice in Washington.  Berman’s hire comes on the heels of another congressional
hire for Covington. Former  Arizona  Republican Senator  Jon Kyl 
joined the public policy and government affairs practice on
March 6.  Berman, first elected to Congress in 1982, was defeated in
in 2012 by fellow Democratic Representative  Brad Sherman  in the
redrawn 30th Congressional District. He previously was a member
of the California State Assembly for a decade.  Berman, who will be senior of counsel at Covington, said he
considered joining several law firms after returning to the
private sector after 40 years.  “At every one of these place I talked to there was
somebody I had a good relationship with but there were a number
of them at Covington,” Berman said in a telephone interview. He
cited Stu Eizenstat, a Covington partner who heads the
international practice and who served in three American
presidential administrations, as a key one.  He also said an important reason he picked Covington was
the firm’s reputation for “doing high-quality legal work and as
a great place to work.”  Berman was a senior member and leader on the House
Judiciary Committee and chairman of its subcommittee on courts,
 intellectual property  and the Internet, where he led changes to
patent and intellectual property laws affecting the
entertainment and high-technology industries.  “Representative Berman and I come from different chambers
and different parties, but we are both committed to building
bipartisan consensus to get things done,” Kyl said in a
statement. “I look forward to doing that together for
Covington’s clients.”  Also on the global public policy group at Covington is
former Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff  and John Veroneau, who served as deputy U.S. trade representative.  Covington has more than 800 lawyers at nine offices in the
U.S.,  Europe  and  Asia .  Milbank Adds A&O Financial Regulatory Chairman in New York  Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP hired banking and
financial services regulatory lawyer Douglas Landy as a partner
in the leveraged finance and financial regulations group in its
 New York  office. Landy joins the firm from Allen & Overy LLP,
where he was head of the U.S. financial services regulatory
practice, Milbank said.  Landy, a former staff attorney at the  Federal Reserve Bank
of New York , worked at A&O for about five years. He said he
enjoyed the period but decided to move because he wanted to work
with clients on more U.S. matters.  “The depth of penetration that Milbank has in the U.S. is
only equaled by a couple of law firms,” Landy said in a
telephone interview.  Landy represents global financial institutions in U.S.
regulatory matters, including dealings with the Fed, Securities
and Exchange Commission and other agencies. Last year, he
represented a group of more than two dozen foreign banks
challenging the proposed Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank.  “The need for expert regulatory and compliance counsel is
a top priority for our banking and financial services
clients,”Milbank Chairman Scott Edelman said in a statement.
“In the swirl of Dodd-Frank, Basel III, the Volcker Rule,
stress testing, Libor scandals and so much more, Doug is a
powerful and wise advocate.”  Milbank has 600 lawyers at 11 offices in the Americas,
Europe and Asia.  Clifford Chance Adds Partners in Hong Kong and London  Clifford Chance LLP announced two partner hires this week,
including former Norton Rose LLP partner Dorian Drew, who
advised ex-Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond 
on the Libor rates investigation. Drew will join the global
regulatory enforcement and white-collar crime group as a partner
in the London office.  Drew is a solicitor advocate specializing in regulatory
investigations and enforcement action within the financial
services industry, the firm said.  Alastair C. MacAulay, formerly of Mayer Brown JSM, also
joins Clifford Chance in the  Hong Kong  office as a partner who
will lead on maritime and offshore finance matters, the firm
said.  MacAulay focuses on asset and project finance, particularly
in the transportation and energy sectors, the firm said. He has
represented banks and financial institutions on loan, guarantee,
leasing and other credit transactions.  His recent work includes advising Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. on
a liquefied natural gas ship project and Chilean power producers
Colbun SA and AES Gener SA on the long-term charter of a storage
and regasification unit, the firm said.  Clifford Chance  has 3,400 legal advisers at 35 offices in
25 countries worldwide.  Mayer Brown Hires Intellectual Property and Real Estate Partners  Mayer Brown LLP made two more partner hires this week,
adding intellectual property lawyer Stephen Baskin in Washington
and real-estate lawyer  Brian Davis  in Chicago.  Baskin was previously at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton
LLP, where he was managing partner of that firm’s Washington
office. Davis was a partner with Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  Baskin has led patent litigations for more than 20 years,
the firm said. Davis represents institutional real estate
investors on matters including distressed debt and equity
transactions, asset acquisitions and dispositions. Mayer Brown
also hired former Barclays Plc director Joel Moss this week.  Mayer Brown has lawyers at offices in the Americas, Asia
and Europe.  K&L Gates Hires USTR Lawyer as Partner in Washington  Frank J. Schweitzer , formerly associate general counsel at
the Office of the United States Trade Representative, joined K&L
Gates LLP as a partner in the international arbitration and
international trade practices in Washington.  At the USTR, Schweitzer represented the U.S. in litigation
before the  World Trade Organization . He was lead counsel in the
challenge to China’s barrier to foreign providers of electronic-
payment services and was co-lead counsel for the U.S. in the WTO
appellate proceeding that upheld a finding of illegal European
subsidies to Airbus, the firm said.  Schweitzer also advised on international investment matters
and was legal counsel in negotiations on the investment chapter
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and talks on the
U.S.-China bilateral investment treaty, the firm said.  He will focus his practice on international dispute
resolution, with an emphasis on WTO dispute settlement and
investment treaty arbitration.  K&L Gates has lawyers at 47 offices in the U.S., Asia,
Australia, Europe, the  Middle East  and  South America .  News  Jones Day Partner Orr Named Detroit’s Emergency Manager  Michigan Governor Rick Snyder named Washington lawyer Kevyn Orr, a partner at the  Jones Day  law firm, as emergency manager
to lead Detroit out of a financial crisis that threatens the
largest municipal bankruptcy in the U.S.  Orr, who worked on the team that managed Chrysler Group
LLC’s 2009 bankruptcy, will tackle a city in a downward spiral
of shrinking population and revenue, riddled by swaths of vacant
property and whose municipal government opposes a state
takeover. Detroit’s deficit hit almost $327 million last year,
and its long-term obligations have piled up to more than $14
billion, according to a state review.  Improving the city is “the Olympics of restructuring,”
Orr said yesterday at a news conference.  Detroit becomes the sixth Michigan city with an emergency
manager, though by far the largest. Under a new law that takes
effect March 28, those managers will assume greater authority to
operate and finance the cities. Those powers include the ability
to sell assets and change labor contracts.  “We have great people who want to help,” Snyder said at
the news conference, flanked by Orr and Mayor Dave Bing, a
Democrat. “Now is the time to find common ground to solve the
problem.”  Orr, who said he resigned from Jones Day, is a  University
of Michigan  law school graduate specializing in corporate
restructuring and bankruptcy.  For more, click here.  Video  Should Insurance Regulators Handle Derivatives?  Barry Ritholtz , chief executive officer at Fusion IQ, and
Tangent Capital Partners’ Bob Rice talk with Bloomberg Law’s Lee
Pacchia about the current state of the  derivatives market  and a
recent initiative by the International Swaps & Derivatives
Association to write new standards for credit-default swaps.  Ritholtz says that the multitrillion-dollar derivatives
market remains largely unregulated despite almost destroying the
global financial system during the credit crisis in 2008.  “There are a number of different asset classes and
financial instruments,” he said. “Derivatives are the only one
more or less exempt from oversight.”  Ritholtz suggests that state insurance regulators should
cover derivatives and force participants to put up reserves on
their investments.  Rice contends that regulation of derivatives is difficult
because the products generate tremendous profits at the world’s
largest financial institutions.  Banks “have no interest in standardization or clearing
organizations because it squeezes their margins,” he said.
Still, he said he expects oversight will have to increase
because regulators need a more precise understanding of activity
in the derivatives market.  This is a Bloomberg podcast. To download, watch or listen
