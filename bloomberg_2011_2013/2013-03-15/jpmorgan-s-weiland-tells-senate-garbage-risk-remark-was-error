Former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  market-
risk executive Pete Weiland told lawmakers he erred last year
when dismissing internal loss estimates on botched trades as
“garbage” before they proved prescient.  “Yes, I acknowledge it now, with all the information we
have today, that was correct,” Weiland said today in testimony
to the Senate  Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations. The
panel had quoted his “garbage” remark in a 301-page report
yesterday on JPMorgan’s so-called London Whale bets, which lost
$6.2 billion in last year’s first nine months.  As the trades soured in the bank’s chief investment office
last February, an internal JPMorgan metric known as the
comprehensive risk measure showed the portfolio might suffer a
$6.3 billion annual loss, lawmakers found. Weiland was the
unit’s chief market risk officer at the time.  “We got some CRM numbers and they look like garbage as far
as I can tell,” Weiland wrote in an e-mail dismissing the
estimates’ accuracy. He stepped down later in the year.  The CIO’s then-chief, Ina Drew, also doubted the accuracy
of the estimates, the senators’ investigation found. By the time
she believed it, “it was too late,” they wrote in their
report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
