SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) ’s Matthew Grubb will be entitled to two floor seats and two “lower bowl
tickets” for all Oklahoma City Thunder home basketball games
this season, under his termination agreement with the energy
company.  Grubb, who steps down today as president and chief
operating officer, will also get two years’ salary plus his
annual bonus from 2012, according to a  filing  the Oklahoma City-
based company made today.  Grubb’s termination was announced Wednesday as the company
reached a settlement agreement with activist shareholder TPG-
Axon Capital Management LP. The hedge fund has also called for
the firing of SandRidge Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom
Ward, who owns a stake in the Thunder, a National Basketball
Association team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
