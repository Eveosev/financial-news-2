AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  Chief Executive Officer
Tom Horton’s $20 million severance as part of the airline’s
planned merger with  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  drew an objection from
the U.S.  The American Airlines parent hasn’t established that the
severance complies with bankruptcy law, the U.S. Trustee, which
monitors bankruptcy proceedings, said in a court filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Fort Worth, Texas-based American, which filed for
bankruptcy in 2011, is scheduled to seek court approval later
this month for the $11 billion merger with US Airways to create
the world’s largest carrier.  US Airways CEO Doug Parker will take over as CEO of the
combined company while Horton will serve as chairman. Horton’s
$19.88 million severance would be paid half in cash and half in
stock.  Andrew Backover, an American Airlines spokesman, said the
objection by the U.S. to Horton’s severance and other employee
compensation is without merit.  “The relief requested will appropriately motivate a strong
management team during the integration process to ensure the
value potential of the merger is realized,” Backover said in a
statement.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-bk-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
