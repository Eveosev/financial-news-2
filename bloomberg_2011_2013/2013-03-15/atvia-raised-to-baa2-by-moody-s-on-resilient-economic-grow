Latvia ’s credit rating was raised
one level to Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, as the Baltic
country’s economy recovered and the government reduced the
budget deficit.  The rating was lifted from Baa3, which is the lowest
investment grade, Moody’s said in a statement. The upgrade puts
Latvia on par with  Brazil ,  Italy  and  Bulgaria . The outlook is
positive, as the country’s potential adoption of the euro will
shield it from external shocks, the rating company said.  “Growth has been resilient to the euro area crisis,”
analyst Alpona Banerji wrote in the statement. “The second
driver supporting the upgrade is the increased resilience of
Latvia’s public finances.”  Latvia, which is seeking to become the 18th country to
adopt the euro, expanded at an average 5.5 percent over the past
two years, according to Moody’s. The government cut the budget
deficit to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product last year, from
9.7 percent in 2009, it said.  The yield on Latvia’s government bonds due 2018 fell 5
basis point, or 0.05 percentage point to 1.93 percent by 4:37
p.m. in New York. It has plummeted from 4.15 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
