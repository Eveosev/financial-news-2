French soft-wheat exports jumped 44
percent in January from a year earlier as shipments to  Algeria 
more than tripled, customs data showed. Barley exports rose 57
percent, helped by deliveries to  Syria  and  Tunisia .  France shipped 1.76 million metric tons of soft wheat in
the first month of 2013, climbing from 1.22 million tons a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations using trade  data 
published online this week.  Wheat and barley exports from France are forecast to climb
in the crop year through June after drought cut output in Russia
and Ukraine last year. Soft-wheat export sales may rise to 16.9
million tons from 16.1 million tons in the previous season, crop
office FranceAgriMer predicts.  Soft-wheat sales to Algeria, the largest buyer of French
wheat, jumped to 328,275 tons from 90,815 tons a year earlier,
the customs data show.  France  was the worldâ€™s fifth-biggest
wheat shipper last year, after the U.S., Australia, Russia and
 Canada , based on data from the International Grains Council.  Soft-wheat exports in the first seven months of the crop
year that started July 1 were 9.48 million tons, compared with
8.72 million tons in the year-earlier period.  The monthly volume of barley exports climbed to 565,955
tons from 360,052 tons in January 2012, lifted by a jump in
deliveries to  Belgium  as well as 55,000 tons shipped to Syria
and 23,750 tons for Tunisia, from none a year earlier.  French exports of durum wheat, the hard variety used to
make pasta, dropped 42 percent to 96,182 tons from 166,437 tons.
Corn exports in January fell 7.7 percent to 506,759 tons from
548,844 tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
