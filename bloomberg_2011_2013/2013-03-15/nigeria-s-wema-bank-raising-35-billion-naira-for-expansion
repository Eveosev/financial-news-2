Nigerian lender  Wema Bank Plc (WEMABANK)  is
raising 35 billion naira ($219 million) to fund expansion from a
regional to a national bank, said Kemi Aina, spokeswoman for the
lender.  “We are already raising the money through a private
placement that commenced last year and hope to conclude the
exercise by April,” she said today by phone from Lagos, the
commercial capital. “The money is needed to approach the
central bank for a national banking licence.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  introduced modified licensing
rules as part of reforms after a debt crisis in 2009 brought the
industry to the verge of collapse. Lenders in Nigeria are either
licensed as holding companies operating local and international
units or as national and regional banks.  Wema Bank became a regional lender in 2011, complying with
the  central bank ’s capital requirement of 10 billion naira and
operating in six to 12 of the country’s 36 states. A minimum
capital of 25 billion naira is required for a national bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
