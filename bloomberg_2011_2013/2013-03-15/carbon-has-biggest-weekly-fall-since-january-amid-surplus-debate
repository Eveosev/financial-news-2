European Union carbon permits
posted their biggest weekly drop since January as nations and
other policy makers considered a plan to temporarily remove
supply from the market.  EU carbon for December fell 11 percent this week to close
at 3.78 euros ($4.94) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . The benchmark contract rose 2.2 percent
today.  Carbon fell to a six-week low on March 13 after German
Environment Minister Peter Altmaier said the country will decide
on its position to a plan to delay the sale of some carbon
permits only after the European Parliament votes on the measure
in mid-April. The bloc is considering draft amendments that
would enable postponing sales of 900 million carbon allowances
to support prices, a strategy known as backloading.  Altmaier’s comments may have prompted some traders to lose
confidence in the prospect of backloading being agreed within a
month, said Louis Redshaw, head of carbon and coal for Barclays
Plc in London. “It may have accelerated some of the selling,
decelerated some buying,” he said in a phone interview.  Carbon may fall back to the 3.22 euro level while the
backloading debate continues, he said.  EU permits for December rose as much as 20 percent
yesterday after the European Parliament approved a non-binding
recommendation for regulators to tackle oversupply of carbon
permits in the world’s biggest market.  “You’re creating volatility by backloading,” Redshaw
said. “The market, on the whole, should be left alone.
Tightening targets is much more credible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
