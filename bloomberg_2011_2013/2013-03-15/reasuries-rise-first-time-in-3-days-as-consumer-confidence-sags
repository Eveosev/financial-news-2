Treasuries rose, dropping 10-year
 yields  below 2 percent for the first time in six days, after an
unexpected decline in a gauge of U.S.  consumer confidence  cast
doubt over the strength of the economic recovery.  Prices rose for the first time in three days and snapped
the longest  streak  of days with the benchmark note’s yield above
2 percent in almost a year. The  Federal Reserve  will buy as much
as $5.75 billion of Treasuries today due from December 2017 to
November 2018 in a program to bolster growth.  “The confidence data is not good,” said Tom Simons, an
economist in  New York  at Jefferies LLC, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “If you looked at all the data
this week you would think that the economy was picking up a bit
of momentum. There’s been one direction of data and this is the
first move in the other direction.”  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.99 percent at 10:38 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
sentiment  index (SPX)  for March fell to 71.8, the lowest level since
December 2011, from 77.6 in February. The gauge was projected to
increase to 78, according to the median estimate of 67
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
