U.K. lawmakers will probe how far
auto-insurance costs are being raised by whiplash claims now
estimated by insurers at 1,500 a day.  The  House of Commons Transport Committee  called in London
today for written testimony on whiplash claims and said it plans
to hold hearings with witnesses before publishing its findings
in the summer.  “It is vitally important for policy makers to understand
the reasons for the very high cost of motor insurance,
especially for young drivers, and to take steps to bring that
cost down,” Louise Ellman, the opposition Labour Party lawmaker
who heads the panel, said in an e-mailed statement. “Whiplash
claims undoubtedly play a part in driving up the cost of motor
insurance, but access to justice for injured people must be
preserved.”  The Association of British Insurers called two days ago for
anyone claiming a whiplash injury to undergo a medical
examination. It said 1,500 people a day are now submitting
whiplash claims, which have risen by nearly a quarter over four
years even as the number of road accidents has fallen. Such
claims cost 2 billion pounds ($3 billion) a year, adding 90
pounds to the average auto-insurance premium, the ABI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
