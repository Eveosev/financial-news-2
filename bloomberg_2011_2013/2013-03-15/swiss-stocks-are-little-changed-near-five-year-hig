Swiss stocks  were little changed
near a five-year high before U.S. reports that may show
industrial production and  consumer confidence  increased.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  climbed as JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the
drugmaker and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration designated an
experimental  lung cancer  treatment as a Breakthrough Therapy.
 Dufry AG (DUFN)  rose 1.1 percent after profit increased.  Lindt &
Spruengli AG (LISN)  fell after the world’s largest maker of premium
chocolate reported earnings that missed analyst estimates.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  was unchanged at 7,842.85 as of
11:40 a.m. in Zurich, bringing the gauge’s weekly advance to 1.3
percent. The broader Swiss Performance Index added less than 0.1
percent today.  The number of shares changing hands in companies on the SMI
was more than double the average of the past 30 days as options
expired, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Stocks climbed around the world yesterday as an unexpected
decline in U.S. jobless claims sent the benchmark Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index within two points of its October 2007 record.  A Federal Reserve report at 9:15 a.m. in  Washington  may
show U.S. industrial production climbed 0.4 percent in February
after a 0.1 percent drop the previous month, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 83 economists. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of  consumer
sentiment  for March climbed to 78 from 77.6 last month, a
separate survey predicted.  Novartis Gains  Novartis rose 0.4 percent to 65.70 francs after JPMorgan
raised its recommendation to overweight, the equivalent of a buy
rating, from neutral. Separately, the FDA gave Novartis’s LDK378
compound a Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of
patients with lung cancer.  In addition, two people with knowledge of the matter said
Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc’s injectable-drug business has drawn
interest from companies including Novartis. Spokesmen for
Novartis and Hikma declined to comment.  Dufry advanced 0.8 percent to 123.70 francs, snapping seven
days of losses. The operator of duty-free shops said 2012
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
increased 28 percent to 474 million francs.  Lindt dropped 1.1 percent to 40,560 francs. The company
reported a 12 percent increase in 2012 net income to 271.9
million francs ($287 million), missing the 277 million-franc
average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Daetwyler Holding AG (DAE) , a provider of engineering and
electronics components, climbed 2.8 percent to 102.70 francs.
The company reported a 33 percent gain in full-year net income
to 127.5 million francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
