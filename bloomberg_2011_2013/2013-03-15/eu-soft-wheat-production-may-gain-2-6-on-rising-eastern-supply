Soft wheat production in the
European Union may be 2.6 percent larger than last year as
increasing harvests in southern and eastern  Europe  make up for
declines in the U.K., grain-industry lobby Coceral said.  The EU may produce 127.77 million metric tons of soft
wheat, up from 124.55 million tons in 2012, the Brussels-based
group said today in an e-mailed report. Estimates for both years
include  Croatia , which is set to join the EU in July. Wheat will
be grown on 23.2 million hectares (57.3 million acres), up from
22.81 million a year earlier, and yields are expected to climb
0.9 percent to 5,510 kilograms (5.51 tons) a hectare.  Production in  Romania , the bloc’s fifth-biggest wheat
grower, may jump 23 percent from last year to 6.14 million tons,
while output rises 12 percent in  Bulgaria  and 11 percent in
 Spain , Coceral said. Parts of the southern and eastern EU had
dry weather last year. In the U.K., the third-biggest producer,
the crop may slide 10 percent to 11.98 million tons. Wet weather
last year prevented farmers from planting some winter crops, the
U.K. Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board has said.  “Things look all right in eastern Europe,”  Dave Norris ,
an independent grain broker in Harrogate,  England , said by
telephone today. “There are parts of northern France where
there are a few question marks about what the quality of the
crop is, but the U.K. looks like it will be in unfortunately the
worst shape in Europe for a second year running. The Germans
seem to have a very good crop.”  EU Output  EU production of durum wheat, a hard variety of the grain
used to make pasta, may rise 1.9 percent from a year earlier to
8.27 million tons, Coceral said. Barley output may climb 0.6
percent to 54.79 million tons, and rapeseed production may
increase 2.8 percent to 20.05 million tons.  The EU’s corn harvest may jump 14 percent from 2012 to
64.38 million tons as yields climb in southern and eastern
countries while farmers boost planting in  France , the bloc’s
biggest grower, Coceral said. French corn production may be
16.25 million tons, 4.8 percent higher than in 2012. In Romania,
the second-biggest producer, the harvest may surge 60 percent to
8.63 million tons, and output in  Italy , which ranks third, may
climb 6.8 percent to 8.1 million tons, according to the report.  In a separate report, farm lobby Copa-Cogeca pegged the
soft wheat crop in the 27 countries currently in the EU at
126.96 million tons, with total wheat production, including
durum, at 134.93 million tons. The Brussels-based group
estimated corn production at 56.44 million tons, little changed
from the previous season, and predicted rapeseed output would
climb 7.6 percent to 21.05 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
