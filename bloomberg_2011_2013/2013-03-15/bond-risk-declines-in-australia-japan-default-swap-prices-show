The cost of insuring corporate
bonds from non-payment fell in Australia and  Japan , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
104 basis points as of 11:19 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The last time the gauge closed below that
level was in May 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 0.5 of a basis
points to 101.8 as of 9:23 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark had fallen 20.4 basis points this month
through yesterday, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 101.5 basis points
as of 9:04 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The measure is set for its lowest
close since January 2011, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
