Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) , the St.
Louis-based brokerage, will acquire  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ’s
U.S. institutional fixed-income sales and trading business.  Knight’s European institutional fixed-income sales and
trading team is also part of the deal, which includes about 100
people, Stifel said today in a statement, without disclosing
terms. The group covers high-yield and investment-grade
corporate bonds, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities,
 emerging markets  and fixed-income research.  Stifel Chief Executive Officer Ron Kruszewski, 54, has
pointed to consolidation in the brokerage industry as a way for
his firm to pick up market share. Since Kruszewski became CEO in
1997, Stifel has spent more than $1.7 billion on acquisitions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Expanding our fixed-income business has been an
initiative of ours,” Kruszewski said today in the statement.  Knight agreed in December to be purchased by Getco LLC in a
$1.4 billion deal, ending its 17 years of independence. Knight,
which lost more than $450 million from computer glitches that
led to a flood of errant orders, was bailed out by six financial
firms including Getco and Stifel in August.  Other suitors for the debt team included Guggenheim
Partners LLC, Canaccord Financial Inc. and Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc., people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
