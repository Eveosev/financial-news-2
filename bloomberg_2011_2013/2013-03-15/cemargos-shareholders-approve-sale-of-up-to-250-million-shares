Shareholders of  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) ,
 Colombia ’s largest cement maker, approved the sale of as many as
250 million preferred shares.  The price and date for the sale haven’t been set, Chief
Executive Officer Jorge Mario Velasquez said at an annual
meeting of shareholders today in Barranquilla.  Common shares  have tumbled 15 percent since the company
announced in a Feb. 15 filing that it was planning to sell
preferred shares in local and international markets. They
rallied 1.5 percent today to 8,940 pesos at 2:27 p.m. in Bogota.  Cemargos said in the regulatory filing that it was seeking
to raise cash through an initial sale of preferred shares to
allow it to “maximize growth opportunities.” The company has
1.15 billion common shares outstanding, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
