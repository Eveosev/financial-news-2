Natural gas may climb for the fifth
consecutive week as a late winter cold blast boosts heating
demand, helping reduce a supply glut, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Six of 13 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast that futures
will rise on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through March 8.
Five, or 38 percent, said gas will fall and two predicted that
prices will stay the same. Last week, 55 percent of participants
said gas would advance.  Below-normal temperatures will envelop most of the East
from March 24 through March 28, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas has jumped 25 percent
from its 2013 low of 3.05 on Jan. 2 as blasts of frigid weather
increased demand for heating fuels. A  gas surplus  to the
historic norm narrowed last week for the third week in a row.  Natural gas futures climbed 24.3 cents, or 6.7 percent, to
$3.872 per million British thermal units this week, capping the
biggest weekly gain since Jan. 18. Prices are up 16 percent this
year.  “Meteorologists are now saying that this March might be
the coldest we’ve seen since 1996 and prices are reflecting that
reality,” Aaron Calder, senior market analyst at Gelber &
Associates in Houston, said in a note to clients yesterday.
“What traders are paying more attention to, however, is that
the draw exceeded expectations for a fourth consecutive week.”  Cold Weather  The low temperature in  Chicago  on March 18 will be 22
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 Celsius), 11 below normal, and
 Washington ’s low may be 6 below the usual the next day at 32
degrees, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistical division.  Gas stockpiles  fell by 145 billion cubic feet to 1.938
trillion in the week ended March 5, dropping below 2 trillion
for the first time since May 2011, an EIA report showed
yesterday.  Analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg predicted a
decline of 137 billion.  A  supply surplus  to the five-year average narrowed to 11.4
percent from 14.8 percent the previous week. A  deficit  versus
year-earlier levels widened to 18.5 percent from 14.8 percent,
the most since April 2008.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  6       5     2  To contact the reporter on this story:
