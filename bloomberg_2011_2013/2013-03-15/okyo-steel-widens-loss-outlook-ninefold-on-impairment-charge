Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co. (5423) ,
 Japan ’s biggest maker of steel from scrap iron, widened its
annual loss forecast almost ninefold on a 128 billion yen ($1.3
billion) impairment charge related to a plant in central Japan.  The net loss will be 146 billion yen for the 12 months
ending March 31, compared with a Jan. 18 estimate of a 16.5
billion yen loss, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The operating loss for
the period will probably total 17 billion yen, 9.7 percent wider
than earlier estimates, according to the statement. The company
hasn’t turned a profit since 2009.  A prolonged slump in  Europe , combined with excess steel
supply in Asia and lower product prices, has forced Tokyo
Steel’s Tahara plant near Nagoya to pare production to 60
percent of a forecast made at the start of the year, according
to the statement. The writedown could enable the company to
swing back to an operating profit in the next financial year,
analyst Keiju Kurosaka said.  “The losses at the plant have weighed on the company’s
stock price,” said Kurosaka, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley. “It’s rather positive for its earnings outlook
after the writedown.”  The company’s stock has fallen 35 percent over the last 12
months, compared to a 24 percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average. It closed up 2.1 percent at 448 yen in Tokyo
trading today. The announcement on the impairment was made after
the market close.  Tokyo Steel opened the plant, located near a  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  factory, to produce steel for cars and electronics
appliances in 2009, its first new plant in 14 years. The company
is challenging Nippon Steel Corp. and  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , which
dominate the domestic automotive steel market.  Sales are forecast to reach 138 billion yen this fiscal
year, 3.5 percent short of its previous estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
