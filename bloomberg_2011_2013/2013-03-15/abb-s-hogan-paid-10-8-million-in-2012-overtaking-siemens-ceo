ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  awarded Chief Executive
Officer Joe Hogan a total pay package of 10.2 million Swiss
francs ($10.8 million) in 2012, about 8 percent more than the
previous year and eclipsing the compensation of  Siemens AG (SIE)  chief
 Peter Loescher .  Hogan’s remuneration is made up of about 2 million francs
in base salary, 3.3 million francs in variable compensation to
be paid in 2013, 4.1 million francs in share-based awards from a
long-term incentive plan which will pay out in 2015 if specific
performance targets are reached, pension contributions, and
benefits including social security and children’s education,
Zurich-based ABB said in its  annual report .  Hogan overtook Loescher, who’s total pay package was 7.9
million euros ($10.2 million) in 2012, 867,000 euros less than
the year before. ABB shares gained 6.1 percent last year, while
rival Siemens’ shares rose 11 percent. Hogan earned more than
twice as much as ABB’s second highest paid executive, Bernhard Jucker who was paid 4.6 million francs in total.  CEO salaries face increased scrutiny in  Switzerland  after
the people there voted on March 3 for greater shareholder powers
to decide executive pay. The new laws will ban severance
payments and bonuses for acquisitions or divestments, with jail
terms of up to three years for executives who don’t follow the
rules.  ABB said total executive committee member compensation rose
to 50.9 million francs from 37.8 million francs in 2011,
reflecting an extra member, increased long-term incentive
payments, and 8.4 million francs from a new executive
compensation plan for meeting targets for integrating the
acquisitions of Baldor Electric Co., Thomas & Betts Corp. and
Ventyx Inc., introduced in the fourth quarter of 2012.  ABB spokesman Antonio Ligi said the acquisition integration
payments are not touched by the new compensation rules.  Shares of ABB traded 0.5 percent higher at 21.81 francs as
of 12:53 p.m. in Zurich. About 7.3 million shares changed hands,
or 124 percent of the three month average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
