Sellers of cocoa from  Ghana , the
second-biggest grower, are seeking a higher premium in  Europe  as
the harvest nears its end and purchases by the regulator
decline, four people with direct knowledge of the sales said.  Ghanaian cocoa in the European market was at a premium of
80 pounds ($121) to 90 pounds to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, said the traders, who asked not to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
That compares with 80 pounds to 85 pounds on Feb. 20 and 75
pounds to 80 pounds a month earlier.  Purchases by the Ghana Cocoa Board, the regulator, were
594,000 metric tons from the start of the season Oct. 1 through
Feb. 28, according to  KnowledgeCharts , a unit of Commodities
Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . That’s 17 percent
lower than a year earlier. The data are used by the market as an
indication of output. The main crop will end in May. A smaller
harvest, known as the light crop, runs from June to September.  Cocoa from  Ivory Coast , the largest producer, was at a
premium of 40 pounds to 50 pounds to the exchange price, said
the traders. That compares with 35 pounds to 50 pounds three
weeks ago and 40 pounds to 45 pounds a month earlier.  Cocoa for May delivery dropped 0.8 percent to 1,430 pounds
a ton by 3:06 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
