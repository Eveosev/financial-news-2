Indian stocks retreated for the
fourth day this week, led by lenders and carmakers. A gauge of
volatility climbed to more than a four-month high.  The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 19,427.56 at the
close in Mumbai, taking the weekly drop to 1.3 percent.  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  and  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  were among the biggest losers on
the index after the central bank said it is “collecting
information” on reports of  money laundering  by the lenders. The
banks said yesterday they are probing the report.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT)  and  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  declined on concern slowing
sales will erode their profits.  India’s non-food inflation eased last month even as the
benchmark gauge accelerated from a three-year low, government
data showed yesterday, sustaining scope for the  Reserve Bank  of
India to reduce rates on March 19. The 30-day  volatility  in the
Sensex was at 12.9, the highest since Oct. 29, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “The market is at a critical juncture with conflicting
signals leading to higher volatility,” Jitendra Panda, head of
broking at Capital First Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“ Core inflation  has fallen, while overall inflation is still
high. The bulls and bears are fighting a hard battle.”  Fifteen of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
central bank will cut the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.5
percent from 7.75 percent next week. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
last cut the repurchase rate by 25 basis points on Jan. 29 and
signaled lingering price pressures and risks such as a record
current-account gap left limited space for further easing.  ‘Violated Rules’  ICICI Bank tumbled 3.9 percent to 1,067.5 rupees, the most
since Feb. 28. HDFC Bank slid 1.5 percent to 639.4 rupees.  Axis
Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  lost 1 percent to 1,339.85 rupees, its lowest closing
price since Dec. 21. The three lenders are running a nationwide
“money laundering racket,” which has violated multiple rules
including tax and banking regulations, news website Cobrapost
reported yesterday after a sting operation.  Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Urjit Patel said after the
market closed yesterday the authority is “in touch” with the
banks. No notices have been issued, he said.  Maruti Suzuki fell 0.9 percent to 1,406.7 rupees. Tata
Motors slumped 3.3 percent to 291.1 rupees. The stock tumbled
4.2 percent this week after the company said March 12 sales of
Jaguar Land Rover dropped 22 percent last month in China, its
biggest market. Indian carmakers are bracing for their first
industrywide annual sales drop, with local deliveries having
fallen 4.6 percent to 1.71 million units in the 11 months ended
February, data from the  producers’  group show.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, lost 1.9 percent to 843.65 rupees.  GAIL India
Ltd. (GAIL) , the nation’s largest gas supplier, plunged 2.8 percent to
323.3 rupees.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest mobile-phone
operator, dropped 1.4 percent to 310.3 rupees.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index of the National Stock Exchange of
India lost 0.6 percent to 5,872.65 Its March futures settled at
5,901. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the Nifty, sored 3.4 percent to 15.16.  Foreign funds bought a net $105 million worth of shares
yesterday, a 10th day of inflows, data from the regulator show.
They’ve purchased $9.5 billion of stocks this year, a record for
the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show, amid efforts by the
government to reform the economy by cutting subsidies, allowing
higher foreign investment and hastening infrastructure projects
in a bid to revive growth.  The  Sensex (SENSEX)  is  valued  at 13.2 times projected 12-month
profits, compared with 14.3 times on Jan. 25, when the gauge
climbed to a two-year high, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That compares with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.6 times.  To contact the reporters on this story:
