Japan  plans to compile an action
program to tackle climate change with a new greenhouse gas
emissions target.  The government aims to put together the action plan before
U.N. climate talks to be held in  Poland  in November, Kentaro
Doi, an official at the Ministry of the Environment in charge of
climate change, said today.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government, which took power in
late December, is currently reviewing energy and climate change
policy.  The government will review the previous administration’s
goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent from 1990 levels
by 2020, the government’s taskforce on climate change, said in a
statement today.  The new action plan will map out measures to achieve a new
emissions target, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
