Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISN) , the world’s
largest maker of premium chocolate, reported 2012 profit that
missed analysts’ estimates as most chocolate markets stagnated.  Net income rose 12 percent to 271.9 million francs ($287
million) in 2012, the Kilchberg, Switzerland-based company said
in a statement today. That missed the 277 million-franc average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The chocolate
maker proposed to increase the dividend 15 percent to 575 francs
per registered share.  Lindt said it expects a “difficult economic environment”
in 2013 as rising unemployment weighs on consumer spending,
especially in southern  Europe , though the company is “well-
placed to face the coming challenges.”  The company said it expects to meet its long-term goals for
sales and profitability this year after it outperformed rivals
in markets that were mostly unchanged or declined “slightly.”
The long-term targets are annual organic sales growth of 6
percent to 8 percent, with an improvement of the operating
profit margin of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points.  “Not only the key markets in Europe and North America, but
also the new  emerging markets  in  Russia , Asia and South America
will play a role,” Lindt said. The Swiss chocolatier also said
there are “some signs” the Swiss franc is weakening, which may
boost exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
