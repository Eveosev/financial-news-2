Arabica coffee fell to a three-week
low as stockpiles climbed to the highest since 2010 before the
start of the harvest in top grower  Brazil . Cocoa advanced.  Inventories in warehouses monitored by the ICE Futures U.S.
exchange in New York were at 2.4 million bags as of yesterday,
the highest since March 4, 2010,  exchange data  on Bloomberg
showed. Brazil will harvest 47 million to 48 million bags of
coffee this year, a record for a year in which trees enter the
lower-yielding half of their cycle, said growers cooperative
Cooparaiso in Sao Sebasitiao do Paraiso in Minas Gerais, the
nation’s largest arabica-producing state. Futures fell 3.4
percent so far this week after rising 0.5 percent last week.  “So here we are, about 10 cents a pound off the highs of
last week,” Thiago Cazarini, a broker at Cazarini Trading Co.
in Varginha in  Minas Gerais , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. “It just doesn’t look good again. Will it test $1.35
a pound, $1.30 a pound? Probably yes.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in May declined 0.3 percent to
$1.392 a pound by 7:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
price touched $1.391, the lowest since Feb. 20. Robusta coffee

pound by June 30, the average estimate of 14 brokers and
analysts showed. The beans were the worst-performing commodity
of 2012 in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials.  “The commercial end of the market continues to be
uninspired,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Cocoa for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to $2,140 a ton in
 New York . Cocoa for May delivery added 0.2 percent to 1,444
