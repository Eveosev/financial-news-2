CFR Pharmaceuticals SA (CFR) , Chile’s
largest drug developer, fell the most in five months after
reporting fourth-quarter earnings that were below some analysts’
expectations.  CFR retreated 1.8 percent to 125.01 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago, its steepest decline since Sept. 21. The
country’s benchmark  Ipsa index  lost 0.9 percent.  The pharmaceuticals  producer , which has operations in 18
countries including Thailand and  Vietnam , said in a statement
yesterday that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 38 percent to $35.8 million. According to
calculations by Banco de Chile, Ebitda was $25.7 million, below
the bank’s projection of $27.6 million.  “The lower Ebitda was due to higher sales and management
costs related to merger and acquisitions activity,” according
to the Banco de  Chile  report. “We can’t rule out downward
pressure on the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
