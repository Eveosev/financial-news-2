New York  Mets All-Star third
baseman  David Wright  will skip baseball activity for three to
five days, and his status for opening day is in question, due to
an intercostal strain on his right side.  Wright, 30, who was scratched from a World Baseball Classic
game two days ago, was diagnosed in New York yesterday with a
moderate strain, Mets General Manager  Sandy Alderson  told
reporters.  “Anything about his condition for opening day I think
right now would be speculative,” Alderson said. “Is it
possible that he’ll be out for a period of time, sure. But what
we know right now is that he’s going to rest for three to five
days and we’ll see what happens.”  The intercostal muscles are several groups of muscles
located between the ribs that function to move and stabilize the
chest wall, according to the chiropractic website  BodyMotion .  Wright, a six-time All-Star, batted .306 last season with
21 home runs and 93 runs batted in.  The Mets open their season April 1 against the  San Diego
Padres .  To contact the reporter on this story:
