U.S. farmers will plant more corn
and soybean acres than the government forecast last month,
according to a survey of growers by  Allendale Inc.  Wheat
planting will rise for a third consecutive year, it said.  Farmers indicated they will sow 96.956 million acres with
corn, Allendale said today in an e-mailed release. That’s down
from last year’s 97.155 million acres and above the 96.5 million
that the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast on Feb. 22.  Soybean plantings will rise to 78.324 million acres from
77.198 million last year, according to Allendale’s 24th annual
survey of farmers, which was conducted this year from Feb. 25 to
March 8. The USDA said last month that 77.5 million acres would
be sown this year.  The combined area planted with all wheat varieties will
rise to 56.261 million acres from 55.736 million in 2012,
according to the survey by Allendale, a farm-market adviser and
brokerage based in McHenry,  Illinois . Last month, the USDA said
farmers would sow 56 million acres.  The USDA on March 28 is scheduled to release the results of
a national survey of farmers’ planting intentions, taken this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
