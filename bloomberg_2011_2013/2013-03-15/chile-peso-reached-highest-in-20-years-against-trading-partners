The Chilean peso’s multilateral
exchange rate, which measures the currency’s strength against
the Andean country’s major trading partners, reached its
strongest level last month in at least 20 years, the country’s
central bank said.  An index that tracks the peso against the currencies of 20
countries fell to 94.31 in February, the lowest on record in
data going back to 1992, according to a statement on the  central
bank’s website . Today the currency was little changed at 471.55
per  U.S. dollar  as of 11:29 a.m.  New York  time.  “Against the dollar it’s pretty much flat but against
other economies to which Chile exports, the peso is
appreciating, which is worrying,” said Ruben Catalan, an
economist at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago.  Chilean officials have been monitoring the currency’s
appreciation to assure it doesn’t crimp economic growth by
choking off exports. In a policy statement yesterday, the
central bank noted that the currency had appreciated on a
“multilateral basis,” contrasting with the prior month’s
comparison to the dollar alone.  Expansionary monetary policy in  Japan  had caused the yen to
depreciate, the Chilean central bank said in yesterday’s
statement. The peso reached a four-year high against the yen on
March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
