Treasuries rose for the first time
in three days as investors sought safety after a gauge of U.S.
 consumer confidence  unexpectedly dropped and U.S. stocks fell.  Bonds were little changed earlier, with 10-year yields
trading above 2 percent for a sixth day. The Fed will  buy  as
much as $5.75 billion of Treasuries today due from December 2017
to November 2018 in a program to bolster growth.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 2 percent at 10:10 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
sentiment index for March fell to 71.8, the lowest level since
December 2011, from 77.6 in February. The gauge was projected to
increase to 78, according to the median estimate of 67
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
