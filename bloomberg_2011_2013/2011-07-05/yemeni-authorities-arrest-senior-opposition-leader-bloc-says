Yemeni opposition leader Hasan Zaid
said he was detained by authorities at the airport for a few
hours today before being released.  Zaid said in a telephone interview that he was held because
he hadn’t responded to a summons to appear in court to address
charges that he instigated protesters to occupy government
buildings. He said he was aware of the summons though he never
received it.  Zaid is secretary-general of al-Haq, one of six opposition
parties that make up the opposition Joint Meeting Parties
coalition.  Zaid was detained shortly before he was due to take a
flight to  Saudi Arabia , Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for his
bloc, said earlier.  Yemeni officials couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
