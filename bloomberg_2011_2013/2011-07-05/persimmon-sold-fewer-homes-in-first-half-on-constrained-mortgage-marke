Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s third-
largest homebuilder by volume, said it sold 4.7 percent fewer
homes in the first six months of the year as the mortgage market
remained “constrained.”  Persimmon completed the sale of 4,439 homes compared with
4,657 a year earlier, the York, England-based company said today
in a statement. That generated sales of about 715 million pounds
($1.2 billion).  “Conditions in the mortgage market are constrained, but we
are seeing gradual improvements,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Farley said in an interview. “The industry is in talks with the
 Council of Mortgage Lenders  about creating a 95 percent loan-to-
value product.”  U.K. house prices fell for a second month in June as the
growth in the supply of properties for sale outpaced demand,
Hometrack Ltd. said last week. Mortgage advances fell 10 percent
to 33 billion pounds in the first quarter from the previous
three months, the U.K. Financial Services Authority said on June
21.  Persimmon expects a similar number of home sales for the
full year. There will be increase in home sales in the second
half as the company’s order book at June 30 was ahead of last
year at 725 million pounds, the housebuilder said.  The operating profit margin for the period was 9 percent,
compared with 8 percent a year earlier, and should reach typical
industry levels of profitability about 15 percent in a “couple
of years,” Farley said.  Persimmon was little changed at 491.4 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close in  London . The stock has gained 18 percent this year,
raising the company’s market value to 1.48 billion pounds.  Persimmon’s average selling price was 162,000 pounds in the
first half compared with 168,936 a year earlier, as buyers
bought smaller homes. That should increase in the second half
with the sale of larger properties included in the order book,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
