Personal bankruptcies in the U.S.
fell in the first half of the year as Americans found other ways
to reduce debt, the  American Bankruptcy Institute  said.  Consumers filed 709,303 bankruptcies through June,
7.9 percent fewer than in the same period a year earlier,
Alexandria, Virginia-based ABI said today in a statement.  “The drop in bankruptcies for the first half of the year
shows the continued efforts of consumers to reduce their
 household debt , and the overall pullback in consumer credit,”
ABI Executive Director Samuel Gerdano said in the statement.  Filings in June rose 4.3 percent from a month earlier, when
personal bankruptcies declined the most since October 2006.
Consumers filed 114,803 bankruptcies in May, down from 136,142 a
year earlier, the ABI reported last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
