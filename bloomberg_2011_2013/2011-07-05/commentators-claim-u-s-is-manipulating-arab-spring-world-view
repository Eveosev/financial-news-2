Given the amount of tumult stirring in the  Middle East  today, it is little wonder that some commentators in the Arabic media are putting forward grand narratives to make sense of it all. One theme keeps rising to the top: the idea that a counter-revolution is underway. Recalling the earlier efforts of U.S. President  George W. Bush  to fashion a “new Middle East,” Hafez al-Barghouthi, editor-in-chief of the Palestinian Authority’s official daily  Al-Hayat al-Jadidah , suggested “a new ‘dirtier’ Middle East” might be unfolding. A number of interests, he said, were manipulating the recent Arab uprisings for their own ends. U.S. efforts to bring democracy to Iraq,  he argued , were an earlier opportunity to “redraft the map of a better Middle East based on an ethnic and confessional mosaic,” which, in reality, tends to produce constant conflict and disunity. Today’s regional uprisings,  he said , “probably constitute a fertile environment for the implementation of this plan/conspiracy, because the uprisings eliminated pan-Arab slogans that unify, and allowed the emergence of tribal, regional and sectarian tendencies as if they were implementing the previous American policy in  Iraq .” In an editorial, the independently-owned daily  Al-Khaleej , based in the  United Arab Emirates , wrote that the fact that Iraq must constantly struggle to emerge as a unified, independent state is proof of “an old project,” favored by outside powers and executed from within, to dismantle the region in order to better control it. Al-Khaleej decried  what it called the “bomb” exploded recently by the head of Iraq’s parliament, Osama al-Najifi, when he alluded to the creation of a Sunni territory in the middle of Iraq and a Shiite territory in the south, along the lines of the Kurdish territory in the north. “Salvation can only occur by clinging to a united Iraq and via a pullout by the occupation forces at the end of the year,”  wrote Al-Khaleej . There must not be “any project aimed at keeping the occupation and its chaos on top of the chests of the Iraqis,”  Al-Khaleej concluded . “This is what we must confront in the remaining six months of this year. Let Iraq redeem itself, let it live.” Columnist  Moustafa Zein lamented  what he saw as  Israel ’s gains in recent months. Writing in the Jerusalem-based Al-Quds, a daily closely associated with the party of Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas , Zein remarked that only “a few months ago, Israel was being subjected to an intense international seclusion.” Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  “was siding with Hamas, flirting with Iran and Hezbollah, enhancing his relationships with  Syria  and thinking that the interest of his country lies in siding against the Hebrew state.” The Egyptian revolution had ousted a regime “that Israel had always depended on in order to abort any opposing Arab consensus.” At that time, the Israelis “theorized heavily about the loss of their role in the Middle East.”  Zein continued : Pointing to statements by the ruling military junta in Cairo that the Camp David Accords with Israel would not be abrogated, as well as the recent announcement of a direct dialogue between U.S. officials and Egypt’s powerful Muslim Brotherhood,  Zein argued  that both trends portend well for Israel. In the latter case, he wrote, the U.S. will likely use all its power, and its influence over  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf countries, to reign in any meaningful anti-Israeli activities. “Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has the right to show off and be proud,”  Zein wrote . “The counter revolution against the Arab Spring has achieved what he has never dreamt of.” Commenting on the U.S. talks with the Brotherhood, Ma'mun Findi, a columnist in the London-based Asharq al-Awsat,  asked bluntly , “Is the United States handing over  Egypt  to the Muslim Brotherhood as it handed over Iraq to Iran?” His column was of special interest because it bucked the trend of Brotherhood-friendly stories in Saudi-owned media, perhaps by implicating the Kingdom’s number one enemy, Iran. Wrote Findi : Findi added  that he is “afraid of the Muslim Brotherhood because they are essentially a copy of the previous regime.” For Findi and other commentators, the Arab Spring has lost its bounce.
