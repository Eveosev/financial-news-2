Kenya  failed to hold a weekly coffee
auction because of insufficient supplies, the Nairobi Coffee
Exchange said.  “We didn’t have enough stocks to hold an auction,” acting
Chief Executive Officer David Muriithi said by phone today from
the capital, Nairobi. “The cold conditions have affected the
drying process.”  Regular weekly auctions will resume next week and supplies
are expected to rise in August and September, he said. Coffee
production will be 825,000 bags in the 2011-12 season starting
in October compared with 750,000 bags a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
