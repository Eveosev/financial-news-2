Abu Dhabi ’s stock index rose the most
in almost three weeks, pacing gains in the United Arab Emirates,
before companies start reporting second-quarter earnings.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , the U.A.E.’s third-largest
bank by assets, gained 2.2 percent. Emirates Telecommunications
Corp., the Persian Gulf nation’s biggest phone company, advanced
for the first time this week. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
jumped 0.5 percent, the most since June 16, to 2,729.28 at the 2
p.m. close in the emirate. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  advanced
0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.3 percent
at 1:17 p.m. in  Riyadh .  “The majority of institutional investors are sitting on
their hands awaiting evidence of earnings growth in second-
quarter numbers,” said  Julian Bruce , equity sales head at EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai.  Abu Dhabi Commercial may return to profit in the second
quarter, according to an EFG-Hermes Holding analyst estimate
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank may report a profit of 1.4
billion dirhams ($381 million) after a loss of 527 million
dirhams a year earlier, according to the estimate. The company,
which has the fifth-heaviest weighting on Abu Dhabi’s gauge, is
scheduled to report July 29.  Abu Dhabi Commercial gained to 3.23 dirhams, the highest
since June 19. Etisalat rose 0.9 percent, the most since June
19, to 11 dirhams.  Even after Dubai’s benchmark stock index trimmed a gain of
2.4 percent on July 3, “upside potential remains high over the
coming weeks,” said Adel Merheb, Dubai-based technical analyst
at Shuaa Capital PSC.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  and Kuwait’s SE Price Index climbed 0.3
percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  and Qatar’s  QE
Index (DSM)  rose 0.2 percent, while Bahrain’s gauge was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
