The U.S. will probably adopt
International Financial Reporting Standards, said Hans Hoogervorst, the new chairman of the London-based accounting
organization IASB.  The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board, which wanted
to expand the use of fair-value accounting to all financial
assets, has dropped that model and “that has made talking to
each other a lot easier,” Hoogervorst told delegates at an IFRS
conference in Zurich today.  “We still have quite a few things to resolve, but I’m
positive about the outcome,” Hoogervorst, a former Dutch
finance minister, said in his first public speech since taking
over from David Tweedie as chairman of the  International
Accounting Standards Board  on July 1.  A dispute between the U.S. and the IASB about how to value
financial instruments threatened to derail efforts to align
global standards, affecting how trillions of dollars of assets
are marked on bank balance sheets.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated
it will make a decision later this year on incorporating IFRS,
Hoogervorst said.  “The U.S. is the largest national  capital market  in the
world with some of most developed and sophisticated accounting
standards, therefore it’s appropriate that the SEC has taken its
time,” he said. The U.S. will want to maintain its leadership
in international financial reporting, making it “very hard to
fathom a negative decision by the U.S.,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
