The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose for a second day,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 7 basis points to 228 at 4 p.m. in London. An
increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on  Greece  jumped 42 basis points to 1,920,
according to CMA. Swaps on Ireland climbed 10 basis points to
733,  Italy  increased 10 to 192 and Portugal rose 12 to 769,
while  Spain  was 7 higher at 270 and Belgium was up 4 at 149.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 10
basis points to 397, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.25 basis points to 106.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 7.5 basis points to 161 and
the subordinated index climbed 10 to 286.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
