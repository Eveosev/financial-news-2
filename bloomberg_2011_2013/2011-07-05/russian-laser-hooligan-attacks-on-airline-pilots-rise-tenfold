Laser “hooligans” tried to blind
the pilots of two passenger planes landing at an international
airport in Moscow today as attacks with light-beam pointers
surge in  Russia .  The planes touched down safely at Vnukovo airport after
unknown assailants aimed laser pointers into the cockpits at
about 2:00 a.m. Moscow time, Sergei Izvolsky, a spokesman for
the Federal Air Transport Agency, said today by phone. One plane
was arriving from Istanbul and the other flying from Yakutsk in
Russia’s Far East, he said.  “Landing is usually done manually, so temporary blindness
during the approach is a threat,” Izvolsky said.  More than 50 cases of “laser hooliganism” have been
recorded this year, compared with five last year, Izvolsky said,
adding that most have occurred in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
Several pilots were temporarily blinded in attacks this year
without serious consequences, he said.  Chechnya banned sales of laser pointers today after a
similar incident yesterday, which led to the arrest of 17-year-
old boy, the Rossiya 24 state television channel said on its
website.  The Rostov police have called for similar measures, RIA
Novosti said today. A man with a laser pointer was arrested on
June 26 for trying to blind pilots, the news service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
