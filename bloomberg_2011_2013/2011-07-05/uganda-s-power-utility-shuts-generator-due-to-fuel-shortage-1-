The state-owned Uganda Electricity
Generation Co. shut down one of its thermal generators because
of a fuel shortage, Managing Director Eriasi Kiyimba said,
deepening the country’s energy shortage.  “We have run out of fuel because we are indebted to
suppliers,” Kiyimba said by phone today from the capital,
Kampala. “One thermal generator of 50 megawatts was shut down
yesterday.”  The East African nation, which is reliant on thermal
generators for about 47 percent of its electricity, now has an
energy shortfall of as much as 120 megawatts during periods of
peak demand, he said. The government is working to pay subsidies
to the company so that it can pay its suppliers, Kiyimba said.  Uganda is set to boost its power output when the 250-
megawatt Bujagali hydropower plant starts supplying 50 megawatts
to the national grid in October, with full capacity expected in
April 2012, President Yoweri Museveni said on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
