Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, is seeking about 2.5 billion pounds ($4
billion) for the 632 branches it’s selling to comply with a
European Union ruling on taxpayer aid, two people familiar with
the sales process said.  The deadline for the first round of bids is next week, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the matter is
private. A Lloyds spokeswoman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
