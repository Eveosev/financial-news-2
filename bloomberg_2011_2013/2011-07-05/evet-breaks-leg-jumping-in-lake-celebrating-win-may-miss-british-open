Thomas Levet will miss golf’s  British
Open  after sustaining a small shin-bone fracture three days ago
jumping in a lake to celebrate his French Open victory.  The Frenchman, 42, will undergo surgery tomorrow and be
sidelined for six weeks. The British Open will be played July
14-17 at Royal St. George’s in Sandwich,  England .  “I will have screws and a plate inserted which will ensure
that my shin recovers completely,” Levet, second to Ernie Els
at the 2002 Open after a playoff, said in a statement. “I will
be off six weeks, which is very bad timing with so many
important tournaments coming up. However, the wonderful memory
of winning my national Open will definitely keep me going
through my recovery.”  Levet will be replaced at the British Open by American
Robert Garrigus, who was first on the reserve list.  The victory at  Le Golf National  in Paris was Levet’s sixth
on the European Tour and his first in two years. He’s 137th in
the  Official World Golf Ranking .  To contact the reporter on this story:
