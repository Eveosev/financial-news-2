Gold climbed the most in five weeks
as a deteriorating credit outlook for  China ’s banks boosted
demand for precious metals to hedge against declines in other
assets.  Shares of Chinese banks fell after Moody’s Investors
Service said lenders may hold more problem loans than had been
anticipated. Gold futures dropped 3.7 percent in the previous
two weeks as Greece took steps to avoid default, curbing
investor demand.  “The crack in the armor out of China is keeping gold well
bid,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in  Chicago .  Gold for immediate delivery rose $12.28, or 0.8 percent, to
$1,509.35 an ounce at 10:45 a.m. in New York. A close at that
level would be the biggest jump since May 27.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for August delivery
climbed $27.10, or 1.8 percent, to $1,509.70. The exchange was
closed yesterday for the Independence Day holiday.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
rose as much as 1.1 percent, boosting the appeal of the precious
metal as a hedge against inflation.  “There’s broad-based commodity optimism that’s spilling
over to gold,” Klopfenstein said. “Higher commodity prices are
inflationary.”  Silver futures for September delivery jumped $1.25, or 3.7
percent, to $34.955 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery increased $24.30, or
1.4 percent, to $1,741.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Palladium futures for September delivery gained
$14.95, or 1.9 percent, to $772.40 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
