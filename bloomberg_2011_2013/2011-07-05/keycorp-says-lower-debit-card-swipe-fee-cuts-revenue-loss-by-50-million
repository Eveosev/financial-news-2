KeyCorp (KEY) , Ohioâ€™s second-largest bank,
said revised U.S. curbs on debit-card swipe fees will cut
interchange revenue by $50 million to $60 million, about half
the damage the bank previously estimated.  The new figure includes a higher cap than the one
originally set by the Federal Reserve Board plus an added fee to
cover the cost of fraud, Cleveland-based KeyCorp said today in a
filing with securities regulators. The lender said in December
that the proposed rules would slice about $100 million of
revenue from swipe fees, known as interchange, which merchants
pay when consumers make purchases with debit cards.  Under pressure from banks, the Fed last week almost doubled
the 12-cent ceiling that the central bank first suggested in
September to 21 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
