Asian stocks fell as Chinese banks
declined after Moody’s Investors Service said mainland lenders
may hold more problem loans on their books than had been
anticipated.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of  China  Ltd., the world’s
largest lender by market value, fell 0.5 percent in  Hong Kong .

based in the area worst hit by the March 11 tsunami, advanced

its increasingly large contribution to global growth,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in global equities as a
portfolio manager at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “Any
slowdown in the rate of growth has heightened flow-on effects to
growth expectations, not only in China but globally.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent to 136.92 as
of 7:31 p.m. in Tokyo, reversing earlier gains of as much as 0.2
percent. About an equal numbers of shares rose and fell on the
1,018-member gauge. Through yesterday, the index fell 2.6
percent from this year’s high on May 2 amid concern a slowing
U.S. economy,  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and China’s steps

the Hang Seng index. Bank of China Ltd. declined 0.3 percent to
HK$3.86.  Chinese banks fell after Moody’s said in a report today the
potential scale of problem loans at the lenders may be closer to
its stress case than its base case. The ratings agency said the
credit outlook for the Chinese banking industry may turn
negative.  RBA Holds Rates  In Sydney, shares declined after RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens 
left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent and

percent to 416 yen and Fukuoka Financial Group Inc. increased

major banks following the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and on-
going nuclear crisis, are cheap, Nomura said in a report dated
yesterday. Share prices are close to bottoming, the report said.  In Hong Kong, real estate companies rose, as Shimao

HK$10.68. The company said first-half sales rose 26 percent from
a year earlier.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  also rose 3.4 percent

percent from a year ago to 4.06 billion yuan ($628 million).  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. increased 2.8 percent
