A Yemeni-owned boat caught fire in
the  Red Sea  after leaving Sudan, killing 197 non-Sudanese
passengers who were traveling illegally to  Saudi Arabia , the
state-run Sudanese Media Center  reported .  Three people were rescued and the search continues, SMC
reported today, citing unnamed sources. The boat had sailed for
four hours away from Sudan, and the cause of the fire is
unknown, the Khartoum-based news agency said. Four Yemenis who
own the boat were arrested, SMC said.  Authorities had foiled another attempt to smuggle 247
people from Sudanese soil mostly from foreign countries,
including Chad, Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea, the news agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
