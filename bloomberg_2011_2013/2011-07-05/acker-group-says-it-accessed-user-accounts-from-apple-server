The computer hacking group AntiSec
said over the weekend that it accessed user names and passwords
of an  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  server, a bid to draw the iPhone maker into a
surge of recent cyberattacks.  The group posted the materials of 27 user accounts and
passwords online at the website PasteBin and announced its
discovery July 3 on Twitter.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  and government agencies ranging from
the Central Intelligence Agency to Arizona Department of Public
Safety have been targeted by hacker groups in recent months. In
the case of Apple, which has more than 200 million registered
iTunes accounts, there’s no evidence that customer user names
and passwords were compromised, or if the post was just a prank.  AntiSec said on its Twitter feed that it was “not being so
serious.”  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, declined to comment.  Apple rose $6.17, or 1.8 percent, to $349.43 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 8.3 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
