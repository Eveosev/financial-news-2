OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer by output, climbed to its highest in almost
three years after MSCI Inc. said it will increase the company’s
weighting in its Russia Index as of the July 6 close of trade.  Uralkali’s shares jumped 5.9 percent to 256.94 rubles by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level since Aug.1,
2008.  The company’s weighting will rise to 4.3 percent from 2.7
percent, Andrey Amelin, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow,
said today in a note, based on the information in the MSCI
report. Inflows into the stock from funds tracking the MSCI
Russia Index may amount to $190 million, he said.  The decision to increase Uralkali’s weighting comes after
the company acquired its competitor OAO Silvinit,  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  said
in a statement e-mailed yesterday after the end of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
