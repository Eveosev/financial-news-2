African International Energy Plc, a
Johannesburg-based investor in energy projects on the continent,
said its shares will start trading at 0.50 euros ($0.72) each on
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange by July 8.  The  company , which listed 256.64 million shares on the
bourse in May, is in talks to buy a gas field in  South Africa 
and aims to build a geothermal plant in East Africa, Chief
Executive Officer Aldworth Mbalati said by phone today. It also
plans to resuscitate a  coal mine  in  Nigeria  with a view to
establishing a coal-fired power plant, he said.  African International is only listing its stock, meaning
it’s exempt from issuing a prospectus, and plans to raise
capital at a later stage, he said. “We have sufficient cash on
our books.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
