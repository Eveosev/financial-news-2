The tiny east Indian state of  Tripura , which shares a border with  Bangladesh , is almost never in the headlines. At most, 1 in 10 adult Indians would be able to name its capital, Agartala, and 1 in 100 could identify its chief minister,  Manik Sarkar . But last week Tripura was the cynosure of attention when the  Socioeconomic and Caste Census , independent India’s first attempt to record details of a person’s caste,  began its operations from the small village of Hezamara . A reporter for the Indian Express  produced a lovely dispatch : To most Indian Hindus,  caste -- an ancient, deep-rooted, and many-layered system of hereditary social stratification that involves four main orders ( varnas ) and thousands of sub-orders ( jatis ) -- is one of the foundational components of religious and social identity. This allows  access to the resources, both real and psychological, of a group larger than one’s family, or of a small society within the larger whole. One might think of caste as the one feature that makes the Hindu (and, by a long process of osmosis, often the Indian) sense of self distinctive. Mysterious in its workings to most outsiders, caste is one of the deepest of Indian realities. Yet  from the egalitarian standpoint of a modern democracy, it is also its most abiding and persuasive fiction, one that must be pulled up from the roots. Caste is in some ways an anthropologist's dream and a democrat's nightmare. The so-called caste census has many implications for Indian democracy, which has, from the time of independence in 1947, envisioned a society where caste would be far less influential as a social and economic force than it has been over the course of Indian history. But to try to make this happen, the government has resorted to “reservations,” or caste-based affirmative action, to neutralize the continuing power of upper castes over lower ones, thereby unavoidably perpetuating the very caste awareness that it seeks over the long term to undermine. It is a problem to which there are no easy answers, especially as, over the decades, the sphere of affirmative action has expanded and not diminished. As the Hindu pointed out  in a sage editorial  when the government made its decision to conduct a census that sought to quantify caste a year ago: The Indian Constitution, in its first Schedule in 1950, originally offered reservations to a certain number of notably underprivileged castes and tribes (thereafter called  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ). But since the 1990s it has brought within the ambit of the reservation system many other groups belonging to what are called  Other Backward Classes  (OBCs), offering them quotas in the public sector and in education based on an estimate of their cumulative size. Caste has, therefore, acquired a massive political charge in Indian democracy, and many of the smaller partners in the national coalition government have got to where they are by aggressively mobilizing votes from groups that  either are officially listed as OBCs or else seek to be declared so. It is within this context that  the government decided last year , under pressure from some of its coalition partners, to undertake a joint economic and caste survey. The subtlety and intricacy of the issue are quite thrilling, as evinced by the fact that two of India's best-known political commentators took very divergent positions last year in the debate that followed the declaration. In the Indian Express,  Pratap Bhanu Mehta  listed several reasons for why he considered the move a retrograde one. Among his most interesting points was this: While in the Hindu, the political scientist  Yogendra Yadav  argued: And in a very interesting paper published in the  Economic and Political Weekly , the researcher Sonalde Desai addressed some of the technical difficulties in making a comprehensive map of caste in India: What's my own position regarding the caste census? Ambiguous, I must admit. The citizen side of me, the side that loves the  Indian Constitution  and believes in its ideals, feels that the survey will increase caste consciousness, a sense of high and low, in Indian society. The side of me that  writes novels , on the other hand, and loves the density of novelistic depictions of human realities from within their own categories (no matter how minute) feels there would be much to learn from a more detailed map of caste in India.
