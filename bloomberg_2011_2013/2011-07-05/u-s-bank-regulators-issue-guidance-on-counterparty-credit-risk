U.S. banking regulators issued new
guidance on counterparty credit risk management for large banks,
stressing the need for adequate controls and measurement
systems.  The  Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of
Thrift Supervision said today the financial crisis of 2007-2009
“revealed weaknesses” in counterparty credit risk management
“at many banking organizations.”  The regulators pointed to the “shortcomings” in the
ability of banks to determine exposures in a timely way, and
noted “poor selection” of counterparty credit risk metrics.  Counterparty credit risk “management techniques have
evolved rapidly over the last decade, along with increased
complexity of derivative instruments,” the regulators said.
“Implementation of sound practices has been uneven across
business lines and counterparty types.”  Regulatory guidance, while not binding like a rule, is used
by bank examiners to set standards for financial institutions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
