EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal said its Twitter
account in the U.K. was hacked and later suspended, though no
user data were breached.  Attackers infiltrated the account and began tweeting
messages to PayPal U.K.’s 17,000 followers at about 3:15 p.m.
New York time.  “The PayPal U.K. Twitter handles, one of the many Twitter
handles we have for the company, was hacked this evening,” said
Anuj Nayar, spokesman for PayPal, in a telephone interview
today. “It’s now been turned off.”  “No account information or anything else was in any way,
shape or form breached or affected,” he said.  A tweet sent from the hacked account read, “PayPal can
freeze your funds for no reason, do not use PayPal!!” The
account’s photo and description was changed before being taken
down by Twitter.  The attack is the latest in a series including one
yesterday that compromised a Twitter account belonging to  News
Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox News that falsely reported that U.S. President
 Barack Obama  had been assassinated, Fox said in a statement. It
is unclear whether today’s incident involving PayPal U.K., a
division of  San Jose , California-based EBay, was related to
yesterday’s event.  The attack also comes a week after hackers said they had
taken down  MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s website to mark the six-month
anniversary of the company’s blocking of payments to WikiLeaks.  Other Targets  A spokesman for MasterCard attributed the company’s website
failure at that time to an Internet service provider outage.  Hackers said they targeted PayPal, MasterCard and  Visa Inc. (V) 
in December after the companies barred credit-card payments from
donors to  WikiLeaks , led by Julian Assange. WikiLeaks publishes
secret documents on the Web, including confidential U.S.
diplomatic documents.  In an e-mailed statement last week, Nayar said that
PayPal’s websites did not go down in December and that the
company was “always on alert for attacks against our site.”  “In this particular case, we actively reinforced our
security measures and we continue to be highly vigilant for
future attacks,” Nayar said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
