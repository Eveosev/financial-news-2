Shanks Group Plc (SKS) , a U.K. waste
management company, said trading in the three months to June 30
was in line with its forecasts. It announced at the same time
that Chief Executive Officer Tom Drury is to step down.  The company said in a statement on the Regulatory News
Service that “strong underlying growth continues” and it will
spend between 40 million pounds ($64 million) and 50 million
pounds this fiscal year as part of a 150 million-pound
investment program.  Shanks, based in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, said
a contract for a public-private partnership in  Belgium  has been
signed and will take effect in December. In the U.K., margins on
public finance initiative projects are achieving a 7 percent
target rate of return.  Shares of the company fell as much as 2.9 percent, to 123.4
pence, in  London  trading before recovering. They were down 0.6
percent, at 126.4 pence, at 11:20 a.m., giving the company a
market value of 502 million pounds.  Drury, who wishes to be closer to his home in Cheshire,
northwest  England , will leave Shanks by Oct. 31 to become CEO of
Arrow Global Ltd., a closely held business based in Manchester.
A search for a successor is under way, Shanks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
