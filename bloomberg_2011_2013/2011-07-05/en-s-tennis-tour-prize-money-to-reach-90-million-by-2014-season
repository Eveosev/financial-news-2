The men’s ATP World Tour will
increase its prize money over the next three years, topping $90
million for the first time by 2014.  The tennis tour announced the increase in purses for all
tournaments, excluding the four Grand Slam championships, after
a meeting of its board of directors.  “We are very pleased to have reached this agreement that
reflects the fact that business across the ATP World Tour is
stronger than ever,” ATP Chief Executive Officer and President
 Adam Helfant  said today in a  statement . “We are privileged to
be experiencing a golden era in men’s professional tennis, and
it is fitting that the commitment and excellence of the players
is recognized and rewarded in this way.”  Prize money for the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events will
rise by 9 percent in each of the next three years, while the
purse for the season-ending ATP World Finals in London will
increase to $6.5 million from $5 million over the same period.  The bonus pool payable to the world’s top 12 eligible
players will also grow 33 percent to $8 million in 2014.  The increases are a result of record attendances, increased
television and online viewership and new sponsors, the tour
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
