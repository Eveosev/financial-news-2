The Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing
Index rose to a record as better-than-forecast sales and jobs
data boosted  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  more than 6 percent.  The gauge of 30 retailers gained 2.4 percent to 557.26 at 4
p.m. in  New York , the highest level in records from September
1989. Kohl’s advanced 6.8 percent, the most in the  S&P 500 , to
$55.65 after its June same-store sales increased more than twice
the Retail Metrics Inc. estimate. Target, the second-largest
U.S. discount retailer, rose 6.7 percent to $51.67 after also
posting sales that beat forecasts.  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  surged
6 percent to $32.58 after Morgan Stanley advised buying the
shares.  Retailers in the S&P 500 trade for 20.3 times reported
earnings, or 31.9 percent more than the valuation for the
benchmark index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When
the premium reached 32.2 percent in January, it was the highest
since 2002.  “The market is predicting that the consumer will be fine
in the future,” said  Tim Hartzell , who oversees about $350
million as chief investment officer for Houston-based Sequent
Asset Management. “The price goes up while earnings lag because
the market knows that the early cyclicals are these retailers,”
he said. “They’re fully priced and there’s really no more
upside.”  U.S. companies added 157,000 workers to their June
payrolls, more than double the number forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey, ADP Employer Services reported today. The Labor
Department said first-time applications for  unemployment
insurance  fell last week. June sales were also helped by a drop
in gasoline prices. Gas in the U.S. has declined 10 percent from
a high of $3.99 a gallon on May 4, according to AAA.  Shares of  Gap Inc. (GPS) , the largest U.S. apparel retailer,
increased 5.2 percent to $19.28 after sales increased 1 percent,
beating the average projection for a decline of 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
