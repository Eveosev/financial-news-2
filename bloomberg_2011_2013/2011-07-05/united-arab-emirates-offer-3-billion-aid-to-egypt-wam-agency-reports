The United Arab Emirates offered an
aid package of $3 billion to Egypt during a visit by Egyptâ€™s
Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to  Abu Dhabi .  The grant includes $1.5 billion to create a fund for small-
and medium-sized Egyptian companies and boosting employment, the
state-run Emirates News Agency reported. It also includes $750
million toward housing projects for Egyptian youth as well as
$750 million in soft loans for various projects in Egypt.  Senior executives from a number of U.A.E. companies met
