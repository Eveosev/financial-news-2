Middle East crude oil for sale to
 Asia  remained at discounts to official selling levels even after
 Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. cut export prices yesterday.  Abu Dhabi’s Murban for August loading was unchanged at a
discount of 33 cents a barrel below its official selling price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Land was 41 cents
below, Bloomberg data showed.  The state oil producer reduced the June official selling
price of its flagship Murban grade by 1.3 percent to $112.15 a
barrel, it said yesterday in an e-mail to refiners. That leaves
the grade at a premium of $4.38 barrel to benchmark Dubai, less
than last month’s $5.22 difference.  Oman futures for September delivery rose 2 cents to $106.82
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:14 p.m. Singapore
time, with 2,221 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$105.35 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell $1.35, or 1.3
percent, to $105.63 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September slumped 1.3 percent to $105.32. Murban
declined 1.8 percent to $109.37.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, widened 84
cents to $5.90 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an oil and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September rose 59 cents to $5.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
