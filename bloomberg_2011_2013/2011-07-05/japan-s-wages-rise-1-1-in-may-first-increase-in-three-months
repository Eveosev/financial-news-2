bonuses rose 1.1 percent in May from a year earlier to 271,621
yen ($3,360), marking the first gain in three months, the Labor
Ministry said today in  Tokyo . The increase was driven by a 67.7
percent surge in special pay, a category that includes bonuses.
Scheduled pay fell 0.4 percent and overtime pay slid 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
