The group that awarded West Ham
United the use of the London Olympic stadium after next year’s
Games said it will start an independent investigation into one
of its worker’s consulting work for the soccer team.  “The auditors Moore Stephens have been appointed to carry
out this investigation into our procedures,” the Olympic Park
Legacy Co. said today in an e-mailed statement. “They have put
together a team led by their specialist forensic unit.”  The Olympic group said Dionne Knight undertook the work
with West Ham “without our knowledge or permission.”  The Sunday Times newspaper alleged last weekend that West
Ham made secret payments to an executive on a body that awarded
the stadium to the club. It said the information was found by
corporate investigators hired by north London-based Premier
League team Tottenham, which lost out in the contest for the
stadium.  West Ham said it’s taking legal action against fellow
Tottenham and the Sunday Times over the claims.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
