Wheat futures had the biggest gain in
almost seven weeks on concern that wet weather in the Great
Plains will slow the harvest in the U.S., the world’s leading
exporter.  Parts of  Kansas , the biggest U.S. winter-wheat growing
state, may have thunderstorms with as much as 1.5 inches of rain
(3.8 centimeters) for two days starting tomorrow, said Joel Widenor, the director of agricultural services at the Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. Some areas in  Nebraska 
may get as much as 4 inches of rain in the period, he said.  “You’re getting quite a storm system over northern Kansas
and southern Nebraska,” said Louise Gartner, the owner of
Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,  Ohio . “It’s going to delay
the harvest.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 23.25 cents, or
3.8 percent, to settle at $6.355 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Last week, the price tumbled 7.4
percent, the fifth straight decline, amid signs of higher global
production.  About 44 percent of the winter crop was  harvested  as of
June 26, ahead of the five-year average of 37 percent, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The agency will issue an
update later  today .  To contact the reporters on this story:
