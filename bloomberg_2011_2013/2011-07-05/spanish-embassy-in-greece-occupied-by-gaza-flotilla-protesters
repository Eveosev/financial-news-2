Protesters occupied  Spain ’s embassy
in Athens in support of a demand that ships be allowed to sail
to the Gaza Strip from Greek ports, an embassy spokeswoman said.  About seven protesters entered the embassy at 12:30 p.m.,
the spokeswoman, who declined to be identified, said by
telephone. The group, who would have been with a flotilla that
was prevented from setting sail at the weekend, want Spain to
support the lifting of a Greek government ban on ships leaving
the country’s ports bound for Gaza, the spokeswoman said.  Greece  banned ships from sailing to the Gaza Strip to break
Israel’s blockade on July 1. The government ordered the
coastguard to take “all appropriate measures” to enforce the
decision.  Israel said it won’t allow the flotilla to reach the Hamas-
controlled  Gaza Strip . A similar attempt by a previous flotilla
ended in violence in which nine Turks were killed on May 31 last
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
