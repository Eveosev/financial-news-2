The rand weakened for the first day
in seven against the dollar on speculation  Standard & Poor’s  may
give Greece’s bonds a default rating, curbing demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy declined as much
as 0.7 percent to 6.7689 per dollar, and traded 0.1 percent
weaker at 6.7260 as of 6:41 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand
strengthened for a fourth day against the euro, gaining 0.3
percent to 9.7347.  A rollover plan for financial aid to Greece, serving as the
basis for talks between investors and governments, would qualify
as a distressed exchange and prompt a “selective default”
rating, S&P said yesterday. European finance ministers agreed on
July 2 to disburse an 8.7 billion-euro ($12.6 billion) loan
payout to Greece by mid-July.  “The rand continues to take direction from offshore
developments,” Standard Bank Group Ltd. analysts including
Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan wrote in an e-mailed note
today. “Reports that some of the rating agencies might regard
the rolling over of debt by  Greece  as a technical default could
see risk appetite come off the boil.”  Government 13.5 percent notes due 2015 climbed 2 cents to
121.23 rand, driving the yield down one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.483 percent. The 6.75 percent securities
due 2021 rose 4 cents to 89.091 rand, driving the yield down
less than one basis point to 8.411 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
