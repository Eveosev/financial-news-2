Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK) , a
Turkish unit of Manama-based Albaraka Banking Group BSC, plans
to raise $200 million with a murabaha Islamic syndicated loan,
according the bank’s group chief executive.  The Shariah-compliant lender plans to hire banks by the end
of next week, said Adnan Ahmed Yousif, the Manama-based head of
Albaraka Banking in a telephone interview today.  Albaraka Turk’s Chief Executive Officer Fahrettin Yahsi
said in March the bank plans to borrow about $300 million via a
syndicated loan in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
