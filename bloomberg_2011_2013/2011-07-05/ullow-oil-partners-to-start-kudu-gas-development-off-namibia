Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and its Russian and
Japanese partners expect to agree on natural-gas sales from
Namibia’s Kudu field this year, allowing project development to
start in 2012.  “We’ve been making good progress, we have finalized the
concept there for gas to shore” delivery, Tullow Chief
Operating Officer Paul McDade said today in a phone interview.
“Given it’s a single gas supply to a single power station, we
prefer to do the work on the commercial agreements now before we
start any major expenditures.”  London-based Tullow,  Itochu Corp. (8001)  of Japan and Russia’s OAO
Gazprombank, which acquired a stake in Kudu from OAO Gazprom,
plan to develop the field to supply gas for power generation,McDade said.  The U.K. explorer with the most licenses in  Africa  has
reduced its  stake to 31 percent  from an earlier 70 percent in
the field, which holds about 1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas,
according to Gazprom estimates.  The Kudu gas project is expected to cost about $7 billion
and generate 800 megawatts of electricity for Namibia and export
to  South Africa , according to the state-run utility Namibia
Power Corp., National Petroleum Corp., which is Namibia’s state-
owned oil company, and government documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
