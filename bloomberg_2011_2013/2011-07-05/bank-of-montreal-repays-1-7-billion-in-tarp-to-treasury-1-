The U.S. Treasury Department said
today that Bank of Montreal repaid $1.7 billion following its
acquisition of Marshall and Ilsley Corp.  Bank of Montreal repaid the $1.7 billion in Troubled Asset
Relief Program capital, purchased warrants for common stock of
the bank for $3.3 million and paid dividends totaling $11.9
million.  The Treasury said with todayâ€™s capital repayment, TARP
proceeds total approximately $255 billion, exceeding the
original $245 billion investment in those programs. The Treasury
said it estimates the program will provide approximately $20
billion to taxpayers.  Bank of Montreal agreed in December to buy Milwaukee-based
Marshall and Ilsley for about $4.1 billion. As part of the deal,
the Toronto-based firm agreed to repay $1.7 billion of preferred
shares held by the U.S. government from its bailout of M&I.  That brought the total payment for the acquisition of M&I
to $5.8 billion. The deal was the third-largest U.S. acquisition
by a Canadian Bank or insurance company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
