Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, rose to its highest level in two weeks after the
government approved the use of genetically modified foods as
drought damages crops in the East African country.  The stock closed trading 5.6 percent higher at 10.45
shillings as of 3:00 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the strongest
level since June 21.  Kenya enacted a law allowing the use of genetically
modified organisms and products, including food, which took
effect this month, Hellen Sambili, the minister of higher
education, said in a government notice published on July 1. The
Star newspaper reported the information today.  “Unga had closed six of its processing plants so it means
they will have a respite because the maize shortage is really
biting,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based
Apex Africa Ltd., a brokerage, said in a phone interview today.
“This is a knee-jerk reaction from the market after the
announcement.”  Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki declared the drought a
national disaster on May 30. More than 10 million people living
in parts of Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and  Uganda  are
facing the worst drought conditions in six decades, according to
the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
