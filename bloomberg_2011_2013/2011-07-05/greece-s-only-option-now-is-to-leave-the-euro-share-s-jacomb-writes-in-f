The motives for the European Union’s
“rescue” of  Greece  are to preserve the euro and to prevent
another banking crisis, but the policy won’t work, said Martin Jacomb, the chairman of Share Plc, a former chairman of
Prudential Plc and a former director of the Bank of England.  Writing in the Financial Times, Jacomb said the EU’s future
depends on enabling its poorest members to become competitive
again, and that requires a quite different approach.  Greece can’t earn its way out of the mess it’s in, Jacomb
said, because its adoption of the euro made it uncompetitive,
and that will be the case as long as the euro remains its
currency. Regaining competitiveness always involves a temporary
reduction in labor costs and  living standards , and the only way
that can be accomplished with relative harmony is through
 currency devaluation , he argued.  Therefore, dismantling the euro is the least painful course
of action for Greece and for the EU, Jacomb concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
