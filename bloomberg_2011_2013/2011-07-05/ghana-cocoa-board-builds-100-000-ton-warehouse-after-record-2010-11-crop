Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, is building a warehouse to store 100,000 metric
tons after the 2010-11 crop reached a record and the country ran
short of facilities to keep the beans.  “We anticipated a bumper harvest this season, but we have
been overwhelmed by the volumes,” said Noah Amenyah, spokesman
for the Ghana Cocoa Board, which oversees the industry in the
West African nation. The warehouse will be built in the western
port city of Takoradi, he said by phone today.  Ghana produced 903,646 tons in the September-to-May main-
crop harvest, the Accra-based board said May 30. As many as
80,000 tons may be produced during the 12-week light crop that
started in June, Kwabena Asante-Poku, deputy chief executive
officer of the board, said June 29.  The country will have a cocoa-storage capacity of 700,000
tons after the Takoradi facility is constructed, Amenyah said.
It is also renovating other warehouses around the country, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
