Rains that started falling 10 days
ago in Ukraine slowed harvesting of winter wheat, according to
the national weather center.  Reaping will be delayed by about two weeks in total,
particularly in the country’s center, because plants have
ripened and now must dry before harvesting, Tetiana Adamenko,
head of the center’s agricultural department, said by phone
today from Kiev.  Winter wheat in the central Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions
suffered most from excessive rainfall, according to the
meteorologist. Some fields in those areas may have crop losses
of as much as 30 percent, she said.  Wet plants will bar combines from harvesting for another
three to five days, Adamenko said. That’s causing some declines
in the crop’s size and quality, she said.  The center estimates Ukraine’s total grain harvest this
year at 43 million tons, according to Adamenko. The forecast may
be lowered by around 1 million tons at the end of July because
of wheat and barley losses, she said. It may remain unchanged if
crop conditions stay favorable for corn, compensating for lost
wheat and barley.  Local corn, sunflower and sugar-beet crops are in very good
condition after the rains, Adamenko said. Humidity is
“optimal” for corn, she said, predicting a potential harvest
of between 13.8 million and 14 million tons of the grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
