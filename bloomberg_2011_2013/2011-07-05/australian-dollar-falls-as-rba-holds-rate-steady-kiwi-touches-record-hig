The Australian dollar fell against 12
of its 16 most-traded counterparts after the central bank left
its key interest rate unchanged and said growth this year is
unlikely to match earlier forecasts.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, touched a record
high after business confidence rebounded. The Aussie fell for a
second day against the U.S. currency as traders added to bets
that the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  will lower benchmark rates
this year. Two-year bond yields declined.  “The RBA has revised down growth in their forecasts,”
said  Richard Grace , Sydney-based chief currency strategist and
head of international economics at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia . “You’d expect local bond yields to adjust a little
lower and therefore interest-rate spreads will compress and put
some mild dampening pressure on the Australian dollar.”  Australia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0693 at
11:11 a.m. in  New York , from $1.0734 yesterday. It slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 86.69 yen, from 86.73 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 82.86 U.S.
cents, from 82.96 yesterday, after earlier rising to 83.32
cents, the highest since the currency was freely floated in
1985. It rose 0.2 percent to 67.19 yen, from 67.04 yen.  “Growth through 2011 is now unlikely to be as strong as
earlier forecast,” RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  said in a
statement accompanying the bank’s decision. “Over the medium
term, overall growth is still likely to be at trend or higher,
if the world economy grows as expected.”  Two-Year Note  Yields on the Australian two-year note fell five basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 4.70 percent and touched
4.69 percent, the lowest level since June 29.  The kiwi’s high of the day came as a confidence survey
raised prospects the central bank will raise interest rates. The
New Zealand Institute of Economic Research said a net 27 percent
of the 782 companies it surveyed expect the economy to improve
in the next six months. In the previous survey, a net 27 percent
saw a deterioration.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
