     July 5 (Bloomberg) --  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the largest
provider of wireless services to South Africans, said the
country’s Consumer Protection Act doesn’t make provision for
claims to be made against it for loss of business or income
after its network failed on June 30.  The company may be forced to refund South African customers
because of the network failure, Johannesburg’s Business Day
newspaper reported yesterday, citing National Consumer
Commissioner Mamodupi Mohlala. Vodacom will respond directly to
the commissioner and the telecommunications regulator on the
network outage, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-
mailed response to questions today.  Vodacom has “consistently outperformed the required
quality of service standards” expected from the Independent
Communications Authority of  South Africa , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
