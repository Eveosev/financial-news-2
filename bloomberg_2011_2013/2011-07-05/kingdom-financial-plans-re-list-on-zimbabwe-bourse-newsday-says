Kingdom Financial Holdings Ltd. will
restart trading its shares on the  Zimbabwe  Stock Exchange if
shareholders approve a plan submitted by the company’s board,
 Newsday  reported, citing Chief Executive Lynne Mukonoweshuro.  The re-listing on the southern African nation’s bourse
follows Kingdom’s split from Meikles Africa Ltd. last year,
Harare-based Newsday said. The financial services company,
dominated by its lending unit, returned to profit last year
after losing money in 2009, Newsday said.  Meikles Africa and Kingdom merged in 2008 to form Kingdom
Meikles Africa Ltd. The merger was short-lived and the companies
finalized their split this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
