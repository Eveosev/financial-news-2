After failing to predict this year’s
Treasury rally, Wall Street’s biggest bond traders are sticking
to forecasts that  government bonds  will fall as the economy
recovers and concerns over a European debt crisis recede.  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes will rise to 3.5 percent
by the end of 2011 from this year’s low of 2.84 percent on June
27, according to a Bloomberg News survey of the 20 bond dealers
that serve as counterparties to the  Federal Reserve  in its open
market transactions. The higher rate is still only half the 7
percent average on the securities over the past four decades.  While Speaker of the House  John Boehner  says the country is
broke, and the Federal Reserve has flooded the financial system
with dollars, U.S. debt has returned 2.09 percent since
December, including reinvested interest, almost triple the 0.7
percent for government bonds worldwide, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields near record lows have
frustrated fixed-income investors looking for more return.  “People make comments that rates can’t stay this low
because there is sticker shock when they look how far we’ve
come,” said Jeffrey Schoenfeld, a partner and chief investment
officer in  New York  at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which
manages $33 billion in assets. “But we are in a moderate growth
recovery with little evidence of inflation pressure and the Fed
in no hurry to change its stance. The path of least resistance
is very low” rates for a long time, he said.  Top Performers  Treasuries fell the most in almost two years last week,
pushing 10-year yields to the highest level since May as Greek
lawmakers approved budget cuts needed for a second bailout to
avoid default.  Yields on 10-year notes rose 32 basis points, or 0.32
percentage point, to 3.19 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 3.125 percent securities maturing in May 2021
dropped 2 23/32, or $27.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 16/32.
The increase was the biggest since yields climbed 37 basis
points during the five days ended Aug. 7, 2009.  Ten-year yields declined three basis points to 3.15 percent
at 12:27 p.m. today in New York.  Treasuries outperformed all Group of Seven debt in the
first half. The U.K returned 1.78 percent, Canada 1.79 percent,
Italy 1.68 percent and  Japan  0.6 percent. German and French debt
left investors with losses.  Corporate Debt  Corporate debt has done even better, gaining 3.2 percent
this year as companies sold $1.9 trillion of bonds, a 24 percent
increase from the same period of 2010.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index of stocks has risen 7.57
percent this year. The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities has slid
13 percent from the high this year reached on April 8. Companies
and consumers are starting to get relief from energy costs, as
crude oil has fallen 17 percent from this year’s peak of $114.83
a barrel on May 2.  Inflation expectations are rising. Yields on 10-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities show bond traders
project an average 2.41 percentage point inflation rate during
the life of the debt, higher than the five-year average of 2.07
percent and up from 1.5 percentage points in August 2010 when
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first indicated the central bank
might begin the second round of asset purchases, or quantitative
easing, known as QE2.  After buying $1.7 trillion in securities through last year,
increasing the amount of money in circulation to prevent
deflation, the central bank started a $600 billion program that
ended last week. QE2 also succeeded in driving investors into
riskier assets. Since its start, the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  has risen 13
percent.  Negative Position  Boehner has repeated “we’re broke” since he was House
Minority Leader, saying it last year as Congress was considering
a $26 billion aid package for state and local governments, and
as House Speaker on Feb. 15, when the 10-year yield was at 3.60
percent. He stopped saying it as borrowing costs declined, with
the yield on the 10-year note falling to a 2011 low of 2.84
percent on June 27.  U.S. debt outstanding has grown to $9.26 trillion in
marketable Treasuries, equivalent to about 66 percent of gross
domestic product, from $4.34 billion in mid-2007, before the
recession and collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Still, financing the deficit has become less of a burden,
with yields on all benchmark  Treasury securities  below 4.4
percent and interest expense accounting for 2.7 percent of GDP
in 2010, matching the lowest rate since at least 1998, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Treasuries returned 5.88 percent
last year after losing 3.71 percent in 2009.  Primary Dealers  Primary dealers are betting that the second half of the
year will be different with the U.S economy forecast to expand,
the Fed winding down debt purchases and officials in  Europe 
compromising to prevent  Greece  defaulting on its debt.  The 20 firms have a negative $44.5 billion position in
Treasury notes and bonds, compared with the negative $11 billion
average of the last three years, indicating they expect prices
will fall.  Revenue of S&P 500 companies will climb 10 percent this
year, twice the rate of 2010, according to data from analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. That will help increase 2011 profit even
as companies run out of opportunities to reduce costs by firing
workers or closing factories.  Business activity in the U.S. expanded at a faster pace in
June as orders and production picked up, signaling manufacturing
will keep driving growth in the world’s largest economy.  Business Barometer  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said last
week its business barometer climbed to 61.1 in June from 56.6 in
May. Economists called for the index to drop to 54, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater
than 50 signal expansion.  Two years after the 18-month recession ended in June 2009,
the expansion is “continuing at a moderate pace, though
somewhat more slowly” than anticipated, Fed policy makers said
on June 22. The officials said the economy will grow 2.7 percent
to 2.9 percent this year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1
percent to 3.3 percent in April.  Consumer spending  stagnated in May as payrolls rose at the
slowest pace in eight months, and the  unemployment rate  climbed
to 9.1 percent from 9 percent in April, according to Commerce
and Labor Department data.  ‘Sputtering, Not Stalling’  The  U.S. economy  is “sputtering, but not stalling,”
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a June 23 research note to
clients. The “recent disappointment in first-half growth is not
yet long enough or deep enough to tilt the balance of risks
toward recession,”  Andrew Tilton , an economist at Goldman Sachs
in New York, wrote.  The Fed will remain the biggest buyer of Treasuries as it
uses its $2.86 trillion balance sheet to spur the economy by
purchasing  U.S. government debt  with proceeds from the maturing
securities it owns. That could mean as much as $300 billion of
government debt over the next 12 months without adding money to
the financial system.  “We’ve still got a Fed hell bent on increasing inflation
expectations, negative real returns and risk assets continuing
to outperform,” said David Zervos, the global head of fixed-
income strategy in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., the most
bearish of the 20 primary dealers, expecting the yield to hit
4.25 percent by year end.  If he’s right, 10-year note investors will lose 6.8
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The recovery
and reflation trade is still under way and that will send rates
higher,” he said.  Greek Austerity Measures  The Greek Parliament last week approved Prime Minister
George Papandreou’s 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of
tax increases and asset sales that was a condition of receiving
further European Union aid and staving off default.  “At these levels we are really pricing in complete
disaster and that’s just not what we are seeing,” said  Michael Cloherty , the head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income and
currencies at the primary dealer Royal Bank of  Canada  in New
York.  RBC says 10-year rates may rise to 3.5 percent by the end
of the year after the U.S. economy grew 1.98 percent in the
first quarter, the seventh straight period of economic
expansion. “We are expecting weak growth, but it’s still growth
that should slowly chip away at the slack in the economy.”  The standoff between Obama’s administration and Congress
over increasing the government’s borrowing limit may lead to
higher yields, Zervos said, as Moody’s Investors Service and
Standard & Poor’s said they may consider cutting the nation’s
AAA credit rating unless progress is made next month.  Default Risk  Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s bi-partisan deficit-
reduction group has been meeting since May 5 to reach a
compromise that would trim long-term deficits by as much as $4
trillion and clear the way for a vote in Congress to raise the
$14.29 trillion debt ceiling.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the U.S.
risks defaulting if the limit isn’t increased by Aug. 2.
Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said last week the House wouldn’t
approve any deal that includes tax increases. Money managers are
more bearish on Treasuries than they have been all year, a
weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc. showed.  The company’s sentiment gauge on the outlook for  U.S. debt 
through Dec. 31 slid to a 2011 low of 41 for the seven days
ended July 1. Ried Thunberg ICAP, a New Jersey-based unit of the
world’s largest interdealer broker, surveyed 16 investors
controlling $1.27 trillion.  Even without a default, “rates are overvalued and will
rise as the economic recovery continues, albeit slowly,” said
Mark MacQueen, a partner and portfolio manager at Austin, Texas-
based Sage Advisory Services, which oversees $9.5 billion.
“Despite headwinds, the economic recovery will continue into
the end of the year.”  *T Primary Dealer Forecasts for 10-Year Yields  Firm                Two-Year        10-Year
