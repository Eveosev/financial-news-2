Statoil ASA (STL)  plans to resume
preparations on North Sea oil fields after the U.K. announced
additional support measures for companies that operate small
deposits,  Reuters  reported, citing an unidentified spokesman.  Statoil will resume “preparatory work” on the projects
before making a final  investment decision  at the end of next
year after the government said it was raising a tax support
threshold for oil firms, according to Reuters, citing the
company spokesman.  Stavanger-based Statoil, Norway’s biggest energy producer,
earlier this year put on hold a $10 billion plan to develop the
Mariner and Bressay fields in the U.K. and said it will be less
likely to buy British assets after a tax increase.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
