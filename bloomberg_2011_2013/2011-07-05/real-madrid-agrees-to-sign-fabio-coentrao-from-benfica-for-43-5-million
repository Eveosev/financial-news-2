Benfica said it agreed to trade
 Portugal  left-back Fabio Coentrao to Real  Madrid  for 30 million
euros ($43.5 million).  The transfer will be completed if the 23-year-old agrees to
personal terms and passes a medical test, the Portuguese soccer
team said in a regulatory filing today.  It would be Real Madridâ€™s most expensive signing since it
finished runner-up to Barcelona in the Spanish league last
season.  Real plans to trade Ezequiel Garay, who is also a full-
back, to Benfica, according to Spanish sports newspaper As.  To contact the reporters on this story:
