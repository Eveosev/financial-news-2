European stocks were little changed,
after six straight days of gains for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
before a U.S. report that may show factory orders rebounded in
May. Asian shares and U.S. index futures fluctuated.  CSM (CSM)  NV slumped 10 percent after saying first-half earnings
will decline because of higher raw-material costs.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.1 percent to 275.25 at 8:04 a.m. in
London. The index surged 4.4 percent over the past six trading
days after Greek lawmakers passed a five-year austerity package,
qualifying the country for further aid. The measure still
slipped 1.1 percent in the second quarter on concern that  Greece 
will fail to repay all its debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
