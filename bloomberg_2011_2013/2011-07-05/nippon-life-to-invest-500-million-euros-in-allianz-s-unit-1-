Nippon Life Insurance Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest life insurer, will invest 500 million euros ($724
million) in a unit of  Allianz SE (ALV)  as it expands overseas.  Nippon Life will buy bonds issued by the Allianz’s unit
that have rights to be converted into equities of the Munich-
based parent company, Nippon Life said in a  statement  posted on
its website today. The transaction, aimed at strengthening the
two companies’ capital ties, will be completed on July 7, the
Japanese company said.  Nippon Life has been seeking alliances with overseas rivals
to make up for slowing premium growth in the home market, where
the average age is increasing at the world’s fastest rate. The
company, a mutual society owned by policyholders, agreed in
March to buy a 26 percent stake in  India ’s Reliance Life
Insurance Co., marking the largest foreign direct investment in
the South Asian nation’s insurance industry.  Nippon Life, with head offices in  Tokyo  and  Osaka , invested
$250 million in Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. last year
and $500 million in  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  in 2009. Both
companies are based in the U.S.  The investment in Northwestern Mutual was part of the two
insurers’ efforts to expand an alliance formed in July 2008 when
Nippon Life bought a 5 percent stake in Russell Investments, a
Northwestern subsidiary.  To contact the reporters on this story:
