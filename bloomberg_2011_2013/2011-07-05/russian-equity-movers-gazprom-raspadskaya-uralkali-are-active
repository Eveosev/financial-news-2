The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.2
percent to 1,709.99 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index rallied 0.2 percent to 1,953.07.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP RX) slid for first day in six as Troika
Dialog downgraded Russia’s gas export monopoly to “hold” from
“buy,” citing higher taxes, slowing gas-price growth and a
jump in capital expenditure. Its shares fell 0.7 percent to
203.62 rubles.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  , a Russian coal producer, surged
to its highest since April after its board recommended a first-
half dividend of 5 rubles a share. The stock added 5.8 percent
to 179.96 rubles, in its third day of gains.  OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  , the world’s largest potash producer
by output, leapt to its highest level in almost three years
after MSCI Inc. said it will increase the company’s weighting in
its Russia Index as of the close of trading on July 6. The
shares gained 5.9 percent to 256.94 rubles, its best close since
Aug 1, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
