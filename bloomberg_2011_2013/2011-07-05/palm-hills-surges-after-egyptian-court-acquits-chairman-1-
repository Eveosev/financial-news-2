Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , an
Egyptian luxury-property developer, rose the most in more than a
month after its chairman was acquitted of making illegal
profits.  The shares jumped 7.3 percent, the most since May 29, to
2.51 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That gave
the company a market value of 2.63 billion pounds ($441 million)
The benchmark EGX 30 Index gained 0.2 percent.  Yasseen Mansour was acquitted by an Egyptian court of
charges of making illegal profits and facilitating profiteering
for others, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported
today, citing a court ruling.  “The effect on the stock is psychological,” said Tamer Nigm, head of sales and trading at Cairo-based Watheeqa
Securities Brokerage. “Investors are speculating the company
will not have to pay more for its land purchases now being
disputed in court after Mansour’s acquittal.”  Palm Hills  and other Egyptian real-estate developers such
as  Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding are facing legal challenges to
their land purchases that were not completed via public
auctions, as required by Egyptian law. One of Palm Hills’
purchases on the outskirts of Cairo, dating back to 2006, was
annulled by a Cairo court on April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
