National Football League retirees
filed an amended lawsuit in federal court in  Minnesota  to
protect their pension rights as the league continued to
negotiate with players on a lockout that threatens the upcoming
season.  In a revised complaint asking for class-action, or group,
status, the retirees seek an order to stop discussions between
the NFL and its Players Association “aimed at injuring retired
NFL players” and to award unspecified triple damages.  “They have a right to allocation of revenue” and
officials “are ignoring the voice of the retirees,”  Michael Hausfeld , a Washington-based lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in
a telephone interview today.  The NFL is the richest in U.S. pro sports. The players and
owners are quarreling about how to split about $9 billion in
revenue. Other issues include extending the season from 16 to 18
games and providing a salary cap for rookies.      The NFL owners
declared the lockout at midnight on March 11.  The second amended complaint, filed yesterday, includes as
plaintiffs Carl Eller, Marcus Allen, Franco Harris and Obafemi Ayanbadejo.  The case is Brady v. NFL, 0:11-cv-00639, U.S. District
Court, District of Minnesota ( St. Paul ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
