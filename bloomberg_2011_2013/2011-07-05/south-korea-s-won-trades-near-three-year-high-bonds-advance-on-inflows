South  Korea ’s won fell, snapping a
five-day rally, on speculation importers took advantage of the
currency’s ascent to a three-year high to pay bills.  Government
bonds  rose for a second day.  The won strengthened 2.1 percent against the dollar in the
last five trading days as a July 1 report showed consumer prices
rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier in June, exceeding the
central bank’s target for a sixth month, and overseas investors
pumped $903 million into Korean equities.  “The market received some dollar buying from importers
trying to settle their deals,” said Kim Sung Soon, a Seoul-based
foreign-exchange trader at state-controlled Industrial Bank of
Korea. “With Greek debt concerns abating and as inflation is
still the prime concern for Korean authorities, we see the won
continuing to extend gains, although the pace may slow.”  The won weakened 0.3 percent to 1,066.15 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,062.65 earlier, the strongest level
since August 2008.  European finance ministers authorized on July 2 an 8.7
billion-euro ($12.6 billion) loan payout to  Greece  by mid-July
after the nation’s parliament passed austerity measures,
assuring investors that the country will avoid default.  Overseas investors’ holdings of Korean bonds rose by 2.2
trillion won ($2.1 billion) to a record 81.1 trillion won in
June, the Financial Supervisory Service said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The yield on the 4 percent note due March 2016 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.02 percent,
according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
