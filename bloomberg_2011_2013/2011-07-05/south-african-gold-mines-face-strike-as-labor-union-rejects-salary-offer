AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold
Fields Ltd. (GFI) , Africa’s largest producers of the metal, face
strike action after workers rejected an improved pay offer,
 South Africa ’s  National Union of Mineworkers  said.  Gold mining companies including AngloGold and Gold Fields
offered to raise pay by 5 percent, up from a previous offer of 4
percent,  Lesiba Seshoka , a spokesman for the Johannesburg-based
union, said today by telephone. Members refused the proposal and
are preparing for a walkout, he said.  The NUM and the United Association of South Africa are
seeking wage increases of 14 percent, while the Solidarity union
is seeking 12 percent. Gold prices have surged 37 percent since
the start of last year, spurring unions to demand wage increases
in excess of the inflation rate. Consumer prices rose an annual
4.6 percent in May, according to the nation’s statistics office.  The companies will continue pay talks with unions on July
13, the Chamber of Mines said in an e-mailed statement.  “Clearly this matter will not be resolved,” Seshoka said.
“We will meet the Chamber of Mines next week to inform them of
our intentions to strike.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
