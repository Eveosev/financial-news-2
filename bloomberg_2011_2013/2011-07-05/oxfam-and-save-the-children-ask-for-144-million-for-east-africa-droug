The British charities  Oxfam  and Save
the Children appealed for 90 million pounds ($144 million) in
emergency aid for the drought-hit East African nations of Kenya,
Somalia and  Ethiopia .  Two straight seasons of poor rains prompted Oxfam to make a
record African aid appeal, seeking 50 million pounds to give 3
million people water, food and sanitation, the London-based
charity said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Save the Children  said that shortages of food have left
some children surviving on one meal of porridge a day, and
appealed for 40 million pounds to ramp up its response to the
worst drought in the region in 60 years, according to an e-
mailed statement today.  More than 9 million people in Kenya and Somalia, half of
them children, don’t have enough food or water, Save the
Children said. The level of malnourishment is as high as 30
percent in parts of  Somalia , “making East Africa one of the
hungriest places on earth,” the agency said.  “This is the worst food crisis of the 21st century and we
are seriously concerned that large numbers of lives could soon
be lost,” said Jane Cocking, Oxfam’s humanitarian director,
according to the  statement .  To contact the reporters on this story:
