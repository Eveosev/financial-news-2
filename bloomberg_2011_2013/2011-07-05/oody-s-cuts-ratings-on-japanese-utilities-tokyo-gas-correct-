Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai
Electric Power Co., Kyushu Electric Power Co. and five other
Japanese power companies had their credit ratings cut by Moody’s
Investors Services, which cited a “less supportive” regulatory
framework following the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  Utilities that generate nuclear power had their ratings but
by two notches, while the rankings of others were lowered by one
level, Moody’s said in a statement.  “The two-notch downgrades of those electric utilities with
nuclear-generation capabilities considers the additional and
more immediate risks facing these companies following the events
at Fukushima Daiichi, including their significantly higher
expenses for LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and other fossil
fuels,” Moody’s said. “It also reflects the resulting
economic, financial, and political conditions that may make it
more difficult for these companies to continue recovering their
higher costs on a timely basis.”  Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the crippled
Fukushima station, had its long-term  credit rating  cut four
steps to junk status by Moody’s on June 20 as costs to cover the
meltdowns at the nuclear plant rose.  Tokyo Gas Co. had its senior unsecured debt rating cut by
one notch to Aa2. The ratings of all the companies were kept on
review for downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
