China  Silicon Corp. expects to double
output of polysilicon to 10,000 tons this year, the ICIS news
service reported, citing an unidentified person close to the
company.  The Chinese manufacturer has two plants in Luoyang, in the
province of Henan, that produce the material used in making
solar-energy cells, the report said. One has a capacity of 1,000
tons of output a year and the second will increase production to
9,000 tons by year-end, ICIS said.  Separately, ICIS reported that CSG Holding Co. plans to
increase production by 1,000 tons to 2,500 tons in 2011. ICIS
cited an unidentified official at the company whose plant is
located in Hubei, in central China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
