A strike by members of the National
Union of Metalworkers of  South Africa  that started yesterday
will continue indefinitely, Deputy Secretary General Karl Cloete
said.  No meetings between unions and employers have been
scheduled so far today, Cloete said by phone. Workers will hold
a march in Welkom in the Free State province at 10 a.m., he
said.  The union representing workers in the country’s steel and
engineering industries is seeking a wage increase of 13 percent,
while the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South
Africa, which represents employers, is offering 7 percent, the
labor organization said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
