Advanced Energy Industries Inc. (AEIS)  cut
its revenue forecast for the second quarter, saying price
declines for solar panels are causing some customers to delay
orders.  The  Fort Collins ,  Colorado , company expects to
report revenue between $137 million and $140 million for the
period, below the range of $148 million to $160 million it
projected on May 2. Earnings will be “slightly lower” than the
range it projected, according to a statement on Globe Newswires.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
