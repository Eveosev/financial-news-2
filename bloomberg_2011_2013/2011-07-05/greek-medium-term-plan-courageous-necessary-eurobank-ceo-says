Greece ’s 78 billion-euro ($113
billion) medium-term package of budget cuts and state-asset
sales was needed to convince the European Union the country can
manage its public debt and to secure more funding, said Nicolaos Nanopoulos, Chief Executive Officer of  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA. (EUROB)   “That historic decision distanced us from uncontrollable
adventures and was the serious answer our partners were looking
for in order to move to a new aid package for Greece,”
Nanopoulos said, according to an e-mailed transcript of a speech
in Athens today. “The plan will secure debt sustainability in
the medium-term and give us valuable time to implement the
appropriate measures and carry through the needed reforms.”  Nanopoulos, who heads Greece’s second-biggest lender, said
it’s time to focus on growth and stabilize the  Greek economy  to
ensure a “permanent exit from the crisis.” The private sector
must play a leading role in economic expansion, he said.  Greece’s economy is forecast to shrink 3.8 percent of gross
domestic product this year before growing 0.6 percent in 2012,
according to European Commission data released on July 4. The
debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at 161 percent next year,
according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
