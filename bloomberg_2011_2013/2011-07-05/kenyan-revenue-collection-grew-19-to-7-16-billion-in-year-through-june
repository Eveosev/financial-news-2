Revenue collection in  Kenya , East
Africa’s biggest economy, jumped 19 percent in the fiscal year
through June as the country added more taxpayers, the Kenya
Revenue Authority said.  Receipts rose to 634.9 billion shillings ($7.16 billion)
from 534.4 billion shillings in the previous 12 months,
Commissioner General Michael Waweru told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital. The amount was 0.7 percent above a revised
target of 630.7 billion shillings, he said.  The authority registered 184,550 new taxpayers last year,
boosting collection of domestic taxes by 21 percent to 408.8
billion shillings, Waweru said. State officials also began
paying taxes on their salaries under rules introduced in the
country’s new constitution, which was implemented in August.  “I would like to extend our gratitude to the Kenyan public
for impressing upon their elected parliamentary representatives
to pay their share of taxes,” Waweru said. “I wish to call
upon the public to exhibit similar zeal in ensuring that they
too pay their rightful share of taxes.”  The authority is targeting a 16 percent increase in revenue
this year to 733.4 billion shillings. The government’s fiscal
deficit including grants is expected to widen to 236.2 billion
shillings in the period through June 2012, equivalent to 7.4
percent of gross domestic product, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
