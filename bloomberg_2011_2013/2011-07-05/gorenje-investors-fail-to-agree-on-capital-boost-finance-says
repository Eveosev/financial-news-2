Gorenje Group d.d. investors canceled
a proposal for a capital boost at Slovenia’s biggest appliance
maker, Finance newspaper  reported , citing its correspondent at
the annual general meeting of the company.  Shareholders also rejected a proposal for a 14 eurocents
($0.20) dividend payment from last year’s profit, the Ljubljana-
based newspaper said.  Gorenje’s management proposed last month to increase
capital by up to 33 million euros in a share sale.  -- Editor: Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
