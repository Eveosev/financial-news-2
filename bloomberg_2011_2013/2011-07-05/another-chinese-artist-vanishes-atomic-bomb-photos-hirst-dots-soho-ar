Chinese artist Liu Bolin stood
motionless as two assistants painted his hair pink and orange at
 Eli Klein Fine Art  in  Manhattan ’s SoHo district.  The hodge-podge of color and images that finally
transformed him head to toe would make no sense if he weren’t
standing before a makeshift magazine stand lined with 100 recent
publications. Liu had been painted with whole covers and
segments of glossies featuring Lady Gaga, plump babies and new
gadgets. He had become a vertical slice of the shelves.  The 38-year-old artist’s shtick is to “disappear” into
the background, then have the trompe l’oeil captured by
photographs. Since arriving in  New York  last month, he has
blended with Kenny Scharf graffiti on Houston Street, elements
of  Ground Zero  and a bull sculpture on  Wall Street .  He says his disappearing act is a form of protest against
the Chinese government after it razed an artist village where
Liu worked. Before the compound turned into rubble, he painted
himself against one of its red brick walls.  “I have no power to fight the government,” he said.
“This is my protest.”  Photographs of earlier “disappearances” range from $6,000
to $15,000. “The Invisible Man” runs through Aug. 28th at 462
West Broadway; +1-212-255-4388;  http://www.elikleinfineart.com .  Damien Hirst   Are you missing Damien Hirst, the once so ubiquitous Brit?  Proceed down the block to DTR Modern Galleries where the
walls are lined with Hirst dot prints. They come directly from
his studio and vary in dimensions and edition sizes.  There are also images of skulls and butterflies. Prices
range from $4,900 to $100,000. The gallery rotates its Hirsts as
they sell but they’re always in stock, said director Julia
Morris.  458 West Broadway; +1-212-677-2802;
 http://www.dtrmodern.com   Atomic Explosion  In the  Pacific Ocean , a giant mushroom cloud surges into
the sky, destroying life on the Bikini Atoll. In  Nevada , the
desert is scorched again and again by fiery blasts.  “The Atomic Explosion” at  Peter Blum  displays 66 vintage
photographs from the 1940s and 1950s, when more than 200 nuclear
bombs were tested by the U.S. government.  In one creepy image, a group of men -- journalists, defense
officials and two governors -- sit on chairs in the middle of
the desert in heavy black glasses, watching the explosion as if
it were a Broadway production.  Prices for individual photographs range from $1,200 to
$10,000. Through July 29 at Peter Blum, 99 Wooster St.,
+1-212-343-0441;  http://peterblumgallery.com   Three Hands  In 1967, self-taught French artist Robert Filliou
photocopied the hands of his fellow artists and called the
project “Main d’artiste” (“Artist’s Hand”).  Some of these were later enlarged to 4-foot-square images
and displayed in the windows of  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  Three hands -- of
Filliou, Marisol and Bob Watts -- are on view at  Peter Freeman 
Inc. as part of the late artist’s first New York solo exhibition
since 1998.  Filliou liked to turn everyday materials like cardboard,
bricks and bicycle wheels into witty and poetic installations.  Prices range from 14,000 euros ($20,260) to 150,000 euros.
The show runs through July 15 at 560 Broadway, #602; +1-212-966-
