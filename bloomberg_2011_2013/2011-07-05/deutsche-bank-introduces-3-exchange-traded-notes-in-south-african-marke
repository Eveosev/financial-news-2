Deutsche Bank AG’s South African unit
introduced three exchange-traded notes aimed at local investors
seeking to channel their money into the rest of continent,  China 
and other emerging markets.  The notes started trading today on Johannesburg’s stock
exchange,  Africa ’s largest bourse, Mike Gresty, head of research
at Deutsche Bank’s South African brokerage, told reporters in
Johannesburg. The ETNs track the MSCI Emerging Markets Total
Return Index, MSCI China Total Return Index and MSCI Africa Top
50 Capped Total Return Index.  There is a “secular shift to emerging markets where
investible capital is growing,” Gresty said. U.S. and European
pension funds hold less than 5 percent in emerging-market
equities and less than 2 percent of their debt, he said.  Deutsche Bank’s South African unit has about 1.6 billion
rand ($237 million) under management in its five offshore ETFs
and 11.5 billion rand in its seven Satrix exchange-trade funds,
said Kari van Rensburg, head of equity derivatives.  ETNs are contracts that give investors a return linked to
the performance of a market index. They don’t pay dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
