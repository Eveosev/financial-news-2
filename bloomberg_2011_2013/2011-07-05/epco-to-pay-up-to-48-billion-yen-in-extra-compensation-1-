Tokyo  Electric Power Co. plans to pay
additional provisional compensation of as much as 48 billion yen
($594 million) to victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The Tokyo-based company, known as Tepco, will start paying
as much as 300,000 yen to residents evacuated from areas around
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in mid-July, Takehiro Todoroki, a
spokesman for the utility, said today by telephone. About
160,000 people will receive the second round of the initial
payments, Todoroki said.  Tepco’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, north of Tokyo, has been
spewing radiation since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami
knocked out cooling systems and caused the meltdowns of three of
the six reactors. The disaster displaced 50,000 households and
the utility may face compensation claims of as much as 11
trillion yen, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
unit.  Tepco has paid about 49.8 billion yen in the first round of
compensations to the evacuees since it started making payments
on April 26, Todoroki said.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s Cabinet last month submitted
legislation to create a public entity to help Tepco pay
reparations for the disaster. The budget will set aside 120
billion yen to help with compensation for damage caused by the
nuclear accident.  To contact the reporters on this story:
