Kenya ’s horticultural exports tumbled
almost 80 percent in the first two months of the year due to
weak demand from  Europe ,  Reuters  said, citing Jane Ngige, chief
executive officer of the Kenya Flower Council.  Shipments fell to 14.5 billion shilling ($163.6 million)
from 71.6 billion shillings in the same period last year, the
news agency said.  Flower exports account for more than half of the country’s
horticulture shipments, the biggest source of foreign exchange
in east Africa’s largest economy, ahead of black tea and
tourism, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
