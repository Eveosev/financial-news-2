Saudi Arabia’s Al-Ittefaq Steel
Products Co. reached an out-of-court settlement with 18 banks to
refinance about 7.5 billion riyals ($2 billion) of debt, the
Financial Times reported, without citing anyone.  Al-Ittefaq will repay 22 percent of the loans in six years
and attempt to refinance the balance before it falls due,
according to the newspaper. None of the company’s lenders, which
include  Arab National Bank (ARNB) ,  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA) ,  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) 
and  Saudi British Bank (SABB) , will need to take write-offs as a result
of the debt restructuring agreement, the newspaper said.  The deal, reached last week, will also allow Al-Ittefaq to
expand liquid steel capacity to 2 million tons a year, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
