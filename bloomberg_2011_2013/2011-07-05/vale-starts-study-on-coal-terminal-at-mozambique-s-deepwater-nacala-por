Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron ore
producer, started studies on building a coal terminal at Nacala
port in northern  Mozambique , said Rosario Mualeia, chairman of
the state-run ports and railways utility.  The project is expected to cost about $1.5 billion,
Mualeia, chairman of Caminhos de Ferro de Mocambique, known as
CFM, said in an interview on the sidelines of a coal conference
in Maputo, the capital.  “Work has begun on the project and the government will
come in as a partner through the CFM,” he said, without
disclosing who would fund the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
