The number of housing transactions in
 Hong Kong  fell for the sixth straight month in June as rising
 mortgage rates  and government efforts to curb real-estate prices
damped demand.  The number of units changing hands fell 1 percent from a
year earlier to 9,043, according to Land Registry data. The
value of the transactions rose 60 percent to HK$52.9 billion
($6.8 billion), the highest since November.  The Hong Kong government on June 10 raised down payments
for some home purchases and for foreign buyers, the fourth set
of restrictions imposed since October 2009 to curb surging
residential values.  Home prices  in the city have risen more than
70 percent since the beginning of 2009 on record-low mortgage
rates and an influx of buyers from  China .  “Transactions may stabilize in the coming few quarters
when these policies take effect,” David Ji, Hong Kong-based
head of Greater China research at property broker DTZ Holdings
Plc, said in a phone interview today.  The number of transactions in June fell 6.6 percent from
May’s level and the value rose 6.9 percent, according to the
 Land Registry .  The Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks seven of the
city’s biggest developers, has fallen 4 percent this year,
compared with a 1.25 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Sang
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
