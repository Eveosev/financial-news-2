Australia ’s Queensland state said 30
coal companies globally are interested in a A$6.2 billion ($6.6
billion) expansion of  Abbot Point  that would make the port the
world’s biggest coal-export terminal.  Craig Wallace, the ports minister of the northeastern state,
joined company representatives touring the port as part of an
expression of interest to expand its shipment capacity sixfold
to 300 million metric tons annually, the government said today
on its website.  Coal demand is rising as China and  India , the world’s
fastest growing major economies, produce more electricity and
steel. Supply disruptions in Australia, the world’s biggest coal
exporter, because of record rainfall and rail and port
bottlenecks have pushed up prices to a record this year.  “The world’s top coal companies are showing huge interest
being part of the development,” Wallace said in the statement.
“Global demand for Queensland’s coal is increasing and judging
by the fantastic interest shown here today by industry, we’ll
have customers and investors on hand to deliver this major
project.”  Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) , India’s biggest coal importer, in
May agreed to pay A$1.8 billion for a 99-year lease to operate
the port.  The expanded Abbot Point may start shipments as early as
2017, the statement said.  Vale SA (VALE) , the world’s biggest iron ore
producer which owns a number of coal assets in Australia, last
month said it was interested in developing one of the terminals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
