Ghana’s  currency strengthened as
investors sought cedis before an auction of five-year bonds that
will be denominated in the local currency.  The cedi traded at 1.5150 per dollar by 4:30 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, from yesterday’s close of 1.5160, according to data
compiled by the local unit of Standard Chartered Bank Plc.  “There is good liquidity on the market as foreign-based
investors make funds ready for the auction,” Kevin Adarkwa, a
currency trader at the bank, said by phone.  The  Bank of Ghana  will sell 300 million cedis ($198 million)
of the notes on July 28, the bank said in a prospectus published
on its website June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
