Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened from
a discount to even with futures after a compressor shut down at
Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Norco refinery in Louisiana.  The plant had emissions of benzene and sulfur dioxide
because of the shutdown of its waste-gas compressor, according
to a filing with the National Response Center. A message left on
a media line for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , part owner of Motiva,
wasn’t immediately returned.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.2 cents to parity with futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:08 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 1.84 cents to $2.991
a gallon.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch Shell.  The Norco refinery, one of two that Motiva operates in
southern Louisiana, has a capacity of 250,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
