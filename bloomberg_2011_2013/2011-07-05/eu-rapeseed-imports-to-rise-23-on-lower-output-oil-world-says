Rapeseed imports into the European
Union will rise 23 percent, making the bloc the world’s top
buyer of the oilseed, as Polish, German and Romanian production
drops, Oil World said.  The EU will import 3.1 million metric tons of rapeseed,
also known as canola, in the year that began July 1, up from
2.52 million tons in the prior period, the researcher said in a
report today. Output in the 27-nation bloc, the biggest global
producer, will drop 8.3 percent to 18.9 million tons, according
to the report. U.S. imports will rise 24 percent, it shows.  “The EU-27 will become the world’s largest importer of
rapeseed,” Oil World said. “The prospective sharp increase in
the EU-27 imports and the outlook for higher imports of the USA
will require rationing in the rest of the world.”  Rapeseed futures gained 33 percent in the past year on ICE
Futures Canada in Winnipeg and climbed 32 percent on NYSE Liffe
in Paris. World stockpiles probably will fall 6.5 percent to
5.35 million tons, according to Oil World.  The U.S. will import 560,000 tons of rapeseed in the year,
up from 450,000 tons in the prior period, the researcher said.
Global production will slip 0.5 percent to 59.08 million tons,
the lowest level in three years and below an estimate made two
weeks ago, on declines in  China  and the U.S. as well as the EU,
Oil World said.  Chinese output will fall 4.9 percent to 11.6 million tons,
Oil World said. To compensate for declining output, the
country’s imports will rise 8.3 percent and buyers will
substitute other oilseeds, primarily palm oil and soybeans,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
