The Dodd-Frank Act will have a
“malignant” effect on the U.S. financial system, said former
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  Chairman  Harvey Golub .  “We would be far better off had we not had Dodd-Frank, but
focused on public policy and  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac ,” the
mortgage firms that had to be taken over by the U.S., Golub told
Betty Liu on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
