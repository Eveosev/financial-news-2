Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said the central bank risks fueling gains by the peso
against the dollar if policy makers continue to raise  interest
rates , the  Wall Street Journal  reported.  Santos, in an interview in Bogota, also said the peso has
appreciated less than other currencies against the dollar and
suggested that his nation is unlikely to impose capital controls
to stem gains, according to the report.  Colombiaâ€™s central bank on June 17 increased its overnight
lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent amid quickening
economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
