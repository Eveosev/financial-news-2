Harel Mallac & Co., a Mauritian group
with interests in chemicals and engineering, expects its  Africa 
operations to expand to at least 30 percent of revenue in three
years, Christopher Boland, the chief executive officer, said.  Acquisitions are one of the options it is considering to
expand outside of the Indian Ocean island nation, Boland said in
an interview yesterday in the capital, Port Louis, without
giving details on options being looked at. The group’s HM
International unit made up 10 percent of revenue in 2010, he
said.  “We cannot remain in Mauritius,”, Boland said. “There is
clearly growth potential in Africa.”  Harel Mallac has offices in  Madagascar , Zambia, Tanzania,
 Rwanda  and Burundi, and also services other Eastern African
countries. The Port Louis-based group sells Dell and IBM brands
through its technologies division and Haier and Daewoo products
through its engineering business, according to the company.  Revenue for the year through December rose 13 percent to
3.15 billion rupees ($112 million), its annual report showed.
The technologies unit contributed 36 percent and chemicals 35
percent of group revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
