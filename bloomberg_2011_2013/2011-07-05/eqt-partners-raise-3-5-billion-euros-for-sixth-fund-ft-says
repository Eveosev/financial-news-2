EQT Partners AB raised 3.5 billion
euros ($5.1 billion) in six months, 83 percent of the targeted
4.25 billion euros it wants to raise for its sixth fund, the
Financial Times reported, citing a letter from the Swedish
private equity group to investors. EQT is expected to conclude
the fundraising in the next two months, when it may have raised
as much as 4.75 billion euros, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
