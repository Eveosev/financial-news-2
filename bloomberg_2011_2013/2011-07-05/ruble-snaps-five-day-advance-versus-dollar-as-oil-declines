The ruble gained to its strongest
level in a week versus the euro as oil,  Russia ’s chief export
earner, advanced in  New York .  The Russian currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 40.31 per
euro by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest closing
position since June 27. The ruble was little changed at 27.8625
per dollar, leaving it steady at 33.4639 versus the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude climbed to the highest price in more than two weeks
in New York after the Greek bailout on July 2 signaled global
economies may stabilize. Crude for August delivery rose as much
as $2.05 a barrel and last traded up 1.4 percent at $96.25 a
barrel.  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond down three basis points to 6.87 percent. Non-
deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations of
currency movements and allow companies to hedge against them,
show the ruble at 28.1475 per dollar in three months, compared
with 28.062 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
