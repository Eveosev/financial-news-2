Billionaire Philip Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc. wireless venture said it raised $265 million
of additional funding from new and existing investors for
building out its network and other corporate expenses.  LightSquared has now raised a total of $2.3 billion in the
past year, according to a statement from the venture today. The
company may need to raise as much as $4 billion to construct its
so-called fourth-generation network, Jonathan Chaplin, a Credit
Suisse Group AG analyst in New York, said in May.  The venture, based in Reston, Virginia, plans to compete
with  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless  by selling wholesale 4G
wireless service. It has pledged to the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission to build a network to cover 260
million people by 2016.  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, is working to resolve concerns its network
may interfere with global-positioning systems. It has signed a
deal with  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  to share network equipment and
building costs, including cell sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
