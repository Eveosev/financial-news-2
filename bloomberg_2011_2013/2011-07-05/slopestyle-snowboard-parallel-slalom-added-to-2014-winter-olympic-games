Slopestyle skiing and snowboarding
and parallel special slalom snowboarding were added to the 2014
Winter Olympics in what organizers described as an effort to
attract younger fans.  The six events, a men’s and woman’s category for each, have
been approved to debut in Sochi,  Russia , the  International
Olympic Committee  announced yesterday in a statement. IOC
President Jacques Rogge said he was “very pleased” with the
new additions.  “Such events provide great entertainment for the
spectators and add further youthful appeal to our already
action-packed lineup of Olympic winter sports,” Rogge said.  Ski and snowboard slopestyle are judged events in which
participants perform tricks off jumps while moving through a
downhill course. Snowboard parallel special slalom is a head-to-
head race where athletes maneuver downhill between gates. It is
considered more technical than the giant slalom, which is
already in the  Winter Games .  The announcement comes three months after the IOC announced
the addition of men’s and women’s ski halfpipe, women’s ski
jumping, biathalon mixed relay, figure skating team event and
luge team relay.  The IOC also announced events that are being considered for
possible places in the 2020 Summer Games, including baseball,
softball, karate, squash and wakeboard. Voting for those events
will take place in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
