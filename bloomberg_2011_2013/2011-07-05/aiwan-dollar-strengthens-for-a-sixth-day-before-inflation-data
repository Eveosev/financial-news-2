Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a
sixth day, the longest winning streak since September, before a
government report today that economists predict will show
inflation accelerated to a 16-month high.  The consumer-price index climbed 1.75 percent from a year
earlier in June, compared with a 1.66 percent advance the
previous month, according to the median estimate of analysts in
a Bloomberg survey.  “Some people say the central bank might let the currency
rise a little more to tame inflation,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Union Bank of Taiwan.
“It’s not easy to breach the NT$28.5 level.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$28.739
against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:25 a.m. local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.656 yesterday,
the strongest level since June 3.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent notes due July 2016, the most-traded of the securities,
was 1.16 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 0.365 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
