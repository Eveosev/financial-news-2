Mauritius’s annual inflation rate
fell to a five-month low in June, curbed by two successive
increases in the benchmark interest rates this year.  Inflation decelerated to 6.6 percent in June from 7.1
percent a month earlier, the Port Louis-based Central Statistics
Office said a statement on its  website  today. That’s the weakest
rate of price gains since January, according to data from the
Bank of Mauritius’s website.  The Bank of Mauritius raised its benchmark repo rate to 5.5
percent on June 13 to rein in price growth that accelerated for
six straight months to 7.2 percent in March, the strongest level
in more than two years.  “The 0.75 percent rise in the interest rate this year has
helped” slow inflation, Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at the
Port Louis-based Axys Capital Management Ltd, said by phone.
“It’s not an indication that inflation is slowing down.
Pressures are still there. It’s too early.”  The Indian Ocean island nation, with a population of 1.3
million people, is a net importer of food and fuels, with 67
percent of imports invoiced in dollars.  The rupee depreciated the most in more than two weeks
against the U.S. currency, losing as much as 1.8 percent to
28.55 per dollar before trading 0.7 percent weaker at 28.25 by
11:48 a.m., paring its increase this year to 9.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
