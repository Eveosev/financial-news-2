Asia gasoil discounts widened after
Glencore International AG bought three cargoes in  Singapore , the
region’s largest oil-trading center. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
bought 95-RON gasoline at a lower price compared with yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Glencore bought three 150,000-barrel cargoes of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil, or diesel, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The
company received discounts of 30 cents a barrel to benchmark
quotes from Chevron Corp. and 50 cents from Vitol Group. That’s
a deeper discount than 20 cents yesterday. Glencore also paid BP
Plc 40 cents less than quotes for July 20 to July 26.  Separately, China International United Petroleum & Chemical
Corp., or Unipec, bought 250,000 barrels of gasoil from
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. at 40 cents a barrel below
benchmark quotes, the survey showed.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude gained 16
cents to $18.59 a barrel at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, widened for a fifth day, the longest winning
streak in seven months.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 10 cents to $1 a barrel,
PVM said. A rising regrade shows it’s profitable to produce
 aviation fuel .  Shell sold two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore, according to
the survey. The company sold to Hin Leong Trading Pte at 50
cents a barrel below benchmark quotes and to BP at 30 cents
below July quotes.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 16 cents to
$6.70 a barrel at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The difference yesterday was the widest since June 16, signaling
growing losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after decreasing yesterday to $9.50. A
narrowing viscosity spread means bunker, or marine fuel, has
declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Shell bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline loading from
Singapore at $124.90 a barrel from Vitol, the survey showed.
Prices are lower than yesterday, when Shell bought a similar
cargo at $126.30 a barrel.  Vitol bought four cargoes of 92-RON ranging in price from
$120.30 to $120.40 a barrel. Morgan Stanley, Shell, Total SA and
PetroChina Co. each sold 50,000 barrels to Vitol.  Naphtha for delivery to  Japan  in the first half of
September traded at $926 to $927 a ton. Shell bought 25,000 tons
from Mabanaft GmbH & Co. and another 25,000 tons from Itochu
Corp. BP sold 25,000 tons to Cargill Inc.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
at $80.21 a ton at 5:57 p.m. Singapore time from $79.42 at the
end of Asian trading yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
