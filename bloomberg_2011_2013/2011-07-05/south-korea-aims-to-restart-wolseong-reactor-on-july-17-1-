The South Korean government “aims
to” restart operations at the Wolseong No. 1 reactor on July
17, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said.  The resumption isn’t related to the extension of the
reactor’s life and approval is needed from the Ministry of
Education, Science and Technology, the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement.  The 679-megawatt reactor was shut in April 2009 for an
overhaul, according to state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
