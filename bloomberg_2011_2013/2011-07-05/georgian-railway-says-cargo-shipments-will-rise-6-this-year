Georgian Railway LLC , the former
Soviet republic’s state-owned train operator, forecast slower
growth in cargo volumes this year after posting a 16 percent
increase in 2010.  Total shipments will rise 6 percent,  David Jinjolia , freight
transportation director for the railroad, said in an interview
in Tbilisi. Cargo growth remains “healthy,” he said, as last
year’s increase reflected a postwar effect following the
country’s 2008 conflict with  Russia .  Shipments reached 19.9 million metric tons in 2010 as the
company moved more oil and oil-products cargo after the railway
was repaired following the war. Shipments fell 19 percent in
2009.  Transportation and communication accounted for 12.1 percent
of  Georgia ’s first-quarter gross domestic product, which grew by
an annual 5.8 percent, according to government statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
