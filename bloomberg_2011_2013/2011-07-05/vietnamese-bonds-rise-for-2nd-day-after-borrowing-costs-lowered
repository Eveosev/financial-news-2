Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
second day after the central bank lowered borrowing costs
yesterday.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam cut the repurchase rate by one
percentage point to 14 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement. The move came even after consumer prices rose 20.8
percent in June from a year earlier, the most since November
2008, according to official data.  “Reducing the repurchase rate signals the central bank
believes that inflation is easing and there is a chance for
market interest rates to go down,” Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based
analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co., wrote in a
report today.  The yield on five-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 12.44 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong was little changed at
20,595 per dollar as of 5:04 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the reference rate at 20,613 today,
unchanged from yesterday, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
