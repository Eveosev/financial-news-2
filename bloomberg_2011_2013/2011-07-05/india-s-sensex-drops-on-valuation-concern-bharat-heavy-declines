India’s benchmark stock index fell as
investors weighed rising valuations after a two-week rally in
equities against speculation of a favorable monsoon season.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the nation’s biggest maker
of power equipments, dropped the most in six weeks after the
Business Standard reported the government may approve the sale
of a 5 percent stake next week.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest property
developer, lost 1.3 percent after a three-day, 12 percent surge.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., the biggest tractor maker, rallied 2.6
percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
71.17, or 0.4 percent, to 18,743.31, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge climbed 7.5
percent in the two weeks to yesterday. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 5,630.95 and
its July futures settled at 5,650. The BSE 200 Index decreased
0.3 percent to 2,,321.66.  The Sensex has declined 8.6 percent this year, the worst
performer among benchmark indexes in the world’s biggest stock
markets, as  India ’s central bank raised rates 10 times since the
start of 2010 to cool inflation. Sensex companies trade at 15.2
times estimated earnings, the highest since April 28. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index trades at 11.2 times profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
