Indonesia’s rupiah and bonds fell,
snapping a four-day rally, after the government said its  budget
deficit  this year may be wider than forecast.  The currency retreated from a three-week high after Finance
Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said yesterday the shortfall may be
2.1 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a previous
estimate of 1.8 percent, as subsidy spending may be 31 percent
higher than the original forecast of 187 trillion rupiah ($21.9
billion).  “The market will anticipate there may be a more-than-
expected amount of debt issued this year,” said  Gundy Cahyadi ,
a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
“There could be some quick profit-taking following the sharp
moves yesterday.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 8,537 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached 8,517 yesterday, the strongest level since June
13.  The yield on the government’s 8.25 percent notes due July
2021 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.48
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. The government sold 7.5 trillion rupiah of bonds
and bills today, after receiving 32 trillion rupiah of bids,
according to a  statement  on the debt management office’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
