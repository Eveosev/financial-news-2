U.S. President  Barack Obama  asked
 Kenya  to freeze the assets of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and
the Libyan central bank, the Standard reported, citing a letter
from the U.S. government.  The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, also asked
the East African nation to remove the diplomatic status of
officials loyal to Qaddafi and instead help the rebel
Transitional National Council open a representative office in
Kenya, the newspaper said.  Libya  has investments in Kenyaâ€™s oil and hospitality
industries, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
