Losses from making  fuel oil  in  Asia 
shrank from the widest in almost three weeks after crude costs
declined. Gasoil processing profits rose to the highest in
almost two weeks while naphtha margins increased.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed by 40 cents, or
5.9 percent, to $6.46 a metric ton at 10:41 a.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and
refined-products broker. The spread narrowed from $6.86 a ton
yesterday, the biggest discount since June 16. High-sulfur fuel-
oil swaps fell $1.61, or 0.3 percent, to $643.89 a ton.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged at $9.50 a ton. The spread has narrowed by
50 cents from a week ago, signaling that power-station grade
fuel oil prices have fallen faster than shipping-fuel grades.  Crude oil for August delivery was at $94.76 a barrel, down
18 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 11:28 p.m. Singapore time.  Oil markets have shown “some clear improvement” after the
 International Energy Agency  announced it was releasing
stockpiles, Didier Houssin, the IEA’s director of energy markets
and security, said yesterday, citing increasing refining margins
and a narrowing price gap between light and heavy crude grades.  Middle Distillates  July swaps for gasoil fell for a second day. Prices dropped
53 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $124.07 a barrel, PVM data showed.
Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, rose 10 cents to
$1 a barrel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, rose 12 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $18.55 a
barrel, according to PVM. Refining margins for the fuel are at
the highest since June 22.  Light Distillates  July swaps for naphtha fell $3.50, or 0.4 percent, to $928
a ton, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, rose to
$91.35 a ton from $79.42 at the end of Asian trading yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
