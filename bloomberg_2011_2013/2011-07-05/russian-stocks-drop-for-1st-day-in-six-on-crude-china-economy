Russian stocks fell for the first
time in six days after oil, the country chief export revenue
earner, fell for a second day and metals prices retreated.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks slid 0.5 percent to 1,698.32
by 11:23 a.m. in Moscow. OAO Tatneft, the oil producer based in
the Tatarstan region, slipped 0.9 percent while OAO Gazprom, the
natural gas export monopoly, lost 1 percent. OAO Polyus Gold,
the country’s largest gold producer, retreated 1.5 percent. The
dollar denominated RTS Index retreated 0.2 percent to 1,943.98.  Crude for August delivery fell 0.4 percent to $94.47 a
barrel in  New York  after the People’s Bank of  China  said
yesterday the country still faces “large” inflationary
pressure and the central bank will maintain a “prudent”
monetary policy. Chinese lenders may have greater exposure to
bad local-government loans than anticipated, Moody’s Investors
Service said. Copper, lead and zinc dropped in  London .  “Some pressure is coming from expectations of another
interest-rate increase in China as well as fears of growing
financial risks in that country,” Maria Kalvarskaia, head of
equity research at TKB Capital, said in an e-mailed report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
