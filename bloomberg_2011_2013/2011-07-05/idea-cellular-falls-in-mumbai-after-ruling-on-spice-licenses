Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA) , the mobile-phone
company owned by Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, fell
the most in two weeks in Mumbai trading after a court ruled that
the company must return overlapping licenses obtained from an
acquisition three years ago to the government.  Idea lost 4.9 percent to 75 rupees, the biggest intraday
decline since June 22, before trading at 76.75 rupees as of 1:35
p.m. on the Bombay Stock Exchange.  India â€™s benchmark Sensitive
Index dropped 0.5 percent.  The Mumbai-based company bought a controlling stake in
Spice Communications Ltd., an Indian mobile-services provider,
in July 2008. The New Delhi High Court affirmed the acquisition
and ordered the overlapping Spice mobile-services licenses to be
returned, Idea said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The overlapping licenses are non-operational, with no
attached subscribers, Idea said. The company can challenge the
court order, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
