India ’s rupee halted five-days of
gains on speculation oil refiners stepped up demand for the
dollar to pay for crude.  The currency retreated from the strongest level in two
months as  oil prices  in New York declined for a second day.
India imports almost 75 percent of the commodity to meet local
consumption. The trend is still for the rupee to appreciate on
capital inflows, said Vikas Babu at  Andhra Bank .  “We are seeing oil importers purchasing dollars,” said
Babu, a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange trader at Andhra Bank. He
predicted the rupee will climb to 44.20 by the end of this week.  The currency was little changed at 44.4370 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 44.335 yesterday, the strongest level
since May 3.  Crude fell 0.8 percent to $95.67 a barrel today in  New
York , following a 0.5 percent drop on July 1. U.S. markets were
closed yesterday for the Independence Day holiday.  Overseas investors bought $1.4 billion more Indian stocks
than they sold last week, according to exchange data.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.93 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.90
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
