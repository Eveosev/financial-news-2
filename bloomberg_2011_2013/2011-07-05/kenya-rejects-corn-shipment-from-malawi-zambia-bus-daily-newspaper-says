Kenya  rejected about 5,000 metric
tons of corn imported from Malawi and Zambia, raising concern
that an order for 55,000 tons of the grain from the two
countries may be delayed, Business Daily reported.  The consignment was blocked because the corn was
discolored, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing the Kenya
Bureau of Standards. The additional corn won’t be allowed into
the country unless the bureau approves the quantity already
discharged, it said, citing the Cereal Millers Association.  South Africa , the traditional source of Kenyan imports of
corn, has no capacity to meet Kenya’s demand over the next two
months because the country exceeded its export limit, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
