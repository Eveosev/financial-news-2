GT Solar International Inc. (SOLR) , a maker
of silicon production equipment for solar cells, reached a
record high after receiving two orders worth a total of $81.7
million.  GT Solar rose 86 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $17.04 at 2:58
p.m. in in Nasdaq Stock Exchange trading. The Merrimack, New
Hampshire-based company earlier rose as much as 6.2 percent to
$17.19, the highest since its initial public offering in July
2008.  Two new customers in  Asia  ordered equipment to produce
polysilicon, the basic material of solar cells, the company said
today in a statement.  Prices for polysilicon fell more than 30 percent in the
second quarter as European governments cut solar power
subsidies.  Producers are looking for ways to increase efficiency and
cut costs, GT Solar vice president and polysilicon technology
business unit general manager Dave Keck, said in the statement.
“Our polysilicon production equipment and technology enables
customers to produce high purity silicon at one of the lowest
costs in the industry,”he said.  The orders will be included in GT Solar’s backlog for its
fiscal 2012 first quarter, which ended July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
