Danske Bank A/S raised its forecast
for  Lithuania ’s 2011 economic growth by 1.9 percentage points,
citing higher exports and stronger domestic demand.  The economy may expand 5.8 percent this year, compared with
an April forecast of 3.9 percent,  Violeta Klyviene , a Danske
economist in Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed report. Growth
may slow to 4.9 percent in 2012 and 4.6 percent in 2013.  The economy expanded 6.9 percent in the first quarter, the
second-fastest rate in the European Union after  Estonia . Higher
foreign sales and recovering domestic demand helped the Baltic
nation exit the world’s deepest recession in 2009. Gross
domestic product grew 1.3 percent the following year.  “The external environment remains favorable for Lithuania:
its main trading partners -- Germany, Poland and  Russia  --
continue to grow,” Klyviene said. “We expect export growth to
remain robust but gradually slow over the medium term as the
positive base effect disappears.”  Exports may increase 11 percent this year before growth
slows to 8.4 percent in 2012, Klyviene said.  Private consumption may expand 5.3 percent in 2011 on a
“gradual improvement in household confidence and relatively
accommodative fiscal policy stance,” according to Klyviene.
Wages may grow 3.4 percent in 2011 and 4.7 percent in 2012.  While stronger domestic demand isn’t stoking inflation,
price pressures may become a concern later this year, Klyviene
said.  “Private consumption is growing faster than we predicted
and there is a risk that domestic pressure on  core inflation 
could intensify over the second half of this year,” she wrote.  Inflation may accelerate to 4.7 percent in 2011 before
slowing to 3.6 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
