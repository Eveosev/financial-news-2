Importers in  South Korea , the second-
biggest corn buyer in  Asia , issued tenders today to purchase as
much as 350,000 metric tons of corn for feed production as
prices declined.  Nonghyup Feed Inc., South Koreaâ€™s biggest buyer of feed
grains, sought as much as 190,000 tons for arrival in October
and November, according to a tender notice, a copy of which was
e-mailed to Bloomberg News today. The Major Feedmill Group
issued a tender to import 160,000 for October arrivals, another
notice showed. Both will hold biddings later today.  Corn for December delivery gained as much as 1.8 percent to
$6.075 a bushel at 11:45 a.m. Seoul time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices reached $5.755 a bushel on July 1, the lowest for
the most-active contract since Dec. 13. The grain is up about 57
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
