The federal judge presiding over the
perjury trial of ex-New York Yankees pitcher  Roger Clemens  said
he may not allow the jury to hear from former teammates about
injections they received from Clemens’ accuser, Brian McNamee.  U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton in Washington today said
he’ll decide during trial whether ex-Yankees Chuck Knoblauch,
 Andy Pettitte , and Mike Stanton can tell jurors about
performance-enhancing drug injections given to them by McNamee.
Clemens has maintained he believed McNamee injected him with
vitamins or other permissible drugs.  “The jury may say ‘Well, if they knew what they were
taking from McNamee then why wouldn’t Clemens not know what he
was getting,’ " Walton said.  The judge is hearing pre-trial motions today in Washington
federal court, where jury selection is scheduled to begin
tomorrow.  Prosecutors in the case said they are still seeking audio
recordings of Clemens’ 2008 Congressional deposition, and that
Congress has refused to turn them over.  The case is U.S. v. Clemens, 10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
