Norway ’s sovereign wealth fund, which
today announced its second real-estate purchase, will add to its
investments in Paris and London and has started to look for
targets in  Germany ’s largest cities.  “We’re not done with London and Paris,” Karsten Kallevig,
head of real estate at Norges Bank Investment Management, which
oversees the fund, said in an interview in the French capital.  The Government Pension Fund Global today said it agreed to
invest 702 million euros ($1 billion) to form a venture with Axa
Real Estate, part of the Paris-based insurance company, to own
156,000 square meters (1.68 million square feet) of mainly
office properties in Paris. The fund’s other purchase was a 452
million-pound ($723 million) deal for 25 percent of the  London 
Regent Street shopping area.  The Oslo-based fund, built from Norway’s oil and gas
wealth, last year won approval to put 5 percent of its capital
of $570 billion in real estate, shifting some bond holdings to
achieve a 4 percent annual return target.  “Eventually we are going to have to spread out” from
 France , the U.K. and Germany, Kallevig said. “Right now, it’s a
blanket ‘no’.”  The Paris properties, in which the fund will own a 50
percent stake, include 12-14 on Rond Point des Champs-Elysees,
Opus 12 in La Defense as well as the  Meudon Campus .  A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned fund with assets
such as stocks, bonds and real estate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
