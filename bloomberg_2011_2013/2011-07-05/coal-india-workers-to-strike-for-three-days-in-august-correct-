(Corrects number of days in the headline of story published
yesterday.)  Workers at  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the
world’s biggest producer of the fuel, threatened to go on strike
protesting a delay in wage increases, a labor union leader said.  Employees may walk off their jobs starting Aug. 8 through
Aug. 10, said Rajendra Prasad Singh, general secretary at the
ruling Congress party-backed  Indian National Trade Union
Congress . Representatives of five major unions decided to give
the strike notice to the company after meeting executives in  New
Delhi  today, he said.  “Wages were supposed to be increased from July 1 and until
today even the committee has not been formed to start
negotiations,” Singh said.  The labor unions resisted Coal India’s initial share sale
in October, saying “privatization” of the company will put
their jobs at risk. The government, which owns 90 percent of the
company, later persuaded them to support the sale.  Coal  India  Chairman N.C. Jha did not answer two calls made
to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
