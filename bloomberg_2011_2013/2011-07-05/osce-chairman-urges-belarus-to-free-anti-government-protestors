The Organization for Security and
Cooperation  urged Belarus to free anti-government protestors
detained during the country’s  Independence Day  celebrations.  “I urge the Belarusian government to release those
detained, further refrain from using violence against peaceful
citizens and ensure respect for fundamental human rights and
freedoms,” OSCE Chairman-in-Office Audronis Azubalis, who is
also  Lithuania ’s foreign minister, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Belarusian demonstrators were sentenced to as long as 15
days in jail after police arrested almost 400 people during an
anti-government protest on July 3. Riot police in the capital,
Minsk, used tear gas to disperse protesters as President
Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has ruled the former Soviet republic
since 1994, faces growing unrest over his handling of the
economy.  The European Union extended sanctions against Belarusian
officials last month for prosecuting presidential candidates and
activists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
