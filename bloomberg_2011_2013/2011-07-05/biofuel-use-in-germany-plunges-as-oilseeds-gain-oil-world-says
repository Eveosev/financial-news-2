Biofuel consumption in  Germany 
declined 18 percent in April because of scarce supplies and
rising prices for rapeseed and oil made from the seed, Hamburg-
based oilseeds analyst Oil World said.  Blenders mixed less biodiesel with regular fuel as the
price of rapeseed gained 33 percent in the past year, Oil World
said today in a report. Ethanol mixed into fuel fell by 11
percent in the year through April as Germans shunned the
product, according to the report. Biofuel production totaled
194,000 tons in April, down from 238,000 tons a year earlier,
the researcher said.  “Demand for certified rapeseed oil mainly of German origin
for biodiesel production reportedly increased to record
levels,” Oil World said. “The declining usage of biodiesel is
largely attributable to scarce supplies and high prices of
rapeseed and rapeseed oil.”  Rapeseed on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 33 percent in the
past year to 436 euros ($631.42) a ton by 11:20 a.m. today in
the French capital. The price on ICE Futures Canada in Winnipeg
gained 32 percent in the past 12 months. Total diesel use in
Germany dropped 1.7 percent to 2.65 million tons in April
compared with the same month a year earlier, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
