South African business confidence
gained in June as increased  consumer spending  bolstered the
recovery in Africa’s largest economy, the country’s Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said.  The Business Confidence Index advanced to 86.8 from 85.8 in
May, the Johannesburg-based chamber, known as SACCI, said today
in an e-mailed statement. The index is compiled from 13 economic
indicators, including retail sales, inflation and financial
gauges, such as the  stock index  and the currency.  “The recovery in real household expenditure in durable
goods, such as motor vehicles, was robust as lower  interest
rates  were easing the burden of indebted consumers,” the
chamber said. The central bank has kept its benchmark interest
rate at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent this year.  South African consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of demand in the economy, rose in the first quarter as
real disposable income grew, the  Reserve Bank  said on June 21.
Retail sales rose as its fastest pace in almost four years in
April, increasing 9.8 percent from a year earlier, Statistics
South Africa said on June 15.  With mixed signs in the economy, current consumption
patterns are “dubious and may contribute to a false sense of
improved business confidence,” the chamber said. The driving
force behind the current performance is fragile, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
