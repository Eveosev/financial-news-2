Brazil  plans to sell dollar bonds
abroad for the first time since September, taking advantage of a
rally that’s driven the country’s benchmark yields to a seven-
month low, said a government official.  The government may sell the bonds this month with
maturities of 10 or 30 years, said the official, who asked not
to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak about the
transaction.  The  Finance Ministry  declined to comment in a statement
sent by e-mail. Brazil intends to issue bonds abroad “soon,”
Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin told reporters in Brasilia on
June 29.  Yields on Brazilian dollar bonds due in 2019 touched a
seven-month low of 3.45 percent on June 24. The bonds yielded
3.53 percent at 4:45 p.m. New York time, down from 4.24 percent
at the end of last year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
