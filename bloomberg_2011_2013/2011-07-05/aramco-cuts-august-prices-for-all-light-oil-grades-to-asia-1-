Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, cut official selling prices for August
shipments of light crude grades to customers in  Asia .  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , reduced
the price for Arab Extra Light crude to Asia by 50 cents a
barrel to $2.95 above the benchmark, the company said today in
an e-mailed statement. Aramco lowered the price for Arab Light
crude by 10 cents a barrel to a premium of $1.35 above the
average of the Oman and Dubai oil grades, the Gulf benchmarks
used by traders in Asia.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most
of their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of
the region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives differentials for the four
regions where Aramco sells in relation to benchmark prices, the
month-on-month price change and the degrees of gravity as
defined by the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at
