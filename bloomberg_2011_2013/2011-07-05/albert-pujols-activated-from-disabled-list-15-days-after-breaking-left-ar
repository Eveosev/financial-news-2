St. Louis Cardinals first baseman
 Albert Pujols  was activated from the disabled list, 15 days
after breaking his left arm and two weeks before he was expected
to return,  Major League Baseball  said on its  website .  Pujols, 31, wonâ€™t be in the starting lineup tonight against
the  Cincinnati Reds  and should be available to pinch hit,
according to the website. The nine-time All-Star and three-time
National League Most Valuable Player was injured on June 19 in a
collision at first base with Kansas City Royals third baseman
Wilson Betemit.  At the time of the injury, Pujols was expected to miss four
to six weeks. He has been working out for about a week and is
returning from the disabled list at the earliest possible date,
the website said.  In 73 games this season, Pujols is hitting a career-
low .279, with 17 home runs and 45 runs batted in.  The Cardinals went 6-7 in his absence and scored 51 runs, a
full run per game less than their average with Pujols in the
lineup, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
