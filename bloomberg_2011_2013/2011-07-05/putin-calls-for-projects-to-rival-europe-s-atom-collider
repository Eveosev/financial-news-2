Russia will develop large-scale
scientific projects to rival  Europe ’s Large Hadron Collider,
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  “Such projects can be comparable to the space or nuclear
programs that have been successfully carried out in our
country,” Putin told a meeting of the government’s committee on
high technology today in the Moscow region.  The Education and Science Ministry has drawn up a list of
six potential projects, including construction of a
thermonuclear research center and reactor. The cost of the
projects may be 133 billion rubles ($4.8 billion), said Deputy
Finance Minister Alexander Novak.  The LHC is a 27-kilometer (17-mile) circuit of magnets
running under the French-Swiss border that smashes beams of
atomic particles to record the resulting collisions. The world’s
biggest scientific experiment is recording collisions in its
hunt for the origin of the universe’s missing mass and “dark
matter.”  Putin viewed a Russian collider under construction in the
Moscow-region town of Dubna today, the RIA Novosti news service
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
