Croatia  asked for the preliminary
extradition of Zsolt Hernadi, the chairman of Hungarian refiner
Mol Nyrt., over an alleged bribery case, Nepszabadsag reported,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Hernadi may be accused of paying former Croatian Prime
Minister Ivo Sanader 10 million euros ($14 million) to gain
management control of Croatian refiner INA Industrija Nafte
d.d., the newspaper said, citing Croatian media.  Hungarian authorities declined to comment, it added.  Vuk Djuricic, a spokesman at Croatia’s Office for
Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime, didn’t answer his
phone this morning and the state prosecutor hasn’t yet answered
a Bloomberg e-mail.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
