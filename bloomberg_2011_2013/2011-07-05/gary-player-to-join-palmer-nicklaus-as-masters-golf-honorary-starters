Gary Player will join  Jack Nicklaus 
and  Arnold Palmer  as an honorary starter for the 2012  Masters
Tournament , reuniting golf’s so-called Big Three at the first
major tournament of the year.  Player became the Masters’ first international champion in
1961 when he captured the first of three titles at Augusta
National Golf Club. He made his 52nd and final appearance in
2010.  “I am thrilled to join my friends Jack and Arnold as an
honorary starter,” Player said in a statement released by the
private club in Augusta,  Georgia . “Augusta National is a
special place that holds many memories for me.”  With Player, 75, joining Palmer and Nicklaus, the
tournament’s starters will account for 13 Masters championships,
including seven consecutive victories from 1960 through 1966.  The last time all three competed in the Masters was 2004,
the year Palmer, now 81, made his 50th consecutive start.
Nicklaus, now 71, joined Palmer as an honorary starter in 2010,
five years after his final competitive appearance.  The three have been linked throughout their professional
careers.  When Player won his first Masters title, Palmer, the
defending champion, placed the winner’s Green Jacket on the
South African. In 1975, a year after Player won his second
title, he presented the winner’s jacket to Nicklaus for his
fourth victory.  South African Champions  While it took until the 25th Masters for Player to become
the event’s first international champion, three of the last four
winners have been non-U.S. players, including South Africans
Charl Schwartzel (2011) and Trevor Immelman (2008).  Before Palmer agreed to hit the opening tee shot in 2007,
the tournament had gone without a ceremonial starter since Sam Snead died in 2002. The tradition, which began in 1963, takes
place before the first official group begins the opening round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
