Yale University , the second-richest
U.S. institution of higher learning, raised a record $3.88
billion in a five-year campaign that concluded June 30.  The Yale Tomorrow campaign officially started in September
2006 with $1.15 billion already raised, the university in New
Haven,  Connecticut , said today in a  statement  on its website. It
received $857 million in the past 12 months, Yale said.  Ten donors gave gifts of $50 million or more, said Inge Reichenbach, vice president of development, in the statement.
Among them were alumnus Stephen Adams, and his wife, Denise, who
gave $100 million to make the Yale School of Music tuition free.
Edward Evans, a former publishing executive, donated $50 million
to the  Yale School of Management  two weeks before his death in
January. John C. Malone, chairman of Liberty Media Corp., gave
$50 million to fund 10 new engineering professors.  “The Yale Tomorrow campaign has made Yale a stronger
institution and magnified our impact on the world,” Richard Levin, the school’s president, said in the statement. “I am
deeply grateful for the extraordinary support of our donors.”  Yale’s endowment was $16.7 billion on June 30, 2010,
trailing only the $27.4 billion of  Harvard University , in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard, which is planning a campaign,
last concluded one in 1999 with $2.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
