European stocks advanced, with the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rising for a seventh straight day, before
a U.S. report that may show factory orders rebounded in May.
Asian shares fell and U.S. index futures were little changed.  Celesio AG, Europeâ€™s biggest drug wholesaler, jumped 4.8
percent after analysts raised their recommendation on the stock.
CSM NV slumped 9 percent, its largest drop in 2 1/2 years, after
saying first-half earnings will decline because of higher raw-
material costs.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.3 percent to 276.38 at 10:50 a.m.
in  London . The index surged 4.4 percent over the past six
trading days after Greek lawmakers passed a five-year austerity
package, qualifying the country for further aid. The measure
still slipped 1.1 percent in the second quarter on concern that
 Greece  will fail to repay all its debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
