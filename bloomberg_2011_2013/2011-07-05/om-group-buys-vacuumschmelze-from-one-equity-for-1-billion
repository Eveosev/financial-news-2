OM Group Inc. (OMG) , the worldâ€™s largest
cobalt producer, will buy Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG from One
Equity Partners LLC in a transaction worth about 700 million
euros ($1 billion).  One Equity will receive $50 million in OM Group shares,
equal to a 4 percent stake, under the terms of the agreement to
purchase the Hanau, Germany-based maker of advanced materials
and specialty magnetics for the automotive and electronics
industries, the company said in a statement. The deal is
expected to close by the end of the third quarter and is subject
to regulatory approvals.  One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JPMorgan
Chase & Co., had bought Vacuumschmelze in 2005 for $529 million
from Morgan Crucible Co. The takeover marks the largest purchase
of a maker of advanced materials in at least a decade, according
to Bloomberg data.  Vacuumschmelze  had sales of about 389 million euros and an
operating profit of 78 million euro in the 12 months ending
March 31, and employs 4,500 people. OM Group will finance the
deal through a combination of cash, stock and committed
financing from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, PNC Capital
Markets LLC, and BNP Paribas SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
