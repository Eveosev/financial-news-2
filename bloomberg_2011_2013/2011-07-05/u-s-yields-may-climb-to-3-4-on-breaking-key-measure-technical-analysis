Treasury yields may rise to a two-
month high of 3.4 percent after breaking above a key Fibonacci
level last week, BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd. said, citing
trading patterns.  Ten-year rates advanced to 3.22 percent on July 1,
climbing above the threshold of 3.19 percent that represented a
38.2 percent retracement of their decline from this year’s high
of 3.77 percent on Feb. 9 to 2011’s low of 2.84 percent on June
27, a Fibonacci chart shows.  “U.S. yields seem to have bottomed,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, an interest-rate strategist at the unit of BNP Paribas
SA in  Tokyo . “Yields may next test 3.3 percent or 3.5
percent,” especially if the outlook for the  U.S. economy 
continues to improve, he said.  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped six basis points to
3.12 percent yesterday in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  The next target for yields is now 3.4 percent, which
represents a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
February-to-June decline, Fujiki said. The yield was last above
3.24 percent on May 12.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Key percentages include 38.2, 50, 61.8 and 76.4. A break above
resistance or below support, indicates a currency may move to
the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
