New York  City’s pension funds gained
the most in 13 years last fiscal year after the hiring of new
asset managers and improved stock and bond markets, Comptroller
 John Liu  said.  The funds were valued at about $119 billion in the year
that ended June 30, up more than 20 percent from $97.8 billion a
year earlier, according to preliminary estimates released today
by Liu, whose office oversees the pensions.  “While the markets remain volatile, we have vigorously
pursued a diversification strategy to enhance our returns while
lowering pension costs to the city,” Liu said in a news
release. The office hired people to target asset classes such as
stocks,  hedge funds , fixed income, private equity and real
estate, he said.  U.S. public pension-fund assets rose 3.6 percent during the
first three months of the year, the  U.S. Census Bureau  said June
30. Assets of the 100 largest plans grew by $93.9 billion in the
first quarter to $2.73 trillion, up from $2.64 trillion on Dec.
31.  Pensions have benefited from the stock market’s rebound
since March 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 5.4
percent in the first quarter after climbing almost 13 percent
last year and 23 percent in 2009. Pension holdings of stocks
rose 3.4 percent, or $29.3 billion, to $896.4 billion in the
first quarter, the Census Bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
