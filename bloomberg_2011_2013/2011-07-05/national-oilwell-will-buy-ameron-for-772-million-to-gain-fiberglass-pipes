National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV) , the
world’s largest provider of oilfield equipment, agreed to buy
 Ameron International Corp. (AMN)  for about $772 million in cash,
gaining access to its pipeline-production unit.  Holders of Ameron will receive $85 for each share, Houston-
based National Oilwell said today in a statement. The companies’
boards have approved the transaction, which may close as soon as
the fourth quarter. The price is a 28 percent premium to
Ameron’s closing price on July 1.  Ameron, based in  Pasadena ,  California , surged $18.81, or 28
percent, to $85.08 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the largest gain in 31 years. National
Oilwell rose $1.74, or 2.2 percent, to $80.05.  “The acquisition of this leading fiberglass-pipe provider
will enhance the scale and scope of the solutions we offer to
our oil and gas customers worldwide,” National Oilwell Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Pete Miller said in the statement.  Ameron makes fiberglass-composite pipe for moving oil,
chemicals and fluids, according to the statement. The company
also provides poles and construction materials, as well as
fabricated steel products.  The deal will add to National Oilwell’s earnings next year,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
