Mika Myllyla, who won six Olympic
medals in cross-country skiing for  Finland , has died at the age
of 41, police said.  A statement on the website of the Central Ostrobothnia and
Pietarsaari police district didn’t provide further details,
except to say no crime was suspected.  “His death is being investigated to determine the cause,”
the  statement  said.  Myllyla won the  gold medal  in the 30-kilometer (18.6-mile)
race at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano,  Japan . He won two other
medals that year and three at the 1994 Games in Lillehammer,
 Norway .  Myllyla, a four-time world champion, was suspended two
years for a positive drug test in 2001. He made a brief comeback
before retiring in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
