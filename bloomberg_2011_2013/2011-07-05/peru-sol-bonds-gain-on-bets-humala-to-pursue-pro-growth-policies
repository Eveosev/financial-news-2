Peruvian sol bonds advanced, trimming
yields to a three-month low, on speculation President-elect
Ollanta Humala will back policies designed to lure investment
and spur growth.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 6.27 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.24 centimo to
110.75 centimos per sol, the highest since March 18.  Humala will probably name Kurt Burneo finance minister and
he’ll be “well-accepted” by investors, BNP Paribas economist
Italo Lombardi wrote in a July 1 report. Burneo is a former
deputy finance minister under President  Alejandro Toledo  and a
one-time director at the central bank. Toledo told reporters
yesterday in Lima his party will provide political and technical
support for Humala’s government.  “Peruvian assets have been benefitting from a better view
on Humala and the positive signals that he’s giving to
markets,” said Daniel Chodos, an emerging markets strategist at
Credit Suisse Securities in  New York . Humala has “in some way
assured markets the new government is likely to be more centrist
than originally expected.”  Humala said July 1 that he’ll announce cabinet posts “at
the right moment” and said reports that he has decided on any
appointments are “speculation.”  The sol was little changed at 2.7490 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7500 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
