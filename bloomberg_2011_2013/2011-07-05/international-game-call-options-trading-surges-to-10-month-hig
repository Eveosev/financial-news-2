International Game Technology (IGT) ’s
bullish options volume jumped to a 10-month high as investors
boosted bets that the world’s biggest maker of slot machines
will rally to a one-year high in the next six weeks.  More than 13,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
3:19 p.m. in New York, 20 times the four-week average, as the
shares slumped 1.5 percent to $17.73. The most-active contracts
were August $19 calls, which accounted for more than three-
quarters of the call volume.  “It’s an eye-opener,” said  Patrick Mortimer , director of
options trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope ,
Pennsylvania. “This is purely bullish. Someone’s looking for a
9 percent increase in the shares, and that’s a pretty big pop.”  Eighty-one percent of the August $19 calls changed hands on
the ask price, while today’s trades exceeded the open interest
of 107 outstanding contracts before today, indicating that
buyers of new bullish positions initiated most of the
transactions.  The $19 calls traded at an average price of about 36 cents
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A buyer at that
price profits if the stock rises above $19.36, the strike price
plus the cost of the contract, at expiration on Aug. 19. The
shares haven’t closed above $19 since June 15, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
