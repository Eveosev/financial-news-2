Iraq  exported 2.273 million barrels
of oil a day in June, the most since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion
of the country, according to Falah al-Amri, chairman of the
State Oil Marketing Organization.  June oil revenue, at an average price of $105 a barrel,
dropped to $7.1 billion from $7.4 billion a month earlier, when
the price was $108, he said by telephone from  Baghdad .  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
depends on oil for most state revenue. The government is
struggling to raise exports and is seeking foreign investors to
boost output after decades of conflict and sanctions destroyed
its infrastructure. The crude industry has also suffered in
recent years from insufficient spending and insurgent attacks.  The port of Basra in the country’s south exported 1.727
million barrels of crude a day last month while the oil hub of
Kirkuk in the north shipped 537,000 barrels a day, al-Amri said.
Another 10,000 barrels a day were shipped to Jordan by trucks,
he said.  Iraq has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since the 2003
U.S.-led invasion that ousted the regime of former President
 Saddam Hussein . It expects current oil output to rise to more
than 3 million barrels a day by the end of this year, compared
with 2.4 million barrels a day in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
