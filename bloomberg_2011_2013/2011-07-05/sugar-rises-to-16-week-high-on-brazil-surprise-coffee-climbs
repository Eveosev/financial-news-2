Sugar rose to a 16-week high on signs
of smaller crops in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower. Coffee
gained.  Production in Center South, Brazil’s biggest source of the
sweetener, has slid almost 25 percent this season from a year
earlier, Unica, an industry group, said last week. Cane output
in the region will decline for the first time in 10 years,
according to Datagro Ltd., a researcher. Prices jumped 14
percent in June.  “The Brazil crop performance has taken the market by
surprise,” said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at
Newedge USA in New York.  Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.36 cent, or 1.3
percent, to 27.61 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 9:51 a.m.
in New York. Earlier, the price climbed to 28.32 cents, the
highest since March 14.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 4.05
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.677 a pound on ICE.  In  London , refined sugar and robusta coffee gained on NYSE
Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
