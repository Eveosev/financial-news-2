Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped in July to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to
Chicago futures on climbing demand for tightening U.S. supplies.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month rose to 73 cents to 82 cents a bushel above July futures
from 72 cents to 78 cents on July 1, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The bid for corn delivered in August
jumped as much as 34 cents a bushel. There was no comparison for
grain delivered this month as exporters rolled basis from July
to September futures.  “There is very little farmer selling of either corn or
soybeans, and export demand is improving,” said Troy Lust, a
commercial grain broker for INTL FCStone Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa . “We are seeing a pickup in Chinese corn buying.”  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 10 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $13.3225 a bushel, the sixth gain in seven sessions.  Corn futures for September delivery rose 18.75 cents, or
3.1 percent, to $6.255 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
July corn jumped 6.2 percent to $6.805.  China , the world’s largest pork consumer, has sought grain
imports to replenish stockpiles and help cool domestic prices
that have climbed 22 percent in the past year, said
Grain.gov.cn, a state-controlled researcher. The country may
have purchased 2.5 million to 3 million metric tons in the past
week, and could import as much as 10 million tons to rebuild
inventories, Lust said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
