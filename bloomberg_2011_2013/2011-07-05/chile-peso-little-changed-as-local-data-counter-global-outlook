Chile ’s peso was little changed
versus the  U.S. dollar  today as a stronger-than-expected local
growth figure offset concerns of cooling global growth and
reduced demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso fell less than 0.1 percent to 465.80 per U.S.
dollar at 9:52 a.m. New York time, from 465.65 yesterday.  “Growth data in May was really good, and that shows that
the local market is attracting capital,” Ronald Volpi, head
currency trader at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said from
Santiago in a phone interview. “The euro has weakened and other
Latin American currencies are also falling versus the dollar.”  Chile’s economic activity indicator, known locally as the
Imacec, rose 7.3 percent in May from the previous year on gains
in industry, retail and transport services, the central bank
said in a statement on its website today. Fourteen economists
surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 6.8 percent increase.  The euro fell today on speculation that China will increase
 interest rates  this weekend, cooling growth.  Brazil’s real led losses among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, retreating as much as 0.7
percent after Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told
reporters in London that the government could take measures in
the  derivatives market  to control the appreciation of the
currency.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 466.14 per dollar
for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the
peso’s gains, according to data posted on the bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
