     July 5 (Bloomberg) -- Greek  bank deposits  fell by the most
in more than a year in May as speculation reignited that the
government would default on its sovereign debt and the countryâ€™s
economy contracted.  The balance of deposits held by businesses and households
declined to 191.9 billion euros last month from 196.8 billion
euros ($285 billion) in April, a 2.5 percent drop, the Athens-
based  Bank of Greece  said in a statement posted on its website
today.  The 4.9 billion-euro contraction is the most since April
2010, when they declined by 5.1 billion euros as Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  sought a bailout to save the country from
default.  Deposits by homes and businesses have fallen each month
this year, declining 17.7 billion euros since December 2010, or
8.4 percent, as the economy shrinks under the weight of
austerity measures introduced last year in exchange for a 110
billion-euro bailout from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund . The May figure is the lowest level since November
2007.  Greece  secured a fifth payment under that 2010 package on
July 2, after it pushed through an additional 78 billion euros
of budget cuts and state asset sales against strong domestic
resistance.  Lending to households and businesses contracted an annual
1.1 percent in May, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the
previous month, the central bank said in a separate e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
