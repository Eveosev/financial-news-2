U.K. ministers are looking at whether
they can set procurement rules that prefer domestic suppliers,
after Bombardier Inc., the world’s biggest trainmaker, said it
would eliminate more than 1,400 jobs at a British plant that
failed to get a government contract.  Business Secretary Vince Cable said today that British
companies lose out from the way the government applies European
Union procurement rules. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond
acknowledged that other countries do things differently and told
the  BBC , “the French routinely award contracts for trains to
French builders.”  Hammond and Cable have written to Prime Minister  David Cameron  urging a review of the way the government awards
contracts. Cable’s Growth Review, which is looking for ways to
help the economy, is now examining the issue.  “We recognize that there is a need to examine the wider
issue of whether the U.K. is making best use of the application
of the EU procurement rules,” Cable said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
