A physician working for  California ’s
overcrowded prison system was paid more than any other state
employee in 2010, according to payroll figures released today.  The doctor, whose salary last year was $235,740, collected
a total of $777,423, data released by Controller John Chiang
show. The total includes a settlement of back pay owed to the
doctor, said Nancy Kincaid, a spokeswoman for the court-
appointed office that oversees California’s prison medical
system.  Nine of the 10 highest-paid state employees were paid more
than $500,000 in the 2010 calendar year, amounts that include
bonuses, settlements, or retirement payouts of unused vacation
time or sick days, the  figures  show. In contrast, Governor  Jerry
Brown ’s salary is $173,987. Six of the top 10 were prison
doctors, psychiatrists or dentists.  Earlier data released by Chiang’s office erroneously showed
that a chief psychiatrist for the prison system topped the list
with a 2010 compensation of $838,706. A Chiang spokesman, Jacob
Roper, cited a data entry error for the mistake. Roper couldn’t
immediately say how much the psychiatrist was paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
