Ethanol futures surged the most in
three months in  Chicago  as corn and crude oil gained amid
optimism for increased demand.  The grain-based additive followed the other commodities
higher after a report showed  China ’s services industries
expanded at the second-fastest pace this year and after a
separate report showed orders placed with U.S. factories climbed
in May.  “All those mitigating factors are affecting the market
today,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “You
mix the crude oil and corn together and you get the spillover
into the ethanol market.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery jumped 12.7 cents, or
4.9 percent, to settle at $2.734 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the largest one-day gain since March 31.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  jumped 6.5
cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.785 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 6 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.68, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to
$2.785 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 5 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $2.775.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 15.75 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $6.125 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest
gain since June 28. One bushel can make at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Crude for August delivery gained $1.95 to $96.89 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
price since June 14. Futures have gained 34 percent in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
