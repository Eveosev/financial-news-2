Anthony Thomas , a senior analyst at
Moody’s Investors Service in  London , commented on the
possibility that private-sector owners of Portugal’s government
bonds may be asked to participate in a bailout of the country as
a condition for another European Union rescue. Thomas spoke in a
telephone interview.  Moody’s cut Portugal’s long-term bond rating today to Ba2,
or junk, from Baa1. The outlook is negative.  On private participation in a Portugal bailout:  “Private-sector participation under a support program to a
fiscally stressed country may be considered a distressed
exchange, and therefore a default under Moody’s definition, but
we would have to see exactly what is proposed.”  “The European Union’s approach is evolving. Clearly
nothing has been finalized. But from what we can see, it’s not
so much that we don’t think they’re going to provide additional
support, but a pre-condition of that additional support could
very well be private sector creditor participation.”  “Obviously that’s very significant because not only does
it affect current investors, but it is likely to discourage new
private-sector lending going forward, and therefore reduce the
likelihood that a country like  Portugal  will be able to regain
access to the capital markets at a sustainable cost.”  On Portugal’s budget deficit:  “There are concerns that Portugal will face considerable
challenges meeting its deficit-reduction target.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
