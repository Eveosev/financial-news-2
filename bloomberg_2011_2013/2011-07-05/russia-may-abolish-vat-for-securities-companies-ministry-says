Russia â€™s  Finance Ministry  proposed
eliminating value-added tax for local securities companies to
boost their competitiveness.  The tax makes financial services provided by Russian
companies 18 percent more costly compared with foreign rivals,
the ministry said in a draft tax-policy document for 2012-2014
published on its  website  today.  The ministry also proposed abolishing the tax for brokers,
depositaries, underwriters and asset managers, according to the
document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
