India  fired the Ukrainian coach of
its women’s 400-meter team after two more runners were suspended
for testing positive for banned steroids, widening a doping
scandal that has ensnared eight top athletes.  Yuri Ogorodonik was dismissed today, India’s Sport Minister
 Ajay Maken  said in televised comments. Maken said he would
remove other coaches found to have encouraged the use of
performance-enhancing substances as he ordered an investigation
into why the  doping  was not previously discovered.  “The positive dope tests of eight athletes brought
disgrace to the sporting fraternity and the entire country,”
Maken told reporters. “I have asked the director general of the
 Sports Authority  of India to submit a report within three
days,” he said in  New Delhi . The number of doctors monitoring
athletes may be increased, Maken said.  Three out of the four women runners in the 400-meter relay
team -- who last year won India’s first Commonwealth Games track
medal since 1958 -- have failed drugs tests. India won 101
medals, 38 of them gold, at last year’s event in the country’s
capital to rank second in the overall standings behind  Australia .  Ashwini Akkunji, one of the country’s best track athletes
who won two gold medals at the Asian Games last year and was a
member of the winning Commonwealth relay team, failed a doping
test yesterday, according to a government statement citing Maken.
Her relay teammates Mandeep Kaur and Sini Jose have also tested
positive for steroids along with a female shot-putter and a male
long-jumper, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
