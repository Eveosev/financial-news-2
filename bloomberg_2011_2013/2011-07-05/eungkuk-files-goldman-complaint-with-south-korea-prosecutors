Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. and
Heungkuk Fire & Marine Insurance Co. filed a complaint against
nine  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executives and employees to South
Korean prosecutors, accusing them of fraud, according to a
Heungkuk Life official.  The insurers filed the complaint to the Seoul Central
District Prosecutors’ office on June 28, Lee Yun No, an official
at Heungkuk Life, said by phone today, confirming a Korea
Economic Daily report. The Korean companies have seen losses
from purchasing collateralized debt obligation in 2007 from
Goldman Sachs, Lee said, without elaborating.  “The prosecutors’ office has not contacted us on this
matter,” Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said
by phone in Seoul. A spokesman at the prosecutors’ office
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
