Croatia ’s Prosecutor General said it
hasn’t issued a request to extradite Zsolt Hernadi, the chairman
of Hungarian refiner Mol Nyrt, denying a report published today
by Hungarian newspaper Nepszabadsag.  The information “is not correct,” Martina Mihordin,
spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General, said today in an e-
mailed statement to Bloomberg News.  Nepszabadsag reported there is an extradition order for
Hernady over an alleged bribery case involving Croatian refiner
INA Industrija Nafte d.d., citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
