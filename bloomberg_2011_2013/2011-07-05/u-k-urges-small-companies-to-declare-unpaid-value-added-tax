Britain’s revenue authority said it
will reduce late-payment penalties on some taxes for small
companies and individuals, urging them to disclose outstanding
tax before Sept. 30 or face tougher fines.  The revenue and customs department has written to 40,000
small companies and sole traders, asking them to give details of
undeclared value-added tax, which will be subject to a reduced
10 percent penalty rate, the department said in a statement
released in  London  today. Those failing to comply may face
“substantial penalties or even criminal prosecution,” it said.  “The aim is to make it easy for individuals and businesses
to contact us, make a full disclosure of their income and face a
reduced penalty on any tax owed,” said Mike Wells, director of
risk and intelligence at the department.  The campaign seeks to build on previous efforts that
have so far netted 600 million pounds ($965 million) for the
Treasury. It targets individuals and businesses with annual
revenue of more than 73,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
