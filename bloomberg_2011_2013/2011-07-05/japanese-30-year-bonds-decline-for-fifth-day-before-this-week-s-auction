Japan ’s 30-year bonds dropped for a
fifth day on speculation the nation’s improving economy will
curtail demand at a 700 billion yen ($8.63 billion) auction of
the securities this week.  Benchmark 10-year yields climbed to a two-month high after
a government report showed wages unexpectedly increased in May.
Debt also declined after the resignation of a minister damaged
the administration of Prime Minister  Naoto Kan , adding to
concern his efforts to restrain spending will fail. The  Finance
Ministry  sold 2 trillion yen of 10-year debt today.  “The drop in 30-year bonds comes in part from the
improvement in the domestic economy,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a
senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan Securities Co., one of the
24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.
“Everybody in the market feels if confidence in Japan falters,
we can’t keep these low bond yields,” he said, referring to the
political situation.  The 30-year yield rose 2.5 basis points to 2.07 percent as
of 3:26 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 2.2 percent security due
March 2041 slipped 0.474 yen to 102.390 yen.  Ten-year yields gained one basis point to 1.17 percent, the
highest level since May 6. Ten-year futures for September
delivery lost 0.13 to 140.78 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  Wages including overtime and bonuses climbed 1.1 percent
from a year earlier to 271,621 yen, the Labor Ministry said
today in Tokyo. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a
0.6 percent decline.  Disaster reconstruction minister Ryu Matsumoto submitted
his resignation today after publicly scolding the governor of a
region devastated by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Matsumoto’s departure may complicate Kan’s aim of passing
three bills before carrying out a pledge to step down.  Today’s sale of 10-year bonds drew bids valued at 3.24
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.70 last month. The government will sell 30-year
bonds on July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
