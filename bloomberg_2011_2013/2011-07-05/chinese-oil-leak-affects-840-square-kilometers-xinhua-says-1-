An oil leak at  China ’s Bohai Bay
affected 840 square kilometers (324 square miles) and polluted
some of the marine environment, the official  Xinhua News Agency 
reported, citing the State Oceanic Administration.  About 70 cubic meters of oil mixed with water was cleaned
up as of yesterday, the agency said. No oil was visible on sea’s
surface, and sheen from crude around the platform was minimal,
according to the report.  An oil leak at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield in China’s Bohai
Bay last month is contained and clean-up work is near
completion, Houston-based ConocoPhillips said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Conoco, operator of the site, owns 49
percent stake of the field and  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the nation’s largest
offshore oil producer, owns the remaining 51 percent.  Conoco’s oil drilling increased pressure on the earth
surface and caused the leak, Xinhua said. Conoco will be legally
responsible for the accident, it said.  --Winnie Zhu, with assistance from Alfred Cang and Jing Jin.
