The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will make
a decision on a new trading platform by the end of the year,
said Chief Executive Officer Ester Levanon.  The bourse would “prefer to buy an existing system from a
leading exchange” rather than develop its own, Levanon told
reporters at a breakfast in  London  today. “By the end of 2011,
we will know what direction we are taking, then we will start
planning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
