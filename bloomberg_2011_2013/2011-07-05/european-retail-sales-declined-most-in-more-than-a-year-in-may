European retail sales declined the
most in more than a year in May, as consumers from  Germany  to
Ireland and  Spain  cut spending.  Sales in the 17-nation euro region slipped 1.1 percent
from April, when they rose 0.7 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg, Eurostat, said today. That’s
the biggest decline since April 2010. Economists had projected a
drop of 1 percent, the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Sales fell 1.9 percent from a year ago.  European retailers may struggle to maintain their sales
growth at home as rising energy costs sap consumers’ spending
power just as governments step up budget cuts to contain the
region’s debt crisis, undermining economic growth. Services
growth weakened in June and economic confidence fell. Italian
luxury-goods maker Prada SpA on June 3 forecast first-half
profit to jump, helped by an expansion in Asian markets.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, retail sales slipped
2.8 percent from April, when they remained unchanged, today’s
report showed. French sales fell 0.7 percent, while Spanish
sales dropped 1.6 percent in the month. In Ireland and Portugal,
which have both received external aid, sales fell 0.6 percent
and 3.1 percent from April, respectively.  The statistics office didn’t provide figures for  Greece ,
 Italy  and the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
