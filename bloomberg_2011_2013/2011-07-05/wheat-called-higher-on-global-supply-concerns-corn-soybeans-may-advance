What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 20 cents to 23 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade
and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that adverse
weather will curtail growth in global output, said Greg Grow,
the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 13 cents a bushel
higher on the CBOT as demand for U.S. supplies climbs in  China 
and South Korea following a slump in prices to the lowest in six
months, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after U.S. farmers told the government they planted
less this year, while hot, dry weather later in July may damage
Midwest crops, Grow said. Soybean-meal futures may open $3 to $4
higher per 2,000 pounds, and  soybean oil  is expected to open up
0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
