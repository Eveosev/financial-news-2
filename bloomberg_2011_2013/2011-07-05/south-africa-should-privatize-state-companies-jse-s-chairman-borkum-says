South Africa ’s debate on
nationalizing the country’s mining industry should be replaced
by discussion on selling state-owned companies to private
investors to drive efficiency, said Humphrey Borkum, chairman of
 JSE Ltd. (JSE)  which runs the continent’s biggest bourse  The ruling African National Congress agreed in September to
study nationalization to meet demands from  Julius Malema , head
of its youth arm. Mine operators in South Africa are compelled
by law to sell 26 percent of their assets to black investors by
2014 and boost numbers of black managers to help make up for
discrimination during apartheid before 1994. Some companies
missed targets for 2009, the mines minister said at the time,
adding that the industry had “not lived up to the spirit and
intent” of the law.  “The government has enough on its plate trying to fulfil
its mandate of service delivery,” Borkum wrote in an opinion
piece published in Johannesburg-based  Business Report  today.
“To date, it does not have a consistent record of running
municipalities, public schools, transport or parastatals with
competence.”  If the government privatized state-owned companies such as
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the power utility, and ports and rail
operator Transnet SOC Ltd., “the taxes they would pay would
result in more money for better housing, schools and hospitals
for the poor,” Borkum wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
