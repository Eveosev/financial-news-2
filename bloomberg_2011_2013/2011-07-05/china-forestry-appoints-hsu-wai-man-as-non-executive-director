China Forestry Holdings Co., partly
owned by Washington-based private equity firm  Carlyle Group ,
appointed Hsu Wai Man as an independent non-executive director,
the company said in a statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange
today.  Hsu will be a member of the independent board committee set
up in January to investigate “possible irregularities”
identified by its auditors.  China Forestry’s shares have been suspended since Jan. 27
and the company said in April that its former management
falsified bank documents and logging permits.  Hsu, who worked for accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP for
18 years, will also chair the audit committee, replacing Wong
Tak-jun who has retired, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
