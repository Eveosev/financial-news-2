Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to fall the most in a week, before a government report
today that is expected to show monthly inflation slowed in June.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.84 percent at
3:54 p.m. New York time, according to the stock exchange. That’s
its biggest decline since June 24. The bond’s price advanced
0.270 centavo to 117.242 centavos per peso. Colombian markets
were closed yesterday for a national holiday.  “The market is attentive to the inflation numbers,” said
Daniel Escobar, an analyst at Global Securities brokerage in
Bogota. “Inflation is expected to remain under control in the
medium term.”  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.23 percent in June from
the previous month compared to 0.28 percent in May, according to
the medium estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
national statistics agency is slated to release the report at 8
p.m. New York time.  Colombia’s peso fell, ending a five-day winning streak, as
concern the global economic recovery is faltering cut demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets. The peso dropped 0.5
percent to 1,769 per dollar, from 1,761 yesterday.  Orders placed with U.S. factories increased at a slower
pace than economists forecast, according to the Commerce
Department. European services and manufacturing growth slowed
more than estimated in June, Markit Economics said. The U.S. is
Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying about 40 percent of
the South American nation’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
