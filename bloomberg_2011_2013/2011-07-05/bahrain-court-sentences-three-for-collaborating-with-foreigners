A Bahraini criminal court sentenced
three people to 10 years in jail and 10,000 dinars ($26,526)
each for collaborating with a foreign country, the state-run
 Bahrain  News Agency said.  One of the three, a Bahraini man, was recruited by the
other defendants, who live in  Kuwait  and were sentenced in
absentia, BNA said. The man was asked to obtain information on
military and economic installations, the agency reported. It
said he took photographs of facilities and housing units of
staff who work at the U.S. Navy base in return for 20,000
Kuwaiti dinars ($72,931). The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in
Bahrain.  BNA didn’t identify the country. Prosecutor Nayef Yousef in
May said it was  Iran , which Bahrain’s government has accused of
stoking unrest in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
