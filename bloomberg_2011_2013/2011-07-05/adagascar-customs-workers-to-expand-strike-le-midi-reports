Customs workers in Madagascar plan to
expand a strike until a commission to investigate a recent case
of illegal rosewood exports is put in place along with
safeguards to prevent more unlawful shipments, Le Midi reported.  A strike in the eastern port of Toamasina that started on
July 1 went nationwide after talks failed between the director-
general of customs, Vola Razafindramiandra, and Minister of
Finance Hery Rajaonarimampianina, the Antananarivo-based
newspaper said, citing a union official.  Madagascar recently received $52 million in World Bank
funding for environmental projects on the basis that the
government crack down on the illegal logging trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
