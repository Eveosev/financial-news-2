President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
has “a unique opportunity to do something big to tackle our
deficit” and said he opposes a short-term measure that would
raise the country’s debt limit without addressing more basic
solutions to deficit spending.  Obama said voters haven’t sent leaders to  Washington  to
“take the path of least resistance.” He said in a White House
briefing that he asked bipartisan congressional leaders to meet
on July 7 for talks on the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
