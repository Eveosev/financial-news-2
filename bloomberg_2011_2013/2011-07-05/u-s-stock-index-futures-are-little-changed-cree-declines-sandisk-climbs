U.S. stocks fell, ending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index’s five-day winning streak, as a Moody’s
Investors Service downgrade of Portuguese debt rekindled concern
the economy will slow and offset gains by energy producers.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest U.S. lender, and  General
Electric Co. (GE)  lost 0.8 percent as shares of financial and
industrial companies led losses in the S&P 500. A gauge of banks
dropped the most in the S&P 500 within 24 groups, falling 1.2
percent, as Citigroup Inc. said 2012 industry earnings estimates
may be too high. Energy companies in the S&P 500 advanced 0.5
percent, the most among 10 groups.  The S&P 500 slumped 0.1 percent to 1,337.88 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The intraday move in the S&P 500 between its high and
low was 0.5 percent, the smallest move since April 29, when the
index peaked for the year. The benchmark equity index rose 5.6
percent last week, the biggest rally since July 2009. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  fell 12.90 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,569.87 today.  “The market is correcting a little bit after a strong run
last week, using the headline about  Portugal ’s debt rating as a
catalyst,” said Tom Mangan, who helps oversee $2.7 billion at
James Investment Research Inc. in Xenia,  Ohio . “Portugal’s
economy has virtually no impact on U.S. markets, but the
question is whether this is the continuation of a problem that
began in  Greece . It raises fear of a contagion effect in the
market.”  June Loss  The  S&P 500  fell 1.8 percent in June, spurring the first
quarterly loss in a year, on concern that Greece will fail to
repay all of its debt and that the  U.S. economy  will weaken
further. Even so, the index has gained 6.4 percent in 2011 as
government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated corporate
earnings lifted investors’ confidence.  Stocks reversed gains after Portugal’s long-term government
bond ratings were cut to Ba2, or junk, from Baa1 by Moody’s,
making it the second euro-region country with a non-investment-
grade ranking.  Equities declined earlier as the Commerce Department said
orders placed with U.S. factories increased 0.8 percent in May,
while economists projected a 1 percent increase, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  An unexpected pickup in American manufacturing growth
helped ease concern last week that the world’s largest economy
is faltering, sending benchmark indexes to their highest levels
since May and their biggest weekly gains in two years. Alcoa
Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, will become the first
Dow company to report second-quarter earnings on July 11.  Earnings Season  The “earnings season is right around the very close
corner,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as
chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. “The past
number of quarters it’s definitely helped the market with
surprises on the upside, and we could see more of that.”  Bank of America lost 0.8 percent to $11 as financial stocks
in the S&P 500 slumped 0.8 percent, the most among 10
industries. The KBW Bank Index retreated 1.2 percent as 22 of
its 24 stocks retreated.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, dropped 0.9 percent to $28.42.  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF)  slid 2.1 percent to $6.17.  “We believe that a prolonged low rate environment is
consistent with weak earning asset growth,”  Keith Horowitz , an
analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients today. “While
we believe the large regional banks in our universe should
report 2Q results largely in line with consensus, we do see
significant downside to 2012/2013.”  General Electric  GE, the world’s biggest maker of jet engines, power-
generation equipment, medical imaging machines and locomotives,
slipped 0.8 percent to $19.04. A gauge of industrial companies
lost 0.6 percent, the second-most within 10 groups in the S&P
500.  Energy shares climbed as crude oil jumped 2.1 percent to a
three-week high of $96.89 a barrel after European finance
ministers approved an 8.7 billion-euro ($12.6 billion) aid
payment to Greece on July 2. Marathon Oil gained 3.4 percent to
$34.07 and Peabody Energy advanced 2.2 percent to $60.69.
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-biggest U.S. energy company, rose the
most in the Dow, adding 1 percent to $105.12.  The S&P 500 Insurance Index of 22 stocks slumped 1.1
percent, the second-biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 24
groups.  MetLife Inc. (MET)  lost 1.5 percent to $43.72, while  Genworth
Financial Inc. (GNW)  decreased 2.7 percent to $10.28.  Insurance Probe  MetLife and Genworth Financial units are among nine
companies subpoenaed last month as part of New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman’s probe of the life insurance
industry’s handling of so-called abandoned property, a person
familiar with the matter said.  The probe is seeking to determine whether the companies do
enough to determine whether someone has died and benefits are
due, the person said. About 35 other states are looking into
whether the insurance industry is adequately handling abandoned
property such as unclaimed life-insurance proceeds.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest Internet-search company,
rose 2.2 percent to $532.44. The shares were raised to
“overweight” from “equal weight” at Evercore Partners, which
said they may reach $670 as the company grows in social media
and other product initiatives.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  climbed 1.5 percent to $43.45. Deutsche Bank
AG analysts Bob Gujavarty and Ross Seymore raised their
recommendation to “buy” from “hold,” saying profit margins
will become “far more sustainable.”  General Motors Co. (GM)  gained 0.9 percent to $30.86. The
biggest overseas automaker in  China  said its June sales rose in
the country, reversing a two-month decline, as customers bought
more Buick and Chevrolet passenger cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
