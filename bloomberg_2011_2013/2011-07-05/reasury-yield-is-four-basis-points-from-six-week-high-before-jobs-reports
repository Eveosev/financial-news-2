Treasury yields were four basis
points away from the highest level in six weeks before private
and government reports that economists said will show hiring in
the U.S. is picking up.  Money managers are more bearish on Treasuries than they’ve
been all year, a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc. shows.
The company’s sentiment gauge on the outlook for Treasuries
through Dec. 31 slid to a 2011 low of 41 for the seven days
ended July 1. Ried Thunberg ICAP, a New Jersey-based unit of
the world’s largest interdealer broker, surveyed 16 investors
controlling $1.27 trillion.  “Yields will go up,” said Jorg Zeuner, chief economist
at VP Bank AG, a private bank in Liechtenstein that oversees
the equivalent of $47.2 billion. “There’s an improving
economic outlook.” Investors should favor corporate, high-
yield and emerging-market bonds, he said in an interview in
 Singapore .  Ten-year yields were little changed at 3.18 percent as of
9:50 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 3.125 percent note maturing May 2021 traded at 99 1/2. The
rate climbed to 3.22 percent on July 1, the most since May 19.  The difference between two- and 10-year yields widened to
2.73 percentage points on July 1, the most in two months.  Employers probably added 100,000 workers last month,
following a 54,000 increase in May, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of the
Labor Department report July 8.  Separate figures from ADP Employer Services on July 7 will
show companies added 80,000 positions, after a 38,000 gain in
May, the surveys show. The job increases probably aren’t enough
to reduce the  unemployment rate , based on the responses.  Japan ’s 10-year notes yielded 1.17 percent, the most in
eight weeks.  The extra yield that U.S. 10-year notes offer same-
maturity bonds in Japan widened to 2.02 percentage points from
this year’s low of 1.76 percentage points set last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
