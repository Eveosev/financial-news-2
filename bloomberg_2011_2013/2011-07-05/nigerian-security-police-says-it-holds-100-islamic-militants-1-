Nigeria ’s State Security Service said
it has arrested more than 100 members of a militant Islamic sect
blamed for a spate of bombings and gun attacks in the north and
the capital, Abuja.  “Successful security operations have led to the arrest of
some identified key cell commanders and members of the dissident
group” in six northern states, Marilyn Ogar, spokeswoman for
the service, said today in an e-mailed statement. The agency
deactivated 11 explosive devices in Kaduna state between May and
June, she said.  Nigerian authorities blame the sect, known as Boko Haram,
which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for
bombings and killings targeting government officials and
security forces in  Africa ’s top oil producer. Suspected
militants killed 10 people in bomb and gun attacks in the
northeastern city of Maiduguri on July 3, said Major-General
Jack Nwaogbo, head of a military  task force  in the region.  The group claimed responsibility for a blast on June 16 at
Nigeria’s police headquarters in Abuja that killed at least five
people and injured 11.  Boko Haram has set conditions for peace talks with
President Goodluck Jonathan that include the introduction of
Sharia law in the country’s northern states, Usman al-Zawahiri,
a spokesman for the group, said on June 13.  More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes between 1999 and 2009 in Nigeria, Africa’s top oil
producer and most populous nation, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
