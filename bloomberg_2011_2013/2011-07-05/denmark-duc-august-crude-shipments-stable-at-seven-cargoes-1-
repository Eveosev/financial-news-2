Crude oil shipments from Dansk
Undergrunds Consortium, the producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller
Maersk A/S, are scheduled to be unchanged at seven cargoes in
August, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  A total of 4.2 million barrels, or 135,484 barrels a day,
of crude will be exported in August, according to the plan.  Copenhagen-based Maersk holds 39 percent of the venture,
known as DUC.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 46 percent and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  has 15 percent. Maersk will receive four cargoes, while
Shell will get two and Chevron one, according to the schedule.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
