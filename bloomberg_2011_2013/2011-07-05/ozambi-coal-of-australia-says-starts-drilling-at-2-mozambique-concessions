Mozambi Coal Ltd., an Australian
mining company, started drilling at two concessions in northern
 Mozambique  in May, the company’s executive director, Shiv Madan,
said.  The concessions will probably yield coking and thermal
coal, Madan said in an interview today in Maputo, Mozambique’s
capital. He wouldn’t disclose how much the company had invested
in the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
