Morgan Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney, the
world’s largest brokerage, said compact discs containing tax
information of 34,000 clients were lost in transit to the New
York State Department of Taxation and Finance.  Clients were notified of the loss in a letter mailed last
month, said  Jim Wiggins , a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley. The two password-protected CDs, which weren’t
encrypted, contained some clients’ account numbers and Social
Security numbers, as well as interest earned on tax-exempt bonds
and funds, Wiggins said.  “We’ve seen no evidence of criminal intent or actual
misuse of this information,” he said. “We were informed that
the package appeared to be intact when it was received at the
department, but when it was delivered internally to the intended
recipient, the CDs were not there.”  The discs weren’t located in a joint search with the
Taxation department and the U.S. Postal Service, Wiggins said.
For clients whose Social Security numbers were included on the
discs, MSSB offered to pay for a year of credit monitoring
provided by a third party, Wiggins said.  “We are exploring with  New York  State how to improve the
security of this kind of data transmission,” he said.  Morgan Stanley bought a controlling stake in a joint
venture with Citigroup Inc.’s Smith Barney unit in 2009. The
purchase gave it a  retail brokerage  that had 17,800 financial
advisers and $1.72 trillion in client assets as of March 31.  The website Credit.com reported the data loss earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
