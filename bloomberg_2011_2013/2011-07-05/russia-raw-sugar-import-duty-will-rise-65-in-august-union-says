Russia ’s raw-sugar import duty is
expected to be $140 a metric ton in August, a 65 percent rise
from July, Andrei Bodin, president of the country’s  Sugar
Producers Union  said today.  This month’s duty is $85 a ton, according to  data  of the
Commission of the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and
 Kazakhstan .  Under a joint customs agreement between the three states,
they tax raw-sugar imports based on monthly prices in  New York 
trading, with a one-month lag before changes take effect. Bodin
said the average raw-sugar price in New York was 26.07 cents a
pound in June, which brought the import duty to $140 in August,
according to the commission’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
