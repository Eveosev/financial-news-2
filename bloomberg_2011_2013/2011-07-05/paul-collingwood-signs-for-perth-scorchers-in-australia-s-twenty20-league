The Perth Scorchers signed former
 England  limited-overs cricket captain  Paul Collingwood  to play
in the inaugural season of  Australia ’s revamped Twenty20 league.  All-rounder Collingwood, who was dropped from England’s
Twenty20 and one-day squads last month, joins ex-South  Africa 
opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs as the Scorchers’ two overseas
imports, the Western Australian Cricket Association said today.  “Paul is a gutsy and determined batsman who can lift the
scoring rate with his attacking strokeplay, he is a proven
wicket-taker with the ball and is first class in the field,”
Scorchers head coach Mickey Arthur said in a statement.  The eight teams have until Dec. 9 to submit their 18-man
squads for the 2011-12 T20 Big Bash League, which has expanded
to include two teams each in Sydney and  Melbourne .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
