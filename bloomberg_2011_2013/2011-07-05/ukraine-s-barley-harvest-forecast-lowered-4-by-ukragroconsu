Ukraine’s barley production will be 4
percent lower than previously estimated because of drought last
month and too much now this month, UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine, once the world’s biggest barley exporter, will
probably harvest 8.2 million metric tons of barley, the Kiev-
based researcher said today in an e-mailed statement.  Ukraine harvested 1.8 million tons of early grains from
650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) as of yesterday,
UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
