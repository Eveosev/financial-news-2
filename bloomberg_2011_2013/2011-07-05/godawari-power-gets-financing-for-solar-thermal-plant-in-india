Godawari Power & Ispat Ltd., one of
the seven companies that won licenses to build  India â€™s first
solar-thermal plants, has arranged funding for its project from
the  Bank of Baroda. (BOB)   The Raipur, Chhattisgarh-based developer won  project
financing  for its planned 50-megawatt solar plant in Rajasthan
state, Managing Director B.L. Agrawal said today by telephone.
He declined to give details.  Godawari Power said in December that it planned to invest 7
billion rupees ($157 million) in the project. The shares
advanced 2.1 percent to 164.95 rupees as of 2:53 p.m. after
rising as much as 3.3 percent in Mumbai trading.  The Indian government has set a July 9 deadline for
companies that won solar licenses in an auction last December to
complete funding for their projects or risk losing their permits
and as much as $41 million in bank guarantees.  Godawari Power is the first of the seven solar-thermal
projects, which account for 75 percent of the 620 megawatts of
capacity awarded, to confirm that it has secured funding. The
company has experience building conventional power
infrastructure for its main steel-making business.  The December auction issued licenses for 150 megawatts of
solar photovoltaic capacity to 30 companies. About half of those
companies have arranged financing, industry group Forum for the
Advancement of Solar Thermal said in a June 30 e-mail.  Solar thermal plants use sunlight to heat liquids that
produce steam for generators; photovoltaic plants use panels to
turn sunlight directly into power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
