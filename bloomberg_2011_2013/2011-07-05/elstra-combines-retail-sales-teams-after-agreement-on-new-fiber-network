Telstra Corp.,  Australia ’s biggest
phone company, will combine its sales and retail teams into a
single unit after agreeing last month to hand over fixed-line
assets to the government’s national broadband network.  Gordon Ballantyne will head the customer division, which
will be responsible for sales to consumers, business and
government, Melbourne-based Telstra said in a statement today.
Deena Shiff will lead a new applications and ventures unit
targeting services such as education and health.  Telstra agreed last month to give up control of its copper-
wire assets to the government’s fiber network in exchange for
A$11 billion ($11.8 billion) of compensation, ending its role as
a wholesaler to other phone and Internet service providers.
Chief Executive Officer  David Thodey  is also creating specialist
teams for cloud-computing and media services and centralizing
services such as human resources and finance to cut costs.  Stuart Lee will head the wholesale business as customers
are transitioned to the national broadband network.  Under the agreement with the government, signed June 23,
Telstra will progressively transfer fixed-line customers using
its copper-wire and cable assets onto the government network
that is scheduled to be completed in 2018.  Instead of getting all the revenue from those customers, it
will pay a wholesale fee to the government fiber network for
access before adding its own retail price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
