Brazil and  Argentina  will eliminate
import tariffs on Peruvian products in 2012, Peru’s Trade
Minister Eduardo Ferreyros said today.  The South American country is seeking trade accords with
Central American countries and is negotiating an investment
protection accord with  India , Ferreyros said at an event in
Lima.  Free-trade agreements signed with South Korea and Japan
will come into effect in August, Ferreyros said. Peru, which has
also signed agreements with the U.S., Canada and the European
Union, may seek a similar accord with India, he said.  “Free-trade agreements, which now cover a market of 4.5 billion
potential consumers, have helped double Peru’s exports over the
past five years,” Ferreyros said. “India is one of the world’s
most important markets, which Peru could supply manufactured,
agricultural and fishing products.”  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7505 per dollar at 3:38
p.m. New York time from 2.7480 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
