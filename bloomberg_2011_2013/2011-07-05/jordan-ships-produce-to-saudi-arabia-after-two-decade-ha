Jordan will resume today the export
of fruit and vegetables to  Saudi Arabia , which lifted a 21-year
ban on agricultural products from its neighbor.  Jordan met all conditions set by Saudi Arabia on the import
of agricultural produce, Mohammad Fawaeer, head of the crop and
production unit at the  Agriculture Ministry , said in a telephone
interview in Amman today.  Shipments were halted after Saudi allegations that Jordan
used wastewater for irrigation, he said. “All fruit and
vegetables to be exported to Saudi Arabia will be from crops
planted in Mafraq governorate, where crops are only irrigated by
underground water wells,” he said.  Jordan exported about 750,000 tons of vegetables and fruit
last year to the Gulf states and to Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt
and  Europe , according to ministry data. The kingdom exported
213,228 tons of fruits and vegetables to Saudi Arabia in 1990,
the last year produce was allowed to enter the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
