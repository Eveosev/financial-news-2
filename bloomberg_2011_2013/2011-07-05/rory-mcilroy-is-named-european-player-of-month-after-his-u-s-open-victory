Rory McIlroy was named the European
Tour’s Golfer of the Month for June after his record victory at
the  U.S. Open .  McIlroy, a 22-year-old from Northern Ireland, won by eight
strokes at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, for
his first major title. His score of 16-under-par was the lowest
in the tournament’s 111-year history, one of 12 U.S. Open
records he set.  “I hope this will not be the first Golfer of the Month
Award I receive after winning a major championship,” McIlroy
said in a statement from the European Tour.  McIlroy, fourth in the Official Golf Ranking, is the
favorite with U.K. bookmakers to win the British Open, July 14-
17 at Royal St. George’s in Sandwich, England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
