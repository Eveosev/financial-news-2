India ’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in seven days on speculation yields at the highest
level in more than a month will lure buyers.  Benchmark 10-year yields jumped 35 basis points since the
beginning of the fiscal year on April 1 as the government set a
4.17 trillion rupees ($94 billion) borrowing target in its
budget. The central bank has raised its repurchase rate by 75
basis points since April to damp inflation, which was at 9.06
percent from a year earlier in June.  “These are probably good levels for long-term investors to
buy as the prices have dropped quite a bit due to the fiscal
borrowing and inflation concern,” said K. Ramanathan, chief
investment officer at ING Investment Management Pvt in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent bond due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 8.34 percent at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai. The rate was at 8.36 percent yesterday,
the highest level since May 31.  Five state governments sold a combined 52.5 billion rupees
of debt today, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  India is maintaining its fiscal deficit target for the
financial year that began April 1, Finance Minister Pranab
Mukherjee said in  New Delhi  today. A reduction in fuel levy may
not hurt the government’s deficit target, he said.  Mukherjee is targeting a deficit of 4.6 percent for this
fiscal year. The budget shortfall was 4.7 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose two basis points to 8.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
