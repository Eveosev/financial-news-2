French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said that euro-area governments will take “all necessary
measures” to prevent  Greece  from defaulting.  “We will take all necessary measures to ensure there is no
default,” Baroin told a conference today in Paris. The July 2
decision by euro finance ministers to pay further aid was
“coherent with the original plan to support Greece,” he said.  The remarks, made in Baroin’s first public address since he
became finance minister last week, underline  France ’s policy of
offering support to the euro area’s most indebted nations since
the region’s debt crisis began in 2009.  On discussions led by banks on rolling over a portion of
their Greek holdings, Baroin urged private-sector participation
be “as broad as possible.”  Baroin also told bankers and executives gathered at the
Paris Europlace conference that France is on track to reducing
its  budget deficit  to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product this
year, with the economy set to grow about 2 percent. The deficit
will drop to 4.6 percent of output next year and 3 percent in
2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
