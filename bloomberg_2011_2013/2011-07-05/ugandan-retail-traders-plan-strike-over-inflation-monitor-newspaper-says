Traders in the Ugandan capital,
Kampala, plan to begin a two-day strike tomorrow over rising
inflation and the shilling’s depreciation against the dollar,

draw attention to traders’ demands that the government address
rising costs, the Kampala-based newspaper said, citing Everest
Kayondo, chairman of the Kampala City Traders’ Association.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
