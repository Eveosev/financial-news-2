A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose for the first time in six trading days on concern that the
global economic recovery is flagging.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.1 basis points to a mid-
price of 91.6 basis points as of 4:46 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The credit swaps index increased from the lowest level
since May as orders placed with U.S. factories rose at a weaker
pace than economists forecast and European services and
manufacturing growth were revised lower. The benchmark fell
every day last week as investor optimism grew that  Greece  could
avoid default.  Worries about the Greek debt crisis have been “pushed
forward” and there are no “near-term” concerns coming out of
 Europe , said  Mikhail Foux , a Citigroup Inc. credit strategist in
New York. “Investors right now, they’re looking at the next
potential pressure point and the next impetus for the market to
move, and that will be earnings,” he said.  Credit swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and decline as it improves. They pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
