Uranium spot prices fell 2.8 percent
amid weak demand as traders of the nuclear fuel entered the
holiday season,  Ux Consulting Co.  said.  Uranium-oxide concentrate for immediate delivery was at
$52.75 a pound in the four days through June 30, Ux said in an
e-mailed report today. That’s based on the most competitive
offer tracked by the Roswell, Georgia-based company. Prices from
this week were unavailable due to the U.S. holiday season, it
said.  The spot price for the nuclear fuel, which has declined 21
percent since the week before a March 11 earthquake and tsunami
damaged Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
station, fell $4.75 in June.  “Demand has been fairly weak, although the aggressive
pricing did spark some activity last week and several
transactions were booked,” Ux said. “A few buyers that were
not able to catch enough material as transactions fell below the
$52 level are now bidding at $52 with hopes of securing
additional material at these lower  price levels .”  Nuclear-power utilities buy the bulk of their uranium for
processing into fuel from mining companies, with the contracts
mostly extending beyond 12 months. The market for immediate
delivery, or  spot market , allows trading for delivery within a
year and includes financial investors. The U.S. government also
periodically conducts auctions to reduce stocks.  “As we are in the midst of a holiday week and into the
vacation season, activity may be limited this week as well,
although low and now rising prices may spur some buying
interest,” Ux said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
