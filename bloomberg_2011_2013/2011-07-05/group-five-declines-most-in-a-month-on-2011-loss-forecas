Group Five Ltd., a South African
construction company, dropped the most in a month after
forecasting a loss from a profit a year earlier, citing a
slowdown in the industry.  The stock declined as much as 3.2 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since June 2, and traded 1.3 percent lower at
30.07 rand at 2:16 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Group Five expects to report a loss from 2.52 rand to 2.80
rand per share in the year ended June, compared with a profit of
2.80 rand a year earlier, the company said in a regulatory
trading update.  “The slowdown within the construction sector in the last
two years following the global market crisis has worsened
trading conditions in the construction and materials markets in
which Group Five operates,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
