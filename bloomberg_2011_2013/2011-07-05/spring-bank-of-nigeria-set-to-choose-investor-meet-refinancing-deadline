Spring Bank Plc (SPRINGBK) , a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the country’s central bank, is set to choose an
investor to buy it and help meet a September deadline to inject
new capital, the bank said.  The company is optimistic a “good deal” will be agreed
to, the Lagos-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  Spring Bank held meetings with “over four prospective
investors for its consideration and is satisfied with the
meetings,” it said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  bailed out eight of the
nation’s 24 lenders in 2009 with 620 billion naira ($4.1
billion). The rescued banks have until the end of September to
recapitalize or risk liquidation, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
