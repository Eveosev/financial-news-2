Temasek Holdings Pte, the Singapore
state-owned investment company, is seeking to raise about HK$28
billion ($3.6 billion) by selling stakes in  China Construction
Bank Corp. (939)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , two of the country’s three
biggest banks.  The Singapore-based investment company is selling about
HK$18.7 billion of shares in Bank of  China  and about HK$9.3
billion in an offering of China Construction Bank stock,
according to term sheets obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday.  Shares of China’s four biggest banks fell in Hong Kong
trading yesterday after Moody’s Investors Service said banks’
loans to local governments may exceed official estimates by more
than 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion) more than official
estimates and the credit outlook for the industry could decline.  The extra liabilities, coming on top of the national audit
office’s findings last week of 10.7 trillion yuan in local
government debt, may fuel concern that banks will be unable to
absorb losses on defaults should property prices drop.  Bank of China shares slid 0.3 percent to HK$3.86 in Hong
Kong yesterday while China Construction Bank dropped 1.2 percent
to HK$6.48.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the
world’s most profitable bank, fell 0.5 percent to HK$5.93.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is managing both sales, the terms show.
 Jeffrey Fang , a spokesman for Temasek, declined to comment.  2006 Investment  Temasek’s Fullerton Financial Holdings Pte. Ltd. unit is
offering about 5.2 billion shares in Bank of China for HK$3.60
to HK$3.67 each, according to a term sheet. That’s as much as
6.7 percent less than yesterday’s closing price.  Temasek owned about 10.5 billion shares, or 12.5 percent,
of Hong Kong-listed Bank of China, according to a Dec. 31
filing. The fund paid about $1.5 billion for a five percent
stake in the lender in 2006.  Cairnhill Investments (Mauritius) Pte. Ltd. and Crescent
Investments (Mauritius) Pte. Ltd., both controlled by Temasek,
are also selling about 1.5 billion shares in China Construction
Bank for HK$6.22 to HK$6.35 each. The Singapore fund holds seven
percent, or 16.9 billion shares, of China Construction Bank,
according to company filings.  Temasek, set up in 1974, bought $1 billion of stock in
China Construction Bank’s initial public offering in 2005. It
also purchased an undisclosed stake in the Chinese lender from
China SAFE Investment Ltd. the same year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
