The Swiss franc rose against all
major currencies as doubt over a plan to save  Greece  from a debt
default and concern over inflation in China boosted demand for
safe-haven assets.  The franc strengthened against the euro for the first day
in seven. The Beijing-based Economic Information Daily said
China is likely to raise  interest rates  this weekend. European
policy makers have been at odds over creditors’ role in a new
Greek rescue plan after last year’s 110 billion-euro ($159
billion) bailout failed to contain the region’s debt crisis.
 Standard & Poor’s  said yesterday a bond-rollover plan drafted by
French banks would prompt a “selective default” grade.  “There’s renewed concern about Greece’s rescue plan and
whether the country can actually avoid debt default in one form
or another,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG
in  London . “Against this environment, people are going to bid
for safer assets like the franc.”  The Swiss currency, perceived as a haven during times of
turmoil, appreciated 0.9 percent against the euro to 1.2224 as
of 10:35 a.m. in London. It rose 0.4 percent to 84.46 centimes
against the dollar. One franc fetched 96.11 yen, compared with
95.27 yen yesterday.  The franc strengthened 5.4 percent this year, making it the
best performer among 10 currencies of developed nations,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
