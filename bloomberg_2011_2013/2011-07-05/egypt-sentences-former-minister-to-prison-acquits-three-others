An Egyptian court sentenced in
absentia former Trade and Industry Minister Rachid Mohamed
Rachid to five years in prison, the state-run Middle East  News
Agency  said, without giving further details.  Three other former ministers and two businessmen were
acquitted on corruption-related charges, MENA reported. Anas el-
Fikki and Youssef Boutros-Ghali, the former ministers of
information and finance respectively, had been charged with
squandering public funds on parliamentary and presidential
election campaigns, the news agency said.  Former Housing Minister Ahmed el-Maghraby, Waheed Metwally,
a businessman, and Yasseen Mansour, the chairman of Palm Hills
Developments SAE, were also acquitted on charges that include
profiteering, MENA said. The two businessmen were tried in
absentia. El-Maghraby has already been given a five-year jail
sentence in a separate case.  Corruption allegations against officials and businessmen
close to the regime of former President  Hosni Mubarak  helped
fuel the 18 days of mass protests that led to Mubarak’s Feb. 11
ouster. Boutros-Ghali, who has already been sentenced in
absentia to 30 years on prison on separate charges, is one of
several Mubarak-era ministers who have faced multiple trials
since the change in government.  Egypt ’s public prosecutor contested the acquittal of the
three former ministers, Al Arabiya television reported today,
without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
