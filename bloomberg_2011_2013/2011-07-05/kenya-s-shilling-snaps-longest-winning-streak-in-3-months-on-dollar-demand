Kenya ’s shilling declined, snapping
the longest winning streak in three months against the dollar as
companies increase demand for the U.S. currency after the
shilling rose to the best level in almost three weeks yesterday.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened for
the first day in seven, losing 0.2 percent to 88.50 per dollar
by 2:49 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, from yesterday’s close of
88.35.  “Businesses have increase their demand for the dollar with
the intention of accumulating due to what they see as good
exchange-rate levels for the shilling, a situation that is
likely to persist as demand for the greenback remains high,”
Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp.,
said in a phone interview today.  The shilling has strengthened 2 percent since the Central
Bank of Kenya raised its overnight lending rate to banks on June
29 in an attempt to rein in inflationary expectations and curb
speculative trade in the shilling, which reached the weakest in
17 years on June 22.  It also blocked the use of funds borrowed from the
overnight window to trade in the foreign-exchange market. The
overnight rate, which is reviewed daily, remained at 8 percent
today, according to the Nairobi-based bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
