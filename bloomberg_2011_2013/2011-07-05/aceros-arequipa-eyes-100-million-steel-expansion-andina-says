Corp. Aceros Arequipa SA, Peruâ€™s
largest steel producer, will invest $100 million to boost output
at its steelworks by 69 percent next year to meet increasing
demand, state news agency  Andina  reported.  Lima-based Aceros will expand its Pisco plant to increase
steel production to 1.35 million metric tons from 800,000 tons
by September 2012, Andina said today, citing Chief Executive
