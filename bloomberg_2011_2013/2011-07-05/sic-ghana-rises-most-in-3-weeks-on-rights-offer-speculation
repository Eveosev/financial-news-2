SIC Insurance Co., the biggest
insurer in  Ghana , rose the most in three weeks as investors
speculated that the company may raise money through a rights
offer.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 2 percent, to 52 pesewas by
the 3 p.m. close in Accra, the capital. That’s the biggest jump
since June 13.  “There’s speculation the company will seek the mandate of
shareholders at its annual general meeting to raise additional
capital through a rights offer for expansion,” Randy Mensah, a
stock trader at Databank Financial Services Ltd., said by phone
today. The company hasn’t set a date for the meeting, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
