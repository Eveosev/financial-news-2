South Africa  will probably produce
91,508 bales of cotton lint this year, 3.3 percent less than
estimated last month,  Cotton South Africa  said.  The countryâ€™s crop will still more than double from the
previous season, the first increase in seven years, the industry
group said in an e-mailed statement yesterday, without giving a
reason for the change in forecast. The estimate includes 4,000
bales expected from the southern African kingdom of Swaziland.  Cotton South Africa, based in  Pretoria , represents growers,
processors and textile makers. A bale weighs 200 kilograms (441
pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
