Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
fell, increasing the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on Spanish 10-year debt rose three basis points
to 5.43 percent as of 8:12 a.m. in  London , pushing the
difference in yield, or spread, with bunds five basis points
wider to 243 basis points.  The yield on equivalent-maturity Italian bonds also rose
three basis points, to 4.95 percent, widening the spread to
bunds to 195 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
