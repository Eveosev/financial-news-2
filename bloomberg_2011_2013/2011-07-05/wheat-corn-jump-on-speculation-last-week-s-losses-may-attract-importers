Wheat and corn rose in  Chicago  on
speculation this year’s lowest prices may have fueled demand
from importers. Rice climbed to the highest level in almost six
weeks.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest corn grower and
shipper, sold 1.14 million metric tons of the grain for unknown
destinations, the Department of Agriculture said July 1.  China 
may have been the buyer, researcher Grain.gov.cn said yesterday.
Grains fell last week after the USDA raised estimates for
national plantings and stockpiles.  “Plummeting grain prices last week have resulted in an
increase in actual physical transactions,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in a report today.
“China is well-known as a price-conscious customer, and there
are a number of signs that it was behind the major order placed
last week.”  Wheat for September delivery gained 22.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $6.3475 a bushel by 12:04 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain touched $5.92, the lowest
price for a most-active contract since July 2010, on July 1 and
plunged 25 percent in five weeks before this week.  The soft-wheat harvest in  France , the biggest European
Union producer, may fall 9 percent to 32.5 million tons this
year, farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole  said today. The
U.K. crop will drop 4.2 percent to 13.8 million tons, it said.  Milling Wheat  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 4 euros, or 2.1 percent, to 197 euros ($285) a
ton.  Corn for December delivery rose 11.75 cents, or 2 percent,
to $6.085 a bushel in Chicago. Prices reached $5.755, the lowest
level since December, on July 1 and slid 21 percent in six weeks
before this week.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 12 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $13.245 a bushel.  “On the whole, there is a fair amount of demand,” said
 William Adams , a  fund manager  at Resilience AG in Zurich.  Rice for September delivery gained 29 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $15.20 per 100 pounds, advancing for a third day.
The grain reached $15.30, the highest level since May 25, and
jumped 55 percent in the past year, more than wheat or soybeans.  Indonesia, the world’s third-largest rice grower, may have
to import the grain for a second year to replenish stockpiles as
government estimates show production growth will miss this
year’s target, ministers said.  Southeast Asia’s biggest economy wants stockpiles at state
food company Bulog to reach 2 million tons, up from 1.6 million
tons at present, to manage local prices and for use in case of
an emergency, Coordinating Minister for the Economy Hatta Rajasa
said.  Indonesia  was a net-importer of rice in 2010 after being
self-sufficient the prior two years.  The government has been trying to cool food inflation that
helped drive consumer prices 5.4 percent higher last month from
a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
