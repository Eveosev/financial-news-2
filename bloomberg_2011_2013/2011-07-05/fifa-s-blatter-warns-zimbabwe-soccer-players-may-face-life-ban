FIFA President Sepp Blatter warned
Zimbabwean soccer players that they may face a life ban from the
sport if found guilty of fixing matches in Thailand and Malaysia
last year.  “They will not be allowed back into football,” Blatter
told reporters in the capital, Harare, yesterday.  FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, Interpol and the
relevant governments are investigating the allegations of match
fixing, Blatter said. The FIFA president met Zimbabwe’s
President  Robert Mugabe  and Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai 
yesterday. His visit followed a FIFA delegation that arrived in
Harare last week.  Blatter pledged $1.5 million for the development of soccer
in Zimbabwe, part of it for FIFA’s global “Goal Project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
