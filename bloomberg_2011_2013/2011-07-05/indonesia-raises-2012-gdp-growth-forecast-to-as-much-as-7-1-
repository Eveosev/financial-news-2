Indonesia ’s government raised its
forecast for the economy’s expansion next year on rising exports
and investments.  Gross domestic product may increase as much as 7 percent
next year, Melchias Mekeng, head of the parliament’s budget
committee, said today after deliberations were completed. That
compares with a projection of as much as 6.9 percent in May.
Consumer prices may rise 4 percent to 5.3 percent in 2012,
compared with an earlier range of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent, he
said.  Indonesia is one step away from its first investment-grade
 credit rating  in more than a decade as President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono targets growth of as much as 6.6 percent on average
through the remainder of his term ending in 2014. He plans to
double spending on roads, ports and airports to $140 billion by
then after inadequate infrastructure hampered growth.  “Indonesia’s rating may reach investment grade by 2012 and
several infrastructure projects are expected to start next
year,” Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said in Jakarta today
after meeting lawmakers.  The 2012  budget deficit  may reach as much as 1.9 percent of
GDP, Mekeng said. The budget shortfall may be 2.1 percent of GDP
in 2011, Vice Finance Minister Anny Ratnawati said June 28.  The rupiah has gained more than 5 percent in 2011, the
second-best performing currency in Asia excluding  Japan , as the
region’s growth lures funds seeking higher returns. The rupiah
may average 8,600 to 9,100 per dollar next year, Mekeng said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
