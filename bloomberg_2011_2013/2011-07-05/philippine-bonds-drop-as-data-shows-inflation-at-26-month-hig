Philippine five-year bonds fell,
snapping a five-day rally, as the government reported the
fastest inflation in 26 months.  Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, the  National Statistics Office  said in Manila today,
citing data using 2006 as the base year. First Metro Investment
Corp. President Roberto Juanchito Dispo told reporters today
that the government has set minimum coupon rates of 6.375
percent for new bonds due 2022 and 8 percent for securities due
2031 that will be issued in a debt exchange.  Inflation “is still relatively within expectations of the
central bank and the market,” said Rafael Algarra, treasurer at
Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “There’s a bond swap coming in
so that’s where the focus will eventually shift after the market
absorbs the data on inflation.”  The yield on the 9.125 percent government bonds due
September 2016 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.92 percent as of 4:26 p.m. in  Manila , according to
Tradition Financial Services. The peso closed at 43.058 per
dollar, compared with 43.063 yesterday, according to prices from
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched 43.030 earlier, the
strongest level since May 12.  Inflation was 4.6 percent in June using 2000 as a base year,
the fastest since April 2009, according to official data. That
compared with the 4.7 percent median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer-price rises “appear manageable” in the first six
months of the year and the central bank vows to remain vigilant
against price pressures and will “ward off” inflation threats,
Governor Amando Tetangco said in a speech today in Manila.  The government will offer at least 100 billion pesos ($2.3
billion) of new debt in exchange for shorter-dated, qualified
bonds in the swap that starts today, Dispo said. First Metro,
one of six banks arranging the exchange, has already received
initial demand of about 60 billion pesos and there are about 1.7
trillion pesos of bonds qualified to participate in the swap, he
said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
