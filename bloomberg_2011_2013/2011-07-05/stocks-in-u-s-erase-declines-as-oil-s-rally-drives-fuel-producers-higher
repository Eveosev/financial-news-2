U.S. stocks erased declines, led
higher by energy producers, as oil’s rally to a three-week high
was enough to overcome  Portugal  losing its investment-grade
 credit rating  at Moody’s Investors Service.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,340.40 at 3:25 p.m. in  New York . It slumped as much as 0.4
percent earlier. Energy stocks in the measure rallied 0.7
percent as crude climbed 2.1 percent to $96.89 a barrel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
