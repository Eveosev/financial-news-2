The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approved applications from TrueEX Group LLC and
 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  to operate swap execution
facilities.  The two trading systems join other companies that have
already won temporary approval to run SEFs, including Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP, MarketAxess Holdings Inc., GFI Group
Inc. and TeraExchange LLC, according to the regulator’s  website ,
which lists a total of 18 applications. CME Group Inc., the
world’s largest futures exchange and an ICE rival, said this
week it applied to form one.  The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 has provisions designed to shift
swaps, which helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis, from largely
unregulated transactions negotiated off exchanges to more
transparent trading on systems including SEFs, which the CFTC
and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversee. The
companies are seeking to tap into that market after the CFTC
completed rules governing the trades in May, opening up
competition in the $633 trillion over-the-counter  derivatives
market .  The requirement that swaps trade on SEFs becomes effective
on Oct. 2. Before trading can start on a SEF, the operator must
submit a request to the CFTC for the specific swaps it wants to
offer, known as a made-available-to-trade application. That
process may take up to 90 days to receive CFTC approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
