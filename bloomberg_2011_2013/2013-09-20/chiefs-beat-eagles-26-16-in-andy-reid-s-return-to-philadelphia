Andy Reid  marked his return to
Philadelphia for the first time since he was fired after 14
years with the Eagles by guiding the  Kansas City Chiefs  to a
26-16 win.  The result lifted the Chiefs to 3-0, already surpassing
their 2-14 record last year, which tied for the worst mark in
the  National Football League . The Chiefs last began 3-0 in 2010.  The Eagles, who won six National Football Conference East
division titles and reached the playoffs nine times under Reid,
dropped to 1-2 with their second loss in five days at Lincoln
Financial Field. Reid also steered the Eagles to five conference
championship games and the  Super Bowl  after the 2004 season.  “This is sweet,” Reid told the NFL Network in a televised
interview. “We are 3-0. It makes the plane ride easier, but
we’re still early in the year and we’ve got so much room to
improve I can’t tell you.”  Philadelphia has played with a no-huddle offense under
Reid’s successor, Chip Kelly, who led the  University of Oregon 
to four straight Bowl Championship Series games with the same
fast-paced style before accepting his first role in the NFL.  Eric Berry and  Jamaal Charles  scored touchdowns for the
Chiefs, while Ryan Succop added four field goals. Jason Avant
and  LeSean McCoy  scored for the Eagles, who retired former
quarterback Donovan McNabb’s No. 5 uniform during halftime.  Kansas City took the lead on a 33-yard field goal by Succop
and led 10-0 after Berry returned an interception 38 yards for a
touchdown. Avant hauled in a 22-yard scoring pass from
quarterback  Michael Vick  later in the first period.  Second Interception  Succop kicked a 31-yard field goal after missing from 51
yards at the start of the second quarter. Kansas City got the
ball back when Vick threw his second interception on
Philadelphia’s next drive and Succop added another field goal,
from 34 yards, to make it 16-6 at halftime.  Vick was sacked four times in the first half and the Eagles
gave up 13 points on four turnovers, although their defense
limited Kansas City to field goals on all three visits inside
the home team’s 20-yard line.  After Philadelphia’s Alex Henery kicked a 29-yard field
goal for the only score of the third quarter, Charles ran 18
yards to earn a first down at the Eagles’ 3-yard line and got
 Kansas City ’s second touchdown on the next play.  The Eagles responded on their next drive as McCoy, who
finished with 158 yards on 20 carries, sprinted 41 yards for a
touchdown to make to 23-16. The Chiefs then ran off 8:12 from
the clock and Succop added a 38-yard field goal to leave
Philadelphia trailing by 10 points with 3:21 to play.  After failing to make headway on their next drive, the
Eagles stopped Charles on a 4th-and-1 play on their 1-yard line
with 1:56 remaining. Philadelphia’s chances ended when Vick
fumbled after being sacked for a fifth time and Kansas City
recovered the ball before running out the clock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
