Barclays Plc (BARC)  boosted its estimate
for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to 1,800, the highest 2013
projection among Wall Street equity strategists, on signs the
 Federal Reserve  will wait to begin reducing economic stimulus.  The new forecast implies a 4.5 percent gain from
yesterday’s close of 1,722.34 and exceeds the average
strategist projection of 1,706, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Barry Knapp, the New York-based head of U.S. equity
strategy, had previously said the  S&P 500  would finish 2013 at
1,600.  The U.S. equity benchmark has jumped 2 percent this  week ,
poised for a third consecutive gain, after the Fed unexpectedly
refrained from reducing the pace of its monthly $85 million bond
buying program. The central bank will begin tapering the
purchases in December at the earliest, Knapp said.  “‘Lower for longer’ monetary policy is more probable than
we believed a week ago,” Knapp said in a research note today.  The Fed is now expected to begin trimming asset purchases
in December, with 24 of 41 economists surveyed Sept. 18-19
saying the central bank won’t take the first step in slowing its
economic stimulus until then.  A change in expectations for future leadership of the Fed
also contributed to the higher S&P 500 forecast, Knapp said. The
index rose 0.6 percent on Sept. 16 after  Larry Summers  removed
himself as a candidate for Fed chairman.  Citigroup Strategy  Barclays is at least the second bank to raise its S&P 500
estimate during the past week. On Sept. 13, Citigroup Inc.
increased its projection for 2013 and said the gauge will jump
to 1,900 by the end of 2014, citing rising  valuations  and
investors adding money into mutual funds.  Global equity funds attracted the largest inflows since at
least 2005 in the week ended Sept. 18. The funds lured a net
$25.9 billion in the period, Wei Liang Chang, a foreign-exchange
strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said
by phone from Singapore today, citing data from EPFR Global.
Developed markets posted $24.3 billion of inflows, while
emerging-nation funds drew $1.6 billion, according to Chang.  Knapp of Barclays said he’s less optimistic about next
year’s equity returns and that the struggle among U.S. lawmakers
to agree on a budget may hurt performance. The U.S. House voted
today to finance the federal government through mid-December and choke off funding for President  Barack Obama ’s
health-care law, setting up a showdown with the Senate and the
White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
