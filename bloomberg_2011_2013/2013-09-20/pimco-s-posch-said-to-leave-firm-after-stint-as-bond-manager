Brigitte Posch, an emerging-market
corporate bond manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., has
left the firm, according to a person familiar with the move who
asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to
comment publicly on the matter.  Posch had joined Pimco, which manages the world’s biggest
bond fund, in 2008 from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , where she was head of
Latin American debt securitization and trading.  Pimco’s press office declined to comment in an e-mailed
response to questions. A message sent to Posch, who was based in
Munich, at her corporate e-mail address was returned with an
automated note saying that she no longer works at Pimco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
