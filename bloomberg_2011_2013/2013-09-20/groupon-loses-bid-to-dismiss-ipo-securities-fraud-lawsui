Groupon Inc., the deal-of-the-day
coupon company, lost a bid for dismissal of a lawsuit
complaining the company misled investors about its financial
performance before its initial public offering in November 2011.  U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle in  Chicago  ordered
Groupon to face the class-action lawsuit first filed in April
2012.  Investors accused the Chicago-based company of  securities
fraud  and claimed it used impermissible refund accounting to
boost revenues in a prospectus in connection with its IPO and in
later U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, according
to a revised complaint filed last year.  “The court finds that these allegations present plausible
violations,” of federal  securities law , Norgle said in his
Sept. 18 ruling.  Groupon opened at $28 in Nasdaq stock exchange trading on
Nov. 4, 2011.  The company reported a “material weakness” in its
financial controls on March 30, 2012, and said its first
reported quarterly sales as a publicly traded company were lower
than previously stated because of higher refunds to merchants,
reducing  revenue  in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, by $14.3
million to $492.2 million.  By Nov. 13, 2012, the company’s shares were trading at
$2.63. Yesterday, Groupon rose 9 percent to $12.59.  Groupon doesn’t comment on pending litigation, Nicholas
Halliwell, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  The case is In re  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  Securities Litigation, 12-cv-2450, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  Illinois 
(Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
