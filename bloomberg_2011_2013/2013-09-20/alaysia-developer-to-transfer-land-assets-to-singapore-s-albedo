Malaysian developer Danny Tan will
transfer some property assets into Singapore-listed  Albedo Ltd. (ALBD) ,
and in return acquire a controlling stake in the company.  Albedo, a Singapore-based operator of an iron and steel
foundry, plans to acquire Reflections Oasis Inc. from Infinite
Rewards Inc., a company controlled by Tan, for S$774.1 million
($621 million), the company said in a statement to the Singapore
stock exchange today. Albedo will pay for the acquisition by
issuing 34.55 billion new shares to Infinite Rewards at about
2.24 Singapore cents a share. Post the acquisition, Tan’s
Infinite will own 95 percent of Albedo.  Albedo is seeking to expand its business into property
development as it expects the group’s existing trading
businesses to remain challenging amid increasing competition and
weaker demand for its steel-related raw materials erode its
profit margins, the company said in the statement.  In purchasing Reflections Oasis, Albedo will acquire seven
land plots in Iskandar in  Malaysia  valued at 2.7 billion ringgit
($853 million) and is in negotiations to purchase an additional
two plots, according to the statement.  Tan is the group executive vice chairman of Kuala Lumpur-listed  Tropicana (TRCB)  Corp., a Malaysian property developer,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
