(Corrects third paragraph of story published Sept. 20 to
say that Perez is helping open the art museum.)  Swire Properties Inc. (1972)  said it will
build an 80-story mixed-use tower as part of its $1.05 billion
CityCentre project near the heart of Miami’s financial district.  Designed by Miami-based  Arquitectonica International Corp. ,
the skyscraper will have stores, condominiums and a hotel, Swire
said in a statement today. The building, to be known as One
Brickell CityCentre, will be one of the tallest in  Florida ,
according to the Miami-based company, a unit of Swire Properties
Ltd. of  Hong Kong . The CityCentre project is scheduled for
completion in 2015.  Development of Miami’s historic downtown and financial
districts has rebounded since the global financial crisis, with
more than a dozen projects set to change the city’s skyline.
 Jorge Perez , chief executive officer of Related Group of
Florida, will help open the Perez Art Museum Miami on the
downtown waterfront in December, and a new science museum is
under construction nearby.  “In Miami we’ve seen in one decade changes that are
transformational,” Perez said in an interview yesterday. The
city “is becoming a great urban center.”  Across Miami, residential sales reached a seven-year high
in the second quarter and distressed properties comprised a
smaller share of the market. The average price for Miami luxury
condos, which make up the top 10 percent of sales, climbed 9.5
percent from the previous quarter to $1.7 million, according to
a July report by Douglas Elliman Real Estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
