BrainJuicer Group Plc (BJU)  jumped the
most in more than two years after the online market-research
company said it would return 1.5 million pounds ($2.4 million)
to shareholders in its first special  dividend  since 2008.  The shares jumped 7.8 percent, the biggest advance since
June 2011, to 270 pence in London trading, the highest since
Nov. 19. The volume of shares traded was almost four times the
three-month daily average.  The special dividend “reflects the company’s particularly
strong cash position, and its capital-light business model,”
the London-based company said in a statement today. In addition
to the special dividend of 12 pence a share, BrainJuicer is
paying an interim dividend of 0.9 pence a share.  Canaccord Genuity Corp. analyst Simon Davies today
reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock and maintained
his 12-month price target of 298 pence.  BrainJuicer’s clients include  Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT)  and
 Nestle SA (NESN) , according to the market researcher’s  website . Its
offerings include “FaceTrace” technology to measure responses
to advertising. The stock has advanced 21 percent this year
compared with an 11 percent gain for the FTSE AIM All-Share
Media Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
