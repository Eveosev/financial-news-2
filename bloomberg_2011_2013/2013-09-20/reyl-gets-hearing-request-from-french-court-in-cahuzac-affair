Reyl Group, a Swiss private bank,
said it received a request for a hearing by French judges
involved in investigations over former French budget minister
Jerome Cahuzac.  The bank has always “fully” cooperated with Swiss
authorities and will do the same with the French, Reyl said in a
statement today. It didn’t provide details on the hearing.  Reyl previously provided French judges with evidence about
a Swiss account held by Cahuzac from 1992 through an
administrative assistance request in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
