The price of Canadian barley used
as  animal feed  has plunged to a two-year low as farmers across
the Prairie Provinces start harvesting the biggest crop since in
2009.  Average  prices  at Calgary grain elevators tumbled 38
percent since the end of May to C$160.90 ($156.21) a metric ton,
the lowest since August 2011, according to data from the Alberta
Grain Commission. In  Edmonton , the drop was 35 percent to
$155.11 a ton.  Production in Canada, the world’s fifth-largest grower,
will  jump  12 percent to 8.8 million tons this year with yields
averaging 64.1 bushels an acre, a record,  Statistics Canada  said
on Aug. 21. Saskatchewan and Manitoba are getting as much as 110
bushels an acre from early harvests, while Alberta is seeing
120, FarmLink Marketing Solutions said in a  report .  “When you’ve got yields of 100 bushels, it’s pretty big,”
Joe Jackson, the head of risk management for Jameson, Gilroy and
B&L Livestock Ltd., said in a telephone interview from Moose
Jaw, Saskatchewan.  Russia , Germany, France and Spain are the largest barley
 growers , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
