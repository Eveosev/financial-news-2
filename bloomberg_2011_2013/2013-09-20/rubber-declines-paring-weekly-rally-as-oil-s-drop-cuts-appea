Rubber declined, paring a weekly
advance, as a drop in oil reduced the appeal of the commodity as
an alternative to synthetic products used in tires.  The contract for February delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.3 percent to 281.5 yen a kilogram
($2,829 a metric ton) and traded at 282.5 yen at 10:36 a.m.
local time. The drop pared gains to 3.9 percent for the most-active contract this week.  West Texas Intermediate headed for a second weekly loss as
 Libya ’s oil output increased and as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he will provide inspectors access to chemical-weapons
facilities. Iranian President Hassan Rohani said in an interview
with a U.S. television network that his country would never seek
nuclear weapons and he had full authority to resolve issues
surrounding the nation’s nuclear program.  “Geopolitical tensions in the  Middle East  are easing,
putting a drag on the energy market,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo. “Rubber tracked losses
in oil futures.”  Thai rubber  free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 83.20 baht
($2.67) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . Farmers unhappy with low rubber prices
continued blocking a road in the southern Thai province of
Nakhon Sri Thammarat in a protest against the government,
according to Viroj Jivarungsan, the province’s governor.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange is closed today for holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
