The Ibovespa fell for a second day
as Brazilian exporters including iron-ore producer Vale SA
tumbled with commodity prices.  Banco Bradesco SA led declines among banks as the MSCI
 Brazil /Financials Index fell the most among 10 industry groups.
Clothing seller  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  led gains for retailers after a
report showed that Brazil’s annual inflation slowed in mid-September to below 6 percent for first time in nine months.  The Ibovespa  dropped  0.9 percent to 54,621.69 at 11:04 a.m.
in Sao Paulo, paring a weekly gain to 1.6 percent. Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge rose 2.6 percent on Sept. 18 after the
 Federal Reserve  unexpectedly maintained a U.S. stimulus program
that has helped boost demand for emerging market assets. The
real weakened 0.1 percent to 2.2034 today, cutting a weekly
advance to 3.5 percent.  “We’re still in the hangover after Fed’s decision two days
ago,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, the head strategist at the
brokerage Futura Corretora, said in a phone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “Uncertainty about the U.S. stimulus program boosted
commodities prices and Brazilian raw materials producers for
some weeks, and now investors are adjusting prices and
expectations to a new scenario.”  Forty-nine of the benchmark index’s 73 member stocks
declined. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
fell 0.2 percent. Commodity producers account for 39 percent of
the Ibovespa’s weighting.  Vale fell 0.1 percent to 32.57 reais. Bradesco sank 1.9
percent to 30.78 reais.  Hering gained 0.5 percent to 35.08 reais. Consumer prices
advanced 5.93 percent in the year through mid-September compared
with 6.15 percent a month earlier, according to the national
bureau of statistics. The median estimate of 24 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
