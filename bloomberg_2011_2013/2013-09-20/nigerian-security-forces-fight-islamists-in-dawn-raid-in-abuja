Nigerian security forces battled
suspected Islamist militants in the capital, Abuja, at dawn as
they investigated a weapons cache believed to belong to the Boko
Haram group, state security police said.  Troops came under “heavy gunfire attack” after they began
searching for arms allegedly buried at a building site,
Department of State Services spokeswoman Marilyn Ogar said today
in an e-mailed statement. “Some persons were injured and 12
others have been arrested.”  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language, has carried out gun and bomb attacks in
 Nigeria ’s mainly Muslim north and the capital, killing thousands
of people since 2009 in its campaign to establish an Islamic
state in Nigeria. In 2011, the group detonated a suicide car
bomb at the United Nations headquarters in Abuja.  President  Goodluck Jonathan  imposed a state of emergency in
the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in May to
battle the insurgents.  At least 142 corpses were found in a northeastern Nigerian
town after an attack by suspected Boko Haram members, Saidu
Yakubu, a spokesman for the Borno State Environmental Protection
Agency, said yesterday in a statement handed to reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
