The Spanish soccer league’s
president wants more investors to buy stakes in the transfer
rights of players, clashing with plans by the sport’s European
ruling body, UEFA, to outlaw the practice.  Javier Tebas said he’d like more funds to enter the market
now dominated by Doyen Sports to make so-called third-party
ownership more competitive and improve the terms that investors
offer to cash-strapped teams such as Sevilla and  Atletico
Madrid . Doyen is part of a London-based hedge fund.  UEFA, based in Nyon,  Switzerland , said it’s concerned that
investors may interfere in the $3 billion transfer market, and
wants to ban the practice from its competitions, including the
 Champions League . Doyen provides financing that clubs can’t get
from Spanish banks, Tebas said.  “I’m very much in favor of this,” Tebas said in a seminar
at the league’s offices in  Madrid . “It allows us to organize
debt and make our clubs more competitive.”  Spanish soccer clubs have a combined tax debt of 690
million euros ($933 million), and the government has set a 2020
repayment deadline. Doyen Sports Chief Executive Nelio Lucas
said the fund has invested 80 million euros in sports the last
three years.  Tebas said the league plans to start regulating investments
next year, and could limit the amount of deals per team. He also
wants funds to identify investors to comply with a law to stop
 money laundering .  Doyen’s partners include Rixos Hotels Chief Executive
Fettah Tamince and Bayrock Group LLC founder Tevfik Arif. UEFA
officials weren’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
