Pakistan ’s efforts to negotiate
peace with the Taliban have stalled after militants killed an
army general in a roadside attack last week, the Dawn newspaper
 reported , citing Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.  The Pakistani Taliban, comprising more than a dozen
militant groups with different objectives, claimed
responsibility for an attack on a convoy carrying two senior
military officials, five days after Pakistani political parties
authorized Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government to initiate
talks with militants.  The attack has dealt a serious blow to peace efforts, Khan
said in parliament yesterday, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
