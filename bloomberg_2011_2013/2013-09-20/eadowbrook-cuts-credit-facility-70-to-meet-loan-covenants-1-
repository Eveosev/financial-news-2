Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc. (MIG) ,
the insurer that had its rating cut last month by A.M. Best,
agreed to reduce the funds available on a credit facility in a
deal to comply with loan covenants.  The commitment was lowered to $30 million from $100 million
and is to be reduced to $21 million on March 31, 2016, the
Southfield, Michigan-based insurer said today in a regulatory
filing. Meadowbrook will also pay higher interest rates under
the facility with banks led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The insurer has been coping with losses after determining
it hadn’t set aside enough funds for claims. The downgrade by
the ratings firm fueled a second-quarter impairment, and the
company’s stock has lost 20 percent since June 30.  “We believe the company is in a strong financial position
to return to profitability,” Chief Financial Officer Karen Spaun said in a statement today. “We are pleased with the
agreement to our credit facility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
