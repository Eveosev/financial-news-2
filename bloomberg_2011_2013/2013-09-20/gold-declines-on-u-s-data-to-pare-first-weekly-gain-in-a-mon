Gold fell the most in 11 weeks and
silver had the biggest drop in three months as a Federal Reserve
policy maker said a “small taper” in stimulus may occur in
October, damping investment demand for the metals.  The Fed on Sept. 18 maintained the pace of monthly bond
purchases, and that marked a “borderline decision,” Fed Bank
of St. Louis  James Bullard  said today on Bloomberg Television’s
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . Yesterday, gold
jumped 4.7 percent, the most since March 2009, after the Fed
announcement surprised investors who expected the central bank
to scale back stimulus.  “The next cycle of Fed watching has officially begun,”
Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice president at TD
Securities Inc., said in a report.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 2.7 percent to
settle at $1,332.50 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop for a most-active since July 5. The metal
climbed 1.8 percent this week.  The metal has slumped 20 percent this year as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid a
U.S. equity rally to a record and low inflation.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-trade
 fund  backed by the metal, have dropped 32 percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 5.9 percent to
$21.927 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop since June 20.
Yesterday, the price surged 8 percent, the most since March
2009, on the Fed announcement. The metal led declines among 24
 raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 2.7 percent to $1,432.60 an ounce. Trading
was 44 percent above the average in the past 100 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. This week, the price declined 0.8
percent, the fourth straight drop.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell 2.2 percent to
$721.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
