New York  Yankees pitcher  Andy Pettitte  will say today that he’s retiring after an 18-season
Major League Baseball career, according to the New York Post.  Pettitte, the 41-year-old left-hander, retired prior to the
2011 season before returning to the Yankees the next year. He
has told friends that this season has been physically much
tougher on his body than he anticipated,  the Post said , without
citing its source.  An e-mail seeking comment from Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo wasn’t immediately returned.  Pettitte is 10-10 with a 3.93 earned run average this
season. He has a 255-152 record and a 3.86 career ERA, having
pitched 15 years in New York and with the  Houston Astros  from
2004 to 2006. His win total is the most among active major
league pitchers and 42nd all-time.  Pettitte is scheduled to start in two days when the Yankees
host the  San Francisco Giants . That would mean his final outing
would take place during New York’s last series this season, in
his hometown of Houston.  The Yankees, at 80-73, trail five other American League
teams in the race for the two wild-card playoff berths that are
given to non-division winners with the best records. The Tampa
Bay Rays and  Texas Rangers  each are 83-69 and lead the wild-card
race, 3 1/2 games ahead of New York, which has nine games
remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
