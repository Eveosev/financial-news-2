Canadian  stocks  fell for a second
day as  BlackBerry (BB)  Ltd. plunged the most in three months and gold
producers slumped after a Federal Reserve policy maker said a
small tapering of bond buying is possible next month.  BlackBerry tumbled 16 percent after saying it will cut
4,500 jobs and record an inventory writedown of as much as $960
million after a new set of devices failed to catch on with
consumers. Iamgold Corp. and Eldorado Gold Corp. retreated at
least 7.7 percent as gold fell the most in 11 weeks. Goldcorp
Inc. slid 3.8 percent after Chairman Ian Telfer agreed to pay a
C$200,000 ($194,000) fine in a settlement over allegations that
he violated securities laws.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Index fell 120.31 points, or 0.9
percent, to 12,806.47 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, paring a weekly gain
of 0.7 percent. Trading volume was 117 percent higher than the
30-day average.  Once a quarter, futures and options for indexes and single
stocks expire on the same day, leading to a phenomenon called
quadruple witching, with increased volume as investors close out
their positions.  A comment by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President
 James Bullard  “saying tapering could happen in October got
people all nervous, and corresponding with that gold went
lower,” said Brian Huen, managing partner with Red Sky Capital
Management Ltd. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$220 million
($213.7 million). “The message is not clear, so there’s some
nervousness out there.”  Index Rebalancing  “There’s an index rebalancing happening as well as
quadruple witching for options, so you’ll see some volatility at
the close,” he said.  Bullard, a voter on policy this year who has backed the
Fed’s bond buying, said today the decision not to taper stimulus
was a close call and “small” cuts are possible next month.
Policy makers meet Oct. 29-30.  The benchmark Canadian equity gauge  soared  to a two-year
high on Sept. 18 after the U.S. Fed said it will “await more
evidence” for sustained economic recovery before reducing its
$85 billion in monthly bond buying.  Iamgold (IMG)  plunged 11 percent to C$5.25 and Eldorado Gold sank
7.7 percent to C$7.15 as gold for December delivery tumbled 2.7
percent to $1,332.50 an ounce in New York, the biggest drop
since July 5.  Gold stocks slumped 5.6 percent as a group, the worst
decline in six weeks, as all 24 members of the S&P/TSX Gold
Index retreated. Nine of 10  industries  in the S&P/TSX fell.  BlackBerry Loss  BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, plunged 16 percent
to C$9.08, the most since June 28. The smartphone maker, which
is evaluating a sale, expects to report a net operating loss of
as much as $995 million for the fiscal second quarter, according
to a statement today.  Sales in the quarter were about $1.6 billion, just more
than half the $3.03 billion  average estimate  of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The company sold about 5.9 million
smartphones in the quarter.  Goldcorp lost 3.8 percent to C$26.96. Telfer, the company’s
chairman, was included in an Ontario Securities Commission
statement of allegations in February 2012 regarding an alleged
insider-trading scheme.  Telfer admitted his conduct fell below standards expected,
Cullen Price, representing OSC staff, said at a hearing today in
Toronto. In addition to paying a fine to the regulator, Telfer
will be banned from arranging the right for people to buy shares
in private placements for one year.  S&P Dow Jones Canadian Index Services said on Sept. 13 that
it will make changes to the benchmark S&P/TSX at the close
today. Additions include Air Canada, the nation’s largest air
carrier, and NuVista Energy Ltd. Niko Resources Ltd. will be
removed from the index.  Air Canada slid 2.4 percent to C$3.20 and NuVista slipped
4.9 percent to C$7.01. Niko lost 1.2 percent to C$4.07.  To contact the reporter on this story:
