Russian stocks declined, paring a
third week of gains, amid concern the highest  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index
valuations in six months aren’t justified.  The Micex slid less than 0.1 percent to 1,486.77 by
3:29 p.m. in Moscow, trimming its advance this week to 3
percent. The 1.5 percent rally yesterday sent the index to 4.3
times 12-month estimated earnings, the most since March 15. OAO
Severstal, a Russian steelmaker, declined 0.7 percent to 302.90
rubles and lost 0.2 percent to $9.545 in  London .  This week’s advance in the Micex sent the 14-day  relative
strength index  to 71.98 yesterday, above the level of 70 that
suggests to some analysts that a security has been overbought
and is poised for a decline. Crude oil,  Russia ’s main export
earner, retreated for a second day in  New York  as the threat of
energy supply disruption from military strikes against  Syria 
receded.  “The Russian market gained a lot yesterday,” Andrey Vashevnik, chief investment officer for Russian markets at R&B
Russia Investment Fund Ltd, said by phone. “Today there are
concerns in the market that perhaps the U.S. economic recovery
isn’t as strong as we had thought.”  The world’s biggest economy needs to show more evidence
economic progress will be sustained before the U.S. Federal
Reserve can pare its $85 billion in monthly purchases of
Treasury and mortgage debt, the central bank said Sept. 18.
Crude slipped 0.2 percent to $106.16 in New York.  Trading Volumes  The dollar-denominated RTS Index dropped 0.6 percent today
after closing yesterday 19.9 percent above this year’s low on
June 24.  Average trading volume on the Micex was about 33 percent
below the 10-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ten-day price swings subsided to 15.79.  Polymetal International Plc, a Russian gold and silver
miner, lost 3.7 percent to 355.68 rubles after surging 7.3
percent yesterday.  The ruble weakened 0.4 percent to 31.763 against the
dollar, snapping ten days of gains. Most metals dropped in
London today, including nickel and tin. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s
biggest coking-coal producer, fell 1.6 percent to 111.40 rubles
after rising 2.1 percent yesterday.  OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port rose 3.5 percent to
3.4989 rubles. Vedomosti reported today that UralSib Bank bought
5 percent of the company’s shares before the government’s
planned sale of a 20 percent stake.  Even after this week’s rally, Russian equities have the
cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging economies tracked by
Bloomberg compared with a multiple of 10.8 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  Refinancing Rate  The Micex sank 0.7 percent on Sept. 13 as Russia’s central
bank kept the  refinancing rate  unchanged at 8.25 percent,
matching the forecast of 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Russia’s economy expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, the Federal Statistics Service reported on Aug. 9,
missing the median estimate for 2 percent.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in New York increased 0.1 percent to a six-month
high of 99.74 yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, dropped 1.3
percent.  v  To contact the reporter on this story:
