Ukrainian economic crime police
raided the central office of the country’s sixth-largest lender
by assets, PAT Ukrsotsbank, in Kiev following a ruling by a
regional court.  The office closed because of the today’s search, Anastasia
Pestrikova, head of external relations at Ukrsotsbank, said by
phone, without elaborating. The lender is a subsidiary of
UniCredit Bank Austria AG.  The search followed a ruling by the Leninskyi district
court in Donetsk, Interfax-Ukraine newswire reported today,
citing a person familiar with matter.  A spokesman for the Internal Affairs Ministry in Donetsk
Region did not answer his phone when called by  Bloomberg News 
today. The Leninskyi district court in Donetsk also did not
answer calls.  Graziano Cameli was named Ukrsotsbank’s new chief executive
officer in July after the former CEO, Borys Tymonkin, resigned
for a senior management post at Vetek Group.  UniCredit Bank Austria wrote down Ukrsotsbank’s goodwill by
165 million euros ($223 million) in March. Ukrsotsbank reported
an increase in its first half net income to 6.49 million hryvnia
($0.8 million) from 4.47 million hryvnia a year earlier,
according to local accounting standards, the bank said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
