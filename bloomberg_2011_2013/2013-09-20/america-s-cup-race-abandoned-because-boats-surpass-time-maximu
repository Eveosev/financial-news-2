A lack of wind forced today’s first
race in the America’s Cup to be abandoned with Emirates Team New
Zealand more than two minutes ahead of defending champion Oracle
Team USA and on the brink of capturing the Cup.  After having five races called off in the past week because
the wind was too strong, today’s first race was wiped out near
the end because the New Zealand boat could not finish in the
maximum 40 minutes.  The Kiwis lead 8-2 in the best-of-17 series, and another
race is scheduled for later this afternoon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
