Ergon Capital Partners SA is close
to selling steroid-maker Zellbios in a transaction valuing the
Luxembourg-based company at almost 200 million euros ($271
million), people familiar with the matter said.  Ergon, based in Brussels, hired Jefferies Group LLC to
manage the sale, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the talks are private. Equistone Partners  Europe  is the
frontrunner to buy Zellbios and a sale may be finalized within
weeks, one of the people said.  Zellbios was formed by a merger between Farmabios and
Pharmazell, two makers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, in
2011. The company has annual sales of 118 million euros and
factories in  Italy ,  Germany  and  India , according to the Ergon
website. As well as steroids, Zellbios makes antineoplastics,
used to inhibit the growth and spread of cancerous cells.  Representatives for Ergon, Equistone, Jefferies and
Zellbiosâ€™s Pharmazell unit declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
