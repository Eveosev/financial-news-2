Ireland’s credit-rating outlook was
revised to stable from negative by Moody’s Investors Service,
which cited improvements in the government’s finances and
stability in its access to financial markets.  The Ba1 grade, one step below investment grade, compares
with BBB+ rankings by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The country’s
government debt will likely “level off relative to gross
domestic product,” Moody’s said today in a statement.  “We’ve seen an ongoing fiscal consolidation and we expect
that to lead to the debt finally having peaked as early as this
year and starting to come down in 2014,” Kristin Lindow, a
senior analyst at Moody’s in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “We also have seen that Ireland has been less
susceptible to the events in the broader euro area.”  Italian five-year government bonds yield about 2.15
percentage points more than similar-maturity German debt, while
the spread for Ireland is about 1.9 percentage points.  “The outlook applies to a 12- to 18-month time horizon,”
Lindow said. “That being said, we monitor ratings on an ongoing
basis, so they’re not subject to a specific cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
