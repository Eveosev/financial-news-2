Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s
state-owned oil and gas producer, is set to receive a spot cargo
of liquefied natural gas at its Sungai Udang receiving terminal
in Melaka, according to ship-tracking data.  The Seri Bijaksana, with a capacity of about 153,000 cubic
meters, is anchored off Perak on the western coast of peninsular
Malaysia, according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It is scheduled to dock Oct. 15, the data show.  The tanker sailed from Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s Bonny Island
terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed Aug. 28.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is called,
bought the spot cargo through a sell tender held by Nigeria LNG
last month. Malaysia was the world’s second largest producer of
LNG in 2012 with exports of 23.72 million tons,  according  to the
 International Group  of LNG Importers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
