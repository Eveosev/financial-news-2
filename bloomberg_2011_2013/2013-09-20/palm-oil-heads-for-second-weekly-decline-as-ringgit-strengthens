Palm oil  fell for a third day and
was set for a second weekly decline as a surge in the Malaysian
currency cut the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in December lost as much as 0.6
percent to 2,303 ringgit ($729) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,305 ringgit by the end of the
morning session. Futures dropped 1.8 percent this week. Palm for
physical delivery in October was at 2,340 ringgit yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The ringgit was set for its biggest weekly advance since
the 1998 Asian financial crisis after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that more evidence of a recovery
in the world’s largest economy is needed before the central bank
starts to pare $85 billion a month of bond purchases.  “The ringgit has strengthened a lot against the  U.S.
dollar ,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga
Investment Bank Bhd. “This will make palm oil less competitive
against other oils like soybean oil and rapeseed oil which are
priced in the U.S. dollar and the euro.”  The improving weather in the U.S. Midwest will also boost
prospects for the soybean crop, which is crushed to make a
substitute oil, Lim said.  Soybeans for November lost 0.4 percent to $13.3375 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for December delivery
fell 0.5 percent to 42.75 cents a pound. Financial markets in
China are closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
