Palm imports by  India , the largest
buyer, will probably climb to a record next year as domestic
oilseed harvests trail consumption and a growing population
boosts demand for the oil used in noodles and candies.  Purchases may increase 5 percent to 8.7 million metric tons
in the year beginning Nov. 1 from 8.3 million tons this year,
said Govindlal G. Patel, managing partner at G Patel & Nikhil
Research Co., who has traded cooking oils for more than three
decades. Imports were 7.57 million tons in 2011-2012, according
to data from the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India.  Increased imports may trim inventories in Indonesia and
 Malaysia , the biggest producers, and stem a third year of price
declines, the worst run since at least 1996. World stockpiles
are set to rise to a record by the end of 2013-2014 as
production climbs to an all-time high and demand expands the
least in 12 years, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  says.  “Our per capita consumption of oil is very low compared to
the global average and demand is growing, so we need to
import,” said Patel. Consumption may grow at the same pace as
last year as a slowing economy curbs some purchases, he said.  India’s per capita consumption is growing an average of 4
percent annually and is estimated at 13.5 kilograms this year,
said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association.  The country meets more than half its cooking oil demand
through imports, buying palm from Indonesia and Malaysia and
 soybean oil  from the U.S.,  Brazil  and  Argentina . The country
produces about 8 million tons of vegetable oils annually.  Futures Slide  Palm for delivery in December fell 0.7 percent to 2,300
ringgit ($726) on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives in  Kuala Lumpur 
today. Futures lost 5.7 percent this year, extending the
combined 36 percent slump in 2011 and 2012.  “Indian imports in 2013-2014 will hit a record high, but
not as high as some people suggest,”  Dorab Mistry , a director
at Godrej International Ltd., said in e-mail interview.
“Consumption is being hurt by the local economic slowdown.”  The  economy  expanded at the slowest pace since 2003 in the
year ended March as investment fell and  consumer spending  in the
nation of 1.2 billion people moderated. HSBC Holdings Plc and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut their growth estimates to 4 percent
for this year.  Crude palm oil  and refined, bleached and deodorized palm
olein imports in the 10 months to August rose 14 percent to 6.7
million tons, according to association data. Total cooking oil
imports climbed 8 percent to 8.79 million tons between November
and August, it said.  Winter Crop  “Overall imports will rise to 10.6 million tons this year
because output was lower last year,” said Patel. “We will need
to see how the winter oilseed crop shapes up.”  The rupee slumped 8.1 percent in August, the biggest
monthly loss since 1992, making purchases more expensive. The
currency recovered to 62.315 to a dollar today after touching a
record low of 68.845 on Aug. 28.  “When the rupee was at 67-70, imports were difficult,”
said Patel. “If it stays between 60-63, then consumers may not
find cooking oil costly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
