A  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  solar-thermal
power project will start in October after a five-month delay,
the  Press Trust of India  reported, citing builder  Areva SA. (AREVA)   The project was able to source 60 percent of its equipment
in  India , Siddhartha Ghoshal, managing director of Areva’s solar
unit in the country, told a conference, according to PTI.  All 10 of India’s proposed solar-thermal plants, comprising
500 megawatts of capacity, missed deadlines to start operating
earlier this year, hobbled by escalating costs and difficulties
importing equipment. Only Godawari Power & Ispat Ltd.’s 50-megawatt plant was completed in June after a lack of local
components drove the project over budget by 20 percent.  Reliance’s 21 billion-rupee ($338 million), 100-megawatt
project missed a May deadline as authorities in Rajasthan state
failed to lay a water pipe to the site in time, Reliance Power
Chief Executive Officer Jayaram P. Chalasani said that month.  Solar-thermal plants focus sunlight on liquids to produce
steam for turbines and are valued for their ability to deliver
electricity around the clock.  Reliance Power and Areva didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed requests seeking confirmation of the PTI report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
