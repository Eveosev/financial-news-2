Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) , operator of
the world’s deepest platinum mine, will raise 1 billion rand
($103 million) from selling shares and bank loans as it seeks to
offset  strike action  and repair equipment.  Northam will raise 600 million rand through a so-called
claw-back offer, fully subscribed by Coronation Asset Management
(Pty) Ltd., in which 15 million shares will be sold at 40 rand
each, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement.
Banks will make 400 million rand available from a new revolving
credit facility that ends on March 31, 2015.  “Challenging economic and operational conditions have
beset the South African  mining industry  for an extended period
of time, with depressed platinum group metal basket prices,
volatile exchange rates, rising costs and a complex industrial
relations environment,” the company said in the statement.  Northam lost 192 million rand of revenue in April after
workers at its Zondereinde mine went on strike for three weeks
resulting in reduced production. The funds raised will also be
used to rebuild a smelter, ensure completion of the Booysendal
mine and maintain equipment at its Zondereinde facility, it said
in the statement.  The company, which posted a 70 percent rise in annual
profit last month, said it has fully drawn down its current 1
billion-rand revolving credit facility.  The stock rose 3.9 percent to 42.65 rand in Johannesburg
trading yesterday, giving a market value of 16.3 billion rand.
The shares are up 12.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
