OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) 
dismissed Roberto Monteiro, leaving Eike Batista’s crude company
without a head of finance as it seeks more money from creditors
in a bid to prevent bankruptcy protection proceedings.  OGX’s board “approved the destitution of Mr. Roberto
Bernardes Monteiro from his posts as chief financial officer and
director of investor relations, with the positions remaining
vacant until a new director is chosen by the board” in a future
meeting, the company said in a regulatory filing today. No
further details were offered on the departure.  Monteiro joined OGX from sister company  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) ,
where he was also CFO, in April 2012 as Batista sought to adjust
the startup’s investor relations strategy after it began to miss
output targets. Monteiro’s departure comes after the stock lost
more than 90 percent this year and Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carneiro said Sept. 12 that OGX plans to ask holders of $3.6
billion in bonds for more cash.  Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO)  has notified OGX that it may
end the contract for the Ocean Quest rig because the producer is
behind on  payments , according to a regulatory filing by Diamond
yesterday. OGX owed Diamond $22.7 million on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
