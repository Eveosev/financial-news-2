The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued a South Carolina man and his son over claims
they ran a fraudulent investment program to illegally profit
from the deaths of terminally ill people.  Benjamin S. Staples and his son Benjamin O. Staples made at
least $6.5 million from 2008 to 2012 by offering to pay funeral
expenses for dying individuals who agreed to open joint
brokerage accounts and then relinquish ownership rights to the
brokers, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed today in federal court
in Columbia, South Carolina.  Once they had control of the accounts, the Stapleses bought
discounted corporate bonds with a “survivor’s option” that
allowed them to collect the full principal amount when the joint
owner died, the SEC said. Their illicit profit was the
difference between the discounted price of the bonds they
purchased and the full principal amount they obtained when
redeeming the bonds early, the agency said.  “The Stapleses exploited the tragic circumstances
surrounding a terminally ill diagnosis and turned the misfortune
of others into a profit-making enterprise for themselves,”
Kenneth  Israel , director of the SEC’s regional office in Salt
Lake City,  Utah , said in a statement. “The Stapleses deceived
brokerage firms and bond issuers by casting themselves as
survivors of a joint ownership situation when the deceased had
no legal ties to the bonds at all.”  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and
financial penalties.  Phone calls to attorneys for the Stapleses weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
