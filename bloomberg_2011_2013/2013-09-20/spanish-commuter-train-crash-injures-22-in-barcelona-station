Twenty-two people were injured when
two commuter trains crashed in Barcelonaâ€™s main train station
today.  Ten of the injured needed medical attention, Antonio
Carmona, a spokesman for rail operator Renfe, said in a
telephone interview. One train crashed into the other, which was
stationary, as it came into Barcelona Sants station at 10:05
a.m., he said. Trains continued to operate with a 30 minute
delay.  Spain  suffered its worst railway accident in more than 40
years in July when a highspeed train derailed at more than 150
kilometers per hour, killing 79 people. Authorities are
investigating the accident, which happened as the train rounded
a bend on its approach to Santiago de Compostela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
