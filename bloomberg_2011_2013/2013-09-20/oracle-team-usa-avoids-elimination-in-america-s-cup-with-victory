Oracle Team USA again held off
elimination in the America’s Cup by defeating Emirates Team New
Zealand today on San Francisco Bay.  The victory still left the defending champions behind 8-3
in the best-of-17 series, which continues tomorrow. An earlier
race today was abandoned with New Zealand ahead by more than two
minutes because a lack of wind prevented the Kiwis from
finishing the course within the required 40 minutes.  New Zealand needs one more win to clinch the latest version
of the 162-year-old sailing competition. The USA team,
bankrolled by Oracle Corp. chief executive  Larry Ellison , has to
win the next six races to retain the Auld Mug.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
