Italy ’s wine output may jump 8.4
percent after grape harvests in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and
Sicily recovered from drought last year, researcher Istituto di
Servizi per il Mercato Agricolo e Alimentara forecast.  Production is expected to rise to 44.5 million hectoliters
(1.18 billion gallons) from 41.1 million hectoliters last year,
the Rome-based group wrote in a  report  dated Sept. 17 and
published online today.  Italy was the world’s second-largest  wine producer  after
 France  last year, production data show. French output may
rebound at a slower pace after a wet and cold June hurt
pollination, with the 2013 volume up 7.5 percent to 44.5 million
hectoliters, France’s Agriculture Ministry predicts.  “At the moment everything leads us to believe that 2013
wine production should be higher than the not particularly
abundant one of 2012,” ISMEA wrote. “Caution is always
required but this year even more so. Most of the grapes are
still in the field.”  Production in Veneto, Italy’s biggest wine-growing region
and known for its Valpolicella reds, is forecast to rise 4
percent to 8.05 million hectoliters.  Volume in  Piedmont , home to the Barolo and Barbaresco
wines, is predicted to increase 7.5 percent to 2.54 million
hectoliters, while Tuscany production may climb 5 percent to 2.2
million hectoliters, according to ISMEA.  Veneto’s grape development is about two weeks delayed after
prolonged rain, ISMEA reported. Some areas in Valpolicella
received as much rain by the end of May as in all of 2012,
according to the report.  Delays  Grapes in Piedmont are about 15 to 20 days delayed compared
with 2012 after a “very rainy” spring, with ripening starting
at the end of July rather than the start, and berries of the
nebbiolo variety only fully colored at the start of September,
according to ISMEA.  Output in Emilia-Romagna, which produces Lambrusco, is
forecast to jump 10 percent to 6.9 million hectoliters.  In Puglia in the south, wine production is seen advancing
14 percent to 6.09 million hectoliters, while the volume of wine
in Sicily may jump 17 percent to 6.05 million hectoliters.  “The regions in the south seem to recover more, in terms
of percentage increase, that those of the north,” ISMEA wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
