Brazil ’s swap rates headed for
their biggest weekly drop since June as a strengthening real
eased speculation that the central bank will maintain increases
in borrowing costs to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.10 percent
at 10:15 a.m. in Sao Paulo, extending their drop since Sept. 13
to 36 basis points. The real surged 3.8 percent this week, the
most since January 2012, driving down the price of imports. The
currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.1966 per dollar today.  Brazil’s currency has rallied 11 percent since Aug. 22 when
the central bank announced a $60 billion program of intervention
to bolster the currency and rein in inflation. The real posted
the best performance among 16 major currencies this week after
the Fed maintained the $85 billion pace of monthly bond buying.
Inflation slowed to less than 6 percent for the first time this
year in the 12 months through mid-September.  “After the Fed’s decision, the pass-through inflation from
the dollar may not be so strong,”  Newton Rosa , the chief
economist at SulAmerica Investimentos, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “We haven’t had that many negative suprises with
inflation lately.”  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 price index rose
5.93 percent in the month year through Sept. 15 from a year
earlier, the national statistics agency reported today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
