U.S. feedlot owners reduced the
number of cattle added to herds in August by 10.9 percent from a
year earlier, when drought-parched pastures forced ranchers to
sell animals as feed costs surged, a government report showed.  Placements into herds totaled 1.788 million head, down from
2.007 million in August 2012 and the lowest on records dating
back to 1996, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in
 Washington . Analysts expected an 8.3 percent drop to 1.84
million, according to 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The total feedlot herd on Sept. 1 was 9.876 million head,
down 7.2 percent from 10.647 million a year earlier, the USDA
said. Analysts in the Bloomberg survey expected a 6.5 percent
drop to 9.958 million. Sales of cattle to slaughterhouses last
month totaled 1.883 million head, the second-lowest level on
record, compared with 1.955 million a year earlier, according to
USDA. Analysts expected marketings of 1.867 million.  “Most of the country is in a lot better shape, and there
aren’t forced sales that there were last year,” Tim Petry, a
livestock-market economist for North Dakota State University in
Fargo, said in a telephone interview before the report. “We’ve
got a lot more of the country not in a drought.”  Feedlot operators typically buy 1-year-old cattle that
weight 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders,
which are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,300 pounds
and are sold to meatpackers.  As of Jan. 1, the U.S. cattle herd was at the smallest
level since 1952 after the worst drought since the 1930s spurred
ranchers to send more animals to slaughter. About 6.9 percent of
the contiguous U.S. is in “extreme” drought, compared with 21
percent a year earlier, U.S. Drought Monitor data show. The USDA
rated 34 percent of pasture and rangeland in good or excellent
condition in the week ended Sept. 15, compared with 19 percent a
year earlier.  Feedlots lost about $52 a head on average in August, and
the prospect of continued losses are a “serious concern,”
according to  Rich Nelson , chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in
McHenry,  Illinois .  To contact the reporters on this story:
