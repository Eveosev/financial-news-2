The forint weakened the most in
more than two weeks and Hungary’s 10-year forint bonds snapped a
10-day rally on speculation that the gains sparked by the
 Federal Reserve  maintaining stimulus were overdone.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 298.67 per
euro at 3:15 p.m. in Budapest, paring the week’s gains to 0.6
percent. Yields on Hungary’s forint bonds due in 2023 rose eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.89 percent,
rebounding from the lowest in two months.  The forint gained as much as 1 percent amid an emerging-market rally after the Fed kept asset purchases unchanged at $85
billion per month on Sept. 18, surprising 69 percent of analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. After the initial strengthening, central
European currencies are starting to return to pre-Fed levels,
with the zloty dropping 0.6 percent today.  Investors probably came to regard  Hungary ’s yields as
“overvalued” and the forint’s appreciation “ran out of
steam,” analysts at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s CIB Bank unit, led by
Mariann Trippon, wrote in e-mailed report today.  Ten consecutive days of gains by Hungary’s 2023 notes
pushed their relative-strength index to 72 yesterday, above the
70 level that indicates to some analysts a security is
overbought. The RSI dropped to 69 today. Hungary sold 29.9
billion forint ($136 million) in 3-, 5- and 15-year bonds at an
auction yesterday, 32 percent less than planned, as demand
plunged.  ‘Matolcsy’s Target’  Hungary’s central bank will probably lower its main rate by
20 basis points to 3.6 percent on Sept. 24, according to 10 out
of 14 analysts in Bloomberg  survey . Three economists see a 10
basis point cut and one expects a 25 basis point reduction.  Policy makers may bring the benchmark rate to between 3
percent and 3.5 percent by the end of the easing cycle, Magyar
Nemzeti Bank President Gyorgy Matolcsy said on July 23.  “Given the Fed decision, there is scope for the cut to 3.6
percent, and then we’re approaching the upper end of Matolcsy’s
target range,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at
Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., said by phone today. “At that level,
the bigger bond investors may start to ponder how much lower the
central bank will dare to go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
