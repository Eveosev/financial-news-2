Brazil ’s annual  inflation  slowed in
mid-September to below 6 percent for the first time in nine
months, as the central bank carries out the world’s biggest
interest-rate increase this year.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose
5.93 percent in the year through September 12, the national
statistics agency said in a report published on its website
today. That was in line with the median  forecast  of a 5.94
percent increase from 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Monthly  inflation  of 0.27 percent was also in line with
analysts’ forecast of 0.28 percent.  A weaker currency has complicated the central bank board’s
efforts to slow inflation even as it raises borrowing costs. The
real fell to almost a five-year low before policy makers on Aug.
22 announced a $60 billion program of swaps and credit line
auctions that caused the currency to appreciate at the fastest
pace against the dollar in the world.  The real has strengthened 10.8 percent since Aug. 22,
boosted by the the U.S. Federal Reserve announcement on Sept. 17
that it would continue its pace of asset purchases. Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  said the Fed decision may allow policy
makers to curtail their currency interventions, adding that the
decision is up to the central bank.  ’Uncomfortable’ Level  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said the same day
inflation remained at an “uncomfortable” level.  “ Monetary policy  needs to be especially vigilant so that
this pass-through doesn’t reach the consumer with force,”
Tombini said about a weaker real in a congressional hearing.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 10.18 percent at 9:20 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.7 percent to 2.2170 per  U.S. dollar .  Central bank directors will hold their monetary policy
meeting on October 8 and 9. Policy makers have raised the
benchmark  Selic (BZSTSETA)  interest rate by 1.75 percentage points so far
this year to 9 percent.  Economists polled weekly by the central bank forecast 5.82
percent inflation in 2013 and a Selic of 9.75 percent by year-end. Policy makers target 4.5 percent inflation, plus or minus
two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
