LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury-goods company, is in advanced
talks to acquire a stake in fashion designer J.W. Anderson,
according to two people familiar with the situation.  LVMH, which said today it had taken a majority stake in
British shoemaker Nicholas Kirkwood, could sign a deal with
London-based Anderson as soon as this month, said the people,
who asked not to be named as the information is confidential.  Jonathan William Anderson set up the label bearing his name
in 2008, three years after graduating from London College of
Fashion. He has collaborated with Gianni Versace SpA and  Philip Green ’s Topshop. Kirkwood, who trained at Central Saint Martins
and Cordwainers College, founded his brand in 2004, and has
twice been named accessories designer of the year at the British
Fashion Awards.  LVMH, which in July bought cashmere clothier Loro Piana SpA
for 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion), said today its purchase of
Kirkwood affirmed its commitment to nurture talent and
creativity. Acquiring a stake in Anderson would underscore the
growing appeal of emerging designers to large luxury groups as
they seek to keep shoppers interested.  LVMH acquired French fashion label Maxime Simoens in
February, while Gucci-owner  Kering SA (KER)  bought stakes in designers
Christopher Kane in January and Joseph Altuzarra this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
