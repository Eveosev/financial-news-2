Copper was poised for the biggest
weekly gain in a year after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
maintained monetary stimulus in the U.S., the second-biggest
consumer of the metal.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,333.75 a metric ton at 9:25
a.m. in Tokyo after touching $7,357 yesterday, the highest level
since Aug. 27. Copper has advanced 4.2 percent this week, the
biggest rally since the five days ended Sept. 14, 2012.  The LMEX index of six industrial metals added 2.3 percent
yesterday, the most since Aug. 8, and the MSCI All-Country World
Index of  equities  jumped to a five-year high. Policy makers want
to see more evidence that improvement in the  U.S. economy  will
be sustained before adjusting the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly
debt purchases.  “The Fed’s decision and the dollar’s weakness against the
euro provided support for copper,” said Chae Un Soo, a metals
trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . “Copper is
expected to test the Aug. 27 high of $7,400 in the short term.”  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for the 11th
straight session. They have dropped 5.8 percent to 568,575 tons
since Sept. 4. Ten traders and analysts surveyed expect copper
to climb next week, eight were bearish and eight neutral.  Futures for delivery in December were little changed at
$3.3505 a pound on the Comex in New York. Markets in  China  are
closed today for the Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.  On the LME, nickel, aluminum, lead and zinc declined. Tin
hadn’t traded yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
