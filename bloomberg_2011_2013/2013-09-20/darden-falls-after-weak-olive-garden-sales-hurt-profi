Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI)  fell the
most in more than nine months after first-quarter profit trailed
analysts’ estimates amid declining sales at its Olive Garden and
Red Lobster chains.  The shares slid 4.9 percent to $46.90 at 10:02 a.m. in New
York, after earlier dropping as much as 5.5 percent for the
biggest decline since Dec. 4. Darden had gained 9.4 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 21 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Profit excluding some items in the quarter ended Aug. 25
was about 53 cents a share, the Orlando, Florida-based company
said today in a statement today. That trailed the 70-cent
average of 29 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 6.1 percent to $2.16 billion, trailing analysts’ $2.2
billion projection.  Olive Garden  and Red Lobster have been struggling to lure
diners as cash-strapped Americans eat out less. Deals such as
$6.95 lunches and three-course dinners at Olive Garden haven’t
helped much amid competing offers from Brinker International
Inc.’s Chili’s and  DineEquity Inc. (DIN) ’s Applebee’s. First-quarter
same-restaurant sales fell 4 percent at Olive Garden and slipped
5.2 percent at Red Lobster.  “We are working to improve affordability and to refine the
guest experiences we provide so that they remain responsive to
what guests want beyond affordability,” Chief Executive Officer
Clarence Otis said in the statement.  Darden said it will eliminate 80 to 85 jobs in operating
support and cut spending on some programs to reduce annual
operating expenses by $50 million. The company said the actions
will reduce spending by about $25 million in the current fiscal
year, offset by a one-time cost of $10 million to implement the
cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
