The fashion and luxury-goods
industry is facing a shortage of skilled workers, according to
Francois-Henri Pinault, chief executive officer of  Kering SA (KER) ,
the owner of the Gucci brand.  “We’re struggling to find key people” in functions such
as product development, visual merchandising, marketing and
communication, Pinault said in an interview today in Milan,
where Kering and Vogue Italia presented an initiative to offer
internships to young people.  In the past 10 to 15 years, Kering has focused on
recruiting and retaining design talent, Pinault said. That focus
needs to widen to other functions, he said.  Kering will offer 23 internships at Gucci, Bottega Veneta,
Brioni, Sergio Rossi, Boucheron, Girard-Perregaux, JeanRichard
and Pomellato in  Italy ,  France  and Switzerland, Pinault said.
Vogue Italia will help identify suitable candidates.  Pinault said he’s confident “we will spot amazing people
through this partnership.”  Kering employs about 30,000 people, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
