South African white corn futures
rose the most in more than two weeks after the rand dropped
against the dollar, making it more expensive to import the grain
in the country.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
rose 0.7 percent to 2,308.20 rand ($235) a metric ton, the most
since Sept. 2 by the midday close on the South African Futures
Exchange. The yellow variety for the same month gained 1 percent
to 2,144 rand a ton.  “Today’s movement was literally as a result of the weaker
rand,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in
the Free State province, said by phone.  The rand weakened as much as 1.4 percent today, paring its
third weekly gain.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. A meal made from white corn is one of the nation’s staple
foods and the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December rose 0.3 percent to 3,338
rand a metric ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
