Malaysia ’s ringgit posted its
biggest weekly advance since the 1998 Asian financial crisis
after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from cutting
stimulus that’s spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that more
evidence of a recovery in the world’s largest economy is needed
before the central bank starts to pare $85 billion a month of
bond purchases. The yield on Malaysia’s 10-year government notes
slid to a two-month low, while the FTSE Bursa Malaysia  KLCI
Index (FBMKLCI)  of shares rallied 1.9 percent since Sept. 13.  “Strength in Asian currencies this week has a lot to do
with the Fed’s decision not to taper,” said  Nizam Idris , the
head of fixed income and currency strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd.
in Singapore. “It gives countries with worsening current
accounts more time to get their houses in order.”  The ringgit appreciated 4 percent during the five days to
3.1647 per dollar as of 4:51 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the steepest
increase since September 1998, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
It reached 3.1463 yesterday, the strongest since June 18, before
retreating 0.6 percent today.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 3.8 percent to
3.1691 from a week ago. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
surged 60 basis points, or 0.60 percentage point, to 10.04
percent this week. It slid 27 basis points today.  Bonds, Swaps  Fitch Ratings  cut its credit-rating outlook for Malaysia to
negative from stable in July, citing rising public debt levels.
The nation’s current-account surplus shrank 70 percent to 2.6
billion ringgit ($822 million) in the second quarter, the
closest the country has come to recording a deficit, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1999.  Malaysia’s risk of a debt default is minimal as the
government can reduce the fiscal deficit even if there’s capital
outflows, Prime Minister Najib Razak said in an interview with
CNBC broadcast today.  The cost to insure the nation’s sovereign debt for five
years dropped 27 basis points in the first four days of the week
to 100, the least in three months, CMA default swaps prices show.  Ten-year  government bonds  advanced for an 11th day, the
longest winning streak since the 3.48 percent notes were sold in
March. The yield fell four basis points today and 12 basis
points for the week to 3.68 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate was the lowest since July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
