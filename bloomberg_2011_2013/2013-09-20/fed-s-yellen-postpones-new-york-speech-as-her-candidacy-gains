Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen postponed a speech next month to the Economic Club of New
York, the club said today, as her prospects of becoming the next
Fed chairman gained.  Yellen’s planned appearance Oct. 1 “will be rescheduled,”
the club said in an e-mailed statement. “We will return any
advance payments.”  The likelihood of Yellen, 67, replacing Ben S. Bernanke as
Fed chief has increased as White House officials began gauging
lawmakers’ support and she won the backing of a top Senate
Democrat this week.  Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the chamber’s No. 3
Democrat and a senior member of the Banking Committee, on Sept.
18 called Yellen an “excellent choice” to succeed Bernanke
when his term expires on Jan. 31.  President  Barack Obama ’s aides, meanwhile, have begun
making calls to U.S. Senate offices to discuss the process of
selecting the next central bank chief, mentioning Yellen by
name, according to three Senate Democratic staff members.  The calls to senators’ offices follow the decision by
former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to withdraw his name
from consideration, announced Sept. 15.  Michelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the Fed in  Washington ,
didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
