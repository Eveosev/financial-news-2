U.K. government bonds declined
after Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
said the decision not to slow stimulus this week was a close
call and “small” tapering is possible next month.  Yields on 30-year gilts rose the most in two weeks before
the U.K. sells inflation-linked securities due in 2068 via banks
next week. The Federal Open Market Committee announced two days
ago it would keep buying $85 billion of bonds each month. “That
was a borderline decision” after “weaker data came in,”
Bullard said on Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “The committee came down on the
side of, ‘Let’s wait.’”  Benchmark  10-year (GUKG10)  gilt yields climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.95 percent at 1:52 p.m. London time.
The 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 fell 0.405, or
4.05 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,600) face amount, to 94.005.
Thirty-year gilt  yields (GUKG30)  climbed six basis points to 3.73
percent, the biggest increase since Sept. 5.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 2.3 percent and Treasuries fell 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
