The Rhodes Trust, which awards
scholarships for study at the University of Oxford, received 75
million pounds ($120 million) from the McCall MacBain
Foundation, the largest gift in the program’s 110 years.  The donation from the foundation, established by John and
Marcy McCall MacBain, will allow the trust to award Rhodes
Scholarships in more countries and includes a 25 million-pound
challenge to raise more money, the trust said yesterday in a
 statement  on its website.  John McCall MacBain was the founder and chief executive
officer of Trader Classified Media, a publisher of classified
advertisements, until its sale in 2006, according to the Geneva-based  foundation . McCall MacBain, a native of  Canada , received a
Rhodes scholarship in 1980 and serves as a Rhodes trustee.  “I welcome this donation to ensure that Rhodes
Scholarships will flourish long into the future,” said U.K.
Prime Minister David Cameron, an Oxford graduate, in the
statement. “It is great news for the U.K. and our world class,
higher education system that such a prestigious program looks
set to be secured for the long term.”  The scholarships were established in 1903 by the will of
 Cecil Rhodes , a British mine operator and explorer who founded
what is now diamond producer De Beers, owned by Anglo American
Plc. A class of 83 scholars is now selected annually for two or
three years of study at Oxford. Past U.S. winners include former
U.S. President  Bill Clinton ; Cory Booker , mayor of Newark, New
Jersey; and  Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
