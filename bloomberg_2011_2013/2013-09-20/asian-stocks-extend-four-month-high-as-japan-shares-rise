speculation about the stimulus reduction,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “But the Fed will
eventually trim stimulus, and investors will become more
selective.”  Regional Gauges  India’s S&P BSE Sensex slid 1.9 percent, its biggest drop
