GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) ,  India ’s biggest
gas marketing company, will get a spot cargo of liquefied
natural gas from Qatar’s Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co. in
the first half of October.  The shipment will be delivered to the LNG import terminal
at Dabhol in the western state of Maharashtra, Prabhat Singh,
GAIL’s New Delhi-based marketing director, said today in a phone
interview. The terminal will restart operations from the middle
of October after they were stopped in May because of the
monsoon, Singh said.  The delivered price of the Qatari cargo is $14.40 per
million British thermal units, said another company official,
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak to the media. Spot LNG for delivery over the next four to
eight weeks cost $15.55 per million Btu in the period ended
Sept. 18, New York-based Energy Intelligence Group said on the
website of its World Gas Intelligence publication.  Asian prices are likley to remain at $14 to $16 per million
Btu this year, Singh said Sept. 3.  Dabhol LNG terminal is operated by Ratnagiri Gas & Power
Pvt., in which GAIL and  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , India’s largest electricity
generator, own 32.86 percent each, according to the company’s
 website . The Maharashtra state’s electricity board has 17.4
percent, while financial institutions own 16.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
