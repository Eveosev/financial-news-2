The latest series of indexes
measuring the cost of protecting against default on corporate
debt started trading today.  Gauges of credit-default swaps on companies in  Europe  and
 Japan  rolled into their 20th series. The 21st version of the
Markit CDX North America Investment-Grade Index also opens
today, while the new Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan series starts
Sept. 23. New benchmarks are created every six months when
companies are added or dropped depending on their ratings, cost
of protection and ease of trading.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps linked to 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings cost 393 basis points at 8:25 a.m. in  London ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 364
basis points for Series 19 at the close yesterday.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was at 99 basis points, compared with
89 yesterday. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers was at 140, after closing
at 125, and the subordinated index was 204 basis points, up from
186.  Five constituents changed in Europe’s investment-grade
benchmark and four in the high-yield measure. Constituents of
the financial gauges didn’t change.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
