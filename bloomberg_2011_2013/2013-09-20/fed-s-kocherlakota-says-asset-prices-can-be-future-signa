President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said central bankers should use
probabilities of outcomes derived from financial-market prices
in their policy making.  “Policy makers need some way to gauge the relative
likelihood of future events,” Kocherlakota said today in slides
prepared for a speech in New York. “For policy makers that care
about social welfare, the relevant probability is a risk-neutral
probability.”  The Minneapolis Fed chief spoke at a conference on
extracting and understanding the risk neutral probability
density from options prices at New York University’s Stern
School of Business. He did not comment on the outlook for the
U.S. economy or monetary policy in the slides of his remarks
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
