Moody’s Investors Service is
proposing changes to the way it rates covered bonds to reflect
the debt’s preferential treatment under new European rules
governing bank failures.  The ratings company is responding to an agreement that
calls for bondholders to share the burden of a bank’s failure by
having unsecured debt written off, or bailed-in, while exempting
covered bonds. Given the privileged ranking of the securities,
which are backed by mortgages and public sector loans, Moody’s
suggests raising the minimum level at which it currently grades
these bonds.  “It does seem fair enough to reduce the linkage with
senior unsecured, which will be bail-inable, while covered bonds
are not,” said  John Raymond , an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in
 London .  If the proposals are adopted, the majority of European
covered bonds rated below the highest level of AAA could be
upgraded by as many as two steps, according to Moody’s. The new
guidelines could also extend beyond the European Union to other
jurisdictions that introduce bail-ins for unsecured debt,
according to Moody’s.  “The rating of covered bonds is a big topic so it is good
to see Moody’s start the discussion,” said Frank Will, head of
covered bond, supranational and agency research at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  The European Union’s bail-in rules, agreed on June 27, are
subject to final negotiations and could be adopted as law by
member states by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
