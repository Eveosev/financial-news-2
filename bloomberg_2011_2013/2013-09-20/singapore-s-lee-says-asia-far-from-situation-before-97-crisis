Asia ’s fundamentals are strong and
“far” from the conditions before the 1997 regional financial
crisis, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.  “I do not believe that we are in the situation of the
Asian financial crisis,” Lee said in his speech in the city
state today. The region is “between challenges but overall,
we’re in a stable position,” he said.  Lee said the prospects of a tapering in the Quantative
easing led to an outflow of capital and currency depreciation in
Asia, with investors doubting the sustainability of  emerging
markets . He added the situation has stabilized though risks
remain.  Emerging markets recovered after U.S. policy makers said
this week they want more evidence of an economic recovery before
paring its $85 billion-a-month quantitative-easing program. U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke had said in June the
central bank may start curbing stimulus this year and end it in
2014 if the economy finally achieves sustainable growth  To contact the reporter on this story:
