 The yield on  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS) ’s bond fell to the lowest in more than two years in
Copenhagen trading on speculation the Danish turbine maker will
return to profit as contracts in the U.S. pick up.  The yield on Vestas’ 600 million-euro ($810 million) 4.625
percent bond due 2015 dropped 17 basis points to 5.06 percent
today, the lowest since July 18, 2011, according to Composite
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Vestas’s stock rose as much as 1.3
percent.  “The company has reduced structural costs by more than 30
percent, resulting in higher customer confidence,” Kasper Larsen, a credit analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , said.
“Consequently new order inflow has improved markedly.”  Vestas has struggled with overcapacity and falling wind
turbine prices as lower government subsidies have reduced
investor interest in green energy. The Aarhus, Denmark-based
company reported today its second U.S. contract in a week. That
prompted Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at  Sydbank A/S (SYDB) , to almost
double his  U.S. order estimates for the next two years.  “The order secures a high level of activity in the U.S. in
2014 and 2015 and that’s very good news for Vestas’s capacity
utilization and profitability,” the Aabenraa, Denmark-based
analyst said in a note. He raised his combined U.S. order
estimate to “almost” 2,000 megawatts from “at least” 1,000
megawatts. That compares with estimates for U.S. orders of as
low as 140 megawatts this year, the analyst said.  Order Wins  Vestas said today it won an order to supply turbine
equipment with a capacity of 60 megawatts to Renewable Energy
Systems Americas Inc. in a deal that could grow to as much as
610 megawatts in 2014 and 2015. On Sept. 13 Vestas said it won a
80-megawatt order as part of an master supply agreement with EDF
Renewable Energy Inc. in the U.S. that could expand to as much
as 750 megawatts in 2014 and 2015.  “We find it likely that both these large framework
contracts at EDF and RES will be more or less fully exercised,”
said Sydbank’s Pedersen, who has a buy recommendation on the
Vestas stock.  The yield on Vestas’s bond was at a record-low 3.72 percent
in May 2010, two months after it was issued. The yield jumped to
a record 26.1 percent in May 2012.  “Given the financial development in the company, we expect
Vestas will be able to both extend its revolving credit facility
and refinance its 2015 Eurobond,” Larsen said in an e-mail. The
bond’s earlier high yield levels “was a reflection of real
investor concerns at that time that the company would not be
able to refinance the bond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
