India  is offering lines of credit
to Cuba to set up renewable-energy projects that would help
reduce the Caribbean nation’s dependence on oil imports.  Indian Renewable-Energy Minister Farooq Abdullah met Marino Murillo, vice president of Cuba’s council of ministers, to offer
assistance, according to an Indian government statement.  Cuba, seeking to diversify its energy mix and curb reliance
on crude imports, consumes three times as much oil as it
produces, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. The island nation asked for India’s help in
developing wind farms and power plants that run on bagasse, a
waste product of sugar cane, according to the statement.  The politicians’ meeting follows a trip by Abdullah to
Santiago,  Chile , last week where the two countries also agreed
to cooperate on renewable projects. India, Asia’s biggest wind
market after  China , plans to double clean-energy capacity to
about 60 gigawatts by 2017, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
