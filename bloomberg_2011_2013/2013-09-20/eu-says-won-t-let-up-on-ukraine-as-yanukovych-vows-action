The European Union said it won’t
loosen the conditions for Ukraine to sign a pact on closer ties
as the former Soviet republic seeks ways to meet the bloc’s
terms in the next two months.  “I hope nobody in Ukraine will think that now the EU is
lowering the bar and leaving the conditions we set up in
December behind,” Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said
today at a conference in Ukraine’s Black Sea resort of Yalta.
“I can’t see this happening.”  The 28-member bloc has said issues such as the imprisonment
of ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are impeding the signing
of an Association Agreement and free-trade accord at a summit in
the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius in November. Ukrainian
President Viktor Yanukovych said today that his nation still has
time to resolve the “very difficult” Tymoshenko case.  Ukraine is seeking to cement relations with the EU at the
expense of  Russia , which wants its neighbor to instead join a
customs union it created with Kazakhstan and Belarus. The EU
pact has been delayed after Tymoshenko, an opponent of
Yanukovych from the 2004 Orange Revolution, was handed a seven-year sentence for abuse of office in 2011, a move the bloc deems
selective justice.  Yanukovych said today that he can’t pardon Tymoshenko while
other outstanding court cases against her remain unresolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
