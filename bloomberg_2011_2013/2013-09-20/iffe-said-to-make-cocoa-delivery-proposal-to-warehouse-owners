NYSE Liffe is seeking feedback from
warehouse owners on a proposal to set minimum delivery rates for
the first time for cocoa tied to its futures contracts,
according to three people with direct knowledge.  NYSE Liffe is proposing a minimum delivery rate of 250
metric tons of cocoa a day for warehouses storing as much as
30,000 tons, the people said, citing a letter sent by the
exchange in the past several weeks. Depots holding more than
30,000 tons would have to delivery 500 tons, according to the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The exchange said in June last year it would introduce
minimum delivery rates “in due course” after they started the
same minimum load-out rules for robusta coffee. Ada Anunoby, a
spokeswoman for Liffe, declined to comment on the cocoa plan.  The  European Warehousekeepers Federation  was contacted by
NYSE Liffe about load-out rates on cocoa, Enrico Antony,
chairman of the Amsterdam-based group, said yesterday.  Withdrawals of cocoa are mostly limited to no more than 200
tons a day per warehouse, three people with knowledge of the
deliveries said in July, referring to depots in the Belgian city
of Antwerp. A buyer taking 75,000 tons, the maximum allowed by
Liffe for any of its contracts, might wait about 18 months if
the beans are in the same depot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
