President  Barack Obama  said
congressional Republicans risk creating “profoundly
destructive” consequences for the U.S. by holding the nation’s
debt ceiling hostage to the fight over his health-care law.  Facing a showdown with congressional Republicans over
funding government operations and raising the federal debt
ceiling, Obama said his opponents are “not focused on you,
they’re focused on politics, they’re focused on trying to mess
with me.”  The president was making his case before workers at a Ford
Motor Co. plant in a suburb of Kansas City,  Missouri , a few
hours after the Republican-controlled House voted to finance the
federal government through Dec. 15 and choke off funding for
Obama’s signature health-care law.  He said a “faction on the far right of the  Republican
Party ” is willing to put the  U.S. economy  at risk to score
political points by trying to kill his signature health-care law
as the price for funding the government in the new fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 and raising the debt ceiling to let the
government pay its bills.  He likened the Republican stance on the debt ceiling to
someone buying one of the trucks produced by Ford at the plant
and deciding not to make loan payments to save money. “You
can’t say you’re saving money just by not paying the bills,” he
said.  He said the Affordable Care Act has been the law for more
than three years and he won re-election over an opponent who
vowed to repeal it.  “The voters were pretty clear on this,” Obama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
