Gold output in  Ghana ,  Africa ’s
largest producer after  South Africa , may fall as much as 18
percent this year after declining prices prompted some mines to
cut production, said Ben Aryee, head of the Minerals Commission.  Production retreated 6.4 percent in the second quarter to
1.021 million ounces from a revised 1.092 million ounces in the
first quarter of 2013, Aryee, chief executive officer of the
state-run mining regulator, said today in an interview in Accra,
the capital.  “Gold volumes will definitely decline,” Aryee said. “The
price slump is a matter of grave concern for the sector,
companies are scaling down operations,” he said, without giving
a production estimate in ounces for this year.  Ghana’s gold production climbed to 4.3 million ounces in
2012 from 3.6 million ounces the previous year as global prices
rose for a 12th consecutive year. Prices slumped 19 percent this
year as some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of
value amid signs economies are strengthening. Gold reached
$1,180.50 an ounce in  London  on June 28, the lowest since August
2010.  Current  price levels  mean many companies “will have to lay
off workers or close,” Aryee said.  Bauxite production fell to 193,876 metric tons in the
second quarter from 249,114 tons in the first. Diamond output
increased to 40,868.93 carats from 35,988.38 carats, while
manganese production slowed to 323,299 tons from 434,240 tons,
said Aryee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
