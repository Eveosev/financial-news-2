Warren Buffett , who got 10-year
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  warrants as part of a $5 billion
investment in 2011, said he plans to hold them until near their
expiration before converting the contracts to common stock.  “We’ll exercise them probably the last month, which would
be eight years or so from now,” Buffett, 83, told CNBC in an
interview broadcast today. “There’s no reason to exercise them
sooner. There would be if there were a high dividend on the
common or something, so it’s conceivable. But basically we love
the position of being an owner.”  Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
took a $5 billion preferred stake in Bank of America, with an
annual dividend of 6 percent, after the lender’s stock fell more
than 45 percent amid losses on mortgages. The warrants allow
Berkshire to buy 700 million shares of the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank for $7.14 each. The stock closed at $14.61
yesterday and has a  quarterly dividend  of a penny a share.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan ,
53, who joined Buffett in the interview, said he plans on
retiring more expensive capital before exercising an option to
redeem the preferred stake for $5.25 billion.  “We’re trying to get 8 percent, 9 percent instruments
out” of the capital structure first, before dealing with
Buffett’s preferred investment, Moynihan said. “There will be
some day that we’ll talk about this, but that’s far out there.”  Bank of America is the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
