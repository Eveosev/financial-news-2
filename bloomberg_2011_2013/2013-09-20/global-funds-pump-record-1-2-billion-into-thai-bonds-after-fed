Global funds pumped a record 37.1
billion baht ($1.2 billion) into Thai bonds today after the
 Federal Reserve  maintained stimulus that’s buoyed emerging-market assets.  International investors bought more local debt than they
sold for an eighth day and today’s inflow was the biggest in
data going back to March 2010, figures from Thai Bond Market
Association compiled by Bloomberg show. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Sept. 18 that the U.S. central bank is concerned a
rapid tightening will hurt the world’s largest economy.  The Fed announcement will help improve investor sentiment
in Asia with  Thailand ’s local debt and Malaysia’s securities
standing out as “key beneficiaries,” HSBC Holdings Plc
analysts led by  Andre de Silva  wrote in a research note
yesterday. The Bank of Thailand held its benchmark  interest rate 
at 2.5 percent on Aug. 21 as inflation slowed to 1.59 percent
last month, the least since October 2009.  “Thailand bonds remain a key overweight in our Asia-Pacific portfolio,” de Silva wrote in the report. “The Bank of
Thailand also stands out as the only central bank in  Asia  which
sufficient justification to ease monetary policy as growth has
disappointed while inflation has fallen to a four-year low.”  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 fell 37 basis points, or 0.37 percentage point, this week
in the biggest drop since August 2011 to 4.01 percent as of 6
p.m. in Bangkok, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate
declined three basis points today.  The baht rallied 2.9 percent from a week ago to 30.964 per
dollar, the biggest advance since 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s  foreign reserves  climbed to $169.1 billion on
Sept. 13, from $168.9 billion two weeks earlier, central bank
data showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
