Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, reported for
the ninth consecutive month that rolling global retail machine
sales fell, led by declines in the Asia-Pacific region.  Total machine sales reported by dealers fell 10 percent in
the three months through August from a year earlier, which
compares with a 9 percent drop in the quarter through July, the
Peoria, Illinois-based company said today in a filing.
Caterpillar last  reported  global retail machine  sales  growth in
the rolling three-month period ended Nov. 30.  Caterpillar sales are declining as miners scale back
spending amid sluggish commodity demand and slower growth in
markets such as  China . Retail machine sales reported today fell
in every region except  North America , where they increased 1
percent, the first rise since November. The Asia-Pacific region
had the largest losses with a 30 percent decline, according to
the filing.  “North America was a relative bright spot, turning
slightly positive after eight months of declines, but overall
retail sales were disappointing and indicative that the turn is
still being pushed out,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based
analyst for William Blair & Co., said today in a telephone
interview.  Caterpillar fell 1.4 percent to $86.51 at 10:43 a.m. in  New
York . The shares earlier decreased 2.1 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since July 25. The shares have dropped 3.5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
