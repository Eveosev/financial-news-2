BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) , the struggling
Canadian smartphone maker, has hired accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to evaluate the company for potential
buyers, according to two people with knowledge of the move.  A team of accountants and lawyers from the New York-based
firm have been working in BlackBerry’s home town of Waterloo,
Ontario, since August, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the contract hasn’t been made public.  BlackBerry has been working with a growing list of
consultants after embarking on a strategic review last month. It
previously hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP as an adviser --
alongside its bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- to help explore
its options, a person familiar with the decision said earlier
this month. The company also has been cutting jobs and moving
around workers to streamline its operations.  Kiran Chauhan, a spokeswoman for PwC, and Adam Emery, a
spokesman for BlackBerry, declined to comment.  BlackBerry said last month that it was forming a special
committee to evaluate its strategic options, including a
potential sale of the company.  JPMorgan (JPM)  is advising that
committee, which is led by Tim Dattels, a board member who also
serves as a senior partner at private-equity firm TPG Capital.
BlackBerry’s auditor is Ernst & Young LLP.  Seeking Acquirers  Even so, finding a buyer may not be easy. JPMorgan and  RBC
Capital Markets  spent close to a year quietly canvassing
potential acquirers without success, people with knowledge of
the matter said last month.  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , BlackBerry’s largest
shareholder, has been approaching Canadian pension fund managers
to build support for a homegrown bid for the company, according
to a person with knowledge of those discussions.  BlackBerry shares  fell 3.2 percent to $10.18 at 2:21 p.m.
in  New York . The stock had declined 11 percent this year through
yesterday.  Earlier this week, BlackBerry introduced its biggest touch-screen smartphone ever and opened up the company’s instant-messaging service to rival operating systems. BlackBerry also
said it will continue to shake up its workforce with relocations
and job cuts, aiming to reduce costs.  The latest cutbacks follow the elimination of 5,000 jobs
last year, a move designed to trim $1 billion in operating
expenses.  “Organizational moves will continue to occur to ensure we
have the right people in the right roles to drive new
opportunities in mobile computing,” the company said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
