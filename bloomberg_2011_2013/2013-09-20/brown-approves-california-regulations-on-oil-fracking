California Governor Jerry Brown,
preparing the state for development of the largest shale-oil
reserves in the U.S., signed into law regulations for hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, a process that has been criticized by
environmental groups.  The  third-largest  oil-producing state will for the first
time require permits to use the drilling technique, which
injects millions of gallons of chemically treated water
underground to break up rock and free trapped oil and natural
gas. Energy companies will have to disclose the ingredients in
fracking fluid and notify nearby landowners of their plans.  The measure “establishes strong environmental protections
and transparency requirements,” the 75-year-old Democrat said.
Brown also said he will work with the legislature to adopt
clarifying amendments to the measure.  The governor said he will direct the state’s Conservation
Department to develop a permitting program that groups permits
together based on factors such as known geological conditions
and environmental impacts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
