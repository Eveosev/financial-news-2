New York  Life Insurance Co., the
largest U.S. life insurer owned by policyholders, suspended the
chief executive officer at a lending unit over violations of
company policy, said a person with knowledge of the action.  Trevor Clark, CEO of Madison Capital Funding LLC and
Christopher Williams, a senior managing director, were suspended
with pay, according to the person, who asked not to be
identified because the matter is private. They violated policies
related to personal investments and business activities, the
person said.  Madison Capital is a middle-market lender based in  Chicago ,
and was formed by New York Life in 2001. Clark and Williams
helped found the unit, which provides financing to private
equity firms, according to the company’s  website .  New York Life ‘is not in a position to comment at this
time,” William Werfelman, a spokesman for the insurer, said
today.  Attempts to reach Clark and Williams for comment by e-mail
and at the company’s office weren’t immediately successful. The
New York Times reported the suspensions earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
