The ruble dropped from a three-month high after the longest stretch of gains on record and
Russia’s bond yields increased.  The currency depreciated 0.5 percent against the dollar to
31.8080 by 1:35 p.m. in Moscow, trimming the advance this week
to 2.1 percent. The yield on 10-year ruble bonds rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.20 percent, taking this
week’s drop to 23 basis points.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee said Sept. 18 it
wants more evidence of an economic recovery before paring its
stimulus program, sparking a 0.7 percent rally in a group of 20
of the most-traded emerging-market currencies. The index lost
0.4 percent today.  “One day was enough for the market to come to its senses
after the Fed’s unexpected decision to make no changes to its
policy,” Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at ING Groep in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed note.  Russia’s currency dropped 0.5 percent against the euro to
43.0150 today and depreciated by the same amount to 36.8413
against the central bank’s target basket of dollars and euros.
Brent oil, the nation’s main export earner, rose 0.5 percent to
$109.27 per barrel in  London  after a 1.7 percent drop yesterday.  The “rally on all fronts gave way to the consolidation at
achieved levels, and now everything will depend on the
statistics being published,” ING’s Polevoy said.  Russian companies will pay about 1.12 trillion rubles ($35
billion) of tax this month, with the largest payment of 370
billion rubles for mineral extraction levies due Sept. 25,
according to VTB Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
