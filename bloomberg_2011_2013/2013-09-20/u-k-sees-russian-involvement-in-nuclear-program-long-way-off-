U.K. is encouraging  Russia ’s
Rosatom to work with British companies in third countries,
Energy Minister  Michael Fallon  tells reporters.
* “Companies like Rolls-Royce now are forming partnerships with
Rosatom to compete for some of the new projects that are
becoming available in Czech, Hungary, Turkey and elsewhere,”
Fallon says in Vilnius, Lithuania
* To enter U.K. civil nuclear program, Rosatom must “become
familiar with the very high standards of nuclear regulation that
we have in the U.K.,” Fallon tells reporters
* “We’re a long way off from any Russian participation in our
program at the moment:” Fallon
* Nuclear deal with  Electricite de France  “has to be state-aid
compliant, pre-notified on elements of the deal structure, but
obviously the final result will still require agreement from
Brussels:” Fallon
