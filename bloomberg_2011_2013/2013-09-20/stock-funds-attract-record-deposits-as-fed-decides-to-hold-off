Investors worldwide poured a record
amount of money into equity funds over the past week as the
Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained from reducing the $85
billion pace of monthly bond buying.  Stock funds attracted $25.9 billion in the week ended Sept.
18, topping the previous record set in 2007, according to
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks the
flow of money from both institutional and retail investors
globally. U.S. equity funds won almost $17 billion of the total,
EPFR said in an e-mailed statement.  U.S. stocks, as measured by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX) 
Index, rose to a record this week after the Fed on Sept. 18 said
it needs more evidence of lasting improvement in the economy
before reducing its asset purchases. Treasuries and gold also
rallied as Bernanke stressed that the pace of bond buying would
be dependent on economic data, and the Fed has no predetermined
schedule for tapering the purchases that have pushed its balance
sheet to $3.66 trillion.  Bond funds suffered net redemptions for the eighth straight
week, according to EPFR, while money market funds had “modest
inflows,” in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
