Fidelity Investments, the second-biggest mutual fund manager in the U.S., has hired former Bank
of Canada Adviser David Wolf to work with its global asset
allocation division.  The Boston-based company created a new position where Wolf
works with portfolio managers to help with “asset allocation
strategies,” according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg
News.  “His unique perspectives on the global capital markets, as
well as his extensive knowledge of the Canadian marketplace,
will be a strong addition,” Andrew Windmueller, chief
investment officer of multi-asset class strategies for the
division, said in the memo.  Wolf said in a July telephone interview he was leaving the
Ottawa-based central bank to take a job in the private sector
after a cooling-off period, without identifying his new
employer. In his earlier position, he was main editor of the
quarterly  Monetary Policy Report  and worked with the governing
council that sets the Bank of Canada’s benchmark interest rate.  Wolf also worked as head of Canadian economics and chief
strategist with Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch Canada,
and for eight years as an economist and strategist with Royal
Bank of Canada’s capital markets unit.  Fidelity’s global asset division manages $450 billion for
Canadian and U.S. investors according the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
