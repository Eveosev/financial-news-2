The Philippine peso was poised for
its biggest weekly gain since June last year after the current-account surplus widened and the  Federal Reserve  refrained from
cutting stimulus that’s driven capital inflows. Bonds rose.  The balance in the broadest measure of trade climbed to
$2.5 billion last quarter from $2.3 billion in the same period a
year earlier, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Director Rosabel
Guerrero said in a media briefing in  Manila  today. Overseas
investors bought $58.7 million more local shares than they sold
yesterday, the biggest net purchases in five weeks, and taking
the total this month to $198 million, stock exchange data show.  “We’re sitting on a pile of dollars,” said Marc Bautista,
head of research at  Metropolitan Bank & Trust (MBT)  Co. in Manila.
“Money continues to come in because of the latest news from the
Fed, aside from the regular flows from remittances and business
process outsourcing companies. It’s inevitable the peso will
strengthen once again.”  The peso surged 1.9 percent this week to 43.035 per dollar
as of the midday break in Manila, the strongest level since June
18, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show. The currency was little
changed today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 12 basis
points to 6.03 percent today and 69 basis points from a week ago.
That’s the lowest level since Aug. 19.  The Fed’s decision to keep the size of its monthly bond
purchases at $85 billion will spur inflows to  emerging markets ,
Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said at the same briefing.  The yield on Philippines 8 percent bonds due July 2031 fell
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.72 percent in
Manila this week, according to Tradition Financial Services. It
rose two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
