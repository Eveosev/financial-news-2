European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said indicators measuring
confidence among households and businesses are signaling the
worst may be over for the economy of the euro area.  “There are soft signs of the economy improving,”
Liikanen, who also heads the Bank of Finland, said today in an
 interview  on Helsinki-based television broadcaster MTV3. “The
recovery is fragile and uncertain. The ECB supports growth with
accommodative monetary policy.”  The Frankfurt-based bank has kept its  benchmark interest
rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent since May to buoy the 17-nation economy after pledging in July last year to do “whatever
it takes” to protect the single currency. The unprecedented
phase of monetary easing paid off as the euro-area exited its
longest recession in the second quarter.  “The ECB’s task is to safeguard  price stability ,”
Liikanen says. “When price stability is secure, we can use
monetary policy tools to support economic growth and employment.
We have said interest rates will stay at the current or lower
level for a longer period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
