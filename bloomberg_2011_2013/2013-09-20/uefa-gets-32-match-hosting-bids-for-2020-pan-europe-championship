Germany , Greece,  Azerbaijan ,
 England  and  Israel  are among 32 nations bidding to host soccer
matches at the 2020 UEFA European Championship.  The 16th edition of the quadrennial competition will be
held in 13 cities across the continent, a first for the
tournament. The championship, which began in 1960, is
traditionally hosted either by a single nation or, on three
occasions, two neighboring countries.  “We are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the
bidding process, with more than half of our member associations
willing to host matches,” UEFA President  Michel Platini  said in
a  statement  on the organization’s website.  Candidates were permitted to submit two bids -- one for the
right to host three group games and one round of 16 or
quarterfinal match, and a separate bid to host the semifinals
and final, to be played at the same stadium. The bidding nations
have the right to change their proposed host city, or cities,
until next April.  UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, will decide which
13 cities will host the 60th anniversary, pan-European
tournament on Sept. 25 next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
