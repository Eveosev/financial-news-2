GateHouse Media Inc. (GHSE) , the community
newspaper publisher overseen by the co-chairman of Fortress
Investment Group LLC, said it will seek votes today on a plan to
reorganize in bankruptcy.  GateHouse, based in Fairport, New York, has proposed a
prepackaged plan that will allow it to enter Chapter 11
bankruptcy with creditor support if more than 67 percent of debt
holders accept, the company said in a regulatory filing today.  The publisher has said it plans to file for bankruptcy as
part of a move to merge its media assets with those recently
bought by  Newcastle Investment Corp. (NCT)  The reorganization, which
has support from most creditors, hinges on the combination of
GateHouse with assets of Dow Jones Local Media Group, which
Newcastle bought from  News Corp . in this month for $87 million.  “GateHouse believes that it will be a viable long-term
provider of print, online and other digital products, including
mobile applications, after the completion of the Chapter 11
restructuring,” the company said in today’s filing. It set a
deadline for voting of 5 p.m. New York time on Sept. 26.  GateHouse’s 78 daily newspapers serve 10 million people in
21 states, according to the company’s  website . It also owns 91
advertising-only “shoppers,” 235 weeklies, 350 locally focused
websites and six yellow-page directories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
