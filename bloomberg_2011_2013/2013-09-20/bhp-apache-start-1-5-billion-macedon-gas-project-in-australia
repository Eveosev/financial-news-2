BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s
largest oil producer, started its $1.5 billion Macedon natural
gas project, according to partner  Apache Corp. (APA)   The development, Western Australia’s fourth domestic gas
hub, began operating last month and has production capacity of
200 terajoules a day, Houston-based Apache said in an e-mailed
statement. Melbourne-based BHP owns 71.4 percent of Macedon,
while Apache owns the rest.  Western Australia faces a gas shortage, with prices
tripling since 2005, according to the state’s DomGas Alliance,
which represents state users such as  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)   Apache plans to invest about $1.9 billion in Australia this
year, including the Coniston and Balnaves oil projects and the
Julimar development, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
