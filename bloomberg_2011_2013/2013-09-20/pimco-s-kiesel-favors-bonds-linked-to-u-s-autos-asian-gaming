Pacific Investment Management Co.
is favoring bonds of companies linked to the U.S. automobile
industry and Asian gaming market amid subdued global economic
growth.  Significant pent-up demand for cars in the U.S. and
infrastructure investments made by the Chinese government to
improve access to Macau, the only place in China where casino
gambling is legal, make those industries attractive, according
to  Mark Kiesel , Pimco’s global head of corporate bonds. The
world’s largest bond fund manager targets companies whose credit
grades may be upgraded by ratings companies, he said.  “In the U.S., we continue to favor a group of auto and
auto finance companies with improving fundamentals,” Kiesel
wrote in a report on the  Newport Beach , California-based
company’s website. “Macau offers investors an attractive way to
invest in the growth of the Chinese consumer.”  Signs of a modest recovery in Europe mean a few auto and
auto-parts companies “are well positioned to benefit from an
improvement in profitability and free  cash flow  as the European
auto cycle turns,” Kiesel wrote.  Kiesel also sees potential gains in corporate bonds in the
U.S. energy, chemical and housing industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
