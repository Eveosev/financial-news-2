Canola fell to the lowest in more
than five weeks on signs that farmers will harvest a record crop
in  Canada , the world’s largest grower.  Production will climb to 14.78 million metric tons in the
12 months that started Aug. 1, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
said in a Sept. 18 report. That’s up from last month’s forecast
of 14.6 million tons and will exceed  record  output reached in
2011. About 52 percent of the crop has been harvested in
 Saskatchewan , the top grower, according to a provincial report.  “It’s a large crop,” Errol Anderson, the president of
ProMarket Wire, said in a telephone interview from Calgary.
“This is pure old harvest pressure.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.2 percent to
C$485.50 ($472) a ton at 12:12 p.m. on ICE Futures Exchange in
Winnipeg, after earlier touching C$485.10, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 12. The oilseed declined 17
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
