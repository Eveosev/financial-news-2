News Corp. (NWSA) , the publishing company
that owns the Wall Street Journal, reported $506 million in net
income for the year ended June 30, when Chairman  Rupert Murdoch 
split the operation from his entertainment business.  The profit, which amounted to 87 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $2.08 billion, or $3.58, the previous fiscal
year, the New York-based company said in a  regulatory filing 
yesterday. Revenue climbed 2.7 percent to $8.89 billion.  Murdoch is narrowing News Corp.’s focus to larger
publications, including the Journal, the  New York  Post and the
U.K.’s Times. When the company broke off from 21st Century Fox
Inc., it started with $2.6 billion in cash and zero debt.  The publisher also said it will pay a dividend at some
point in the future, without specifying the date or the amount.  “Payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall
within the discretion of its board of directors,”  News Corp .
said in the filing.  News Corp. shares were little changed in extended trading
after the filing yesterday. The Class A shares fell 1.4 percent
to $16.64 at the close in New York and have gained 5.3 percent
since they began trading separately from 21st Century Fox in
June.  The loss in the prior year resulted from a non-cash charge
of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of the 12 months ended
June 2012, principally related to its Australian newspaper
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
