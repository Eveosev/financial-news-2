President Esther George, who has consistently dissented against
additional stimulus, said the central bank missed an opportunity
to begin reducing bond purchases because markets were primed for
such a move.  “Costly steps had been taken to begin to prepare markets
for an adjustment in the pace of asset purchases,” George said
today in a  New York  speech to the Shadow Open Market Committee,
a group of economists that critiques Fed policy. “This week’s
decision by the Fed to taper expectations and not bond buying
surprised many, disappointed some like me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
