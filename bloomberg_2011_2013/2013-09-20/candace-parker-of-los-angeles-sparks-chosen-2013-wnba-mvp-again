Los Angeles Sparks forward Candace
Parker was selected as the 2013 WNBA Most Valuable Player, the
second time she has won the award during her six-year women’s
professional basketball career.  The 27-year-old Parker received 234 points, including 10
first-place votes, from a national panel of 39 sports writers
and broadcasters, the WNBA said last night.  Parker was the first player in WNBA history to earn both
MVP and Rookie of the Year honors in the same season in 2008.  This season, Parker helped the Sparks earn a 24-10 record,
tied for the second-best mark in the league, and the Western
Conference’s No. 2 playoff seed. She scored at least 20 points
13 times, including a season-best 30 points in a 94-78 win
against Tulsa on July 11.  Minnesota Lynx forward Maya Moore finished second in the
voting with 218 points and Chicago Sky rookie forward/guard
Elena Delle Donne was third with 189 points, followed by Sky
center Sylvia Fowles with 109 points and Atlanta Dream
forward/guard Angel McCoughtry with 90 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
