Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s 7.7 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) purchase of  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8) 
won European Union antitrust approval allowing the carrier to
expand its Internet and television customer-base.  The deal doesn’t raise competition concerns because “the
activities of the merging parties were mainly complementary,”
the European Commission said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  While Kabel Deutschland primarily offers cable TV, fixed
line telephony and Internet access services, Vodafone’s main
business consists of mobile telephony services, the Brussels-based commission said.  The transaction will give Vodafone access to 8.5 million
households in Germany, Europe’s largest telecommunications
market, and bolster its capacity to sell combined wireless,
fixed-line Internet and television services. It would also
intensify competition with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , the country’s
former phone monopoly, on whose network Vodafone has so far
relied for wireline services.  Germany is Vodafone’s biggest market, accounting for about
18 percent of annual sales, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The company is based in Newbury, England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
