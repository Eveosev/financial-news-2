JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , the only
Chinese solar manufacturer that posted a  profit  in the second
quarter, gained the most in more than two weeks after raising
$61.75 million in its third  offering  of American depositary
receipts.  JinkoSolar’s ADRs gained 14 percent to $18.71 at 10:53 a.m.
in New York after rising as much as 15 percent, the most
intraday since Sept. 3. The Shangrao, China-based company’s ADRs
are each worth four ordinary shares.  The company sold 3.8 million ADRs for $16.25 each,
according to a statement yesterday. Underwriters have a 30-day
option to purchase as many as 570,000 additional ADRs.  JinkoSolar reported second-quarter net income of 49 million
 yuan  ($8 million) Aug. 14, its first profit since 2011. It was
the only profitable Chinese manufacturer in the 15-member
Bloomberg Industries Large Solar Index in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
