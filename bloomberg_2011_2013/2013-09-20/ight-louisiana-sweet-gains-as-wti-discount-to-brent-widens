Light Louisiana Sweet and other
Gulf Coast oils gained against West Texas Intermediate as the
U.S. benchmark lost ground to Brent.  WTI’s discount to its European counterpart widened by $1.50
cents to $4.40 a barrel at 2:58 p.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. When WTI weakens versus Brent, which
is used to price foreign crudes, it can raise the value of
domestic oils competing for space in Gulf Coast refineries.  LLS gained 35 cents a barrel to a premium of $1.20 against
WTI at 1:53 p.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened 35 cents a barrel to a
premium of $1.45. The discount for  Thunder Horse  narrowed 30
cents to $1.90 a barrel, while Mars Blend’s discount narrowed 35
cents to $4.30.  Poseidon rose 25 cents to a discount of $5.15 a barrel to
the domestic benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
