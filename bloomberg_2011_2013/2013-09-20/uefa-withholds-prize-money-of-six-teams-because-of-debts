European soccer ruling body UEFA 
temporarily withheld the prize money of six clubs for failing to
comply with so-called financial fair play rules.  The six --  Romania ’s Astra Ploiesti, Ukraine’s Metalurh
Donetsk, Croatia’s Hajduk Split, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
Zrinjski, Skonto of Latvia and  Turkey ’s Trabzonspor -- were
found to owe money to other clubs, employees or tax authorities,
UEFA said today in an e-mailed statement.  The six have competed in  Europa League  qualifying this
season or progressed to the group stage.  The prize money will be withheld until the clubs pay the
debts, UEFA said. The governing body said it requested 25 other
teams, which it didn’t identify, to submit more information
about their financial situation.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
