Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL)  fell the most
in more than two years after the maker of aircraft electronics
forecast profit and sales that trailed analysts’ estimates as
U.S. military spending shrinks.  The stock slid 6.6 percent to $69.40 at 12:50 p.m. in  New
York , after the company said the cuts would crimp results for
the period ending Sept. 30, 2014. Earlier the shares fell as
much as 6.9 percent for the biggest intraday decline since
August 2011.  Rockwell, which provides avionics, communication and
navigation products to the U.S. Department of Defense, state and
local governments, said that sequestration, or the automatic
budget cuts triggered Oct. 1, will weigh on earnings for the
period. The  Cedar Rapids , Iowa-based  Rockwell Collins  expects
2014 to be “the bottom for this defense cycle,” Chief
Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in a statement.  Earnings per share will be in a range of $4.30 to $4.50 in
fiscal 2014, while revenue will be $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion,
Rockwell Collins said in the statement. Analysts had estimated
profit of $4.84 on sales of $4.93 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rockwell Collins stock had jumped 28 percent this year
through yesterday. Trading  volume  today was about twice the 12-month daily average.  The company forecast annual commercial-systems revenue to
increase by “mid-single digits,” driven by production of
Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, or as much as 7 percent,  Howard Rubel ,
an aerospace analyst with Jefferies LLC, said in a note. He
rates the shares hold.  The forecast excluded the company’s $1.39 billion takeover
of Arinc Inc., which provides air-to-ground communications and
will be its biggest acquisition when it closes later this year.  “Exposure to aerospace growth should be boosted by the
soon-to-close Arinc deal,” Robert Stallard, a New York-based
aerospace analyst with  RBC Capital Markets , wrote in a note to
clients. He recommends buying the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
