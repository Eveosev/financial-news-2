Japan ’s  Topix index  rose, climbing
to its highest in eight weeks and capping a three-week gain, as
exporters advanced after the yen weakened overnight.  Toyota Motor Corp., which gets about 75 percent of sales
overseas, increased 1.3 percent as carmakers were the biggest
contributors to the gauge’s rise.  Shiseido (4911)  Co. jumped 5.8
percent after Citigroup Inc. recommended the cosmetics company’s
shares. Open House Co. surged 26 percent as the provider of
real-estate services made its debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., Japan’s second-biggest shipping line,
dropped 3.2 percent as the sector slid the most among the
Topix’s 33 groups.  The Topix added 0.3 percent to 1,218.98 at the close in
Tokyo, completing a 2.8 percent advance for the week ahead of a
three-day weekend. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid 0.2 percent
to 14,742.42 after rising as much as 0.3 percent. Investors also
awaited  Germany ’s general election on Sept. 22.  “The yen’s drop yesterday is a plus for stocks, of course,
but investors want to square positions ahead of a long weekend
and the German polls,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s
second-largest brokerage. “The market is due a correction after
rising fast over the past few days.”  The  Topix (TPX)  advanced 10 percent over the past three weeks and
is within 4.5 percent of its May 22 high. The gauge is up 42
percent this year, making Japanese equities the best performers
among developed markets as the Bank of Japan’s monetary easing
helped weaken the yen, supporting exporters.  Japan’s currency slid 1.5 percent against the dollar
yesterday before paring losses and trading at 99.36 today. A
weaker yen boosts the value of overseas earnings at exporters.  Exporters Rise  Toyota climbed 1.3 percent to 6,480 yen. Nikon Corp., a
camera maker that generates 26 percent of sales in Europe,
soared 6.4 percent to 1,809 yen, the most on the Nikkei 225, as
the yen traded near a four-year low against the euro.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The measure lost 0.2 percent yesterday after rallying to
a record on Sept. 18 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly
refrained from reducing stimulus.  Investors are watching German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
bid for re-election on Sept. 22. Merkel has campaigned on her
leadership through the regional debt crisis and a reduction in
unemployment to a record low. Should her Christian Democratic-led bloc fall short of a majority with its Free Democrat
coalition partner, she may be forced into a so-called grand
coalition with the opposition Social Democrats.  Among other stocks that rose, Shiseido gained 5.8 percent
to 1,725 yen, its highest since January 2011, after its rating
was raised to buy at Citigroup. The company’s shares jumped 8.8
percent this week.  Trading Debut  Open House surged 26 percent from its initial public
offering price to 2,245 yen on its first trading day on the TSE
first section. The company, founded in 1997, sells houses and
apartments in Tokyo and neighboring Kanagawa.  The Nikkei’s 14-day  relative strength index , a measure of
trading momentum, was at 66 today, near the 70 threshold that
some traders say portends a selloff.  “Technically speaking, the market has been overbought.
Selling pressure is high with the Nikkei around 15,000,” said
Kazuyuki Terao, the Tokyo-based chief investment officer of
Allianz Global Investors Japan Co.  Shipping Lines  Mitsui O.S.K. (9104)  fell 3.2 percent to lead declines on the
Nikkei 225 after surging 7.3 percent in the past two days. Its
RSI fell to 62.5 after rising to 70.4 yesterday. Nippon Yusen
K.K., Japan’s biggest shipper, lost 1.6 percent to 316 yen.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. slipped 2.3 percent to 514 yen.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on a visit to the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant yesterday, urged the company to decommission the
site’s two remaining reactors. The utility stated it would need
to raise another 1 trillion yen to do so and would make a
decision by the end of the year, Abe said.  The Topix  traded  at 1.27 times book value today, compared
with 2.53 for the S&P 500 and 1.77 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day  historic
volatility  was at 19.80 today, compared with its five-year
median of 19.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
