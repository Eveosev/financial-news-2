Clive Capital LLP, the $1 billion
commodity hedge-fund firm founded by  Chris Levett , plans to
close after posting more than two years of investment losses,
according to a letter to clients.  Clive told investors today the London-based hedge fund will
shut down at the end of the month, according to the letter,
which was obtained by  Bloomberg News . The Clive Fund’s Class A
shares fell 9.1 percent this year through Sept. 18 after
declining 8.8 percent in 2012 and about 10 percent in 2011.  Levett, 43, started Clive in 2007 after leaving Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital Management LLC. Clive is among money
managers who have been hurt since the start of 2011 after price
swings in markets from oil to wheat whipsawed traders, prompting
losses and clients to pull investments.  “We perceive there to be limited, suitable opportunities
at this point in the economic-demand and the commodity-supply
cycles,” Clive wrote in the letter. “It is also unclear as to
when a heightened opportunity environment will return in
commodities.”  The commodity hedge fund ended 2012 with $1.95 billion
under management, a 46 percent drop from the year earlier. The
firm cut fees for its Class B shares after the redemptions to
bring them in line with the industry standard of charging a 2
percent management fee and a 20 percent performance fee. Clive,
which managed as much as $5.1 billion in May 2011, previously
charged clients a 2.5 percent fee to oversee assets and 25
percent of any investment gains.  BlueGold Capital  Some of the biggest commodity hedge funds have closed since
the start of last year. BlueGold Capital Management LLP, the $1
billion energy fund co-founded by  Pierre Andurand , liquidated in
April 2012 after losing 34 percent in 2011, and New York-based
 Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  shut a $500 million commodities
fund after it lost almost 13 percent in four months. Andurand,
36, started a new commodity fund this year.  Assets managed by commodity hedge funds have fallen 5
percent since the end of 2012 to $75 billion, according to
Atlanta-based data provider Evestment.  Client Funds  Clive’s Class A shares surged 44 percent in 2008, 17
percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2010, according to investors.
Class B shares, which started later, rose 16 percent in 2008, 16
percent in 2009 and 18 percent in 2010. Clive has produced an
average annual return of about 9 percent since it started
trading in December 2007, according to the client letter,
beating the 1.7 percent yearly gain of the Newedge Commodity
Trading Index.  Clive told investors that 98 percent of their capital will
be returned next month and the remainder once a final audit has
been conducted, according to the letter.  Elizabeth Holstein, who heads  investor relations  at Clive,
confirmed the firm sent the letter to clients. She declined to
comment further.  Before joining New York-based Moore Capital, Levett worked
at trading firm Commodities Corp. He started his commodities
career in 1992 at  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , where he
traded oil. Levett is worth an estimated 250 million pounds
($400 million),  London ’s Sunday Times reported in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
