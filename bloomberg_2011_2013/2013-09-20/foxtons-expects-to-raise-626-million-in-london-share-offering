Foxtons Group Plc, a real estate
broker based in  London , said it expects to raise 390 million
pounds ($626 million) in an initial public offering today.  The sale of 169.4 million shares at 230 pence each will
give Foxtons a market value of 649 million pounds, the company
said in a statement today. The sale includes a primary offering
of 55 million pounds and 335 million pounds of secondary sales
by shareholders, directors and employees.  Foxtons is benefiting from London’s booming housing market,
where the average price of a home climbed 9.7 percent during the
year to July, according to the U.K’s  Office for National
Statistics . The broker has 40 of its 42 branches in London and
sells homes mostly at prices from 200,000 pounds to 1.4 million
pounds, the company said on Aug. 27.  Foxtons shares begin conditional trading on the London
Stock Exchange today.  BC Partners  bought the company, founded by
Jon Hunt in 1981, for about 390 million pounds in May 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
