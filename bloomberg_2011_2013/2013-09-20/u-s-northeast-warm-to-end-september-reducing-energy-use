The U.S. Northeast may end
September with temperatures about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6
Celsius) above normal, which will probably cut energy demand,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Warmer weather will reach the northern Great Plains and
eastern New York and New England from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, Rogers
said in a forecast today. Higher temperatures are also expected
in most of  Canada  and  Southern California , while much of the
rest of the U.S. will be seasonal.  “Sept. 26-27 is the national crossing point where heating
demand outweighs cooling, so warmer changes are now bearish
versus bullish,” Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a
e-mail interview.  Energy traders watch temperature fluctuations to gauge how
much natural gas, oil and coal will be needed for heating homes
and businesses. When daily averages fall below 65 degrees there
is usually a boost in demand for the day.  MDA Weather Services predicts a wider spread of warmer-than-normal temperatures for the same time frame. Readings may
rise 2 to 3 degrees above average as far south as Texas and the
Midwest may be 5 degrees above normal, MDA said.  The daily average temperature in New York on Sept. 29 is
about 64 degrees, according to MDA, in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
