Ibovespa  futures  fell as
commodities retreated, dimming the outlook for Brazilian raw-material producers.  Power utility Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA may move as
Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating one level to
speculative grade because of lower electricity rates and
operational cash flow. Former billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
logistics company  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)  may be active after renewing
a bridge loan of 518 million reais ($234 million) with Brazil’s
development bank, known as BNDES.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October dropped 0.6
percent to 54,420 at 9:19 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.7 percent to 2.2182 per U.S. dollar. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24 raw materials declined 0.4 percent. Commodity
producers account for 39 percent of the Ibovespa’s weighting.  The Ibovespa entered a  bull market  on Sept. 9 after rising
20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 16 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 3.3 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.8 billion reais
yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.75 billion reais
this year through the same day, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
