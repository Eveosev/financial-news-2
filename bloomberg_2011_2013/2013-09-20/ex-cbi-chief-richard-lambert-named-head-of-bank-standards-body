Britain’s biggest banks have named
 Richard Lambert , former head of the Confederation of British
Industry, to run a group to oversee industry standards.  Lambert, 68, has been asked to design an independent body
for banking standards, which won’t lobby on the industry’s
behalf, the chairmen said in a joint statement. The banks
include  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Santander U.K. Plc and
Standard Chartered Plc.  The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, assigned
by the government to investigate industry failures, recommended
in a June report that the banks create an independent body to
maintain standards. Banks have been hit by scandals including
the rigging of benchmark interest rates, the improper selling of
loan insurance as well as  money laundering .  “The new professional body will be independent of the
banks, and will cover all sectors of the industry,” Lambert
said in the statement. “I hope it will be supported by all
banks and building societies doing business in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
