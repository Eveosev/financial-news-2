LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the port operator
 Eike Batista  ceded control of last month, rose for a third week
as the company renewed a 518 million-real ($235 million) bridge
loan with Brazil’s state development bank.  The  shares  gained 0.5 percent to 1.92 reais at 12:42 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, pushing this week’s advance to 14 percent. The
stock has more than doubled in the past two months.  LLX’s unit LLX Acu Operacoes Portuarias SA said yesterday
that it extended the maturity of the loan for three more years.
Batista, once worth $34.5 billion, agreed to relinquish control
of LLX to private-equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners LLC
last month as the former billionaire tries to raise cash amid
missed targets and ballooning debt at companies he founded
including OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
