The pound was set for a third
weekly advance versus the dollar after a government report
showed the U.K.’s budget deficit narrowed in August.  Sterling was 0.8 percent from the strongest level in eight
months against the U.S. currency after the  Federal Reserve  this
week unexpectedly refrained from slowing the pace of bond-buying
under its quantitative-easing program that tends to debase the
currency. The currency headed for its first weekly loss in a
month against the euro before a report economists said will show
 consumer confidence  improved in the 17-nation currency bloc.
U.K. gilts were little changed.  “We can extend higher in sterling in this broad risk-positive environment,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European
currency strategy at Morgan Stanley in  London . “However, I
would be a bit cautious in the near-term as the move has gone
quite a long way. It could be due for a bit of a correction.”  The pound was little changed at $1.6033 as of 10:58 a.m.
London time after climbing to $1.6163 on Sept. 18, the highest
level since Jan. 11. It has gained 1 percent this week. The U.K.
currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 84.35 pence per euro after
reaching 83.53 pence on Sept. 18, the strongest since Jan. 17.
Sterling has weakened 0.7 percent against the shared currency
this week.  The U.K.’s  net borrowing  excluding temporary support for
banks was 13.2 billion pounds last month compared with 14.4
billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today. The median estimate of 19 analysts in a
Bloomberg News  survey  was for a deficit of 13.3 billion pounds.  Recovery Evidence  Sterling has risen 5.8 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 4
percent and the dollar weakened 1 percent.  U.S. policy makers said this week they want more evidence
of a recovery before paring their $85 billion-a-month
quantitative-easing program. Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke said the
central bank must determine its policies based on “what’s
needed for the economy,” even if it surprises markets.  Bank of England  minutes published on Sept. 18 showed its
nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to keep
its bond-purchase stimulus program at 375 billion pounds and the
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  An index of household confidence in the euro area climbed
to minus 14.5 in September, the most since July 2011, from minus
15.6 in August, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts
before today’s European Commission report.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield was at 2.90 percent. The
price of the 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 was
94.40.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 2.3 percent and Treasuries fell 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
