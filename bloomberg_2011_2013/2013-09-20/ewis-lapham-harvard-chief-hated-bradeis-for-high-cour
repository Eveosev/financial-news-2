When presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson wanted an expert adviser on trusts, he summoned attorney
Louis Brandeis from  Boston . At 20, he’d graduated from  Harvard
Law School  as class valedictorian and in his practice had gained
a reputation for legal brilliance.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  With the advice of Brandeis, Wilson’s platform came to
include positions against monopolistic trusts and unfair
business practices: We “will look after the men who are on the
make rather than the men who are already made.”  President Wilson later nominated Brandeis to the Supreme
Court, where he would be the first Jew. It ignited a firestorm:
The lawyer was denounced by the establishment for his radical
ideas, his Zionism, his character and temperament.  Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, who was about to
recommend a quota on Jewish students, gathered more than 50
signatures on a petition opposing the appointment.  After a bitter four-month process, on June 1, 1916, the
Senate voted 47-22 to confirm Brandeis as the 67th Supreme Court
Justice.  I spoke with A. Scott Berg, author of “Wilson,” on the
following topics:  1. Scholar-President.  2. Public Intellectual.  3. Passionate Lover.  4. Idealist Warrior.  5. Tragic Hero.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
