Connecticut  utilities agreed to buy
270 megawatts of solar and wind energy as the state seeks to
acquire at least one-fifth of its power from renewable sources
by 2020.  Northeast Utilities (NU) ’ Connecticut Light & Power and United
Illuminating Co. agreed to buy electricity under long-term
contracts from the 20-megawatt Fusion Solar Center in eastern
Connecticut and the 250-megawatt Number Nine Wind Farm in  Maine ,
according to a statement today. Terms of the deals weren’t
disclosed.  The average cost of electricity from the two projects will
be less than 8 cents a kilowatt hour, according to the
statement. The two projects are expected to go into operation by
the end of 2016.  The 270 megawatts are about 3.5 percent of Connecticut’s
total energy load, according to the statement. The Public
Utilities Regulatory Authority has 30 days to approve the
agreements.  “These projects bring real benefits -- cleaner power with
no air emissions and improved reliability by diversifying our
energy portfolio -- all at a cost comparable to electricity
generated from conventional power plants,” Governor Dannel Malloy said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
