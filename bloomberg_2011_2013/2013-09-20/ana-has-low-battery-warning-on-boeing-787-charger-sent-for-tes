ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , the biggest
operator of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s, said one of its Dreamliner planes
had a low-battery warning this week for the first time.  The warning on Sept. 17 quickly disappeared and the plane
was able to take off from Beijing airport and land at  Tokyo ’s
Narita without any problems, Megumi Tezuka, a spokeswoman at
ANA, said by telephone from Tokyo today.  The carrier is sending the battery charger to the
manufacturer for checks, after replacing the battery and finding
no problems during a visual inspection, said Tezuka.  Boeing 787s were grounded worldwide earlier this year after
batteries made by  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  melted on two planes. Tokyo-based ANA, which has called the 787 an “indispensable
aircraft” for the group’s future plans, restarted commercial
flights on the Dreamliner in June.  The grounding of the jet pared ANA’s sales by 8 billion yen
($81 million) in the quarter ended June. Japan Airlines Co., the
world’s second-largest operator of 787s, said the grounding of
its Dreamliner fleet cut sales by 4.8 billion yen in the same
period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
