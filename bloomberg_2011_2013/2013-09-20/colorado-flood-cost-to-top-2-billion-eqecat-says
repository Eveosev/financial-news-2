Flooding and mudslides in  Colorado 
this month caused more than $2 billion in economic losses, most
of it uninsured, according to catastrophe risk modeler Eqecat.  The estimate includes damage to homes and roads, lodging
expenses for displaced people and the cost of restoring
services, Eqecat said in a  statement  yesterday. About 1,500
homes were destroyed, and replacing them will cost $300 million,
or $200,000 each, Eqecat said. Losses were estimated at $350
million in houses that were flooded without being destroyed.  Record rainfall affected counties from Denver to the
Wyoming border, damaging 17,500 homes, according to the modeler.
Most of the property is outside zones covered by the National
Flood Insurance Program, Eqecat said. Basic homeowners insurance
excludes such losses.  “Restoring the destruction from this series of events will
take time, further affecting businesses and residents,” Eqecat
said in the statement. “Hundreds of miles of roads have been
flooded. Many bridges and at least four dams have been damaged
or destroyed.”  The cost in Colorado compares with as much as $50 billion
last year from Superstorm Sandy, which struck states including
 New York  and  New Jersey . Rainfall in Boulder, Colorado, exceeded
17 inches (43 centimeters) this month, according to the  National
Weather Service . That compares will less than 3 inches for
September in each of the past five years, Jim Kalina, a
meteorologist for the service in Boulder, said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
