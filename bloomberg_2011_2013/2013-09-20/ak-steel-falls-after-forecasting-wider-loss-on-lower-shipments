AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) , a U.S.
producer of the metal, fell the most in 10 months after
forecasting a wider-than-expected third quarter loss as an
equipment outage reduced shipments.  AK Steel dropped 13 percent to $3.88 at 9:33 a.m. in  New
York , the most since Nov. 13. The shares have slumped 14 percent
this year.  The company will lose 22 cents to 27 cents a share this
quarter, the  West Chester , Ohio-based company said in a
statement after markets closed yesterday. That is a wider loss
than the 16-cent loss estimated by Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., he said in a note yesterday.  “Downside to expectations appears to be driven by pricing
with the company unable to fully take advantage of rising spot
prices because of a previously disclosed furnace outage at
Middletown,” Yu said in the note.  This quarter’s shipments may fall as much as 9 percent to
1.2 million tons from 1.4 million a  year earlier , according to
 AK Steel .  On June 22, the company took its blast furnace at
Middletown, Ohio, offline after a mechanical failure. The
furnace resumed operations on July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
