Energy  rigs  in the U.S. fell by
seven to 1,761 this week, as natural gas rigs decreased for the
first time in three weeks, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Gas  rigs  dropped by 15 to 386, the Houston-based field
services company said on its website.  Oil rigs  jumped by eight
to 1,369. The miscellaneous rig count was unchanged at six.  The rig count has increased as domestic crude output has
climbed to the most since 1989 as producers use hydraulic
fracturing and horizontal drilling to reach shale deposits. U.S.
reserves have risen the most in two decades, government reports
show. The resurgence in production helped the U.S. meet 87
percent of its energy needs in the first five months of 2013, on
pace to be the highest annual rate since 1986.  U.S. oil output rose to 7.83 million barrels a day last
week, the EIA said Sept. 18. Output has increased 12 percent so
far this year after a 19 percent gain in 2012.  Crude for October delivery fell 83 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $105.56 a barrel at 1:30 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices are down 2.4 percent this week and have
advanced 15 percent in the past year.  Natural gas for October delivery slipped 3.4 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.686 per million British thermal units, up 32
percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 46 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.299 trillion, the EIA, the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical
arm, reported yesterday. Supplies were 5.4 percent below year-earlier levels and 0.5 percent above the five-year average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
