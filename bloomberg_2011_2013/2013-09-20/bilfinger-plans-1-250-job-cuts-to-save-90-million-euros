Bilfinger SE (GBF) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest builder, plans to cut 1,250 office jobs over the next
two years by merging units in an effort to reduce annual costs
by at least 90 million euros ($122 million).  Thomas Toepfer, who leads the industrial-services and
concessions unit that’s being broken up and partly sold, will
leave at the end of October following disagreements on how the
business should be run, the Mannheim-based company said in a
 statement . He will be replaced by 57-year-old Pieter Koolen.  “Our strength lies in the diversity of our service range
and in efficient cooperation among our operational units,”
Chief Executive Officer  Roland Koch  said in a separate  statement 
outlining corporate strategy and workforce reductions. “We will
ensure that our combined expertise is geared toward the creation
of greater value added for our clients.”  Koch has been transforming Bilfinger from a construction
company into a services provider and is targeting 45 percent
growth in net income to about 400 million euros in 2016 from 275
million euros in 2012. In addition to revenue from the planned
sale of the concessions business, the former politician has 850
million euros available to fund acquisitions to reach the goal.
Part of the plan is to reduce exposure to higher-risk, lower-margin construction projects.  Bilfinger  fell  as much as 0.8 percent to 76.64 euros and
was trading down 0.6 percent at 10:24 a.m. in  Frankfurt . That
pared the stock’s gain this year to 5.2 percent, valuing the
construction company at 3.53 billion euros.  The company plans to eliminate so-called subgroups to
centralize administrative functions into 14 divisions, it said.
The reorganization will generate personnel-cost savings of 80
million euros to 90 million euros, plus additional spending cuts
in a “double-digit million range,” as of 2015. Bilfinger has
70,000 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
