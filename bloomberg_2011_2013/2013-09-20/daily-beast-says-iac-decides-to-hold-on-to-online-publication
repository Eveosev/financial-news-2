IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI)  has ruled out a
sale or shutdown of the  Daily Beast  even after its split with
 Newsweek  and founding editor Tina Brown’s departure, the online
publication said.  IAC has approved the website’s operating budget for 2014
“in concept,” Rhona Murphy, interim chief executive officer of
the Daily Beast, said today in a memo to staff, according to a
statement posted online. The site will be redesigned to keep
traffic growing, the company said.  The future of the Daily Beast, founded in 2008 by Brown and
IAC Chairman  Barry Diller , was thrown into doubt earlier this
month when she announced she’d leave to start a new venture
focusing on conferences. IAC acquired a stake in Newsweek in
2010 and combined it with the Daily Beast online, only to sell
it last month after struggling to make it profitable.  “If you removed the failed experiment to revive Newsweek,
the story of The Daily Beast is one of excellence in reporting,
in design, and in digital distribution,” Diller said in the
statement.  While the company hadn’t made any formal moves to offer the
website for sale, Brown had explored the idea with Diller before
announcing her departure, people familiar with the
matter have said.  The Daily Beast averages more than 15 million unique
visitors a month, with traffic up 22 percent this year, the
company said, citing figures from  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) ’s Omniture
unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
