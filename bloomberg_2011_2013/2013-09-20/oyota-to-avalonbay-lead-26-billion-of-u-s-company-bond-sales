Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  AvalonBay
Communities Inc. (AVB)  led bond sales in the U.S. of at least $27
billion this week, the slowest pace this month, as relative
yields narrowed.  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, raised $350 million
and Arlington, Virginia-based AvalonBay sold $400 million of
seven-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
fell from $90.6 billion last week, when Verizon Communications
Inc. issued a record $49 billion in an eight-part offering, and
compares with a 2013 average of $29.7 billion.  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 217 basis points
as of yesterday from 221 basis points on Sept. 13, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield
Index. Yields decreased to 4.1 percent from 4.28 percent.  Toyota’s U.S. finance unit, Toyota Motor Credit, issued
two-year, floating-rate notes to yield 15 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data
show. The offering, expected to be rated Aa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service, was increased from an initial $300 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  AvalonBay Offering  AvalonBay, the second-largest U.S. apartment real estate
investment trust by market value, issued 3.625 percent debt to
yield 140 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. The offering, its first sale this year,
traded yesterday at 101.2 cents on the dollar to yield 3.42
percent, up 1.5 cents from the sale price of 99.7 cents,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Equity Residential (EQR)  is
the largest apartment REIT by market value.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $20.1
billion, compared with $73.2 billion last week, while offerings
of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $7.5 billion,
compared with $17.4 billion in the prior period, Bloomberg data
show.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
