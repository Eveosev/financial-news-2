LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , owner of the
world’s most popular professional-networking website, was sued
by customers who claim the company appropriated their identities
for marketing purposes by hacking into their external e-mail
accounts and downloading contacts’ addresses.  The customers, who aim to lead a group suit against
LinkedIn, asked a federal judge in San Jose,  California , to bar
the company from repeating the alleged violations and to force
it to return any revenue stemming from its use of their
identities to promote the site to non-members, according to a
court filing.  “LinkedIn’s own website contains hundreds of complaints
regarding this practice,” they said in the complaint filed
Sept. 17, which also seeks unspecified damages.  LinkedIn claims to have the largest online professional
network with more than 238 million members, including executives
from every Fortune 500 company. Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Weiner  is quoted in the complaint as saying on a second-quarter
earnings call, “This strong membership growth is due in large
part to new growth optimization efforts.”  LinkedIn fell 2.1 percent yesterday in  New York  Stock
Exchange trading to close at $243.90.  Doug Madey, a spokesman for  Mountain View , California-based
LinkedIn, said the lawsuit is without merit and the company will
fight it.  ‘Members First’  “LinkedIn is committed to putting our members first, which
includes being transparent about how we protect and utilize our
members’ data,” he said yesterday in an e-mail.  LinkedIn required the members to provide an external e-mail
address as their username on its site, then used the information
to access their external e-mail accounts when they were left
open, according to the complaint.  “ LinkedIn  pretends to be that user and downloads the e-mail addresses contained anywhere in that account to LinkedIn’s
servers,” they said. “LinkedIn is able to download these
addresses without requesting the password for the external e-mail accounts or obtaining users’ consent.”  In a  post  today on the LinkedIn blog, Blake Lawit, the
company’s senior director of litigation, said the allegation
that LinkedIn breaks into the e-mail accounts of members who
choose to upload their address books to the site is not true.  The company doesn’t access customers’ e-mail accounts
without their permission, he said. Nor does LinkedIn “pretend”
to be a customer to gain access to the user’s e-mail account, he
said.  ‘Never Send’  “We never send messages or invitations to join LinkedIn on
your behalf to anyone unless you have given us permission to do
so,” Lawit wrote.  LinkedIn software engineer Brian Guan described his role on
the company’s website as “devising hack schemes to make lots of
$$$ with Java, Groovy and cunning at Team Money!” according to
the complaint. Java is a programming language and computing
platform released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Groovy is a
another language for the Java platform.  The plaintiffs, who are seeking a  jury trial , provided a
link to the engineer’s post,
 http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianguan , which they said they last
visited Sept. 13.  Guan left the company in May 2012, Shannon Stubo, a
LinkedIn spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.  ‘Viral Growth’  The customers blamed the use of their contacts on
LinkedIn’s strategy, which they quoted from a regulatory filing,
to “pursue initiatives that promote the viral growth of our
member base,” according to the complaint.  In an e-mail to Bloomberg yesterday, Deborah Lagutaris,
whose LinkedIn profile describes her as a tax preparer, real
estate broker and former law clerk, said LinkedIn contacted more
than 3,000 people in her name, including those copied in on her
e-mail messages.  “This means that not only direct e-mail contacts but
peripherals as well,” were used, she said. “I contacted
LinkedIn and they said, ‘Oh, you can remove all those
invitations from your account manually. We don’t know what
happened.’”  Instead, she said she added a disclaimer to her LinkedIn
page saying she hadn’t sent the invitations.  Jeffrey Barr of Livingston,  New Jersey , said in an e-mail
that he estimated LinkedIn used as many as 200 names and e-mail
addresses of his contacts, inviting them to connect with him on
the site.  ‘Old Girlfriends’  “Some of the people I hadn’t talked to in five to 10
years, including several old girlfriends I had forgotten to
delete,” he said.  LinkedIn told him he hadn’t unchecked a default setting
allowing it to use the e-mails, he said.  According the complaint, it was part of LinkedIn’s growth
initiative also to send multiple e-mails endorsing its products,
services, and brand to potential new users, following up with
additional messages to people who didn’t sign on.  The existing users have no way to stop the process, the
plaintiffs said.  “These ‘endorsement e-mails’ are sent to e-mail addresses
taken from LinkedIn users’ external e-mail accounts including
the addresses of spouses, clients, opposing counsel, etc.,”
according to the complaint.  The actions were taken even though LinkedIn assures its
users when they log in, “We will not e-mail anyone without your
permission,” the plaintiffs said.  “LinkedIn’s appropriation of e-mail addresses to send
multiple reminder e-mails promoting its service is motivated by
monetary gain,” they said.  The lead lawyer handling the customers is Larry Russ of
 Russ August & Kabat PC  in  Los Angeles .  The case is Perkins v. LinkedIn Corp., 13-cv-04303, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California ( San Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
