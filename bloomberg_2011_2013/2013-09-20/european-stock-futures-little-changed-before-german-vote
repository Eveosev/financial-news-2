European stocks  dropped from a
five-year high as Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President
 James Bullard  said the central bank may decide to reduce bond
purchases at its next policy meeting.  Adidas AG slid 2.9 percent after lowering its profit
forecast for 2013. Direct Line Insurance Group Plc lost 3.2
percent as  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  sold a 630 million-pound ($1 billion) stake in the U.K.’s biggest car insurer.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.3 percent to 314.27 at
4:30 p.m. in  London  after earlier climbing as much as 0.2
percent. The equity benchmark has still risen 0.9 percent this
week, extending its rally so far this year to 12 percent, as the
Fed refrained from slowing the pace of its bond-buying program
at its last policy meeting on Sept. 17-18.  “Almost every single investor expected the Fed to taper,”
Henrik Drusebjerg, who helps oversee $220 billion as a senior
strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen, said by telephone.
“Bullard’s comments are definitely something that would concern
investors as we’ve seen quite a rally this week on the back of
the Fed indicating that it will delay tapering.”  Bullard said that economic reports over the next month may
lead the  Federal Open Market Committee  to cut its monthly
purchases of Treasuries or mortgage bonds when it next meets on
Oct. 29-30. “It’s possible that you could get some data that
change the complexion of the outlook and could make the
committee be comfortable with a small taper in October,”
Bullard said in an interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg
Television’s “ Bloomberg Surveillance .”  Fed Stimulus  The Stoxx 600 climbed to its highest level since June 2008
yesterday after the Fed  said  it needs to see more evidence of
lasting improvement in the  U.S. economy  before slowing the pace
of its bond-buying program.  In  Germany , an  INSA opinion poll  published yesterday showed
the opposition  Social Democrats  climbing one percentage point to
28 percent, 10 points behind Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
 Christian Democratic Union  and its sister party the  Christian
Social Union  of Bavaria. Both main groups fell short of a
majority with their preferred coalition partners in the survey.  Some polls show the Free Democrats, the junior member of
the governing coalition, struggling to reach the 5 percent
threshold they need to enter parliament, meaning that Merkel may
have to form a government with another party.  National benchmark indexes fell in 10 of the 18 western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 0.4 percent and
Germany’s DAX slipped 0.2 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index added
0.1 percent.  Consumer Confidence  A European Commission report showed an index of household
sentiment in the euro area climbed to minus 14.9 in September
from minus 15.6 in August. The  median estimate  of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had called for a reading of minus 14.5.  Adidas slipped 2.9 percent to 80.23 euros after cutting the
low end of its profit forecast for 2013 by 7.9 percent. The
world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker said the euro’s
strength would hurt its sales in the third quarter, while the
move to a new distribution center in  Russia  would reduce the
availability of products in shops.  Direct Line (DLG)  dropped 3.2 percent to 211 pence after RBS sold
300 million shares of the insurance company for 210 pence
apiece. The bank, which is majority owned by the U.K.
government, reduced its holding in Direct Line by 20 percent to
28.5 percent. RBS slipped 1.4 percent to 363.7 pence.  RWE Slips  RWE AG retreated 3.9 percent to 24.70 euros after Germany’s
second-largest utility said it will reduce its dividend. The
company will pay 1 euro ($1.35) on each common and preferred
share at its annual general meeting in 2014, half of what it
paid this year.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  lost 4.5 percent to 391.2 pence as Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit downgraded the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks to neutral from buy. The brokerage
said that U.S. rules governing swap-execution facilities, which
come into effect on Oct. 2, will have a wider scope than
analysts had expected.  “These appear to be much more extensive than we -- and the
market, we suspect -- had envisaged,” the note said. “We
therefore see short- and medium-term risks to earnings.”  Mediaset SpA (MS)  added 1.7 percent to 3.29 euros after Morgan
Stanley increased its target price on  the broadcaster  controlled
by former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  to 3.65 euros
from 2.15 euros. The brokerage said that an improving
advertising market and sustained cost savings will enable the
company to reduce its indebtedness.  Ackermans & van Haaren NV rose 4.4 percent to 73.79 euros
after the investment firm offered to buy Cie. d’Entreprises CFE
SA for 451 million euros to gain full control of the world’s
third-largest dredging company.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 60 percent greater than the average of the
past 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
