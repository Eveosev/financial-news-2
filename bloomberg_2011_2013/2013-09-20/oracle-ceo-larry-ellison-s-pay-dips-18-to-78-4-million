  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Larry Ellison ’s pay package declined 18 percent to $78.4
million for fiscal 2013 after he gave up an annual bonus and the
company missed some of its profit targets.  Ellison, 69, who is worth $41.8 billion and ranks eighth on
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, was the highest-paid CEO in
the U.S. this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oracle issued a profit forecast for the fiscal second
quarter this past week that fell short of most analysts’
projections, as the largest maker of corporate databases faces
more competition in business software and stagnating technology
spending. While Ellison has been acquiring companies and
investing in technology to retake market share, the efforts are
taking longer to boost sales.  Ellison received $96.2 million in compensation in fiscal
2012, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday. His target bonus for fiscal 2013,
which ended in May, fell to $1.17 million from $3.92 million,
while stock-based compensation shrank 15 percent to $76.9
million. Ellison, along with co-presidents Mark Hurd and Safra Catz, also declined an executive bonus plan.  With a base salary of $1, Ellison is rewarded via
performance-based payouts. He owns 24 percent of Oracle, which
has a market value of $157.7 billion.  Oracle  shares  rose 29 percent in the year to May 31.  Deborah Hellinger , a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, declined to comment.  Ellison’s Oracle Team USA is trailing Emirates Team New
Zealand in the America’s Cup yacht race competition under way in
San Francisco. While his crew won a race yesterday, the
defending champions remain behind 8-3 in the best-of-17 series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
