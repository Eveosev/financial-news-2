  Lithuania  raised its economic
growth forecast for this year and next because of accelerating
export growth.  Gross domestic product will probably rise 5.8 percent this
year, compared with a September forecast of 2.8 percent, the
Vilnius-based  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economic output will slow to 4.7 percent next year,
compared with a previous estimate of 1.2 percent. The central
bank forecast 2011 GDP growth of 3.3 percent last month.  The Baltic nation’s government is betting on an export-
driven expansion as recovering demand across  Europe  propels
exports to record highs. The economy expanded an annual 4.8
percent in the final three months of last year, the most in 10
quarters, boosted by sales of goods abroad, which account for
about two-thirds of output.  “This may be a bit premature to base full-year growth
estimates on the last exports results, yet if domestic demand
recovers along the way, the forecast may be rather realistic,”
Vilija Tauraite, a Vilnius-based economist with SEB Bank, said
by phone. SEB forecasts 4 percent growth this year.  Inflation will average 3.3 percent both this year and next
on rising consumer demand, compared with a previous estimate of
1.8 percent for 2011, the ministry said.  The yield on Lithuania’s 10-year bond fell 0.01 percentage
points to 6.09 percent today after the announcement.  Exports, which accelerated to the highest on record of 5.4
billion litai ($2.18 billion) in December, will probably grow at
least 22 percent this year, the ministry said.  The  budget deficit  will probably average less than 5.3
percent of GDP this year, compared with a budget plan of 5.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
