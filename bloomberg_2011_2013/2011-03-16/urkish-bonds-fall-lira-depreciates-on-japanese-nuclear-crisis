Turkish bonds fell, raising yields
for the first in six days, and the lira headed for its weakest
level in a week as the nuclear crisis in  Japan  curbed demand for
riskier emerging-market assets.  Yields on two-year bonds rose the most in more than 10
days, advancing 10 basis points to 8.65 percent, according to
the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira depreciated 0.6
percent to 1.5891 per dollar. The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  erased
earlier gains to close 1.5 percent lower at 63,280.42 at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul.  European Union Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said
the damaged Japanese nuclear plant is “out of control” and
there could be further catastrophic events. Crude gained as  Saudi Arabia  sent troops into neighbouring Bahrain to help quell
protests and Libyan forces battled rebels in the east.  “The developments in Japan weaken the likelihood of short-
term capital inflows through carry-trade,” Erkin Isik,
strategist at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS, said in e-mailed
comments. He said he doesn’t expect policy makers to change
rates this month, and “there is not much chance of a fall in
the yields before the central bank meeting,” he said.  Policy makers will decide on  interest rates , currently at a
record-low 6.25 percent, in a meeting on March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
