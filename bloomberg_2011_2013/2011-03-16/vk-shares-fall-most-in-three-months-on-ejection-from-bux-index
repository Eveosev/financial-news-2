TVK Nyrt., the Hungarian chemicals
maker controlled by refiner Mol Nyrt., fell to the lowest in
almost six months after the Budapest Stock Exchange said the
company will be dropped from the benchmark BUX index from April.  The shares fell 3 percent to 3,260 forint by the 5 p.m.
close in Budapest, the biggest decline since Nov. 29 and the
lowest closing price since Sept. 24. The BUX index slid 1.5
percent.  TVK will be removed from the index “as it was the second
time they did not meet the requirements,” the bourse said in a
statement, without specifying which criteria TVK failed. BUX
members must fulfill conditions based on trading volume, market
capitalization, assets and free float, including having a
minimum market value of 5 billion forint ($25 million) and at
least 0.5 percent of the net assets on the exchange, according
to  information  on the bourse’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
