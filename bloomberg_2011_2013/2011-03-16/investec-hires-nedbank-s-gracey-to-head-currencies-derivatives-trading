  Investec Ltd. (INL) , a private bank and
wealth manager, hired David Gracey from  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  to
head its currency and derivatives trading team in South Africa.  Gracey replaces Grant Barrow, who will lead Investec’s new
clearing unit, Mark Currie, the executive in charge of
Investec’s capital markets division, said by phone from
Johannesburg yesterday.  The clearing unit “is a new initiative which Grant has
been involved in incubating,” Currie said. “With Basel III,
there is a move to have all derivatives exchange-traded, so we
see growth in that area”.  Gracey, who headed foreign-exchange trading at Nedbank
Capital, the securities unit of South Africa’s fourth-biggest
bank, leaves Nedbank after a two-decade career, John Chemaly,
the bank’s head of global markets, said by phone. Nedbank hasn’t
yet appointed a replacement for him.  “David was a very senior guy and we’re sorry to see him
go,” Chemaly said. “We are looking to put some people into
place but at the moment we’re comfortable with the way we are
staffed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
