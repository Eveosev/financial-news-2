  France  will put all 58 of its
nuclear reactors through safety checks following explosions at a
Japanese plant, according to French Energy Minister Eric Besson,
who defended atomic energy at a parliamentary commission.  “France has to learn as much as possible from this
catastrophe,” Besson told a hearing today in Paris. The country
was right to opt for nuclear power because it provides energy
independence, less expensive electricity and lower greenhouse
gas emissions, he said.  French reactors will get safety reviews, including their
ability to withstand earthquakes and floods, he said.
Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s biggest power generator,
operates the country’s nuclear reactors, which provide more than
75 percent of domestic power. EDF is also developing a new
reactor in Normandy and has plans for one or two more in France,
as well as plants in the U.K. and  Italy .  The nuclear safety checks for French reactors will be
“transparent and understandable” in determining what types of
“stress” reactors can withstand, French Environment Minister
Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told the same commission. The French
tests will be in line with those to be carried out in other
European countries, she said.  “The risk of earthquakes is taken very seriously in
France,” said Andre-Claude Lacoste, head of the Autorite de
Surete Nucleaire, France’s nuclear safety watchdog. The risk is
considered “moderate.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
