Copper climbed for the first time
in six days on expectation that reconstruction needs after  Japan ’s largest quake on record will boost demand in three to
six months. All six metals on the London Metal Exchange rose.  The metal for three-month delivery rose as much as 2.1
percent to $9,306 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
traded at $9,281 at 3:04 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract
tumbled to a three-month low of $8,944.50 yesterday. June-
deliver copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 2.9
percent to close at 70,580 yuan ($10,740) a ton.  “Following the steep losses in the last few days, the
price now looks attractive to some buyers,” Li Peiying, an
analyst at Essence Futures Co., said by telephone from Beijing.
“People have started to shift their attention to the rebuilding
that will boost demand in the next few months.”  Copper and lead are likely to benefit due to power line and
transformer replacements and the need for generators and
batteries in light of power problems,  Gayle Berry , an analyst
with  Barclays Capital , said in a report yesterday. Aluminum,
zinc and nickel demand may also rise, according to the report.  Japanese stocks rose for the first time in five days on
speculation a selloff yesterday that drove valuations to a 28-
month low was excessive. The broader Topix index climbed 6.6
percent, the most since October 2008, to 817.63.  Uncertain Shipments  Chinese imports of refined copper from Japan are expected
to remain normal in March and April, although uncertainties
remain for May and June, analysts led by  Mark Pervan  with
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in a report
today. “March shipments have nearly been completed, while
copper due to leave to  China  in April has been stored in
warehouses in ports in western Japan.”  Japan last year supplied 253,157 tons of refined copper to
China, the largest consumer, or 8.7 percent of Chinese imports,
according to customs data.  Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Japan’s third-largest copper
maker, declared force majeure March 14 on concentrate shipments
to its Onahama smelter, after the quake and tsunami halted power
supply. The facility has an annual capacity of 258,000 tons,
spokesman Toshiaki Yamada said today.  The Conference Board Leading Economic Index for China rose
0.3 percent to 155 in January from the previous month, said the
New York-based research organization on its website today,
citing preliminary data. The indicator, designed to capture
prospects over the coming six months, recorded the first decline
since 2008 in December.  Aluminum in  London  rose 0.7 percent to $2,511 a ton, zinc
gained 2.1 percent to $2,329 a ton, and lead added 1.1 percent
to $2,538 a ton. Nickel climbed 2.5 percent to $25,310 a ton,
and tin advanced 1.1 percent to $28,900 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
