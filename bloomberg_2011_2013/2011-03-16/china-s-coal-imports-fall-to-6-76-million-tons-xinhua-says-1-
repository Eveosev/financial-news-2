  China ’s coal imports fell to 6.76
million metric tons in February, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported in a flash headline today, without saying where it got
the information from or giving more details.  That would be a 59 percent drop from 16.56 million tons in
January and a 48 percent decline from a year earlier, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on government data.  Chen Yue, a Beijing-based official at China’s General
Administration and Customs handling data releases, didn’t reply
to two telephone calls after business hours request comment. The
customs department is due to publish the February coal import
trade data on March 21.  China’s coal output grew 20 percent in February from a year
earlier to 247.5 million tons, the Beijing-based China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on March 11.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
