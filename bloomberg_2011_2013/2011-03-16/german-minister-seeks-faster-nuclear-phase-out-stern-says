  Germany  should abandon nuclear
power sooner than foreseen under current law, Stern magazine
quoted Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen as saying in an
interview.  Germany will probably use nuclear power for another 10-15
years, Stern cited Roettgen as saying in an e-mailed preview of
an article in this week’s edition. If a planned safety review
finds unacceptable risks at any German nuclear plant, it should
be shut down, Roettgen, a member of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union , told the magazine.  Merkel’s coalition last year extended the life of German
nuclear-power stations by an average of 12 years, saying more
time was needed to shift to renewable energy sources. All plants
had been slated for closure by about 2022 under legislation
passed by a previous government. Merkel on March 14 announced a
three month moratorium on the extension for safety checks to
carried out in light of the disaster in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
