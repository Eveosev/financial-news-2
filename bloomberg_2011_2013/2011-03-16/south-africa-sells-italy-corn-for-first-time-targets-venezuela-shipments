  South Africa  is exporting corn to
Italy for the first time in at least 14 years and is targeting  Venezuela  for shipments as it seeks to drain a record surplus,
Grain SA, a growers organization, said.  South  Africa  currently has corn stocks of 5.22 million
metric tons, more than double anticipated annual exports,
according to the Pretoria-based  South African Grain Information
Service , after farmers reaped the biggest crop since 1982.  “We’re definitely looking for new markets,” Barrett
Schoeman, a spokesman for Bothaville-based Grain SA, said in an
interview today. “We’re talking to Venezuela about corn exports
for stock feeds.”  In the marketing year that began May 1, South Africa has
broadened its corn sales from traditional African customers, by
shipping 934,677 tons of corn to  Italy , South Korea, Kuwait,  Japan , Taiwan and  Spain . In the previous marketing year only
88,844 tons went to markets outside Africa.  Last week South Africa shipped 35,200 tons of white corn to
Italy, bringing the total this year to 59,607 tons.  So far this marketing year South Africa has exported
702,625 tons of white corn to all destinations and 900,007 tons
of yellow corn. Exports will probably end the season at about
800,000 tons of white corn and 1.2 million tons of yellow,
Schoeman said. That compares with exports in the prior year of
1.41 million tons of white corn and 261,338 tons of yellow.  Bumper Harvests  This year exports of white corn by South Africa to nearby
states has been curbed by bumper harvests in those countries. In
much of Africa, white corn is used to make corn meal, a staple
food, while yellow corn is fed to animals.  White corn for July delivery fell 13 rand, or 0.8 percent,
to 1,532 rand a ton on the  South African Futures Exchange  in
Johannesburg today, bringing its 12-month gain to 38 percent.
Yellow corn fell 1.1 percent to 1,580 rand, curbing its increase
to 20 percent. Corn prices in  Chicago , the global benchmark,
have jumped 75 percent over the last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
