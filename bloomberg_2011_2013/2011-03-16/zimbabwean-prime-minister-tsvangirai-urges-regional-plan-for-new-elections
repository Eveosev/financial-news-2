Zimbabwean Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  urged southern African nations to establish a plan
for new elections amid difficulties within the country’s
coalition government.  “There are a few problems developing in terms of cohesion”
in the government of national unity formed in 2008, Tsvangirai
told reporters yesterday after meeting Armando Guebuza, the
president of neighboring  Mozambique . Guebuza is a member of a
three-nation panel on defense, politics and security, known as a
troika, set up by the Southern African Development Community.  The troika, of which Guebuza is a member “should be fully
briefed” on the situation in  Zimbabwe , Tsvangirai said after the
two leaders held talks in Maputo, the Mozambican capital.  The Movement for Democratic Change, led by Tsvangirai,
formed a power-sharing government with President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front in 2008 after
disputed elections. While the coalition helped end a decade of
economic recession, it has often come close to breaking down. A
new constitution must be agreed before a vote can take place,
according to the accord.  Earlier yesterday, Tsvangirai met Zambian President Rupiah Banda, the head of the SADC troika,  Zambian Watchdog , an
Internet news site, reported yesterday. The Zimbabwe prime
minister is also expected to travel to  South Africa  and
Botswana, where he will meet those countries’ presidents,
according to  Newsday , a Harare-based newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
