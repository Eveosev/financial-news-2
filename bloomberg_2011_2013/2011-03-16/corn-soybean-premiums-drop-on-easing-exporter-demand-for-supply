Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative
to Chicago futures as a worsening nuclear crisis in  Japan 
following last week’s earthquake eroded exporter demand.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in March
at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 50 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 51 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture
 data  show. The soybean basis was 55 cents to 65 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 62 cents to 77 cents.  “Japan’s earthquake has rocked the world markets,” said
Bryce Stremming, a risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc.
in Bloomington,  Illinois . “People think they can buy supplies
cheaper,” as the widening catastrophe threatens to disrupt
grain purchases.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 19.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to close at $6.165 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.08, the lowest for
a most-active contract since Jan. 12. Yesterday, the grain
tumbled 4.5 percent, the most in four months.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 17 cents, or 1.3
percent, to close at $12.87 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest
gain since March 2. The price, which dropped 5.2 percent
yesterday, has declined 12 percent since reaching a 30-month
high of $14.5575 on Feb. 9.  Japan, the world’s biggest buyer of U.S. corn and third-
biggest importer of soybeans, faces a “serious situation,”
trying to control radiation leaking from a power plant damaged
by the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that struck on March
11, said Yukiya Amano, the head of the  International Atomic
Energy Agency .  “It feels like people just want to wait and see what
happens,” before increasing inventories of corn and soybeans,
Stremming said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
