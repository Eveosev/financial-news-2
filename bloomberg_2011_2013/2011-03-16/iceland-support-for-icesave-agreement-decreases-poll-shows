Icelandic voter support for a
depositor accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands is
decreasing, a MMR poll conducted for  Vidskiptabladid  showed.  Support for the agreement slipped to 52 percent in the MMR
poll, the Reykjavik-based newspaper said today. That compares
with 63 percent in a Capacent Gallup poll conducted for state
broadcaster RUV published on March 9. Out of those polled, 48
percent said they would reject the agreement in the April 9
referendum.  MMR polled 900 people on March 8 through March 11. The
margin of error is 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
