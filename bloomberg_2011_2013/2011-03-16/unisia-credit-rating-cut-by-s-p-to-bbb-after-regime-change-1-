Tunisia’s credit rating was cut one
notch to BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s , which said the country’s
political turmoil this year has hurt its economic prospects.  S&P assigned a stable outlook to the rating because it
expects the transition after the nation’s regime change will
lead to a mainly temporary additional drag on economic growth
and public finances, according to a statement in London today.  Tunisia’s caretaker government is trying to bring stability
to the North African country, where weeks of protests over
unemployment, high food prices and political repression forced
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power on Jan. 14.  “The political and economic legacy of the Ben Ali regime
and the precipitous transfer of power have, in our view, damaged  Tunisia ’s prospects for growth, public finances, and external
balance,” the ratings company said.  A vote for a National Council, which will draft a new
constitution, will be held on July 24, interim President Fouad Mebazaa said on March 3. All Cabinet members who served under
Ben Ali have quit.  “Downward pressure on the ratings could re-emerge if
renewed uncertainty about the political transition or weaker
economic policies depress growth, enlarge fiscal deficits beyond
our forecasts, or pressure the country’s balance of payments,”
S&P said. “Conversely, we may raise the rating over the medium
term if a new government is able to establish its credibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
