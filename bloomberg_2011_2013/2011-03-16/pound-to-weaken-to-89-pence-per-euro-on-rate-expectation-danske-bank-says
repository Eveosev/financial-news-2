The U.K. pound will weaken to
89 pence per euro in the next three months as the  European
Central Bank  starts raising borrowing costs four months before
the  Bank of England , Danske Bank A/S predicts.  Danske Bank pared back its forecast from a previous
estimate of 86 pence as it expects the ECB to raise its
refinancing rate to 1.25 percent in April from 1 percent.  “Markets are pricing almost a 100 percent probability that
the ECB will raise rates in April; I am less confident that the
Bank of England will raise rates” because the U.K. economy is
too fragile,  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank in
London said by phone.  Hydeskov forecasts the U.K.’s central bank will keep its
benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent until
August. “In my view a May rate hike is simply not realistic,”
he said.  The pound was 0.4 percent stronger at 86.72 pence per euro
as of 12:55 p.m. in  London  after depreciating to 87.10 pence,
the weakest since Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
