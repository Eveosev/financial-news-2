U.S. nuclear-power output rose 0.3
percent after power increased at the Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor in  Maryland  and NextEra Energy Inc. boosted the Turkey Point Unit 3
in Florida, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Production nationwide increased by 251 megawatts from
yesterday to 86,542 megawatts, or 85 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Fifteen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC , a joint venture of  Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  with Electricite de France SA,
boosted its 867-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor to 56 percent
of capacity from 10 percent yesterday.  Another reactor at the plant, the 867-megawatt Calvert
Cliffs 1, is operating at full power. The plant is located 38
miles (61 kilometers) south of Annapolis.    NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 3
reactor to full power from 60 percent of capacity yesterday.
Another 693-megawatt reactor at the site, Turkey Point 4, is
operating at 100 percent. The plant is 20 miles south of Miami.    Entergy Corp. (ETR)  slowed its 778-megawatt Palisades reactor on
Lake Michigan to 52 percent of capacity from 100 percent
yesterday. The plant is located 37 miles west of Kalamazoo,
Michigan.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
