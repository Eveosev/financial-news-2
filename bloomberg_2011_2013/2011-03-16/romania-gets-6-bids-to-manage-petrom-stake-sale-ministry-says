The Romanian  Economy Ministry 
received offers from six bidding groups for managing the sale of
a 9.8 percent stake in  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , the Economy Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement in Bucharest.    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) ,  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ,  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  Renaissance Capital 
have formed groups with Romanian brokerages and banks as they
seek to win the tender to manage the Petrom stake sale, the
ministry said.    Romania , which values the stake in the country’s largest  oil company  at 500 million euros ($698 million), plans to sell
the shares by the end of June, to raise money for investment,
Economy Ministry official Victor Cazana said today in Bucharest.
The Balkan nation also plans to sell stakes in utilities  Transelectrica SA (TEL)  and Transgaz SA by the end of this year and
will select managers to handle the sales after completing the
Petrom transaction, Cazana said.  Romania will probably pick a manager for the Petrom sale in
two weeks, after assessing the bids, Cazana said.  Petrom’s shares rose 1.8 percent to 0.39 lei in Bucharest
trading today, valuing the oil company at 22.1 billion lei ($7.4
billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
