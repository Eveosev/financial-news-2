Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, declined 59 percent from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors from Bahia’s growing
areas totaled 5,107 bags in the week to March 13, Hartmann wrote
in a report dated yesterday. That compares with the 12,561 bags
a week earlier. Total arrivals from across Brazil were 9,404
bags, compared with 23,871 bags a week earlier. A bag weighs 60
kilograms (132 pounds).  Brazil celebrated its annual Carnival festival earlier this
month. “As expected, the arrivals of the two Carnival weeks
were on the low side and volume at least from Bahia is expected
to continue phasing out over the coming weeks,” Hartmann said.  Bahia represents almost 80 percent of the country’s cocoa
output, and 95 percent of its grindings, according to Hartmann.
He is a board member of the Commercial Association of Bahia and
is in charge of the group’s statistical service on Brazilian
cocoa output, according to an e-mail on Sept. 2.  Hartmann predicted in December that  Brazil ’s main crop may
reach 1.2 million bags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
