German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Cabinet approved borrowing reductions in coming years as the
government seeks to comply with a constitutional requirement to
almost eliminate new debt by 2016.  Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  proposed slashing
borrowing to 31.5 billion euros ($44 billion) in 2012, down from
the 40.1 billion euros set out in the four-year budget plan, a
ministry official said March 14, speaking on condition of
anonymity.  Net borrowing is forecast to shrink to 13.3 billion euros
in 2015, more than the 12.8 billion euros forecast in February
because of additional health costs. The government plans to
raise spending by around 0.3 percent on average per year, from
303.8 billion euros in 2012 to 309.5 billion euros in 2015.    Germany ’s so-called debt brake is locked into the
constitution, compelling the government to run a budget close to
balance in 2016. The budget blueprint suggested the federal
government may comply with the rule already in 2015, one year
earlier than planned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
