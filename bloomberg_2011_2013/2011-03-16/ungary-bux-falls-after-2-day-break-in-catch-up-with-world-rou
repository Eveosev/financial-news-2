Hungarian stocks fell the most in a
week, catching up with declines on global markets after
explosions at a nuclear plant in  Japan  hurt demand for riskier
assets during Hungary’s two-day holiday.  The benchmark BUX stock index declined as much as 1.9
percent and was down 1.5 percent at 21,900.39 by the 5 p.m. end
of trading in Budapest, the biggest drop since March 9 and the
lowest closing price since Jan. 3. OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s
largest lender, fell 3.2 percent and TVK Nyrt., which will drop
out of the BUX index in April, fell 3 percent.  “The Japanese catastrophe has substantially redrawn the
picture, with panic selling especially on Tuesday,” Akos Herczenik and Levente Blaho, analysts at Raiffeisen Bank
International AG in Budapest, wrote in a research report.  U.S. stocks fell for a third day as Japan’s nuclear crisis
and a plunge in housing starts damped optimism in the economic
recovery, while oil and Treasuries rose as protests escalated in
Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
