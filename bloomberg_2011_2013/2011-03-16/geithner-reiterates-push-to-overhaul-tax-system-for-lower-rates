U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  reiterated that the Obama administration wants to
revamp the tax code to lower rates while eliminating many breaks
for companies.  “We look forward to working with members of Congress and
the business community to design a comprehensive, revenue-
neutral reform of the corporate tax system that would lower tax
rates, eliminate special tax breaks and encourage investment in
the  United States ,” Geithner said in testimony prepared for a
hearing today before a House Appropriations Committee panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
