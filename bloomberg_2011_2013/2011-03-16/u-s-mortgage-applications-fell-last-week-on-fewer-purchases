Mortgage applications in the U.S.
fell last week as a decline in borrowing costs failed to spur
home buying.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of loan
applications declined 0.7 percent in the week ended March 11.
The group’s purchase index fell 4 percent, while a measure of
refinancing climbed 0.9 percent.  The prospect of further declines in  home prices  and more
foreclosures in coming months may be prompting Americans to
refrain from purchases. Federal Reserve policy makers said
yesterday that the housing market is “depressed,” as they
stuck to their plan of buying Treasuries to boost economic
growth.  “Demand remains very sluggish at this point,” Scott Anderson, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Minneapolis , said before the report. “We still have a glut of
existing homes, and that’s the main problem. Jobs are still a
concern.”  The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan decreased last
week to 4.79 percent, the lowest since Jan. 14, from 4.93
percent. Borrowing costs reached 4.21 percent in October, the
lowest since the group’s records began in 1990.  The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 4.03
percent from 4.17 percent.  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan rose to
66.4 percent from 65.5 percent the prior week.  A report today from the Commerce Department is projected to
show housing starts fell 5 percent in February to a 566,000
annual rate, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Starts averaged 585,000 in 2010.  Existing-Home Sales  Sales of previously owned homes, which make up more than 90
percent of the market, climbed in January to the highest level
in eight months, as distressed sales accounted for 37 percent of
all sales, the National Association of Realtors said on Feb. 23.
All-cash purchases were 32 percent of total sales during the
month. People purchasing with cash don’t apply for mortgages.  New-home sales fell 13 percent in January to a 284,000
annual pace, the Commerce Department reported Feb. 24. That
compares with a 274,000 low reached in August.  Lower  interest rates  and cheaper homes are encouraging for
some builders because they make owning a property more
affordable. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home values in 20
cities fell 2.4 percent in December from a year earlier, the
biggest 12-month decrease since December 2009, the group
reported last month. Prices were down 31 percent from their peak
in July 2006.  “Affordability remains at near an all-time high,” Martin Connor, chief financial officer at  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , said at a
March 7 investors conference in  Orlando ,  Florida . Thirty-year
mortgage are around 4.9 percent and “that’s still a
historically low rate. And prices are depressed. We have some
optimism, but we’re cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
