metric tons of rough rice in the year that starts Nov. 1, up
from an estimated 10.604 million a year earlier, a unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a  report  dated March 11
that was posted today on its website.  Wheat imports may drop to 5.35 million tons in the year
that begins July 1, from an estimated 5.5 million a year
