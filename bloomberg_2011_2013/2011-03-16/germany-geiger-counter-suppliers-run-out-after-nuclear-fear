German Geiger counter suppliers
including  Conrad Electronic SE  have sold out of the devices
after demand from private and industrial customers rose because
earthquakes in  Japan  damaged nuclear power stations.  Conrad Electronic , a German consumer and office electronics
retailer, has sold out of Geiger counters, spokeswoman Christina
Bauroth said by telephone from the company’s Hirschau
headquarters. The retailer, which has an online business and
operates 26 stores in Germany, is trying to get new devices by
the middle of April, she said.  “Telephone lines are buzzing,” Uwe Rische, managing
director of  Graetz Strahlungsmesstechnik GmbH  in Altena,
Germany, said in an interview. Geiger counters have sold out as
orders are five times higher than usual, he said. Most orders
come from companies that import goods from Japan or have to send
employees to the country, he added. Some shipping companies have
ordered as many as 50 Geiger counters for their crews cruising
off Japan’s shores, Rische said.  Conrad is selling Geiger counters for 299 euros ($417) to
499 euros while the devices cost as much as 3,000 euros at
Graetz.  Amazon.com Inc, the world’s largest online retailer, has no
evidence of increased Geiger counter sales in  Germany ,
spokeswoman Veronika Merkle said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
