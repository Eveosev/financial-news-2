Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said that he’s halting plans to develop nuclear power in the
South American country as  Japan  struggles to avoid a meltdown at
a plant after last week’s earthquake and tsunami.  “I’m ordering Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez to freeze all
nuclear power development projects for peaceful means,” Chavez
said today on state television.  Chavez signed a deal with Russia’s Rosatom Corp. in October
to develop nuclear power in Venezuela including a research
reactor. Electricity Minister Ali Rodriguez said on Oct. 21 that
Venezuela hoped to eventually produce 4,000 megawatts of nuclear
power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
