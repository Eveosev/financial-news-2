  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, said a U.S. federal agency
effectively lifted operating restrictions at a Nevada mining
project which is the subject of an environmental dispute.  The federal Bureau of Land Management approved an
environmental study for Cortez Hills, Toronto-based Barrick said
today in a statement. The U.S. District Court in April granted
an injunction restricting the transportation of ore and the
pumping of water pending completion of the study.  Cortez Hills is near Mt. Tenabo, a sacred site for the
 Western Shoshone , who along with two other American Indian
tribes have objected to how Barrick’s expansion plans would
drain water from the area. The tribes had sought to halt
production.  Barrick said its Cortez property, which includes Cortez
Hills, will produce 1.3 million to 1.45 million ounces this year
at total cash cost of $235 to $265 an ounce.  The lawsuit is South Fork Band Council of Western Shoshone
of  Nevada  v. U.S. Department of the Interior, 08-cv-00616, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Reno). The appeals court
case is South Fork Band Council of Western Shoshone of Nevada v.
U.S. Department of the Interior, 09-15230,  U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit   San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
