Swiss investor confidence rose for
a second month in March as increasing exports and reviving
consumer demand bolstered the economy’s expansion.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance,
increased to minus 13.5 from minus 17.2 in February, the ZEW
Center for European Economic Research in  Mannheim ,  Germany , and
Zurich-based  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The survey was conducted March 10-14.  The Swiss economy is gathering strength as companies boost
output and hiring to meet export demand. Leading economic
indicators rose in February, manufacturing growth accelerated
and unemployment fell to the lowest in almost two years. BAK
Basel Economics on March 10 raised its 2011 growth forecast.  A gauge measuring confidence in the current economic
situation rose to 67.6 from 60, according to the statement.  The  Swiss National Bank  may keep its benchmark interest
rate at 0.25 percent at tomorrow’s meeting, according to all 20
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The Zurich-based central
bank will publish its decision at 9:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
