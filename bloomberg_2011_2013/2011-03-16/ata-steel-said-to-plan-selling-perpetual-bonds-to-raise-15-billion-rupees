  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer, aims to raise as much as 15 billion rupees ($332
million) in the nation’s first sale of rupee perpetual bonds by
a non-finance company, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said.    JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  will arrange the
sale, said one of the people, declining to be identified because
the matter is confidential. The Mumbai-based company will pay a
coupon of 11.8 percent on the bonds, which can’t be called for
redemption for the first 10 years, the person said.  Tata Steel Group Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee
announced a 70 billion rupee fundraising plan in November. The
bonds will add to the 3.53 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) of
loans Tata Steel obtained on Sept. 29 and the 34.8 billion
rupees raised from a share sale in January to replace debt used
to buy Corus Group Plc in 2007 for $12.9 billion.  Chatterjee did not respond to an e-mail and a phone call
made to his office. Kavita Sonawala, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan
in Mumbai, declined to comment. Charudatta Deshpande, ICICI
Bank’s spokesman in Mumbai, did not respond to an e-mail.  Tata Steel shares gained as much as 2.4 percent to 607.50
rupees and traded at 606.80 rupees as of 1:35 p.m. in Mumbai.
The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rose
1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
