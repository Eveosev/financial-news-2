Deaths in the U.S. fell for the
10th straight year to a record low as the number of murder
victims declined, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. Heart disease remained the No. 1 killer.  More than 2.4 million Americans died in 2009, a preliminary
analysis of the most recent figures showed, down 36,336 from a
year earlier, according to the CDC’s  National Center for Health
Statistics .  Life expectancy  at birth rebounded to an all-time
high of 78.2 years in 2009, after falling for the first time in
15 years in 2008. There were 4.1 million births in 2009,
according to the CDC.  Death rates declined significantly for 10 of the 15 most
common causes of death, lead by a 6.8 percent drop in homicides,
a 4.7 percent decline in influenza and pneumonia and a 4.2
percent decrease in stroke rates. Deaths from  Alzheimer’s
disease , unintentional injuries and chronic lung conditions all
fell by 4.1 percent.  The number of Americans who committed suicide rose to
36,547, from 35,933 in 2008, passing blood poisoning and making
it the 10th-leading cause of death in the country. The rankings
for the top 15 causes of death otherwise remained the same, led
by  heart disease ,  cancer , lower respiratory disease, strokes and
accidental deaths.  There were 741 deaths for every 100,000 people in the
nation in 2009, the lowest level on record, according to the
report. The findings come from information on death certificates
provided by all 50 states, the  District of Columbia  and U.S.
territories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
