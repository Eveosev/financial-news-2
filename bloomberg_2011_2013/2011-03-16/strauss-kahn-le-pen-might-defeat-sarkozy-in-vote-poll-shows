Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Marine Le Pen might defeat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  if a French
election were held now, a poll showed.  Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the  International
Monetary Fund  and a Socialist Party member, would win 33 percent
in the first round, according to the  Ipsos-LogicaBusiness
Consulting  poll for Le Monde and  Europe  1 radio. Le Pen, leader
of the National Front party, would win 19 percent and Sarkozy
would get 18 percent, Ipsos-Logica said.  The figures underline Sarkozyâ€™s unpopularity. Two previous
polls showed Le Pen leading in the first round of the two-round
election that is scheduled for April and May of 2012.  If the Socialists selected either Martine Aubry or Francois Holland as their candidate, they would have a smaller lead in
the first round with 23 percent support and Sarkozy would get
into the second round with 21 percent.  Ipsos-LogicaBusiness surveyed 948 French adults by
telephone March 14. No margin of error was published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
