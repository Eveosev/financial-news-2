Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co.’s
suspension of resin production at an earthquake damaged plant in  Japan  may hurt output at manufacturers of integrated circuit
chips for communication devices, Barclays Plc said.  A three-month stoppage of resin shipments from Mitsubishi
Gas may put at risk as much as half the global output of chips
used in communication devices including smartphones and tablet
computers, Andrew Lu, an analyst at Barclays Capital Asia Ltd.
in  Hong Kong , wrote in a report yesterday.  Japan makes almost 40 percent of the world’s electronics
and audio-visual components, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. wrote
in a report on March 15. Production has been suspended at some
factories in northern Japan because of the damage caused by the
record 9 magnitude quake on March 11 and ensuing tsunami.  Mitsubishi Gas isn’t certain when it may resume operations
at its bismaleimide-triazine facility in Fukushima prefecture,
the Tokyo-based company’s sole plant making the BT resin,
spokesman Atsushi Shibata said by telephone today.  The chemical maker controls half the global market for the
BT resin used by chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., according to the Barclays report. The
“larger-than-expected bottle neck” may affect companies whose
earnings mostly depend on communication ICs, Lu wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
