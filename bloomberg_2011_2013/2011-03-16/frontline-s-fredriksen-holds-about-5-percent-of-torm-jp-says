  John Fredriksen , chairman and chief
executive officer of Frontline Ltd., has bought shares in Torm
A/S totaling now about 5 percent, Jyllands-Posten reported. It
didn’t say from where it got the information.  Jens Martin Jensen, chief executive officer of Frontline
Management A/S, confirmed the holding to the Aarhus-based
newspaper but declined to specify how large it is. The
investment isn’t strategic, Jyllands-Posten quoted Jensen as
saying.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
