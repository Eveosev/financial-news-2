  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the mail-order and
online movie-rental service, is in talks to distribute its first
original TV series, two people with knowledge of the transaction
said.  The agreement, if completed, would give Netflix the ability
to offer exclusive viewing of “House of Cards” on its
streaming service, a tactic that  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO and  CBS
Corp. (CBS) ’s Showtime have used to attract and retain subscribers.  Netflix would license 26 episodes of the program, which
stars Kevin Spacey and was adapted from the 1990 miniseries and
book that follows a British politician who wants to be prime
minister. The pilot is being directed by David Fincher, who was
nominated for an Academy Award for his work in “The  Social
Network ,” a film for which Spacey was executive producer.  Under the arrangement, Media Rights Capital, which owns the
show, would retain DVD rights and the ability to syndicate the
program for TV after Netflix’s exclusive period expires, said
one of the people.  Susan Arons, a spokeswoman for Media Rights Capital,
declined to comment.  The discussions were reported earlier by TheWrap.com.  HBO produces “Boardwalk Empire,” “True Blood” and
“Entourage,” and had about 28.3 million subscribers as of
September, according to researcher SNL Kagan. Netflix, based in
Los Gatos, California, had 20 million subscribers at the end of
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
