  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s van operations aims
to increase profit and deliveries this year and will step up
offerings in non-European markets to underpin the expansion.  The commercial-vehicles division targets higher operating
profit than last year’s 232 million euros ($324 million),
Wolfgang Schreiber, head of the unit, said today at a press
conference in Hanover, Germany. Vehicle sales increased 23
percent last year to 435,600 units.  “Over the medium term, we also want to grow outside
Europe,” Schreiber said, noting that van sales surged 85
percent in Latin America to 114,000 vehicles and more than
doubled in the Middle East.  The European market for vans increased 15 percent in
January, while heavy-duty truck demand surged 65 percent,
according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.
Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen will start making the Amarok
pickup at its Hanover factory, the carmaker’s third-largest
German plant, from mid-2012 with a goal to build over 40,000
units for  Europe ,  Russia  and other markets.  Europe’s biggest automaker already has 40,000 orders for
the Amarok, which is currently produced only at VW’s factory in
Pacheco,  Argentina . Sales of the pickup totaled 22,600 in 2010,
the year it was introduced in markets outside the U.S. VW
expects the highest growth in Amarok sales in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to Schreiber.  Deliveries of the T5, the van division’s best-selling
model, increased 27 percent to 148,000 of which 124,000 vehicles
were sold in Europe. Sales of the Caddy model fell 8 percent to
128,700 units, reflecting the expiration of government trade-in
incentives, which fueled the van’s deliveries in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
