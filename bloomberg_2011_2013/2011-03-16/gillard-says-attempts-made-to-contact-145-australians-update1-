Australian Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard  said attempts were being made to contact 145 of the
nation’s citizens in  Japan .  “What we’re trying to do is contact them and make sure
they are safe,” Gillard said to reporters today in Canberra.
“With the kind of problems that are happening on the ground, it
is difficult to contact people.”  Australia updated its travel advice to Japan today after a
March 11 earthquake and resulting tsunami. People should
reconsider travel to Tokyo and surrounding earthquake-affected
districts, according to the Department of  Foreign Affairs 
 website .  Japanese police figures put the death toll at 3,676, with
7,558 missing as of 8 a.m. local time. The temblor and resulting
tsunami destroyed or partially damaged 60,007 homes or buildings
and 719 roads and swept away 26 bridges. Fatalities may reach
10,000 in Miyagi prefecture, Go Sugawara, a spokesman for the
police, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
