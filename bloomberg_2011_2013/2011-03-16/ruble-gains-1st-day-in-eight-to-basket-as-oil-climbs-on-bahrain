  Russia ’s ruble strengthened for the
first day in eight against the target basket used by the central
bank to temper exchange-rate swings as oil erased losses in New
York after violence in Bahrain escalated.  The currency added 0.4 percent to 33.7930 against the
dollar-euro basket as of 11:11 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble
appreciated 0.6 percent against the dollar to 28.6699 per dollar
and was 0.2 percent stronger at 40.0576 per euro.  Oil, Russia’s key export earner, rose from the lowest in
two weeks in New York as violence in Bahrain stoked concern
turmoil may spill into neighboring  Saudi Arabia , threatening
supplies from the world’s biggest crude exporter. Crude for
April delivery rose 1.2 percent to $98.38 a barrel in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
