China’s banking regulator head  Liu Mingkang  said it’s “best” for systemically important banks to
have a 12 percent capital adequacy ratio by the end of 2013, the
21st Century Business Herald reported.  Such lenders must have at least 11.5 percent of capital by
then, the Chinese-language newspaper reported today, citing the
China Banking Regulatory Commission chairman’s comments at a
March 14 meeting. That includes an 8 percent minimum
requirement, a 2.5 percent conservation buffer and another 1
percent to reflect their systemic importance, the report said.  The additional capital reflecting the banks’ systemic
importance can vary between 1 percent and 2.5 percent, depending
on the banking industry’s ability to withstand risks, Liu said,
according to the report.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Linus Chua  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
