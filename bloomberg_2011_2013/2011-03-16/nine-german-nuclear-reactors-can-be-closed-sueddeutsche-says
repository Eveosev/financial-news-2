  Germany â€™s Federal Environment
Agency said the country can shut down nine nuclear reactors
without any problems,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
Jochen Flasbarth, the head of the government department.  Closing that number of nuclear reactors is possible without
any impact on the safety of electricity supplies and without any
need to import electricity, the newspaper cited Flasbarth as
saying in an article that will be published tomorrow.    Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on March 15 that the country
will close nuclear reactors accounting for 25 percent of its
atomic-energy capacity as part of a safety review after
explosions at reactors in  Japan . It will keep its seven oldest
nuclear reactors offline as part of a nationwide review to run
through June, Merkel told reporters in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
