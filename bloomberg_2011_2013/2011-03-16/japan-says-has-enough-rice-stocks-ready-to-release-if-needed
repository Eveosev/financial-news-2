  Japan  has sufficient stockpiles of
rice and is ready to release them if required, farm minister
Michihiko Kano said today, as fears of a nuclear radiation leak
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami led to hoarding in
some parts of the country.  “There are shortages in some areas” but the country has
enough in reserve, Kano said in a statement today. Road
congestion, scant fuel supplies and the government’s
prioritizing aid to earthquake-affected regions were the cause
of the rice deficiencies, the statement said.  Tokyo residents emptied store shelves of food, water and
batteries and filled car tanks with gasoline as workers at the
Fukushima nuclear facility continued to struggle with the
aftermath of the 9-magnitude temblor. Hoarders may make it more
difficult to send goods to the millions affected by the 7-meter
(23-foot) tsunami that engulfed the northeast coast, Kano said.  Japan produced 8.24 million metric tons of rice last year.
The private sector held 1.89 million tons in stockpiles as of
the end of June, while the government has inventories of 920,000
tons. Demand may total 8.11 million tons in the year ending June
30, according to farm ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
