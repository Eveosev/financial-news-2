  Celesio AG (CLS1)  Chief Executive Officer
Fritz Oesterle will retire by mutual agreement in June after
more than 12 years on the job, the German drug wholesaling
company said.  Oesterle, 58, is stepping down before his contract expires
on Dec. 31, 2013, Rainer Berghausen, a spokesman at Stuttgart-
based Celesio, said today in a telephone interview.  There has been speculation in since late 2010 that majority
owner Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH is interested in cutting its stake
of about 54 percent in Celesio. German newspaper Handelsblatt
reported on Feb. 24 that Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. is
in talks on a possible purchase of the holding.  The CEO’s departure “was certainly a surprise to me,”
Karl-Heinz Scheunemann, an analyst at Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart, said today in a phone interview.
“The market does seem to think that a sale is now more
likely.”  Celesio rose 7 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 17.06 euros in
Frankfurt trading. The stock has lost about 24 percent in the
past year, in contrast to an increase of 21 percent in the
German MDAX midcap index, of which Celesio is a member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
