  Thailand ’s baht rebounded from its
biggest drop since January as regional stocks rose on
speculation the slide triggered by  Japan ’s worst earthquake on
record was overdone.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares rebounded
from yesterday’s biggest loss in more than two years as Japan’s
Keidanren business lobby reassured investors that the nuclear
situation in the country may be stabilizing. The baht has gained
0.6 percent this month, the best performance among  Asia ’s 10
most-traded currencies excluding the yen, as overseas investors
bought $209 million more Thai shares than they sold, exchange
data show.  “The regional stock markets are rebounding and that is
leading to some buying of Asian currencies,” said  Tsutomu Soma ,
a bond and currency trader at Okasan Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“Most markets in the region saw panic selling yesterday and
players probably thought that was too much. A rebound may be
limited because the nuclear issue won’t be easily settled
soon.”  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent to 30.41 per dollar as of
4:00 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency dropped 0.6 percent yesterday, the most since Jan.
28.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, rose 4.5 basis points to
2.62 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015
climbed one basis point to 3.31 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
