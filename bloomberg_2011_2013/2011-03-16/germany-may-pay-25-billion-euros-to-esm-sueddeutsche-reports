  Germany  may have to contribute as
much as 25 billion euros ($35 billion) in capital to the
European Stability Mechanism,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing
unidentified government officials with knowledge of the deal.  The amount may be necessary to ensure that the European
Stability Mechanism receives the highest AAA ratings by credit
rating companies to ensure it can borrow money in the capital
markets at the best possible conditions, the German newspaper
reported in an article that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
