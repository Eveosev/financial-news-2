  Greece  will not collect take-off
and landing fees at airports, with the exception of Athens
International Airport, in an effort to boost tourism, Transport
Minister Dimitris Reppas said in an e-mailed statement today.  The fee exemptions will be in place from April 1 to Dec.
31, according to the statement. The government is aiming to
increase traffic at regional airports that typically serve
holiday destinations such as the islands of Rhodes, Mykonos and
Corfu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
