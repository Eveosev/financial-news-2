The Gulf Cooperation Council will
respond “firmly and with determination” to acts that threaten
the security and stability of its members, Al-Watan reported,
citing GCC Secretary-General Abdul Rahman al-Attiyah.  “The responsibility of maintaining Gulf security and
stability is a collective one,” Al-Watan quoted al-Attiyah as
saying. Al-Attiyah also said GCC countries reject any foreign
attempts to intervene in their affairs, Al-Watan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
