Czech, a car venture formed by automakers  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
PSA Peugeot Citroen, said it’s reviewing the possible impact of
the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accidents on its
vehicle production.  “We still need to confirm what’s the situation of some of
our suppliers,” the company’s spokesman Radek Knava said by
phone. Still, TPCA does not expect any “significant” impact on
its production as most car parts it uses are produced locally,
Knava said.  Japanese automakers and car part producers such as Nissan
Motor Co. or its affiliate Nissan Shatai Co. temporarily reduced
their operations and closed some facilities in  Japan  due to
power outages following the March 11 earthquake.  TPCA has “enough” stockpiles for vehicle production until
the end of the week, Knava said. The company expects to have
more information about further supplies today, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
