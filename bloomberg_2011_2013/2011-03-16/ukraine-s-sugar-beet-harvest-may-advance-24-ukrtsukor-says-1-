Ukraine’s sugar-beet harvest may
advance 24 percent to 17 million metric tons this year from 13.7
million tons in 2010 as farmers increase planting, said Mykola
Yarchuk, head of sugar producers’ group Ukrtsukor.  Sowing will probably rise to 570,000 hectares (1.4 million
acres), compared with 502,000 hectares last year, Yarchuk told
reporters today at an Adam Smith Conferences event in  Kiev , the
capital.  Production of refined sugar will probably be about 2.1
million tons, Yarchuk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
