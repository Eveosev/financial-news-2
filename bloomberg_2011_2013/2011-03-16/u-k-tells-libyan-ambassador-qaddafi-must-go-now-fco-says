The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth
Office Under-Secretary Simon Fraser told Libyan Ambassador Omar
Jelban that Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  “must relinquish
power immediately,” the FCO said in an e-mailed statement this
evening.  The meeting took place after Fraser summoned Jelban to the
FCO in London to discuss the situation in  Libya , the statement
said.  Fraser said the U.K. had “profound concern about the
Libyan regime’s ongoing attacks on civilians,” and that
“perpetrators of violence against civilians will be held to
account.”  The U.K. is also concerned about the “continued
harassment and detention of journalists in Libya,” the
statement said.  The U.K. will remain in “close contact” with the Libyan
opposition through a “range of groups both inside out of the
country who we consider to be legitimate political
interlocutors,” the FCO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
