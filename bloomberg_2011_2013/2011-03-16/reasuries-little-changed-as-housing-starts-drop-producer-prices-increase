Treasuries were little changed
after reports showed housing starts fell and producer prices
increased last month.   Prices of U.S. government securities had fluctuated as
tremors continued to rattle  Japan  and the nationâ€™s nuclear
crisis deepened. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes were little
changed at 3.30 percent at 8:32 a.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
