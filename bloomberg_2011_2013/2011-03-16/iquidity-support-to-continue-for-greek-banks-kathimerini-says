  Greece ’s central bank ruled out the
possibility of the country’s commercial lenders buying back
preference shares held by the state any time soon,  Kathimerini 
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  Bank of Greece  decided that under the current financial
climate, the country’s lenders aren’t ready for the withdrawal
of the liquidity support package agreed in May, the Athens-based
newspaper said.  The largest stakes held by the state are in  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and Alpha Bank SA, each with 950 million euros ($1.3
billion), with the government also holding shares in another
seven lenders, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
