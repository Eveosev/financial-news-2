Moqtada al-Sadr, a leading Shiite
Muslim cleric in  Iraq , called on his followers in Baghdad and
Basra to march in support of Shiite protesters in  Bahrain , said
an Iraqi lawmaker who is close to al-Sadr.  “We stand firmly with the Bahraini people, and condemn the
foreign intervention in the affairs of Bahrain and the sending
of military forces to counter the will of the people of
Bahrain,” Mashriq al-Naji said today in an interview.  Separately, Iraqi parliament speaker Osama Nujaifi, a
Sunni, called on the government to formulate an Iraqi stance on
events in Bahrain. “I will meet tomorrow with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Hoshyar Zebari to study our position,” he said.  Bahrain yesterday declared a three-month state of emergency
after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states arrived to
help quell a month of protests driven by majority Shiites,
calling on the Sunni monarch to expand democracy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
