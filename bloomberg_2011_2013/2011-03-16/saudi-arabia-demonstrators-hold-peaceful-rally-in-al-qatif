About 1,000 people in  Saudi
Arabia ’s eastern city of al-Qatif defied a ban on demonstrations
and protested peacefully to demand the country’s troops end
their incursion into Bahrain.  Protesters chanted and held signs that called on the
government to stay out of Bahrain, according to Ali Hassan, 26,
who took part in the march. He said the march veered away from
security forces to avoid a confrontation.  A separate protest was held in the city of Awwamiya,
according to Jasim al-Awwami, 27, who participated in it.  Regional unrest, which has toppled the leaders of Tunisia
and  Egypt , has reached Saudi Arabia’s neighbors Yemen, Oman and
Bahrain, the island-kingdom where a Sunni family rules the
majority Shiite population. In  Libya ,  Muammar Qaddafi  is
fighting rebels who seek to end his four-decade rule.  Bahrain’s Shiites make up about 70 percent of the
population and many retain cultural and family ties with  Iran ,
as well as with Shiites in Saudi Arabia, who are a minority of
about 10 to 15 percent.  Saudi Shiites have been holding protests every Thursday and
Friday for the past few weeks in towns and villages a short
drive from the Bahrain causeway connecting the two countries.  Bahrain security forces drove protesters from their
rallying point at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama yesterday
leaving two demonstrators and two police officers dead.  Bahrain Curfew  The military imposed a curfew on parts of Bahrain from 4
p.m. until 4 a.m. and banned protests and public gatherings
until further notice, an army spokesman said on state
television.  Bahrain this week declared a three-month state of emergency
after troops from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states arrived to
help quell a month of protests driven by Shiites, who are
calling for democracy and civil rights. Some groups have
escalated their demands to include the overthrow of the Sunni
rulers, the Al Khalifa family, and the creation of a republic.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 80 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $97.98 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile

applies a strict version of Sunni Islam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
