Insurers and reinsurers will
probably sustain losses of $12 billion to $25 billion tied to
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , according to
catastrophe modeling firm Eqecat.  The estimate, disclosed today in a statement from Eqecat,
falls short of a prediction of 1.2 trillion yen ($15 billion) to
2.8 trillion yen that rival modeler AIR Worldwide said would be
borne by the industry on the quake alone.  “This loss estimate encompasses the effects of earthquake
shaking, ensuing tsunami and fires, and losses to automobiles,
marine, life, and personal accident insurance lines,” Eqecat
said. Japanese property insurers may cede $2 billion to $4
billion in losses to a government reinsurance pool, Eqecat said.  Japanese insurers including  Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. (8766)  and
global reinsurance firms led by  Munich Re  and Swiss Reinsurance
Co. are assessing their losses and preparing to pay claims. The
earthquake, Japan’s strongest on record, and tsunami struck
north of  Tokyo , killing at least 3,771 people, destroying
property and triggering radiation leaks at a nuclear power
station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
