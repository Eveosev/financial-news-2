(Corrects repurchase rate in second paragraph.)    India ’s 11-year bonds fell as a
surge in money-market rates made it costlier for investors to
buy debt with borrowed funds.  The overnight call money rate rose to a four-month high of
7.15 percent, from 6.85 percent at the beginning of this week,
reflecting a shortage of cash in the banking system after
companies settled quarterly tax bills yesterday. The  Reserve
Bank  of India, which has raised its policy rates seven times in
the past year, will review borrowing costs tomorrow. All 24
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast the repurchase auction
rate will be increased by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent.  “There is some genuine shortage of funds as there have
been liquidity outflows due to advance tax payments,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in
Mumbai. “Tomorrow, the RBI is expected to raise rates again, so
that’s also factored into the call money rate.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent bond due August 2022 rose one
basis point to 8.09 percent as of 10:02 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
