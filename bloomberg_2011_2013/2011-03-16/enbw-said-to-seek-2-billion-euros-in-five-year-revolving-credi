  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,  Germany ’s third-largest utility, is seeking a 2 billion-euro
($2.8 billion) facility to replace an existing credit line, a
person familiar with the deal said.  EnBW is offering initial interest of 42.5 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate on money drawn from the
five-year revolving credit, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information is private. Lenders will get
a commitment fee equal to 35 percent of the interest margin, the
person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A press officer at Karlsruhe-based EnBW didn’t return an e-
mail and a phone call seeking comment. The new transaction will
refinance a facility signed in 2005, the person said.  Standard & Poor’s rates EnBW’s debt A-. Moody’s Investors
ranks it A2. Fitch Ratings grades it A.  To contact the reporter on this story:
