  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,
Europe’s third-biggest insurer, expects higher profit and
margins this year, boosted by growth in the non-life segment.  The insurer targets 2011 operating income between 4 billion
euros ($5.6 billion) and 4.7 billion euros, from 4.1 billion
euros in 2010. Generali expects operating income of as much as
3.2 billion euros in the life segment and as much as 1.7 billion
euros in the non-life area, according to a slide presentation on
its website.  “Operating profit and net profit guidance for 2011 are
bullish good news,”  Fabrizio Croce , a Zurich-based analyst with
Kepler Capital Markets and who has a “hold” recommendation on
the stock, said by phone.  Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto is trying to
expand in emerging markets and eastern  Europe  to boost profit
following the global financial crisis. The Trieste, Italy-based
company said today its fourth-quarter profit fell 6 percent,
hurt by a higher tax rate.  “In the life sector the group expects to confirm the
ambitious production levels of 2010,” Generali said in a
statement. “In the non-life business area, the group expects to
confirm the premium growth rates of 2010.”  Profit Drop  Net income in the fourth quarter declined to 389 million
euros ($543 million) from 414 million euros a year earlier,
missing the 416 million-euro average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Generali will propose a dividend of 45
cents a share from 35 cents.  The insurer’s  tax rate  last year increased to 33.2 percent
from 24.9 percent a year earlier.  Generali fell 2.9 percent to 14.54 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 22.6 billion euros.  Generali’s operating profit in the fourth quarter rose 19
percent to 944 million euros. Non-life operating income gained
18 percent to 246 million euros, while the operating profit in
the life segment climbed 20 percent to 731 million euros.  Full-year profit rose 30 percent to 1.7 billion euros,
while operating income increased 12 percent to 4.1 billion
euros. The combined ratio, or spending on claims and costs as a
percentage of premiums, increased to 98.8 from 98.3 in 2009,
signaling that the company’s insurance underwriting is less
profitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
