Taiwan’s government bonds snapped a
five-day advance after the island’s stock index recovered from
yesterday’s slump.  Benchmark 10-year yields rebounded from a four-month low on
speculation the selloff in local stocks, driven by  Japan ’s
earthquake and nuclear accidents, was excessive. Problems at a
nuclear plant north of  Tokyo  may be stabilizing,  Hiromasa
Yonekura , chairman of Japan’s Keidanren business lobby, told
reporters in Tokyo today.  “Sentiment has stabilized on equities for now so we see
less demand for debt today,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based
bond trader at Polaris Securities Co. “But any bad news from
Japan could trigger another round of sell-offs.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021,
the most traded government debt, rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.355 percent as of the 1:30 p.m.
close, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate reached
1.326 percent yesterday, the lowest level for a benchmark 10-
year security since Nov. 16.    Taiwan ’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.556 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, compared with NT$29.559
yesterday, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The Taiex index of
shares rallied 1.1 percent, following a 3.4 percent drop
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
