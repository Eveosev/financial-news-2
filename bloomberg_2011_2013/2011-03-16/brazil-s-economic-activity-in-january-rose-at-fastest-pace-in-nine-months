  Brazil ’s economic activity index
rose at its fastest pace in nine months in January, suggesting
the economy may be cooling less than analysts had forecast.  Economic activity, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose
0.71 percent in January from the previous month, according to
the central bank’s seasonally adjusted index. That compares with
a revised increase of 0.11 percent in December and is the
quickest pace since April 2010.  Traders are wagering that the bank will boost borrowing
costs by 0.5 percentage point for a third straight meeting April
19-20, to cool inflation that is running at a 26-month high,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.
The faster-than-expected growth may lead policy makers to
lengthen the cycle of rate increases, said Enestor  Dos Santos ,
senior Brazil economist for BBVA in  Madrid .  “The figure released today reinforces the risk that the
economy will refrain from moderating,” Dos Santos said in an
emailed report.  Economic activity rose 5.14 percent from a year ago,
according to the non-seasonally adjusted series, from 3.71
percent in December.  Lower Forecast  Latin America’s largest economy expanded 7.5 percent in
2010, its fastest pace since 1985, after registering year-on-
year growth of more than 9 percent in the first and second
quarters.  Analysts covering the Brazilian economy cut their 2011
economic growth forecast for a third straight week in a March 11
central bank survey. Gross domestic product will expand 4.1
percent this year, down from a week earlier forecast of 4.29
percent, the survey found.  Since the survey was taken, the Labor Ministry published a
report showing that Brazil generated 280,799 registered jobs in
February, a record for the month, beating the 195,450 median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts.  January retail sales also beat estimates and rose at their
fastest pace in five months, fueled by supermarket sales and
purchases of household goods. Sales rose 1.2 percent in January
from December, up from a revised 0.2 percent the previous month.  “Industrial output may be weak, but other sectors such as
agriculture, retail and services, which are covered by this
index, are performing OK,” said Elson Teles, chief economist at
Maxima Asset Management SA., speaking by telephone from  Rio de
Janeiro .  Teles had forecast an increase of 0.4 percent in the
seasonally adjusted figure.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
12.30 percent at 1:08 p.m. New York time.  The central bank raised  interest rates  twice this year, to
11.75 percent, in a bid to slow demand that has pushed inflation
to a 26-month high. Domestic demand is fueling a “new growth
cycle” for the Brazilian economy after the financial crisis of
2008 and 2009, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said
March 3.  Annual inflation quickened to 6.01 percent in February, the
fastest pace since November 2008. The central bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
