An exchange-traded fund designed to
let investors bet against Japanese equities more than quadrupled
in size as clients poured in money following the country’s worst
earthquake on record.  The $54.5 million UltraShort MSCI  Japan  ProShares fund,
which returns twice the inverse of Japanese stocks, created
975,000 new shares in the last three trading days, bringing its
shares outstanding to 1.35 million, according to the fund’s
sponsor, ProShares Advisors LLC. Its share price has risen 22
percent since the quake as of 10:22 a.m. in NYSE Arca trading.  Investors have fled Japanese stocks, sending the MSCI Japan
Index 12 percent lower since the day before the 9.0-magnitude
temblor. The quake and subsequent tsunami created Japan’s worst
crisis since World War II. The index rose 6.6 percent today.  ETFs, most of which track an index, trade on an exchange
throughout the day like stocks. Large buy orders are made
through authorized agents who purchase blocks of the underlying
holdings and trade them with the fund to create new shares.
Large sell orders result in share redemptions and fewer
outstanding shares.  UltraShort  MSCI Japan (MXJP)  is the only inverse fund among 100
ETFs tracked by Bloomberg that invest primarily in Japan and
have reported returns. The fund added 75,000 shares on March 11,
375,000 on March 14 and 525,000 yesterday, Ray Ahn, a spokesman
for Bethesda, Maryland-based ProShares said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
