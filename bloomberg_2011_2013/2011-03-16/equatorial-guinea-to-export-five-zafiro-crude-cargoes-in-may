  Equatorial Guinea  will export five
cargoes of Zafiro crude in May, one more than April, according
to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The May shipping plan will total 5 million barrels, or
161,290 barrels a day. This compares with 4 million barrels or
133,333 barrels a day in April. The cargoes are for 1 million
barrels each.  Equatorial Guinea produced 307,000 barrels a day of oil in
2009, according to BP Plcâ€™s Statistical Review of World Energy.  Zafiro blend consists of oil from the Zafiro, Jade, Opalo,
Sausage and Serpentira fields off Equatorial Guinea on the West
African coast. The crude is produced jointly by Exxon Mobil
Corp., Ocean Equatorial Guinea Corp. and the government of
Equatorial Guinea.  The loading schedule for Ceiba crude has yet to be
released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
