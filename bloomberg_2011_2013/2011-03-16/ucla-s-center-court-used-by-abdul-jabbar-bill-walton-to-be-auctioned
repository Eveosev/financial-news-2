The center-jump section of the
Pauley Pavilion court where Hall of Fame coach  John Wooden ’s
UCLA basketball teams compiled a 148-2 record is being auctioned
off.  The 12-foot diameter section will be offered next month as
part of an internet sale presented by  SCP Auctions, Inc. , with a
$25,000 minimum bid.  The original court, which was installed in 1965, was home
to eight of the  University of California ,  Los Angeles ’s 10
National Collegiate Athletic Association championship teams
under Wooden.  The jump circle has been preserved in storage since its
replacement in 1982. In 1998, it was displayed for an event at
Pauley Pavilion and signed by Wooden and former players  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  -- known as Lew Alcindor during his time at UCLA --
Bill Walton, Sidney Wicks and Walt Hazzard.  The court section is being sold by an unidentified UCLA
alumnus and a large portion of the proceeds will be dedicated to
funding medical research, SCP said. The auction will be open to
registered bidders from April 15 to 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
