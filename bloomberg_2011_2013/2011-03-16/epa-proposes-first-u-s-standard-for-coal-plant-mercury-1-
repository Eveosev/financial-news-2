The Obama administration proposed
rules limiting toxins such as mercury and acid gases spewed into
the air from coal-fired power plants, clearing the way for the
first U.S. standards for such pollutants.  The regulations would require many power plants to install
“widely available, proven pollution control technologies” to
cut emissions such as mercury, arsenic, chromium and acid gases,
the Environmental Protection Agency said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The EPA, which was under court order to craft a rule after
former President  George W. Bush ’s mercury standard was declared
unlawful, said the rules will prevent as many as 17,000
premature deaths. The standards would also create construction
and utility jobs, the agency said.  “Today’s announcement is 20 years in the making, and is a
significant milestone in the  Clean Air Act ’s already
unprecedented record of ensuring our children are protected from
the damaging effects of toxic air pollution,” EPA Administrator
Lisa Jackson said in a statement.  Utility owners such as New Orleans-based  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  have
said they are concerned about the cost of controls they may have
to install to cut acid gases.  “If you set a stringent level for acid gases, that might
be what triggers the requirement that our facilities put in
scrubbers,” Chuck Barlow, Entergy’s assistant general counsel
for environmental law, said in an interview yesterday.  “There seems to be a pretty big debate among scientists
about whether there is any health impact from these acid
gases,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
