  South Korea ’s  Financial Supervisory
Service  said it asked police and the operator of the nation’s
stock exchange to investigate rumors that contributed to the
plunge in Korean shares yesterday.  The benchmark Kospi Index fell 2.4 percent yesterday, the
biggest drop since November.  Japan ’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said yesterday there was a danger of further radiation leaks
after the country’s worst earthquake on record.  The financial regulator requested that Korea Exchange Inc.
determine whether there were irregular trades yesterday, while
police will track the source of rumors spread on Internet
messaging services and Twitter that radiation would drift
towards South Korea from Japan by 4 p.m., Kim Soo Mi, an FSS
spokeswoman, said by telephone today.  “We’re trying to see if someone was trying to manipulate
stock prices by spreading the information through those means,”
she said.  FSS will decide whether it will begin its own investigation
depending on the outcome of the probe by police and the
exchange, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
