  Greece ’s benchmark ASE Index rose
20.65, or 1.3 percent, to 1,611.09 at the 5:20 p.m. close in
Athens, gaining for the fifth time out of the last six trading
sessions.  The FTSE/ASE 20 Index of the country’s biggest companies
added 1.4 percent to 752.25. The Cyprus General Market Index
added 0.3 percent to 1,059.86.  The following shares were among the most active in Athens
trading today. Symbols are in parentheses.  Alpha Bank SA (ALPHA GA) rose 3.7 percent to 5.10 euros,
after dropping 6.3 percent the previous day. Alpha Bank’s
rejection of a merger offer from  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)   may be a ‘sit and wait’ tactic to negotiate better terms in
the event of a likely sovereign debt restructuring, Mediobanca
said in a report today. National Bank’s stock added 1.5 percent
to 6.92 euros.  Mediobanca also initiated coverage on Alpha and National
Bank with a “neutral” rating. It also initiated coverage 
for  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)   and EFG Eurobank Ergasias (EUROB
GA) with an “underperform” rating. Piraeus Bank gained 2
percent to 1.54 euros. Eurobank added 2.1 percent to 4.95 euros.  Bank of Cyprus Pcl (BOC GA), Cyprus’s largest bank dropped
1.1 percent to 2.75 euros, falling for a second day. The Cypriot
banking system and the economy as a whole will face continuing
difficulties this year, Stockwatch cited  Hellenic Bank Pcl (HB)   Chief Executive Officer Makis Keravnos as saying. The stock
for Hellenic Bank dropped 2.2 percent to 88 cents.    Forthnet SA (FORTH)   dropped 5.8 percent to 49 cents,
falling for a second day. Greece’s second-biggest web services
provider posted a net loss of 86.8 million euros ($121.4
million) from 41.2 million euros in the same period a year
earlier, according to an e-mailed statement from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
