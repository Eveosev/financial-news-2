The Slovak government approved a
plan to revamp and partially sell state railways as it seeks to
raise revenue and cut subsidies to the ailing industry.  The plan envisages the elimination of about 5,000 jobs, or
one-sixth of the workforce, within three years and other
austerity measures at state railway companies, Transportation
Minister Jan Figel said after a Cabinet meeting in Bratislava,
Slovakia, today.  The government will sell 66 percent of the cargo unit,
ZSSK Cargo, and wants to pick a buyer by June 2012, he said.  The companies, which include also an operator of the rail
track and a passenger unit, have accumulated losses of 353
million euros ($491 million) and need to repay the state 236
million euros in loans, according to the ministry  document .  To contact the reporter on this story:
