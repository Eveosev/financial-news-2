Gold will probably attract buyers
on declines toward $1,325 an ounce with the medium-term bull
trend targeting a record $1,460 to $1,500 an ounce, according to  technical analysis  from  Barclays Capital .  “Failure to hold above support in the $1,390 area was not
unexpected,” according to a report from analysts including
Phil Roberts. “We would look to buy any dips toward support in
the $1,325 area. Our greater view remains bullish.”  Bullion for immediate delivery traded little changed at
$1,396.63 an ounce today after dropping to $1,381.22 yesterday,
the lowest level in a month. The price climbed to a record
$1,444.95 an ounce on March 7. Asian shares climbed for the
first time in five days, rallying from declines stoked by the
risk of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and radiation
leaks from a nuclear power station after  Japan ’s strongest
earthquake on record.  “A close back above $1,405 would encourage our bullish
view, although breaking above $1,435 is needed to confirm new
highs through $1,445,” the report said. “Breaking below the
50- and 100-day averages near $1,380 would increase the risk of
a deeper fall toward $1,360.”  In technical analysis, analysts study charts of trading
patterns to try to predict changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jason Scott  in Perth at
