U.S. ethanol production jumped 1.4
percent to 895,000 barrels a day last week, the biggest advance
in two months, according to the Energy Department.  Output rose to the highest level since the week ended Feb.
4 and the gain was the largest since Jan. 14, the department
said in a report released in  Washington . Stockpiles grew to

1.3 percent, to $2.375 a gallon at 10:45 a.m. New York time on
