The  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
has 110 agents examining corporate fraud and 233 looking at
securities fraud, said FBI Director Robert Mueller.  Mueller cited the statistics today at a House Judiciary
Committee hearing after Representative John Conyers, a Michigan
Democrat, questioned why there havenâ€™t been more cases stemming
from the U.S. financial crisis.  At the end of fiscal year 2010, the FBI had more than 2,300
open corporate and securities fraud investigations, Mueller said
in prepared  testimony .  To contact the reporter on this story:
