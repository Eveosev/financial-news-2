  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the
world’s biggest publicly traded surfwear maker, fell the most in
three months in Sydney trading after cutting its earnings
forecast on the impact of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami.  Billabong shares dropped as much as 6.3 percent to A$7.28,
the biggest decline on an intraday basis since Dec. 15. The
stock was trading 3.7 percent lower as of 11:05 a.m.  Annual earnings on a constant currency basis will fall as
much as 6 percent in the 12 months ending June, compared with
last month’s forecast for a little changed result, Gold Coast,
Australia-based Billabong said in a statement today. The company
had a net income of A$146 million ($145 million) in the year
earlier.  Billabong, which gets 60 percent of Japanese sales from
company-owned outlets, has shut 18 of the 44 stores it operates
in the country because of damage, loss of power or problems with
access. It’s also attempting to work with its 500 wholesale
customers to assess the impact “but preliminary discussions
indicate that many accounts are currently closed,” it said.  About two-thirds of its annual earnings in  Japan  are
generated in the four months between March and June.  “The company is now assuming that there will be a
significant shortfall in sales that were previously expected,”
it said in the statement. “Some insurance is in place in Japan
and while there is an expectation that some monies will be
recovered, this is highly unlikely to occur in the current
financial year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
