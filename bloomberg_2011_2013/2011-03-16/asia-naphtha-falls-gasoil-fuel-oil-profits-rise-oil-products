Asia naphtha capped the longest
losing streak in more than two months as petrochemical-plant
outages in  Japan  cut demand. Fuel-oil and gasoil refining
margins climbed.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan retreated
for a fourth day to $927 a metric ton, the longest decline since
Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, fell to $97.66 a ton from $108.07 at the end of
Asian trading yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  Refiners’ profits from turning  Brent crude  into benchmark
92-RON gasoline dropped after the price of cargoes for loading
from  Singapore  declined 1.5 percent to $114.25 a barrel.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, fell to $97.66 a ton from $108.07 at the end of
Asian trading yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha narrowed 20 cents to $12.90 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A narrower reforming margin means
the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is decreasing.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON
gasoline loading April 8 to April 12 from Glencore International
AG at $117.30 a barrel, traders said. Shell bought a 97-RON
cargo for loading March 31 to April 4 from ConocoPhillips at
$117.35 a barrel. Shell bought a third 97-RON cargo loading
April 2 to April 6 from BP Plc at $117.55 a barrel.  Shell bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half May
delivery from BP Plc at $928 a ton. Cargill Inc. bought a
similar naphtha cargo for delivery in the second half of May
from Glencore at $925 a ton. Vitol Group bought 25,000 tons of
first-half May naphtha from Koch Industries Inc. at $928 a ton.  Naphtha consumption in Japan may shrink by as much as
100,000 barrels a day on average this year, analysts at Vienna-
based JBC Energy GmbH said in a report today.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, declined for
the first time in three days. Prices dropped 1.2 percent to
$128.15 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jet
fuel  fell 1.4 percent to $129.75 a barrel.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
profit for the fuel, advanced to $24.09 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. The crack spread is at the widest since Sept. 26, 2008.  BP sold 120,000 barrels of jet fuel for loading April 5 to
April 9 to Vitol at a premium of 30 cents above prices published
by Platts, according to traders. BP sold another 120,000 barrels
for loading March 31 to April 4 to Vitol at a premium of 50
cents above Platts prices. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 100,000
barrels loading April 11 to April 15 from Shell at a premium of
50 cents.  BP also sold 200,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur to Glencore at a premium of 20 cents to Platts prices.
The cargo was for loading April 1 to April 5.  Vitol sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10-parts-per-
million of sulfur to Shell at a premium of $5.70 a barrel above
Platts prices for the 0.5-percent sulfur grade of gasoil, the
traders said.    Fuel Oil   Asian benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil fell 1.1 percent to
$643 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, declined 1
percent to $625 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
narrowed 57 cents to $4.37 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.
Losses from making the fuel are at the lowest since Feb. 16.  Vitol sold 40,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel oil to Lukoil
OAO at a premium of $6.50 above the average of Platts prices for
April.  Refinery News  JX Holdings Inc. resumed shipments by sea from its refinery
