Korea Resources Corp., a state-run
mineral explorer, signed a contract to explore an  iron ore  mine
in Peru as  South Korea  seeks to secure supplies of the raw
material used in steelmaking amid rising prices.  The Seoul-based company and a Peruvian operator, Ferrobamba,
will jointly invest $5 million on exploration work over the next
two years, Korea Resources said in an e-mailed statement today.
Under the contract terms, Korea Resources has the rights to take
a stake of as much as 40 percent in the mine when they embark on
development later, it said.  South Korea, which imports almost all its minerals, last
year purchased about 56 million metric tons of iron ore from
overseas, mostly from Australia and Brazil, an increase of about
14 million tons from 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
