Ghana  police are investigating the
delivery 600,000 barrels of crude oil to the West African
nationâ€™s Tema Oil Refinery last year, the Ghana News Agency
said.  A company that was paid $48 million by the refinery for the
oil may not have been the actual supplier of the crude, the
state-run news agency reported, citing Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa,
a deputy minister of information.  Three companies are claiming ownership of the shipment,
GNA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
