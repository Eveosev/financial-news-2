Portuguese government bonds opened
lower after Moody’s Investors Service reduced the nation’s
credit rating by two steps to A3.  The yield on the 10-year bond rose four basis points to
7.45 percent as of 8:34 a.m. in  London . That increased the
additional yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of benchmark German bunds by two basis points to 429
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
