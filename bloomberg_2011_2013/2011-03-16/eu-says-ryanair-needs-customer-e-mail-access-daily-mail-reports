  Michel Barnier , the European
Union’s financial services commissioner, said in a letter that
Ryanair’s communication policy is “incompatible” with an EU e-
commerce directive that requires such companies to have an e-
mail address accessible to customers, the  Daily Mail  reported
without saying to what or whom the letter was addressed.  Stephen McNamara, Ryanair’s head of communications,
confirmed that customers can’t contact the airline via e-mail,
the Daily Mail said.  A spokesman for the European Commission said Ireland’s
National Consumer Agency will have to take action or the EC
could take legal steps, the newspaper said.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
