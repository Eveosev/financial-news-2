U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Chairman Gregory Jaczko said all the water has drained from the
spent-fuel pool at a crippled nuclear reactor in  Japan ,
resulting in the release of high levels of radiation.  “We believe that the secondary containment has been
destroyed and there is no water in the spent-fuel pool,” Jaczko
said today at a hearing of a House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel.  The unit at the Fukushima Daiichi plant wasn’t operating at
the time of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Jaczko said.  The spent-fuel pool at the plant’s Unit 3, which was in
service, may be cracked and losing water, Jaczko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
