SK Innovation Co.,  South Korea ’s
biggest refiner, plans to buy 2 million barrels of crude from JX
Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. after last week’s magnitude-9 temblor
shut more than a quarter of  Japan ’s oil-processing capacity.  The crude is worth about $200 million and is already being
shipped from the Middle East, the Seoul-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. SK didn’t say how much it plans to pay
for the oil.  The March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami has shut
about 1.3 million barrels a day of refining capacity in Japan,
data from the Petroleum Association of Japan show. JX Energy
closed refineries in Sendai and Kashima in the northeast.  SK will ship 260,000 barrels of gasoline, equivalent to 25
percent of Japan’s daily consumption, to JX Energy, the South
Korean refiner said, without disclosing the value of the sale.  The refiner will also export 10,000 metric tons of  fuel oil 
for electricity generation to Tohoku Electric Power Co., the
company said, without giving a monetary value.  South Korea will divert to Japan an unspecified volume of
liquefied natural gas that it was to receive between March and
April, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said on March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
