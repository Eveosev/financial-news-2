  RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR) , the
Bermuda-based reinsurer, said the cost to the company from last
week’s earthquake in  Japan  will be “significant and is likely
to be material.”  It is too early to estimate the tally, the company said
today in a Business Wire statement. Costs from Australia floods
and a February earthquake in  New Zealand  will reduce first-
quarter earnings by a combined $220 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
