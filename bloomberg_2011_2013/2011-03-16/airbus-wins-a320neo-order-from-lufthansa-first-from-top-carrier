Airbus SAS won an order for 30 of
its new A320neo-series planes from  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  valued
at about $2.8 billion at list price, the fourth commitment for
the model and the first from a top global carrier.  The contract specifies 25 standard A320neos and five larger
A321s, Cologne, Germany-based Lufthansa said today in a
statement. The aircraft will be delivered from 2016, it said.  Lufthansa, which also ordered five  Boeing Co. (BA)  777 cargo
planes worth $1.35 billion, is renewing its fleet to cut costs
and replace smaller regional planes with larger models. The neo,
a version of Airbus’s existing short-haul jet fitted with new
engines, will burn 15 percent less kerosene, the airline said.  “Besides greater fuel efficiency, all the models on order
will help lower operating costs as well as noise levels and
emissions,” Lufthansa said. “The orders are yet further steps in
Lufthansa’s ongoing fleet modernization and expansion policy.”  Airbus’s contract from Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-largest
airline, comes as Chicago-based Boeing ponders an upgrade of the
competing 737 model.  Randy Tinseth , director of marketing at the
U.S. company’s commercial airplanes group, has said the matter
will be decided by the summer.  Success in the single-aisle market is critical because
Airbus and Boeing derive the bulk of their earnings from the
aircraft. Airbus, the planemaking unit of European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co., predicted in December that it could sell as
many as 4,000 of the modified A320 planes over 15 years.  Virgin, Tam  The Lufthansa order comes after India’s IndiGo pledged in
January to buy 150 A3230neos and U.K. billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin America Inc. said the same month it would buy
30 of the revamped planes and 30 of the current model. Brazil’s
Tam SA followed last month, saying it had ordered 22 neos.  A geared turbofan engine built by  United Technologies
Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit and the Leap-X from  CFM
International , the venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF) 
of France, are the choices for powering the A320neo.  Lufthansa’s statement didn’t specify a choice of engine.
The carrier is already a customer for Bombardier Inc.’s CSeries
short-haul plane, which will use the Pratt & Whitney powerplant.  Lufthansa’s main-brand airline had 228 narrow-body jets in
its fleet as of Sept. 30, according to its quarterly report,
including 117 from Airbus’s A320 series. The 777 freighters will
be added from 2013, it said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
