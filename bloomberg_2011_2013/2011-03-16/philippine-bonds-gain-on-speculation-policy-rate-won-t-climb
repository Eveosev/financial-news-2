Philippine bonds rose on
speculation increasing risks to a sustained global recovery will
convince the central bank to delay raising borrowing costs.  The monetary authority is closely watching global
developments to see whether it needs to adjust its policy rate
next week, Governor Amando Tetangco said today. The tone of his
statement is “less hawkish” compared to March 4, when he said
the scope for keeping rates steady had narrowed, according to
Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president for treasury at Chinatrust
Philippines Commercial Bank Corp. The peso advanced.  “The governor may be scaling back expectations of a rate
hike a bit, with all the new headwinds for the global and
domestic economy,” said Manila-based Bernardo-Recto.  The yield on the 7 percent January 2016 bond fell three
basis points to 6.08 percent as of 5:03 p.m. in  Manila , the
lowest level since Feb. 10, according to data from Tradition
Financial Services Inc.  “We are monitoring the effects of recent events on global
commodity prices, investor risk appetite and on domestic
inflation expectations to see if there is any need to adjust our
policy stance during our next meeting,” Tetangco said in a
mobile-phone message today. Policy makers next meet on March 24.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 43.735 per dollar at the 4
p.m. close of trading in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc.  To contact the reporter for this story:
