S&T Bancorp, the Pennsylvania
lender that took a $109 million government bailout in 2009, cut
reported earnings for last year after finding a “material
weakness” in how it accounts for loan charge-offs.  The error forced the company to more than double its
provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter to $7.68
million, S&T said today in a statement. As a result, earnings
per share for the last three months of 2010 were 31 cents, not
the 41 cents originally reported, the  Indiana , Pennsylvania-
based company said.  “S&T determined that a modification of a participation loan
had not been properly recorded in the second quarter of 2010,”
the bank said in the statement. “Management is taking the
necessary steps to remediate this material weakness.”  For all of 2010, the revisions reduced earnings per share
to $1.34 from the $1.44 the bank first reported.  S&T, led by Chief Executive Officer Todd Brice, operates 51
offices in 10 Pennsylvania counties and has $4.1 billion in
assets. Shares of the bank have dropped 4.8 percent this year on
the Nasdaq Stock Market after gaining 33 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
