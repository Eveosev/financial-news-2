  Visa Inc. (V)  says it’s fixed the
problem that prevented people from booking tickets for the  2012
London Olympics  by  credit card .  Fans with Visa cards that expired before the end of August
were unable to process applications yesterday as 6.6 million
tickets went on public sale.  Visa, the world’s biggest electronic payments network, said
starting March 21 all of the company cards with an expiration
date of May 2011 or later will be accepted by the London Games’
ticket application website.  “Any Visa cardholders with an April expiry date will
receive a replacement card before the ticket registration
deadline of 26th April,” the company said in a statement.
“This means that all Visa cardholders will be able to apply for
tickets before the 26 April deadline.”  Visa is an Olympics sponsor and the only card that can be
used to buy tickets for the  London  Games. Tickets are issued on
a first-come, first-served basis so any registration taking
place before the deadline will have an equal chance of success
in the ballot, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
