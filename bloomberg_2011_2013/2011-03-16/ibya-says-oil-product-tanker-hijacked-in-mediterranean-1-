GNMTC, a shipping line owned by  Libya , said one of its tankers was hijacked by an armed group
probably linked to rebels in the east of the country.  The Anwaar Afriqya, with a crew of 22, was diverted to the
port of Tobruk near the border with Egypt, where it is now
docked, GNMTC said in an e-mailed statement. The ship holds
23,800 metric tons of gasoline loaded in  Greece , GNMTC said.  “This piracy operation must have been planned with the
assistance of high technology and sophisticated positioning
equipment plus vessel departure and loading information,” the
company said in its statement.  Forces loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  moved into
Ajdabiya, a city about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the rebel
capital of Benghazi. Group of Eight foreign ministers failed to
agree yesterday on imposing a no-fly zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
