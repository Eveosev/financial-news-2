  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , two British banks, shut their branches in Bahrain
as clashes between security forces and anti-government
protesters intensified.  HSBC has closed its four branches in Manama, citing
concerns for the safety of its 334 employees, according to an e-
mailed statement today. Standard Chartered, which employs 500
people in Bahrain, shut all seven of its branches, a spokesman
said by telephone from Dubai today.  Clashes between mainly Shiite Muslim protesters demanding
democracy through elections and forces from their Sunni
government escalated on March 13, leaving more than 100 people
injured. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa declared a three-month
state of emergency yesterday to quell the violence.  All automatic teller machines are stocked and functioning,
while internet banking and call centers are operating normally,
HSBC said.  Standard Chartered ’s call center in the country is
also functioning and wholesale and private banking clients can
call their relationship managers at home, the spokesman said.
Both banks are based in London.  Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet and its
ruling family has close links with Saudi Arabia, a key ally of
the U.S. in its attempts to halt  Iran’s nuclear program .  Reuters reported the closures earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
