President  Barack Obama  urged
basketball fans to take a break from filling out brackets
predicting college basketball tournament winners to visit the
U.S. Agency for International Development’s website and consider
making a donation “to help the people who have been devastated
in Japan.”  “Go to usaid.gov and that’s going to list a whole range of
charities where you can potentially contribute,” Obama said
during an interview for broadcast later today on ESPN, where he
reveals his own choices for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association’s basketball championship, an event promoted as
March Madness. “I think that would be a great gesture as you’re
filling out your brackets.”  “This is a great tradition, we have fun every year doing
it,” Obama said of the college basketball tournament. “But
while you’re doing it, if you’re on your laptop,” consider
making a contribution, Obama said.  Obama predicted that the four top-seeded teams -- the
University of Kansas,  Duke University ,  Ohio State University ,
and the University of Pittsburgh -- will reach the semi-finals,
known as the Final Four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
