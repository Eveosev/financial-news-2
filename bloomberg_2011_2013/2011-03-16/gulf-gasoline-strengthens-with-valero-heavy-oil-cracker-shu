Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a heavy oil cracker for repairs at its
Corpus Christi West refinery in Texas.  The 92,000-barrel-a-day unit is being repaired and the
outage “is not expected to be a lengthy,”  Bill Day , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.25 cent to 12.75 cents versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:10 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
4.93 cents to $2.7222 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor held at a discount of 17.5
cents against futures.  Heavy oil crackers convert heavy residue, such as asphalt
and heavy gasoil, from a vacuum distillation unit into light oil
products such as gasoline, naphtha and gasoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
