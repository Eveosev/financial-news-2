  Australia ’s dollar strengthened,
rebounding from a four-month low against the yen, as Asian
stocks rallied and the Bank of  Japan  injected funds into the
financial system to revive confidence after the nation’s biggest
earthquake on record.  The so-called Aussie climbed against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts after Japan’s central bank added 5 trillion yen
($62 billion) into the financial system, a third day of
injections. Demand for  New Zealand ’s dollar was limited after
Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s
largest dairy exporter, said whole milk powder prices fell at an
auction for the first time in five months.  “The BOJ’s monetary easing stance is likely to halt the
yen’s further appreciation,” said  Koji Fukaya , chief currency
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo. “Investors are
encouraged to buy back some high-yielding currencies as they
think Japanese stocks hit bottom yesterday.”  Australia’s dollar gained to 80.29 yen as of 5:17 p.m. in
Sydney from 79.99 yen in  New York  yesterday, when it reached
79.28 yen, the lowest since Nov. 1. The currency traded at 99.38
U.S. cents from 99.10 yesterday, when it touched 98.16 cents,
the weakest since Jan. 12.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 73.25 U.S. cents from 73.18
cents, and bought 59.20 yen from 59.07 yen.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 5.7 percent,
rallying from yesterday’s 11 percent plunge. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index advanced 3.1 percent today.  Nuclear Plant  The Australian dollar weakened yesterday on speculation
Japanese investors will repatriate assets amid a nuclear crisis
following last week’s earthquake and tsunami. A fire broke out
at the No. 4 reactor of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant north of
Tokyo today, where engineers are battling to contain the spread
of radiation.  “It’s all about what’s happening at Fukushima nuclear
plant,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac Banking Corp. “That’s what the market is
going to focus on until we sees stability in that situation."  Fonterra said whole milk powder prices fell 12.9 percent
from two weeks earlier, according to auction results published
today.  An index of consumer confidence in New Zealand dropped to
101.4 in March from 108.1 in February, according to data today
by Roy Morgan Research and  ANZ National Bank Ltd .  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
