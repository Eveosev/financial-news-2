Japanese Emperor Akihito expressed
condolences to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami that
devastated the nation’s northern Pacific coast.  In an address to the nation on public television today, he
thanked those assisting in rescue and rebuilding efforts.  “I hope as many people as possible will be confirmed
safe,” he said. “By mustering all or our strength for a swift
rescue effort, I can only wish for even the smallest improvement
in the situation of the victims, to provide hope for
restoration.”  The magnitude-9 earthquake that struck on March 11 left
hundreds of thousands stranded and without power, with
disruptions to food and water deliveries sparking panic buying.  More than 3,600 people have been confirmed dead, with 7,558
missing. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  earlier called for calm as he
dispatched 100,000 armed forces personnel to region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
