The U.S. Commodity Future Trading
Commission plans to start finalizing derivatives regulation
under the Dodd-Frank Act with definitions for swap dealers and
major users of swaps, Chairman  Gary Gensler  said.  The CFTC plans to divide the rules into three groups, with
some rules slated for adoption later in the summer or fall,
Gensler said in remarks prepared for a videoconference at the
annual Futures Industry Association conference in  Boca Raton ,
Florida. The regulations are required by mid-July under the
financial-overhaul law, and Gensler has said some of the rules
may need more time.  Gensler said rules defining capital and margin requirements
in swaps transactions may be among the latest rules to be
finalized by the CFTC. “Rules in the late group probably will
not be considered until the late summer and early fall,”
Gensler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
