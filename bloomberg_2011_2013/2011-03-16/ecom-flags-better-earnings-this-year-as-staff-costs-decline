  Mecom Group Plc (MEC)  said today it
expects to increase profit this year and cut its debt further as
staff reductions help boost earnings.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 28 percent to 155.5 million euros ($217
million) in the year ended Dec. 31, the London-based media
company said in a statement. Net debt fell 62.7 million euros to
310.7 million euros.  “We expect to make continued improvement in EBITDA,” the
company said in today’s statement. “We expect to make further
good progress in reducing net debt.”  Mecom plans to start making dividend payments in the second
half of this year as the company begins to look for growth
opportunities after restructuring its business, Chairman Stephen Davidson, said in a phone interview. Mecom said today costs fell
by 5 percent last year, following a 10 percent fall in 2009.  Mecom fell as much 3.7 percent to 240.75 pence as of 9:53
a.m. in  London , after earlier rising by as much as 5.1 percent.
The company’s staff headcount is down about 600 people including
the effect of disposals, the company said today.  The company, which controls newspapers in the Netherlands
and Scandinavia, is “comfortable” with analyst estimates of
between 163 million euros and 167 million euros in EBITDA for
this year, Finance Director Henry Davies said on the same call.  “We are in very good shape with our banks,” Davidson
said. “In each of the countries we operate we see a number of
very good opportunities both organically and potentially through
contiguous acquisitions.”  Davidson said that the company hasn’t made any “conclusive
decisions” on who will be the company’s next chief executive
officer. David Montgomery, company founder and former CEO, left
the company in January after agreeing to retire following
pressure from some investors.  Advertising revenue fell 4 percent to 656.3 million euros
last year, while circulation revenue rose 1 per cent to 564.1
million euros. Adjusted earnings per share rose 6.5 euro cents
to 44 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
