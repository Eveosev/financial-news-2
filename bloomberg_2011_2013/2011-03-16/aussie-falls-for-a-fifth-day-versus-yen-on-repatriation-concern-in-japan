  Australia ’s dollar fell for a fifth
straight day against the yen on concern that Japanese investors
would repatriate funds as the country’s nuclear crisis worsened.  The rally that pushed the yen to the strongest since April
1995 against the  U.S. dollar  prompted speculation the Bank of
Japan may intervene for the first time since September in an
effort to counter repatriation flows and shore up the
competitiveness of Japanese companies. The Aussie fell against
12 of its 16 major counterparts after Japan’s central bank added
5 trillion yen ($62 billion) into the financial system, a third
day of injections.  “It’s all about what’s happening at Fukushima nuclear
plant,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac Banking Corp. “That’s what the market is
going to focus on until we sees stability in that situation.”  Australia’s dollar fell 1.5 percent to 78.79 yen at 3:18
p.m. in New York from 79.99 yen yesterday, when it reached 79.28
yen, the lowest since Nov. 1. The currency traded at 99.37 U.S.
cents from 99.10 yesterday, when it touched 98.16 cents, the
weakest since Jan. 12.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 72.92 U.S. cents from 73.18
cents, and bought 58.37 yen from 59.07 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
