Medine Sugar Estates Ltd., a
Mauritian producer of the sweetener, said output may fall as
much as 8.7 percent to 42,000 metric tons this season as drought
hampers cane growth.  Cane height is currently “lagging behind” normal levels,
spokeswoman Sophie Desvaux said by phone today from the capital,  Port Louis . The area under cane cultivation is the same as last
year, when the company produced 46,000 tons of sugar, she said.  Development of sugar cane this year is “significantly
below” the same stage last year, the Mauritius Sugar Industry
Research Institute said on March 6. The island nation may
produce 400,000 tons of the sweetener this year, 12 percent less
than in 2010, the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate has said, citing
industry estimates.  Sugar is Mauritius’s main crop, covering 80 percent of
areas under cultivation and representing about 63 percent of
agricultural exports, according to the Chamber of Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
