Former Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz will play in the Nationwide Tour’s  South Georgia Classic 
next month, the first time he will compete in a U.S.  PGA Tour 
co-sanctioned event.  Smoltz, who ended his career as the only pitcher in Major
League Baseball history with 200 wins and 150 saves, previously
attempted and failed to qualify for the  U.S. Open  and Georgia
Open.  He accepted a sponsor’s invitation to compete in the 156-
player tournament, set for April 28-May 1 at  Kinderlou Forest
Golf Club  in Valdosta, Georgia.  “I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes,” Smoltz said in
an interview on the Golf Channel this morning, according to a
news release from the PGA Tour. “I’m not looking to take
anybody’s spot who is aspiring to be a tour professional. I know
it’s not easy. I just want to see what it’s like.”  The 44-year-old Alpharetta,  Georgia , native finished second
in the 2010 American Century Championship in his first
appearance at the celebrity golf event in Lake Tahoe,  Nevada .  Smoltz last pitched in 2009, for the Boston Red Sox and St.
Louis Cardinals. He compiled a 213-155 record, with 154 saves
and a 3.33 earned run average, over 21 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
