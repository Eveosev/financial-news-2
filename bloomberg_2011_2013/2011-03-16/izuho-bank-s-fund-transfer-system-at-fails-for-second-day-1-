  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ’s
banking said it has resumed money transfers between accounts at
its 440 branches after failing for a second day in a row.  The system was restarted as of 11:15 a.m. after being down
at 9 a.m. today, said Tomohiro Sakauchi, a Mizuho spokesman. The
Tokyo-based bank is still investigating what caused the problem,
he said.  The system breakdowns follow a 9-magnitude earthquake that
struck  Japan  on March 11 and the power outages that followed the
country’s biggest temblor on record. There have been at least
405 aftershocks since the main quake, according to the  U.S.
Geological Survey .  The company currently does not believe the problem is
related to the quake or power supply issues, Sakauchi said  A similar failure yesterday from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.
prevented the bank from completing 380,000 transactions, valued
at 490 billion yen ($6.1 billion), Katsusuke Hirako, a spokesman
at Mizuho bank, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
