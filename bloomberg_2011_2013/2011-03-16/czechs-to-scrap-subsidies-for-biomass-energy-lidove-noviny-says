The Czech government is preparing a
new renewable energy law that will remove subsidies to most
biomass power plants,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Environment
Ministry spokeswoman Michaela Jendekova.  Producers who will not finish the construction of their
plant by the year end will not be eligible for the government
subsidies, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
