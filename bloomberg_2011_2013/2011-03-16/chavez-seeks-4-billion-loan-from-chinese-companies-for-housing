  Venezuela  signed an agreement with
Chinese companies Citic Group and  Industrial & Commercial Bank
of China (601398)  Ltd. to negotiate a $4 billion loan to finance oil and
construction projects, President  Hugo Chavez  said.  Citic International Contracting Inc., a unit of China’s
state-owned Citic Group, will build 20,000 housing units in
Venezuela and start a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela
SA to operate mature crude fields, Chavez said on state
television yesterday.  Chavez has boosted oil shipments to China to repay billions
of dollars in loans destined to finance infrastructure projects
in the South American country. Venezuela expects to increase oil
exports to about 1 million barrels a day in three years from the
current 400,000 barrels, Chavez said.  “We have all the oil that  China  needs for years to come
right here,” Chavez said during a meeting with officials from
the Chinese companies.  Venezuela’s Oil Ministry said the country had 296.5 billion
barrels of crude oil reserves at the end of 2010, according to
information published in the country’s Official Gazette.  PDVSA, as the state oil company is known, may work with
Citic to pump oil out of mature fields that have current
production of about 50,000 barrels a day in Anzoategui state,
company vice president Eulogio Del Pino said on state television
yesterday.  The $4 billion loan would be a “first installment” of
financing to build homes in the country, PDVSA said in a
statement.  Chavez signed agreements with China’s  XCMG Construction
Machinery Co Ltd (000425)  on March 14 to import hydraulic trucks to build
homes as he seeks to resolve a housing deficit that has
ballooned to 2 million units.  Bilateral  trade has surged  to $8.85 billion in 2009 from
$250.4 million in 2000, according to Venezuela’s Banco de
Comercio Exterior, the state-run trade bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
