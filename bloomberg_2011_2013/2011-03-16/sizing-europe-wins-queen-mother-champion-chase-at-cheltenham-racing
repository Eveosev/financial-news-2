Sizing  Europe , a 10-1 shot ridden
by Andrew Lynch, won the Queen Mother Champion Chase, the main
race on the second day of the centenary Cheltenham horseracing
festival.  The nine-year-old, trained by Henry de Bromhead in Ireland,
led from several fences out and saw off the challenge of last
year’s winner Big Zeb (3-1). Captain Cee Bee (14-1) was third.
Two-time champion Master Minded’s challenge faded after a
mistake at the second-last fence.  The two-mile race in western  England  carried a top prize of
182,400 pounds ($293,000).  “He traveled really well and I was afraid something might
just quicken past me up the straight, but he’s a hardy boy,”
Lynch told Channel 4. “Henry always said he wanted a strongly
run, two-mile race, and this is the only race all year that
suits him.”  Other winners today were Chicago Grey (5-1), First
Lieutenant (7-1), Bostons Angel (16-1), Carlito Brigante (16-1),
What A Charm (9-1) and Cheltenian (14-1).  The Cheltenham festival, one of the main events in the U.K.
jumps-racing calendar, ends on March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
