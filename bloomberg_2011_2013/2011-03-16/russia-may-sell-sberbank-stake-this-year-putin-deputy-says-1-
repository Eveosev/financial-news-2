  Russia ’s government may sell part
of its controlling stake in OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest
lender, this year, said Igor Shuvalov, one of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ‘s two first deputies.  “This year, if conditions are favorable, we might offer
the market Sberbank shares,” Shuvalov told reporters at a
conference in Moscow today. “We’re not going to hurry. We’re
going to do this work just as well as we did on VTB.”  There is a “good chance” the sale will happen this year
and be through a market placement,  Alexei Ulyukayev , a first
deputy chairman of the Russian central bank, said today. Bank
Rossii, which holds the state’s 60.3 percent stake in Sberbank,
may recommend that it increase dividends from its 2010 profit,
he told reporters.  The government plans to gain at least 1 trillion rubles
($35 billion) from selling assets over the next three years,
including $3.3 billion it raised in February for a 10 percent
stake in VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest bank. Economy
Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said earlier this week that the
Sberbank sale might not happen in 2011.  Sberbank climbed as much as 2.3 percent, the most since
March 3, before closing down 0.5 percent at 94.53 rubles in
Moscow.  The government is also considering selling its stakes in
OAO Sovcomflot, Russia’s largest shipper, and other companies
this year if market conditions are favorable, Shuvalov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
