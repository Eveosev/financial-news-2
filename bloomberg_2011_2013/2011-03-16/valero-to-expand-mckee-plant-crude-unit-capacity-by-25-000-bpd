  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  plans to expand
crude-unit capacity at its McKee refinery in Texas by 25,000
barrels a day over the next three years.  The expansion will increase the refineryâ€™s capacity to
195,000 barrels a day,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an
e-mail.  The plant will also process tens of thousands of barrels of
locally produced oil supplied through a gathering system that
Valero has been expanding, Day said. He declined to specify how
much. The expansion will be completed this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
