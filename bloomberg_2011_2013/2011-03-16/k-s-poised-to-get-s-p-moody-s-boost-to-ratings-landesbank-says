K+S AG,  Europe ’s biggest potash
producer, may have its credit ratings raised by  Standard &
Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service after financial metrics
improved and debt fell, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said.  “After the strong numbers for the fourth quarter we
reiterate our expectation that S&P will raise its rating, and
also see good chances for an upgrade by Moody’s,” Matthias Schell, a credit analyst at Stuttgart, Germany-based LBBW, said
in a note to clients.  A takeover offer for the company isn’t likely at the
moment, Schell said.  K+S is rated BBB at S&P’s, the second-lowest investment
grade rating, and was assigned a “positive” outlook on Jan.
17. Moody’s rates the company an equivalent Baa2 with a
“stable” outlook. The company on March 10 reported fourth-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and lifted its
outlook for sales this year.  While K+S may draw the attention of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  or
Rio Tinto Group after the amount of shares freely trading rose,
Schell said he does not currently expect either of them to bid
for K+S.  BASF SE (BAS)  on March 11 sold 19.7 million shares of K+S,
equal to 10.3 percent, the last remaining stake in its former
subsidiary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
