Felix Magath was dismissed as coach
of German soccer team Schalke 04 after a patchy season that has
left the club 10th in the Bundesliga, while reaching the
quarterfinals of the Champions League.  Magath, 57, who had a contract until 2013, was also the
club’s general manager. His firing was announced on Schalke’s
website after a supervisory board meeting that he didn’t attend.
He’s leaving with immediate effect.  “From FC Schalke’s point of view there are very good
reasons for this parting,” supervisory board chairman Clemens Toennies said on the website. “We will not communicate these
publicly because judicial proceedings are pending.”  Schalke is now the only German team left in the Champions
League after  Bayern Munich ’s defeat by defending champion Inter
Milan. The Gelsenkirchen-based club has been less successful
domestically, winning nine of 26 league games this season after
finishing second to Bayern last year. It’s also reached the
final of the German Cup where it will play Duisburg.  Magath joined Schalke in 2009 from Wolfsburg, which he led
to its first Bundesliga title.  He previously won back-to-back league and cup doubles with
Bayern Munich before being fired in January 2007.  As a player, he scored in Hamburg’s 1-0 win over Juventus
in the 1983 European Cup final. He was a three-time league
winner with Hamburg and represented  West Germany .  Magath’s managerial career also includes spells at Hamburg,
Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
