Bawag PSK Bank, the Austrian bank
controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, reported a profit
for the first time since 2006 as charges for bad debt and
impairments declined and revenue grew.  The bank reported net income of 125.4 million euros ($175.3
million) for 2010, compared with a net loss of 21.5 million
euros a year earlier, Vienna-based Bawag said in an e-mailed
statement today. Loan loss provisions declined by 16 percent
last year, while gains on financial assets rose 12 percent,
according to the statement.  Bawag, bought by Cerberus in 2006 after a near-collapse,
said it was “confident” to “increase profitability” this
year as the outlook for Austrian economic growth was
“cautiously optimistic.” The bank will pay interest on 550
million euros of Austrian state capital in both 2010 and 2011,
it said. It canceled 400 million euros of state guarantees which
it no longer required last year.  Net interest income, the difference between money paid on
deposits and earned on loans and Bawag’s biggest revenue source,
rose 15 percent to 650 million euros. Bawag tapped bond markets
for the first time since more than five years in 2010, selling
1.2 billion euros worth of covered bonds.  Bawag plans to open 300 new branches in cooperation with
the Austrian postal service, Oesterreichische Post AG, and will
invest around 100 million euros into the expansion until the end
of next year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
