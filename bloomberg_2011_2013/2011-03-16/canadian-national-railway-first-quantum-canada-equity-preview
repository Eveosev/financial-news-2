Canadian stocks swung between gains
and losses as energy and fertilizer producers rose with the
prices of oil and wheat while banks fell after U.S. building
permits declined to a record low.    Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
climbed 1.9 percent as violence escalated in Bahrain. Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. gained 2.5 percent as an index of
commodities rallied after the biggest decline in four months
yesterday on concern the earthquake and nuclear crisis in  Japan 
will slash raw-material demand.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the
country’s largest lender by assets, dropped 1.3 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 1.74
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,548.70 at 12:22 p.m. in
Toronto. The index had jumped as much as 1 percent and declined
as much as 0.3 percent earlier.  “The market really doesn’t like uncertainty,” said Jeff Bradacs, a Toronto-based senior investment analyst for a team at
Manulife Asset Management that oversees C$1.7 billion ($1.7
billion). “Until we have clarity on Japan, I would expect the
volatility to remain.”  The S&P/TSX had fallen 5 percent from March 4 to yesterday
as the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index
dropped 6.8 percent. Crude oil retreated after surging to a 29-
month high as civil war broke out in  Libya . Gold and silver fell
as investors sold precious metals to raise cash as equity
markets dipped after the March 11 earthquake in Japan.  Oil gained today on concern the violence in Bahrain will
spill into neighboring  Saudi Arabia . Crude declined the most
since Oct. 19 yesterday.  Energy Shares  Suncor advanced 1.9 percent to C$42.72.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ,
Canada’s second-largest energy company by revenue, increased 1.5
percent to C$49.75 for its first gain in eight days.  EnCana
Corp. (ECA) , the country’s biggest natural gas producer, increased 2.2
percent to C$32.15 as the fuel climbed for a fourth day.  The five largest Canadian banks dropped after the U.S.
Commerce Department said housing starts declined more than most
economists estimated to the lowest level since April 2009.  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest lender by
assets, lost 1.3 percent to C$58.84.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the
parent of  Portland , Maine-based TD Bank NA and Cherry Hill New
Jersey-based Commerce Bancorp, Inc., decreased 1.4 percent to
C$82.15.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s No. 3 lender by assets,
slipped 1.1 percent to C$57.62.    Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , the Toronto-based insurer with
120 life insurance sales offices in Japan, gained 1.7 percent to
C$16.29 after tumbling 7.7 percent the previous two days. Peter A. Rozenberg, an analyst at UBS AG, raised his rating on the
stock to “buy” from “neutral.”  Grain Rises  Wheat rebounded from a four-month low on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Japan is the second-biggest importer of U.S. wheat
and, according to  Statistics Canada , the No. 3 buyer of Canadian
wheat.  Potash Corp. increased 2.5 percent to C$54.45.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, rose 1.5 percent to
C$87.51.  Viterra Inc. (VT) , Canada’s biggest grain handler, gained
1.8 percent to C$10.92.  Uranium-mining companies fell for a third day as the
nuclear crisis in Japan jeopardized a renaissance in nuclear
power.    Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s second-largest uranium producer,
declined 6.7 percent to C$29.93 to extend its weekly drop to 18
percent.  Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by
Moscow-based ARMZ Uranium Holding, slumped 4.6 percent for a 41
percent plunge on the week.    Semafo Inc. (SMF) , which mines gold in  Africa , soared 5.5 percent
from an eight-month low to C$8.52. The company is scheduled to
release fourth-quarter financial results today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
