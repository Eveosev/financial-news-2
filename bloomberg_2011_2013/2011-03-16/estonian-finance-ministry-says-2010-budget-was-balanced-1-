  Estonia ’s budget was balanced last
year due to better-than-expected economic growth and the sale of
spare carbon-emissions credits, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Economic growth accelerated at the end of the year,
boosting employment, the Tallinn-based ministry said today in an
e-mailed statement. The national statistics office is due to
release official 2010 budget data on March 25.  Estonia, which on Jan. 1 became the first former Soviet
republic to adopt the euro, had the lowest budget deficit and
government debt among the 17 members of the currency bloc last
year, according to the European Commission, which in November
forecast Estonia’s 2011 gap at 1 percent of economic output.  Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said on Jan. 19 that the  budget deficit  was about 1 percent of gross domestic product
last year. The government expects a deficit of 1.6 percent this
year as state payments into the pension system resume and as
spending rise due to the allocation of emissions-sales revenue,
Ligi said then.  The country’s ruling coalition, which won March 6 general
elections, has pledged to return to a  budget surplus  in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
