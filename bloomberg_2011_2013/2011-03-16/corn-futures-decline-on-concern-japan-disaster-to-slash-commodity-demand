Corn futures fell to a two-month
low on concern that commodity demand will decline as  Japan ’s
nuclear crisis escalates.  The Asian nation is struggling to control radiation
leaking from a power plant damaged by the magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami that struck on March 11, killing
thousands. Japan is the world’s biggest corn buyer. On Feb. 22,
the price in Chicago reached a 31-month high.  “People fear the worst possible outcome in Japan and are
liquidating long positions,” said Gregg Hunt, a market analyst
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “The situation
has the potential to reduce demand” for supplies from the
U.S., he said.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 19.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to close at $6.165 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.08, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 12. Yesterday, the
grain tumbled 4.5 percent, the most in four months.  Before today, the price jumped 75 percent in the past 12
months. The U.S. is the world’s leading corn exporter.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
