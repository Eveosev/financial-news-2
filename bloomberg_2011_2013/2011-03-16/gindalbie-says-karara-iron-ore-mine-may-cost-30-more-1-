  Gindalbie Metals Ltd. (GBG) , developing a
A$2 billion ($2 billion) iron ore mine in  Australia  with China’s
Anshan Iron & Steel Group, said the project may cost 30 percent
more because of rising prices for raw materials and labor.  “All projects in  Western Australia  are currently subject
to significant cost escalations and this situation is almost
certainly going to get worse as the resources boom strengthens,
pushing up the price of both labor and materials,” Gindalbie
Chairman George Jones said today in a statement.  Gindalbie may have to sell as much as A$150 million of
shares to help pay for a more expensive mine, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc said in a report. The company is studying an
increase in capacity to 16 million tons a year from 10 million
tons a year, Gindalbie said in a separate statement.  Gindalbie rose 6.8 percent to A$1.1015 at 1:32 p.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange. RBS lifted its
recommendation to “buy” from “hold” after a recent decline
in the share price, analysts led by Todd Scott said yesterday in
the report.  Gindalbie also said today Tim Netscher would replace Garret Dixon as managing director and chief executive officer at the
end of April.  Anshan,  China ’s fourth-largest steelmaker has a 35.9
percent stake in Gindalbie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
