Sales at major South Korean
department stores climbed at the slowest pace in 11 months in
February, easing from a record rate of growth the previous month.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 5.2 percent
from a year earlier, after rising 24 percent in January, the
Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
February’s gain was the smallest since March 2010.    South Korea  joined Thailand and  Vietnam  in raising
borrowing costs last week as it strives to tame the fastest
inflation in more than two years. The nation’s biggest economic
test remains tackling consumer-price growth, Governor Kim Choong Soo said yesterday.  Discount-store sales fell for the first time in 13 months,
declining 10.9 percent in February from a year earlier, after a
gain of 21.4 percent in January, today’s report showed.  South Korea’s Lunar New Year holiday fell on Feb. 2 through
Feb. 4 this year, spurring shopping in January. The holiday
occurred in mid-February in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
