Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, the
New York-based investment bank that focuses on financial-
services clients, hired Aaron Dorr from  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  to
oversee services for fund managers.  Dorr, 39, previously led asset-management investment
banking at Jefferies, Sandler said in a statement today. Before
that, he worked for nine years at Putnam Lovell, a boutique
focusing on asset managers that Jefferies bought in 2007.  Dorr advised Munich-based  Allianz SE (ALV)  on its $1.3 billion
acquisition of Newport Beach, California-based Pacific
Investment Management Co. in 2000, and Longacre Fund Management
LLC on its 2008 sale of a minority stake to  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) ’s Petershill fund. Last year, he advised Westchester
Capital Management Inc., with about $4 billion under management,
on its sale to Westchester employees and to Lincoln Peak
Capital.  “We see significant opportunity in asset management
advisory for middle-market companies, which have been the core
of our business for more than two decades,” said Jonathan Doyle, a managing principal at Sandler, in the statement.  Jefferies hired Frank Cicero from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  last year as
the head of its financial-institutions investment-banking group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
