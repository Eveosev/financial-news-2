Luis Salazar, a minor league
manager with the  Atlanta Braves , had his left eye removed after
being struck in the face by a line drive.  It was the third operation for Salazar since the March 9
accident, Braves spokesman Brad Hainje said in an e-mail, which
didn’t specify the date of the most recent surgery. Salazar, a
54-year-old former player, may be released from the hospital
today and intends to return to work as manager of the Major
League Baseball club’s Class A team in Lynchburg,  Virginia , the
spokesman said.  Salazar was standing in the dugout at the Braves’ spring
training complex in Kissimmee,  Florida , when he was struck in
the face by a foul ball hit by Atlanta catcher Brian McCann. He
was unconscious when an ambulance arrived and was airlifted to a
hospital where he underwent surgery that night, ESPN reported.  Salazar played for four teams over his 13-year year major-
league career. He will manage Lynchburg after three seasons as a
hitting coach in the  Los Angeles Dodgers ’ organization,
according to ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
