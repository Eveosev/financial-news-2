The agency that administers
Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program, declined to propose
a coverage decision for when the government should pay for
anemia drugs by  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  and  Johnson & Johnson. (JNJ)   The  no-decision , if made final, leaves coverage
determination in the hands of regional contractors that Medicare
uses to process claims for reimbursement, said Don McLeod, a
spokesman for the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently recommends
patients with kidney disease be treated to raise their
hemoglobin, an iron-rich element of red-blood cells, when it
falls to the level of 10 grams to 12 grams per deciliter of
blood. Usage of Amgen’s Aranesp and Epogen and J&J’s Procrit by
Medicare patients with kidney disease is unlikely to change
because of today’s government decision, said  Mark Schoenebaum ,
an ISI Group analyst in  New York .  “It appears that Medicare is basically turfing the entire
debate and recommending that no recommendation be made right
now,” Schoenebaum said in a note to investors. “This would
appear to be good for Amgen, since it effectively endorses the
current status quo and implies that the agency will not
recommend lower hemoglobin targets.”  Amgen, based in Thousands Oak, California, rose as high as
$1.11, or 2.1 percent, to $53.80 in extended trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market after the ruling was announced. The shares
declined 31 cents to $52.69 at the 4 p.m. close of regular
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Rob Waters  in San Francisco at
