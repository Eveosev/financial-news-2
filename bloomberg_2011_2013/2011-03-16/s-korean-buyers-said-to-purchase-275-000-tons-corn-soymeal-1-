Buyers in  South Korea , the third-
biggest corn importer, purchased a total of 275,000 metric tons
of corn and soybean meal and plan to import more cargoes as
prices plunged after last week’s earthquake in  Japan .  The Korea Feed Association bought 220,000 metric tons of
corn and soybean meal, said two industry executives who took
part in the bidding, asking not to be identified because tender
results are confidential. That is the biggest quantity purchased
in a single tender by the group since October.  Nonghyup Feed Inc. bought 55,000 tons of soybean meal for
July arrival in a separate tender, said two other industry
executives. The Major Feedmill Group plans to buy 190,000 tons
of corn for delivery by July 15 in the bidding tomorrow,
according to a tender notice e-mailed to Bloomberg today.  Corn traded in  Chicago  tumbled 12 percent this month on
speculation that the earthquake, the strongest on record in
Japan, will curb grain demand from the world’s biggest buyer.
Soybeans and wheat have dropped 4.5 percent and 16 percent,
respectively. South Korea is  Asia ’s second-biggest grain
importer after Japan.  Corn buyers in Japan are delaying purchases after the quake
and tsunami damaged ports in the nation’s northeast, suspending
grain-unloading operations, said  Nobuyuki Chino , president of
Unipac Grain Ltd. Japan reduced wheat purchases after the
disaster, according to the farm ministry.  In today’s bidding, the Korea Feed, South Korea’s biggest
grain-buyer, purchased 110,000 tons of corn for arrival in June
and July and the same quantity of soybean meal for delivery in
July and August. The volume is the biggest bought in a single
bidding by the Korean group since it purchased 218,000 tons of
corn and soybean meal in an Oct. 5 tender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
