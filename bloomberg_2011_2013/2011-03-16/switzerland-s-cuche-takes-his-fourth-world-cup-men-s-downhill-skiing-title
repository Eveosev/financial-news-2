American Lindsey Vonn, who had
already clinched the women’s downhill skiing title, took the
overall World Cup lead today by finishing fourth in
Lenzerheide,  Switzerland .  Julia Mancuso won the race in 1 minute, 27.50 seconds, with
Switzerland’s Lara Gut in second, 0.81 second behind. Elisabeth Goergl of Austria was third. Vonn moves past  Maria Riesch  in the
overall World Cup standings.  Mancuso’s victory, her first in downhill since 2007, pushed
her into third place behind Vonn and Riesch in the season
standings for the event.  Riesch entered the day with a 23-point edge on Vonn for the
overall crown, but the German finished 17th and took no points.
Vonn now leads by 27 points with three races left. Tina Maze of
Slovenia is third.  Earlier, Switzerland’s Didier Cuche won his fourth men’s
downhill skiing title, edging past  Austria ’s Michael Walchhofer,
who was leading before the race.  Cuche today finished fourth in 1 minute, 23.25 seconds,
0.31 second behind the winner,  France ’s Adrien Theaux.
Walchhofer, who was also going for his fourth title, finished
11th, in 1 minute, 23.64 seconds. Either Cuche or Walchhofer
have now won the last seven downhill titles.  Austria’s Franz Klammer won five downhill titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
