  China ’s top economic planner has
approved  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and Kuwait Petroleum
Corp.’s $9 billion refinery development in the southern province
of Guangdong.  The companies will build a refinery with the capacity to
process 15 million tons a year, or 300,000 barrels a day, and a
1 million ton-a-year ethylene plant in the city of Zhanjiang,
according to a statement on the National Development and Reform
Commission’s  website  today.  Kuwait has been in talks to build the refinery project
since at least 2004. The complex, scheduled to start operations
by 2013, will overtake Exxon Mobil Corp.’s $5 billion Fujian
project to become China’s biggest refining venture with an
overseas partner.  Kuwait plans to choose a third partner within six months to
develop the refinery, Al-Rai reported March 13, citing Hussein
Ismail, president of Kuwait Petroleum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
