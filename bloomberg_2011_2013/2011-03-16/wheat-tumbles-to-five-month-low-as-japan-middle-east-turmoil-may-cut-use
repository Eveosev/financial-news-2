Wheat futures slumped to a five-
month low on speculation that the earthquake in  Japan  and
protests in the Middle East will cut global demand.  Twelve dry-cargo ports in Japan, the second-biggest buyer
of U.S. wheat, were damaged and still shut yesterday following
the March 11 quake and tsunami,  Inchcape Shipping Services  said.
Four people died today during protests in Bahrain. Riots over
high food costs and corruption have spread across the Middle
East and northern Africa, toppling leaders in Tunisia and Egypt,
the world’s biggest wheat buyer.  “We’ll keep one eye on Japan, one eye on the Middle East
and one eye on the equity markets,” said Dan Kuechenmeister,
the manager of the commodities department at RBC Dain Rauscher
in  Minneapolis . “We need to be a three-eyed monster.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $6.62 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the prices touched $6.56, the lowest
since Oct. 6.  The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter, and  Nigeria  is
its biggest customer. Wheat was the fourth-biggest U.S. crop in
2010 at $13 billion, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
