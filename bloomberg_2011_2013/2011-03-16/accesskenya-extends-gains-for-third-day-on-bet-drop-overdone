  AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the
country’s only publicly traded Internet company, rose to the
highest level this month on speculation its drop since the
beginning of this year was overdone.  The stock climbed 3.2 percent to 9.7 shillings at the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, paring its year-to-date decline to 28
percent. The stock is the market’s worst performer this year.  “They got punished enough by the market, they have had a
massive depreciation,” Timothy Wambu, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Financial Services, said in a phone
interview today. “People are coming back because the price is
now at an attractive entry level.”  The company’s 14-day relative strength index rose above 30
for the first time since Feb. 3 today. A reading below that
threshold indicates an asset’s price has fallen too far
and is poised to rise, according to technical analysis
techniques.  To contact the reporter on this story:
