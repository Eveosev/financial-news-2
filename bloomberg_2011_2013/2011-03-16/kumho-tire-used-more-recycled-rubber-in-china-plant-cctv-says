     March 16 (Bloomberg) -- Kumho Tire Co., the biggest tire
supplier to carmakers in  China , used more recycled rubber than
its own guidelines at its Tianjin factory,  China Central
Television  reported last night, citing an unidentified person.  Kumho used more material from unfinished tires that failed
quality checks to save on costs, state broadcaster CCTV said.
The Gwangju, South Korea-based tiremaker supplies to the local
ventures of General Motors Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and Volkswagen
AG., according to the report.  A spokesman for Kumho, who declined to be named citing
company policy, couldnâ€™t immediately comment when contacted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
