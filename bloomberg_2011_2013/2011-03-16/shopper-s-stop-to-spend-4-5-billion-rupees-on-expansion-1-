  Shopper’s Stop Ltd. (SHOP) , India’s
second-largest publicly traded retailer, plans to spend 4.5
billion rupees ($99.7 million) to open more departmental stores
and hypermarkets as rising incomes drive consumer demand.  The company plans to add 24 Shopper’s Stop department
stores to the existing 36, Managing Director Govind Shrikhande
said today in Chennai. The number of HyperCity stores will be
increased to 26 from nine, Shrikhande said. Shopper’s Stop will
expand to 25 cities in four years from 15.  Wages in  Asia ’s third-largest economy are expected to rise
at an average 12.9 percent this year, a survey by AON Hewitt LLC
showed. India’s per capita income may almost double by 2020,
fueling consumer demand, Shrikhande said.    India ’s golden retail period has yet to come,” he said.
“When the economy grows, customers do have the money to spend
and the market expands.”  India’s retail market is expected to rise to $535 billion
by 2013 from $410 billion in 2010, according to the Global
Retail Development Index by AT Kearney.  Shopper’s Stop  rose  3.5 percent to 333.40 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The shares have fallen 11 percent
this year, compared with a 10 percent decline in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s benchmark Sensitive Index.  Shopper’s Stop plans to fund the expansion through internal
accruals, Shrikhande said, adding that the company generates
cash flows of more than 1 billion rupees a year. The company had
886 million rupees worth of cash and near cash items as of March
31, 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  The retailer plans to expand in smaller cities such as
Durgapur, Siliguri and Coimbatore, and add more stores in cities
where it is already present, such as Chennai and Bangalore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
