  Syria  canceled a sale of 1 billion
Syrian pounds ($21 million) of one-year notes at an auction this
week, the first since it started offering debt, as investors
sought higher yields amid turmoil in the region.  Bids came in “much higher” than the 1.5 percent interest
rate at which the bills were offered,  Ministry of Finance  said
in a statement today on its website. The government “is trying
to keep interest at rates the Treasury can bear,” Finance
Minister Mohammad al-Hussein said.  Syria started selling bonds for the first time in December
to finance development projects. Debt yields and credit risk of
governments in the Middle East have surged this year as popular
uprisings toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt . Bahrain security
forces clashed with protesters today in the capital Manama and
hundreds of riot police were deployed.  Syria’s government plans to sell treasury bonds and bills
this year with a total value of 30 billion pounds, the ministry
said Jan. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
