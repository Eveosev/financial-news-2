The  United Nations  human rights
commissioner said Guinea should establish a truth and
reconciliation commission to probe abuses in the West African
nation.  It is “extremely urgent” that the country hold talks to set
up such a body,” Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights, told reporters yesterday in the capital, Conakry.  “Authors of the most atrocious human-rights violations,
including sexual violence, remain free,” Pillay said. “It is
necessary to end impunity.”  Guinean soldiers opened fire at a stadium in September 2009
after demonstrations by opposition supporters, killing at least
156 people, according to a UN commission of inquiry created by
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The actual number of deaths was
“likely far greater,” the panel said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
