The number of Britons who think now
is a good time to buy a home fell in March as strains in the
 labor market  dented demand for property, the Building Societies
Association said.  The proportion of people saying it was a good time to buy
declined to 41 percent from 43 percent in December, the BSA said
in an e-mailed statement released in London today, citing a
YouGov Plc poll. The share who say it isn’t a good time to buy
rose to 29 percent, the highest since December 2008, from 26
percent. YouGov polled 2,026 adults between March 4 and March 7.  “People believe that substantial barriers to buying
property persist,” Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage policy at
the BSA, said in the statement. “Against the uncertain economic
outlook, job insecurity increased slightly as a barrier in the
latest results.”  U.K.  claims for unemployment benefits  unexpectedly fell the
most in eight months in February, while the  unemployment rate 
rose, the  Office for National Statistics  said today. Jobless
claims dropped 10,200 from the previous month, though the U.K.
unemployment rate based on International Labor Organization
standards rose to 8 percent in the three months through January
from 7.9 percent in the period to October.  Separate reports yesterday showed  house prices  fell in
January and mortgage lending dropped in the fourth quarter as
banks continued to ration credit. The average price of a home
fell 1.4 percent from a month earlier to 208,552 pounds
($335,456), according to a government report. The Financial
Services Authority said mortgage lending fell 10 percent in the
fourth quarter to 37 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
