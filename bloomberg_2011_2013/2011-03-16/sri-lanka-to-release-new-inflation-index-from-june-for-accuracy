  Sri Lanka  plans to release a new
consumer-price index by the end of June to accurately reflect
household spending and assess price movements, a director at the
 Department of Census and Statistics  said.  “We are seeing a shift from food to non-food
consumption,” D.C.A. Gunawardena said by telephone today from
Colombo. The new gauge will be based on the spending pattern of
households in the capital Colombo in 2006 and 2007, compared
with the current index that tracks 2002 consumption, he said.  Sri Lanka’s inflation accelerated to a 25-month high in
February. The nation’s central bank on March 8 kept interest
rates unchanged for a second straight month after cutting them
in January to bolster economic growth.  “The new index will help for monetary policy purposes as
it will be a better gauge of inflation,” Gunawardena said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
