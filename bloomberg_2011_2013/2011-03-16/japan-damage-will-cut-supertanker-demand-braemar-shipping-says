  Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami is
likely to cut demand for supertankers that deliver the nation’s
oil after damage reduced crude processing,  Braemar Shipping
Services Plc (BMS)  said.  The closing of refineries will cut demand for about 777,000
barrels a day until they resume processing, Braemar said in an
e-mailed report. That would equate to 143 very large crude
carriers, or VLCCs, a year.  “Approximately 90 percent of Japanese crude oil imports
originate in the Middle East, we will see this route impacted
over the period of the closure,” according to the report.  Rental income from the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-
to-Japan route has dropped 22 percent since March 10, the day
before the earthquake and tsunami killed thousands and damaged
nuclear power stations. In industry-standard Worldscale terms,
costs on the route have dropped 4.2 percent since the
catastrophe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
