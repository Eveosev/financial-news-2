The Bovespa stock index fell for
the second day, joining a global selloff, on signs that Japan’s
nuclear crisis is worsening and the U.S. housing recovery is
stalled.    Vale SA (VALE3)  and  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , two of  Brazil ’s biggest metals
exporters, sank on concern growth in Japan and in the U.S. will
falter, cooling demand for materials.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , Brazil’s
fourth-largest consumer-goods company by market value, climbed
after Barclays Plc rated the stock “overweight.”  The Bovespa fell 1.5 percent to 66,002.57 at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. It dropped as much
as 2 percent earlier. Fifty-two stocks fell on the index, while
13 gained. The real weakened 0.6 percent to 1.6760 per  U.S.
dollar .  “Foreign investors are still very cautious about putting
their money in Brazil,” said Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps
oversee 60 million reais ($35.8 million) at Leme Investimentos
in Florianopolis, Brazil. “There’s been unrest in the Middle
East, an earthquake in  Japan  and housing data in the U.S, all
sources of concern. The actual state of the Brazilian economy
hasn’t been as important as this news.”  Tokyo Electric Power Co. said a reactor containment vessel
may have been breached at the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
plant, deepening Japan’s nuclear crisis and increasing the risks
of radioactive leaks.  The company suspected damage following an explosion in the
reactor building yesterday. About 70 percent of the fuel rods at
the plant’s No. 1 reactor and a third of the No. 2 reactor’s
fuel may have been damaged, and temperatures at spent-fuel-rod-
cooling pools were rising, Tepco said.  U.S. Housing  Housing starts in the U.S. declined in February to the
slowest pace since April 2009 and building permits dropped to a
record low, signs the housing market recovery is limping along
as the rest of the economy improves.  New  home construction  fell 22.5 percent to a 479,000 annual
rate, U.S. Commerce Department figures showed. The decrease from
January was the steepest since March 1984. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey called for a 566,000 rate. Building
permits, a proxy for future construction, fell 8.2 percent to a
517,000 pace.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 2 percent. European stocks tumbled for
the sixth day, with the Stoxx 600 index declining 1.6 percent.  Vale fell 2.5 percent to 44.70 reais, the lowest price
since September. Gerdau dropped 3.2 percent to 21.42 reais.
Hypermarcas gained 0.9 percent to 18.56 reais.  Autometal SA, the Brazilian unit of Spanish auto-parts
maker Cie Automotive SA, rose 0.8 percent to 15.96 reais after
it was rated “outperform” in new coverage at Credit Suisse
Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Bovespa is down 4.8 percent this year after
homebuilders and banks retreated on concern rising inflation
will spur additional measures to restrict credit growth,
outweighing gains in oil and raw-material producers.  The index trades at 10.5 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares to a ratio of 13.8 for the Shanghai Composite Index,
7.3 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 17.3 for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
