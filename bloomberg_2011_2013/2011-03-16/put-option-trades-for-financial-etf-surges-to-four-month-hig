Put volume for an exchange-traded
fund linked to an index tracking bank stocks rose to its highest
level since November after a trade with a strike price 10
percent below yesterday’s close.  An investor bought a block of 15,000 April $23 puts to sell
the  SPDR KBW Bank ETF (KBE) , which tracks companies like  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , for 25 cents each at
11:23 a.m. in New York, according to a report by Trade Alert
LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market analytics, and
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract had an open interest of
1 before today.  The April $23 puts accounted for almost all options volume,
which was 29 times the four-week average and 30 times the number
of calls to buy. The ETF fell 1.5 percent to $25.30. It dropped
1.1 percent in the past year, compared with a 8.4 percent rise
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
