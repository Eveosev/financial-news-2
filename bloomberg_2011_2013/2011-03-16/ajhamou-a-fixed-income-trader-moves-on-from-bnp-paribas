Hicham Hajhamou, a fixed-income
trader at BNP Paribas SA in  New York , resigned today from the
firm, he said in a telephone interview.  Hajhamou, 35, declined to comment on his plans, except to
say he will continue to trade Treasuries. He joined BNP, one of
20 primary dealers that trade directly with the  Federal Reserve ,
in June 2008.  Hajhamou focused on trading long-term securities as well as
other maturities at BNP, and reported to Kevin Walter, head of
U.S. Treasury trading, he said. He worked earlier at the former
primary dealer Countrywide Securities Corp. as a Treasury trader
and traded securities at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. from 2000
to 2006.  Neither Walter nor Megan Stinson, a BNP Paribas press
officer, immediately returned calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
