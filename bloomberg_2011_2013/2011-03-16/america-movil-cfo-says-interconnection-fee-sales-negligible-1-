  America Movil  SAB’s net mobile
interconnection-fee sales, including fees charged to other
carriers and payments made to them, are normally negligible,
said Carlos Garcia Moreno, chief financial officer for the
largest wireless provider in the Americas.  Reducing the fees doesn’t always translate into lower
prices, Garcia Moreno said today during a news conference in  Mexico  City.  America Movil and fixed-line provider Telefonos de Mexico
SAB, both controlled by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , are
locked in a dispute over interconnection fees charged in Mexico
with competing telecommunications companies including Grupo
Televisa SA, Grupo Iusacell SA and Megacable Holdings SAB.  Rivals say Slim’s companies charge too much to connect
calls to their networks and have filed antitrust complaints.
Slim’s companies filed their own antitrust complaints and
accused competitors of shutting the companies out of  television
advertising  and trying to force Telefonos de Mexico out of the
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
