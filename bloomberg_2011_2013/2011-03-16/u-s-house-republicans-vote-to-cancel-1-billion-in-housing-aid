The U.S. House voted 242-182 along
party lines to cancel an Obama administration program to aid
communities hit by foreclosures and abandoned properties.  “This is a bad giveaway,” Representative  Gary Miller , a
California Republican and sponsor of the legislation, said today
during a debate on the bill.  The vote would eliminate the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program and rescind $1 billion from the fund, which helps local
governments redevelop blighted communities. President  Barack Obama  has said he would veto the legislation.  Today’s vote was the third of four planned to cut funding
for Obama’s efforts to prevent foreclosures and aid communities
most affected by them.  The House may vote later this month on a bill to eliminate
the administration’s signature foreclosure-prevention effort,
the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, which pays
banks to modify borrowers’ monthly mortgage payments.  To become law, the bills also must be passed by the Senate,
controlled by Democrats, and signed by the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
