Ireland’s central bank estimates  house prices  may fall 60 percent from their peak in 2007, under
an “adverse” scenario underpinning stress tests of the
country’s debt-laden lenders.  Home values may fall 17.4 percent this year and 18.8
percent in 2012 under the scenario, the central bank in Dublin
said in a report today. Gross domestic product is seen falling
1.6 percent this year before rising 0.3 percent next year. The
tests results will be revealed on March 31 and will help
determine how much of the 35 billion euros ($49 billion)
available for banks under Ireland’s international bailout will
be drawn down.  The government is counting on the tests to reveal the full
extent of potential losses at lenders  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) ,
Bank of Ireland Plc, Irish Life & Permanent Plc and EBS Building
Society. The state has injected 46.3 billion euros into the
financial system over the past two years and says it won’t pump
in additional capital until after the reviews.  “The economic scenarios in the base case, before even
considering the adverse case, are more pessimistic than the
market is anticipating,” said Brian Devine, chief economist at
Dublin-based NCB Stockbrokers. “It is good that the central
bank is coming out with very conservative figures.”  Under a base-case scenario for the economy and the  property
market ,  home prices  are seen dropping 55 percent from their peak
in 2007. This scenario sees GDP rising 0.9 percent this year,
1.9 percent in 2012 and a further 2.5 percent in 2013.  Prime Minister  Enda Kenny , who took power last week, said
yesterday that he won’t inject more money into banks “without
some responsibility or sharing” of losses by bondholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
