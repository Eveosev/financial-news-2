  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) , the biggest maker of copied drugs, and  AGL Resources Inc. (AGL) 
were among companies that returned to the  debt market  after
issuance froze yesterday for the first time this year.  Teva sold $750 million of 3-year fixed- and floating-rate
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AGL Resources,
the owner of Atlanta’s natural gas utility, issued $500 million
of 30-year bonds in an offering increased by $100 million, the
data show.  No companies issued debt yesterday after $5.57 billion of
sales on March 14 and average daily volume of $6.3 billion in
March. Global stocks fell after the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
posted its biggest two-day drop since 1987 amid concern that a
nuclear disaster was unfolding in  Japan . The extra yield
investors demand to hold speculative-grade debt instead of
Treasuries jumped to the highest since January.  “The market was spooked by the events in Japan and stocks
saw a huge sell-off,” said  Rajeev Sharma , a money manager in
New York at First Investors Management Co., where he oversees
$1.5 billion of investment-grade debt. “Until things settle
down, it will be difficult for people to jump back into riskier
investments.”  Investment-Grade Yields  Investment-grade corporate bonds, which are priced against
Treasuries, saw their yields fall below 4 percent on March 14
for the first time since Jan. 28, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data, as investors sought the relative
safety of  U.S. government debt . Spreads on the securities
widened to 155 basis points yesterday, the highest since Feb. 4.    Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the iron-ore producer that
in January agreed to pay C$4.43 billion ($4.5 billion) for
Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd., offered $1 billion of
bonds, Bloomberg data show. The Cleveland-based company issued
$700 million of 4.875 percent 10-year notes that yielded 170
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.  The company also sold $300 million in an additional portion
of 6.25 percent, 30-year bonds originally issued in September,
the data show. Those bonds paid a spread of 190 basis points
over Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Teva sold $250 million of 1.7 percent senior unsecured
fixed-rate debt at a spread of 73 basis points over U.S.
Treasuries and $500 million of floaters at 50 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate, a lending benchmark that
was set at 0.31 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Teva Proceeds  The  Petah Tikva , Israel-based company plans to use proceeds
to pay back borrowings from a syndicated credit facility
maturing in January 2014, which was used this month to redeem
1.75 percent convertible senior debt due 2026, it said today in
a regulatory filing.  The company may also pay back borrowings from “other
unsecured credit facilities” that mature in July 2011 and
helped finance the acquisition of Ratiopharm GmbH. Teva agreed
to purchase  Germany ’s Ratiopharm last year for 3.63 billion
euros ($5.06 billion).  The AGL Resources debt yielded 150 basis points more than
Treasuries, the data show. The company may use proceeds to pay
back outstanding commercial paper and to help fund its merger
with Naperville, Illinois-based Nicor Inc., it said today in a
regulatory filing. The company agreed to buy Nicor for $2.4
billion in cash and stock in December.  Teva last tapped the  bond market  in June, selling $2.5
billion of debt in three parts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s $1 billion of 3 percent, five-year
notes priced at 99.876 cents on the dollar, or a spread of 95
basis points, the data show.  AGL Resources’s last debt sale was in August 2009, when it
issued $300 million of 5.25 percent, 10-year notes, Bloomberg
data show. The company last sold 30-year bonds in 2004, which
had a coupon of 6 percent and priced at a spread of 120 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
