The number of U.S. millionaires
increased by 600,000 in 2010, according to a report by  Spectrem
Group .  About 8.4 million American households had assets of $1
million or more, not including their primary residences, a gain
of 8 percent, according to Chicago-based Spectrem. The figure is
still below the 2007 high for millionaires, when there were 9.2
million in the U.S., Spectrem said.  “The recovery is doing better in this population, probably
better than for Main Street America,” said George Walper Jr.,
president of Spectrem, in a telephone interview. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index returned 15 percent last year.  The figure is lower than pre-financial-crisis levels
because the value of real estate has not recovered, he said. The
survey includes the value of second homes and real-estate
investments. In December the S&P/Case-Shiller index of home
values in 20 cities was down 31 percent from its peak in July
2006.  The number of ultra-high-net-worth households, which
Spectrem defines as those with $5 million or more in investable
assets, increased 8 percent to 1.1 million in 2010, the survey
said.  Household wealth was $56.8 trillion at the end of 2010,
according to the  Federal Reserve . Millionaires control about 56
percent of U.S. wealth, according to a March 14 survey by
Boston-based  Fidelity Investments , the second-largest U.S.
mutual-fund company after Vanguard Group Inc.  Turning Bullish  Millionaires turned bullish on their investments in
February for the first time in more than three years, according
to a Feb. 23 survey by Spectrem. Walper said he expects optimism
may fall slightly in March.  “The whole issue in  Japan  and with the markets eroding
worldwide will increase people’s concerns,” in the short-term,
he said. “But generally, we’re still trending upwards.”  Millionaires said they’re most likely to invest more in
stocks in 2011, with holding cash coming in second, Spectrem
said.  Ultra-high-net-worth households said their greatest
personal concern is the financial situation of their children or
grandchildren. Mass affluent households, by contrast, which
Spectrem defines as those with $100,000 to $999,999 in assets,
said maintaining their current financial position was their
greatest concern, followed by having enough money for
retirement.  Spectrem’s report is based on four sets of surveys of more
than 6,000 households conducted online throughout 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
