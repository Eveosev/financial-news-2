The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars dropped to the weakest this year against the greenback
and the yen as concerns about the impact of the nuclear disaster
in  Japan  spurred investors to sell riskier assets.  The so-called kiwi dollar declined against 15 of its 16
most-traded peers as the risk of radiation leaks from crippled
nuclear plants north of  Tokyo  stoked speculation Japan’s
insurers and investors will sell overseas assets to pay for
damages.  Australia ’s dollar dropped 5.6 percent versus the yen
since March 11, heading for its biggest weekly slide since May.  “The markets are in a panic and everyone’s diving into the
havens of the yen and the Swiss franc,” said  Joseph Capurso , a
currency strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  in Sydney.
“When you’re seeing this amount of volatility that’s usually
bad for so-called risk currencies like the Aussie and the
kiwi.”  The Australian dollar fell to as low as 97.06 U.S. cents,
the least since Dec. 2, before trading at 97.86 cents as of
10:18 a.m. in Sydney. The Aussie tumbled 2.1 percent to 76.68
yen, after reaching as low as 74.48, the weakest since August.  The kiwi slid to 71.18 U.S. cents, a six-month low, before
trading at 71.98 cents. The New Zealand currency dropped as much
as 5.4 percent to 54.81 yen, the weakest since April 2009.  The declines haven’t been as deep as the drops experienced
in previous financial-market crises surrounding  Greece ’s
sovereign-debt problems last year and the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, Capurso said.  “We’re still a fair way short of the sort of sell-offs
that happened after the Greek and Lehman crises,” he said.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the nations’ higher-
yielding assets. The risk is that sudden exchange-rate moves can
erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
