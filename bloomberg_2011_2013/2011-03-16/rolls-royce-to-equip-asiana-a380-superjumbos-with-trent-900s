  Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/)  said  Asiana
Airlines (020560)  Inc. chose its Trent 900 engines to power the six A380
aircraft that South Koreaâ€™s second-biggest carrier agreed to buy
from Airbus SAS about two months ago.  Seoul-based Asiana will receive the double-decker jets in
2014, its first Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft, the London-based
company said in a statement today.  The A380 aircraft comes with two engine options, the other
being the Engine Alliance venture between  General Electric Co. (GE) 
and  Pratt & Whitney . A Rolls-Royce Trent 900 exploded on a
Qantas Airways Ltd. aircraft in mid-flight in November,
prompting the Australian carrier to temporarily suspend
operation of its A380 fleet to investigate the cause.  To contact the reporter on this story:
