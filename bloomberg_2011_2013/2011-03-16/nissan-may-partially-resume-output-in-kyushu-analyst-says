Nissan Motor Co.,  Japan ’s second-
biggest carmaker, may partially resume production in Kyushu,
southern Japan as early as tomorrow, an analyst said.  Nissan’s Kyushu plant, which produces the Tiana sedan, X-
Trail sport-utility vehicle and Sunny compact car, will have the
parts needed to start output, said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at
Carnorama, citing information he received on March 15 from the
automaker’s suppliers.  The Yokohama-based automaker has halted operations at all
six Japanese plants after the earthquake off the coast of Sendai,
northern Japan on March 11. Nissan spokeswoman Sachi Inagaki
declined to comment on whether the automaker will resume
operation at its Kyushu plant.  Miyao said production at the Kyushu plant “may not last
long” as the carmaker will have limited inventories of parts.
“The earthquake is by far the worst damage the  auto industry 
has had from a natural disaster,” he said.  Nissan shares rose 5.7 percent to 738 yen at 12:44 p.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporters on this story:
