U.K. authorities raided a plant
used to produce illicit motor fuel, the largest to be discovered
in the country, and arrested a person there.  The site in  Northern Ireland  was capable of removing
government coloring from at least 30 million liters (7.9 million
gallons) a year of agricultural diesel, intended for subsequent
re-sale to motorists, according to  Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs . Diesel for agricultural machinery is subject to a lower  tax rate  and colored to distinguish it from car fuel.  “This is fuel fraud on an industrial scale,” John
Whiting, HMRC’s assistant director for criminal investigations,
said in an e-mailed statement. “The sheer size of this illegal
operation is staggering and far exceeds anything we have ever
come across before.”  Police and customs officers yesterday seized six  storage
tanks  containing 37,000 liters of  diesel fuel , and 21,000 liters
of toxic waste created in the process of removing the markings,
HMRC said in an e-mailed statement. The lost tax revenue would
have cost the U.K. about 20 million pounds ($32 million) a year,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
