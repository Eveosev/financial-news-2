Empresa Brasileira de Compressores
SA, a Brazilian maker of refrigeration compressors, will hire
300 more workers in Slovakia as it boosts production in the east
European country,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  The company, which currently employs 2,150 people at its
factory in Spisska Nova Ves, eastern Slovakia, invested 13
million euros ($18 million) in the expansion, the newspaper
said, citing the unit’s Director Norbert Brath. The Slovak
government will cover one-half of the expansion costs,
Hospodarske reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
