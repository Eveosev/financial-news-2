The Slovak government approved a
plan to lease Bratislava airport, the country’s busiest, to a
strategic partner for 30 years, Transportation Minister Jan
Figel said.  The government wants to pick the winner of a lease contest
by June 2012, Figel said today at a press conference in
Bratislava, Slovakia, after a Cabinet meeting. The government
expects the partner to boost traffic and reduce the airport’s
dependency on  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , which has the biggest share.  The number of passengers served by the Stefanik Airport in
Bratislava declined 3 percent last year to 1.66 million. The
airport, which competes for business with neighboring Vienna,
expects to handle 1.85 million passengers this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
