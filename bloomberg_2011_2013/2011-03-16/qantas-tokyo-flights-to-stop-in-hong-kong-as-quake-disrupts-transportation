  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  added  Hong Kong 
stopovers to six flights serving Tokyo’s Narita Airport after an
earthquake and nuclear-power plant emergency disrupted transport
links in  Japan .  Tokyo flights linking Sydney and Perth will stop in Hong
Kong through March 19, according to a  statement  on the airline’s
website. There are no plans to cancel any services, Simon Rushton, a spokesman, said by phone.  The carrier added the stop so it could swap crews in Hong
Kong as there are intermittent difficulties in transporting
staff to hotels in Tokyo, Rushton said. The move is a
precautionary step to ensure that employees don’t have to work
double shifts on the 10-hour flights between Australia and Japan.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG yesterday moved all its Tokyo
services to the southern Japanese cities of Nagoya and Osaka.
The carrier, along with Air France-KLM and Austrian Airlines AG,
has added stops in Seoul for crew changes.    Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  are
operating flights to Japan as normal today, according to
statements on their websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
