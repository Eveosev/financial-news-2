Oil fell to a two-week low in  New York  amid concern that the earthquake in  Japan  may reduce
fuel demand in the world’s third-largest crude consumer.  Prices dropped as much as 1 percent after reports of
additional damage and fires at a nuclear plant underscored the
extent of destruction across Japan. About 1.3 million barrels a
day, or 29 percent, of Japan’s refining capacity was closed
after the country’s largest temblor on record. Oil gained 1.1
percent earlier on speculation unrest in the Middle East may
lead to supply disruptions.  “The Middle Eastern premium seems to be eroding as we
concentrate in an uptick in supply as a result of Japan shutting
down refining capacity,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.  Crude for April delivery fell as much as 96 cents to $96.22
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest intraday price since Feb. 25. It was at
$96.23 at 11:28 a.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract
dropped $4.01, or 4 percent, to $97.18, the lowest level since
Feb. 28. Prices declined the most since Oct. 19 and are up 18 
percent from a year ago.  Brent oil for April settlement retreated as much as $1.17,
or 1.1 percent, to $107.35 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the lowest intra-day price since Feb.
23. Yesterday, the contract lost $5.15, or 4.5 percent, to 
$108.52, the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 4, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
