  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state utility known as Taqa, expects to produce 135,000 to
146,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2011, General Manager
Carl Sheldon said.  Much of the output would come from assets in  North America ,
where Taqa is replacing its reserves at a rate of 235 percent,
he said in a conference call today. The companyâ€™s global reserve
replacement ratio is 176 percent, Sheldon said.  Taqa has a capital spending target of $2 billion for the
year, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
