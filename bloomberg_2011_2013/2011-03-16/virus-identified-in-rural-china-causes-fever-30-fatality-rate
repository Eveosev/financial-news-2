A fever-triggering illness that has
killed about 30 percent of infected patients in rural  China  has
been traced to a new virus.  Researchers, who designated the culprit as the SFTS
bunyavirus, believe the disease is transmitted by ticks that
count most mammals in the Asia-Pacific region as hosts,
according to a study today in the New England Journal of
Medicine. SFTS is short for severe fever with thrombocytopenia
syndrome.  The scientists confirmed the virus’s presence in 171
patients, who were mostly farmers living in six provinces in
China, since 2009. They had fever, thrombocytopenia and
leukocytopenia -- low counts of blood platelets and white blood
cells -- and dysfunction in multiple organs. There is no
evidence of human-to-human transmission, the researchers said.  “These are not viruses that are airborne or easily
transmitted,” Heinz Feldmann, chief of the Laboratory of
Virology for the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases  in Hamilton,  Montana , said in a telephone interview.
“It’s very unlikely it would spread into areas where the virus
is not present.  “The risk of a global outbreak or even a larger epidemic is
remote,” said Feldmann, who wrote an accompanying editorial in
the journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
