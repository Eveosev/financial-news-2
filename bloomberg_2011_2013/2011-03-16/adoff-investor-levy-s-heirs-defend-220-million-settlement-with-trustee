Heirs of Norman F. Levy, an
investor with  Bernard Madoff , defended a $220 million settlement
with the Madoff firm’s trustee, saying in a court filing
yesterday that the accord was negotiated in good faith and
should have “finality.”    Irving Picard , the trustee, settled with Levy’s family in
January 2010, saying they had acted “honorably.” The Levys and
their charity withdrew $305 million more from the  Ponzi scheme 
than they deposited in the six years before Madoff’s December
2008 arrest, Picard had alleged. A lawyer for smaller Madoff
investors asked a judge to void the settlement last month,
saying new information had surfaced about the scale of Levy’s
participation in the Ponzi scheme.  Levy, who died in 2005 at age 93, transferred $90 billion
to Madoff between 1997 and 2001, including $35 billion in 2001
and $23 billion in 2000, which Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC returned in the same amount each year, according
to court documents. The transfers were eight times larger than
all other Madoff customers’ combined transfers for that period.  Picard said today that the settlement was “fair and
equitable and should not be disturbed.” Purportedly new facts
put forth by investors seeking to void the deal “are not new,
having been considered by the trustee at the time of the
settlement,” he said in a filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan .  The settlement avoided potentially “protracted, costly and
uncertain litigation,” he said.  A court hearing on the issue is set for March 30.  The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
