U.K. retailing billionaire  Philip Green  said he’s looking at opening factories in the U.K. as
sourcing costs in the Far East climb as much as 15 percent.  Green’s company, Arcadia Group Ltd., is “having a look at
what possibilities are there in terms of U.K. production,” he
said on the sidelines of the Retail Week conference in  London 
late today. He said he’s considering reopening “dormant
factories.”  Arcadia has about 3,000 owned and franchised outlets in
more than 30 countries including Topshop fashion stores. It
sources only a “very small” amount of its products from the
U.K., with the remainder from factories in 32 other countries.  The retailer ruled out buying any of the retail assets that
are up for sale by Icelandic banks, Green said. Aurora Fashions,
the U.K. fashion retailer that is majority owned by Iceland’s
failed Kaupthing Bank Hf, plans to split off its Karen Millen
unit, a step that may lead to the sale of its largest, most
profitable business, the company said this month.  The billionaire opened his first Topshop store in the U.S.
last year and has outlined plans for further outlets in  Canada ,  Japan , Brazil and  Australia , said he has 500 store leases in the
U.K. that expire over the next three years that he wants to come
out of.  “We’re going to have some very interesting dialogue” with
our landlords, he said. “At the same time we want to grow our
international business.”  Green said the U.K. retail market is “tough,” citing
higher wage and raw materials costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
