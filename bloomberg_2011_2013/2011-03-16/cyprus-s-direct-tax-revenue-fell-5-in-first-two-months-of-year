Cyprus’s revenue from direct taxes
in January and February was 5 percent lower, at 314.3 million
euros ($440 million), than a year earlier, mainly because of a
drop in the defense levy, the  Inland Revenue Department  said.  The defense tax, applied to dividends, interest, rents and
taxable income of public corporate bodies, fell 14 percent, to
130.8 million euros, while revenue from a capital gains tax
dropped 20 percent, to 13.3 million euros, the department said
in a  statement  on its website.  Revenue from corporate tax fell 2 percent, to 53.4 million
euros, and stamp duty 23 percent, to 7.3 million euros. An 11
percent increase in income tax for employees, to 92.4 million
euros, partly compensated for the the revenue drop, according to
the statement.  Cyprus’s budget deficit is likely to narrow this year to
less than 4 percent of economic output, from 5.5 percent in
2010, Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis said Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
