  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) ’s
refinery in southern Hainan province will raise oil processing
by 3 percent this month to boost gasoline supplies in the
domestic market, a company official said.  The plant will refine 700,000 metric tons of crude this
month, compared with 680,000 tons in February, said the official,
who declined to be identified because of company rules. The 8-
million-ton-a-year refinery has halted reformate exports since
January as domestic demand for auto fuel rises, according to the
official. Reformate is an unfinished form of gasoline that’s
aromatic-rich and high in octane.  The Hainan refinery won’t export any reformate in the
second quarter, the official said. Gasoline inventory at Sinopec,
or  China  Petroleum, dropped “quite quickly,” according to the
official, who didn’t elaborate.  Sinopec, the nation’s largest oil refiner, is studying
using “price leverage” to spur its refining units to boost
gasoline output, President Wang Tianpu was quoted as saying in a
statement on its parent’s website March 9. Sinopec’s second-
largest oil refinery, Maoming in  Guangdong province , halted
exports of gasoline, the plant’s head Yu Xizhi said March 8.  China’s gasoline supply has been tight since the beginning
of the year after small domestic refineries, known as teapots,
reduced oil processing because of losses while demand gained
from rising vehicle sales, said the official.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Clyde Russell, John Viljoen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
