Twitter Inc., the social-networking
service that lets users share 140-character messages, said it’s
looking into an increase in error rates that’s making it harder
to access the site.  “We are aware of the problem and taking action,” the San
Francisco-based company said today at about 3 p.m. New York time
on  a blog  devoted to the site’s status.  Twitter has struggled with service disruptions as its
traffic surges. The average number of postings sent daily  rose 
to about 140 million in the past month, up from 50 million a
year earlier, the company said this week. Twitter had reported
“elevated error rates” an additional four times in February,
along with a range of other difficulties.  The company is increasingly counting on its site to deliver
advertising, potentially putting more revenue at stake when the
service goes down. Twitter’s surging prospects and potential ad
revenue have helped drive up its valuation. It was valued at
$3.7 billion in December when it received an investment led by
venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. That
compares with $1 billion in September 2009, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  Carolyn Penner, a spokeswoman for Twitter, declined to
comment beyond what was on the status blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
