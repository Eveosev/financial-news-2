Ryu Seung Sun, an analyst at Mirae
Asset Securities Co., comments on today’s gains in South Korean
stocks. The Kospi index rose 1.1 percent to 1,944.67 as of 1:18
p.m. in  Seoul .  The gauge slumped 2.4 percent yesterday, the most since
Nov. 11, amid concerns stemming from damage to Japanese nuclear
power plants following the country’s largest earthquake on
record.  “Today’s rise is largely stemming from perceptions that
yesterday’s fall was excessive.  ‘‘It’s true stocks are cheap now. Fundamentals haven’t
changed much, and the earthquake could actually weaken
inflationary pressure.  ‘‘The market will move without a firm direction around the
bottom for the time being, because nothing has been resolved.
Uncertainties will remain, although the mid-term trend remains
upward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
