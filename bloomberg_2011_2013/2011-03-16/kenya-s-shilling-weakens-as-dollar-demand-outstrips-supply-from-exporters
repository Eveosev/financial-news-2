  Kenya ’s shilling weakened as demand
for dollars by importers outstripped supplies from exporters of
agricultural goods.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy fell as much
as 0.23 percent and was trading down 0.1 percent at 85.85 per
dollar at 11:54 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The shilling
rebounded from a 17-year low yesterday, closing at 85.80
yesterday, the first day it gained since March 2.  “The inflows from agricultural export provided a momentary
relief to the local unit, snapping the losing streak, but the
high demand for the greenback by importers has pushed the
shilling onto the back foot, which is expected to keep it under
pressure,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC
Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview.  The shilling has depreciated 6 percent this year to the
weakest level since March 1994, making it the fourth-worst
performer worldwide against the dollar after Suriname’s dollar,
the Sudanese pound and  Vietnam ’s dong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Traders have cited political unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East, as well as speculative
positions against the shilling, as being among the reasons for
the Kenyan currency’s weakness, according to the country’s
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
