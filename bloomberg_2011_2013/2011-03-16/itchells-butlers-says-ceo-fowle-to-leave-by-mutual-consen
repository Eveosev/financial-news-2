  Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the U.K.
owner of Harvester and Toby Carvery pubs and restaurants, said
Chief Executive Officer Adam Fowle will leave the company by
“mutual consent.”  Jeremy Blood, currently a non-executive director on the
board, will be made interim chief executive officer until a
permanent successor is found, the Birmingham, England-based
company said today in a Regulatory News Service statement. Fowle
will stay with the company for a period “to ensure an orderly
and effective transition.”  “Adam has made a significant contribution over a number of
years to Mitchells & Butlers,” Chairman Simon Burke said in the
statement. “He leaves the company in a much stronger position
than when he took over as Chief Executive.”  Blood was appointed as a non-executive to Mitchells &
Butlers in January 2010 and was managing director at Scottish &
Newcastle Plc from 2007 until May 2009, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
