Gambian President Yahya Jammeh
invited representatives of independent media organizations to a
meeting for the first time in a decade to help improve relations
between the government and reporters.  The meeting is due to take place on March 18, Fatou Camara,
director of public relations at the president’s office in the
capital, Banjul, told newspaper editors on March 9.  Gambia’s independent media hasn’t been allowed to attend
official functions and press briefings at the State House or
receive press statements for more than a decade, according to
Emil Touray, secretary general of the Gambia Press Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
