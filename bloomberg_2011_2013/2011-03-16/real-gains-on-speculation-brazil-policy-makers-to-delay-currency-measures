  Brazil ’s real rose on speculation
the government may postpone new measures aimed at containing the
currency’s appreciation after last week’s earthquake fueled
expectations that Japanese investors may repatriate funds to
help rebuild the country.  The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.6612 per dollar at 9:05 a.m.
New York time, from 1.6653 yesterday. The currency has gained
6.4 percent in the past 12 months.  The government is monitoring the market to evaluate
potential new currency measures, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said yesterday in Brasilia. Officials have been considering new
measures that would set time requirements for foreigners’ stock
investments to stay in the country, according to a government
official briefed on the plans.  “With this intention of the government to wait, the market
is going to test” the level of the real, Alfredo Barbutti, an
economist at Liquidez DTVM Ltda., the second-biggest currency
broker on the BM&FBovespa exchange, said in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo .  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 12.34 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
