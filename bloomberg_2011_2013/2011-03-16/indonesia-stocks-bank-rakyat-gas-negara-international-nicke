Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  rose 6.99 points, or 0.2
percent, to 3,531.48 after dropping 1.3 percent yesterday.  Energy companies: PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS IJ), the
nation’s biggest gas distributor, dropped 1.4 percent to 3,650
rupiah. PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG IJ),  Indonesia ’s second-
largest listed oil company, retreated 1.6 percent to 124 rupiah.  Crude oil futures tumbled yesterday in New York by the most
in almost five months, falling 4 percent to $97.18 a barrel. Oil
rose 1.3 percent to $98.40 a barrel in after-hours trading. A
lower oil price cuts the appeal of alternative fuels such as
gas.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ), the nation’s biggest
carrier, rose 1.8 percent to 560 rupiah, the highest close since
Feb. 18, as crude oil dropped in  New York . A lower oil price may
help reduce the airline’s fuel costs.  PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO IJ), the nation’s
largest producer of the metal, declined 1.1 percent to 4,650
rupiah. Nickel futures fell 4.3 percent to $24,705 a metric ton
in  London  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
