  Japan ’s yen weakened against the
dollar as the nation’s central bank pumped more funds into the
financial system, boosting Asian stock markets and damping
demand for the safest assets.  The yen depreciated against all but one of its 16 most-
actively traded counterparts as the Nikkei 225 Index rose for
the first day in five, gaining 5.7 percent. The  Bank of Japan 
added 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) in one-day operations.  The yen declined 0.3 percent against the dollar to 80.92 as
of 8:04 a.m. in London.  Switzerland ’s franc depreciated 0.2
percent to 91.85 centimes per dollar.  The euro snapped a three-day advance, declining 0.2 percent
to $1.3969.  To contact the reporter on this story:
