  Al-Ahli Bank of Kuwait (ABK)  is
continuing its policy of expansion in the Gulf Cooperation
Council states and is interested in a presence in Qatar,  Al-
Watan  reported today, citing Chairman Abdullah Al-Sumait.  Al-Ahli could expand in Qatar either through opening a new
branch or acquiring a strategic stake in a Qatar-based lender,
Al-Sumait said, according to the Kuwaiti newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
