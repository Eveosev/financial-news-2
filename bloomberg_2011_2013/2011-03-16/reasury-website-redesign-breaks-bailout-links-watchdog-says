Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the fourth-
biggest U.S. railroad, followed  Massachusetts Institute of
Technology  in selling 100-year bonds this month as investors
snap up yields above 5 percent on investment-grade debt.  Norfolk Southern sold $400 million of 6 percent debt due
2111 to yield 175 basis points more than 30-year Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  MIT , the school founded
by William Barton Rogers in 1861, sold $750 million of taxable
5.6 percent 100-year bonds on May 11 at a 130 basis-point
spread, Bloomberg data show.  Borrowers are tapping the market for funding that exceeds
the average  life expectancy  in the U.S., which is about 79 years
according to World Bank  figures , as investors seek higher
returns than on typical investment-grade securities. The average
yield on an investment-grade corporate bond fell to 3.75 percent
yesterday, the lowest since November, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data, making longer-maturity debt
more attractive.  “That magic six handle on an IG credit is kind of hard to
meet these days,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “There’s not
much risk differential between holding a 100-year bond versus a
30-year bond. There is some psychology that might make 100-year
bonds a little more volatile but I would wager most of the
buyers aren’t going to be trading them, they’re going to be
investing.”  Norfolk Southern also sold 100-year bonds in August,
Bloomberg data show. The biggest U.S. railroads are Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC, Union Pacific
Corp. and CSX Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
