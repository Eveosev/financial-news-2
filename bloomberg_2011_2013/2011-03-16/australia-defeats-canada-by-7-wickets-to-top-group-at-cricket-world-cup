  Australia  defeated  Canada  by seven
wickets to take over the top of Group A at the Cricket World
Cup.  Australia reached 212-3 after 34.5 overs at the Chinnaswamy
Stadium in Bangalore, and is unbeaten in its last 34 World Cup
matches. Canada was 211 all out after 45.4 overs.  Canada’s 19-year-old opening batsman Hiral Patel put
pressure on Australia before he was caught on 54 off Shane
Watson. The Canadians’ run rate dropped after the wicket and
only Ashish Bagai (39) and Zubin Surkari (34) could push the
bowlers. Brett Lee took 4-46.  After a slow start, Watson and  Brad Haddin  combined for 183
runs before Haddin was out for 88. Watson was out for 94 to lead
Australia, which won with 91 balls remaining.  “They made it pretty hard to score,” Watson said after
the match.  Australia has 9 points, with  New Zealand  and Pakistan on 8
points and Sri Lanka on 7 points, all after playing 5 games.
Canada has played all 6 of its games, and will go home with 2
points.  The top four teams in each of the two tables will qualify
for the quarterfinals. The event ends April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
