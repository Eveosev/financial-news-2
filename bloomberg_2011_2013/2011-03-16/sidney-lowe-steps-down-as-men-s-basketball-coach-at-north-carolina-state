Sidney Lowe stepped down as men’s
basketball coach at  North Carolina  State University, having
failed to guide the team to the national tournament during his
five years in charge.  Lowe’s resignation comes less than a week after the
Wolfpack lost to the University of  Maryland  in the first round
of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. He took over a team
that had reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament in five straight years before his arrival.  Associate head coach Monte Towe will take over during a
search for a new head coach, Athletic Director Deborah Yow said
in a statement on the Raleigh, North Carolina, school’s website.  Lowe, 51, leaves with an overall record of 86-78 and 25-55
in the ACC.  “I have been truly blessed by the opportunity to coach at
my alma mater,” Lowe said on the school’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
