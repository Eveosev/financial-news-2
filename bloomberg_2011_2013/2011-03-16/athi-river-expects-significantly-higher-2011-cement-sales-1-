  Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML) ,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest cement producer by market value, said it expects
sales of the building material to increase “significantly”
this year as demand in East Africa grows at 10 percent annually.  The company, based in Nairobi, posted a 23 percent increase
in net income for the 12 months through December to 792 million
shillings ($9.2 million), as revenue grew 16 percent to 5.96
billion shillings, according to a statement e-mailed by the
Kenyan stock exchange today.  ARM, as the company is known, invested 2 billion shillings
in clinker and cement capacity in Kenya, doubling cement
production capacity by January after upgrading Kaloleni plant in
the port city of Mombasa, and building a new cement crushing
plant in Athi River, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from Nairobi. A
further 1.6 billion was invested in building plants in
neighboring  Tanzania .  The “Dar es Salaam cement grinding plant, with capacity of
750,000 tons per year, is expected to be commissioned in
December this year, whilst the 1.5 million tons per year clinker
and cement integrated plant at Tanga is expected to be
commissioned in mid-2012,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
