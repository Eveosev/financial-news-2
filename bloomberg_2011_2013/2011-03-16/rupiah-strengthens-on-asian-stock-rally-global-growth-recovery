Indonesia’s rupiah gained,
recovering from its biggest one-day drop in two months, as
regional stocks rose and the  Federal Reserve  signaled a more
positive assessment of the economy. Benchmark bonds advanced.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks surged more than 2
percent today after losing 5 percent yesterday. The pickup in
the  U.S. economy  “is on a firmer footing, and overall
conditions in the labor market appear to be improving
gradually,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a
statement yesterday.  “Bargain hunters are lifting the market, seeing attractive
levels after the massive correction yesterday,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a Singapore-based economist at Barclays Capital. “It’s a
risk-on environment today helped by the optimistic statement
from the Fed.”  The rupiah advanced 0.4 percent to 8,775 per dollar as of
5:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency weakened 0.6 percent yesterday, its biggest one-day
drop since Jan. 10.  Smoke or steam was seen rising from Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power complex this morning,
after reactors in  Japan  were damaged by the 9-magnitude
earthquake on March 11.  “Uncertainties will remain fairly high so we can expect
markets to be volatile,” added Sofat.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 fell five basis points to 8.36
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter- Dealer
Market Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
