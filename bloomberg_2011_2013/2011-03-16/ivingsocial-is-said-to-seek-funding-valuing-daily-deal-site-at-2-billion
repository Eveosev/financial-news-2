LivingSocial , the second-largest
website devoted to daily coupons, is close to raising as much as
$400 million in funding that would value the company at more
than $2 billion, two people with knowledge of the talks said.  Venture-capital firms and larger institutional investors
are expected to participate in the financing, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the discussions haven’t
been made public.  LivingSocial would use the new funding in its effort to
narrow Groupon Inc.’s lead in the daily-deal market, which
consulting firm  BIA/Kelsey  predicts will surge to $3.93 billion
by 2015. Groupon has raised more than $1.1 billion in three
rounds of financing, including a $950 million investment that
closed in January.  The funding may be completed as early as next week, one of
the people said. Maire Griffin, a spokeswoman for  Washington ,
D.C.-based LivingSocial, declined to comment.  Groupon and LivingSocial make money by offering local-
business deals to their subscribers -- say, $20 off a $40
haircut. The sites then keep a portion of the revenue raised.  Both companies each hiring large sales forces to solicit
business in a growing number of markets. LivingSocial said in
December that it expects to at least triple its employees base
to 1,800 this year and double the number of markets it serves to
300.  Groupon  has more than 5,900 employees selling deals in more
than 500 markets. The financing that closed in January valued
Groupon at $4.75 billion, people familiar with the matter said
at the time.  Gaining Market Share?  Groupon and LivingSocial control more than 90 percent of
the daily-deal market, LivingSocial Chief Executive Officer Tim
O’Shaughnessy said in an interview in December. LivingSocial is
gaining a few percentage points of share every month, he said.  LivingSocial began testing a new service last week that
lets local merchants set up deals for specific days and periods
of time using an Apple Inc. iPad.  LivingSocial said in December that it raised $183 million
from investors led by e-commerce site  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that
LivingSocial is in talks to raise about $500 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
