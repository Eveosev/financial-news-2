  News Corp. (NWSA)  has started a process to
decide on the future of its MySpace social network “in
earnest,”  Jonathan Miller , head News Corp.’s digital media
group, said today.  “We’re trying to strategically figure out what to do with
MySpace,” Miller said at a media conference in Abu Dhabi.  News Corp., which paid $580 million for MySpace in 2005,
may end up selling the Beverly Hills, California-based company,
for $50 million to $200 million, according to MocoSpace, a
potential acquirer. News Corp. has agreed to talks about a
possible sale, MocoSpace said in February.  Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. is considering options for
MySpace after it was surpassed by social-networking rival
Facebook Inc. in users. In January, MySpace said it would cut
about 500 jobs, or 47 percent of its workers, as part of a broad
restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
