The following is the text of  Canada 's manufacturing shipments report for January
released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales increased 4.5% to $47.7 billion in
January, the highest level since October 2008. While the
gains were widespread, the increase was mostly
concentrated in the transportation equipment sector. The
increase in total sales was the largest since July 2009
(+5.3%).  Constant dollar manufacturing sales rose 5.5% in
January. Constant dollar sales were relatively stable over
the latter half of 2010, before the gain in January.  Higher sales were reported in 17 of 21 industries,
representing 87% of total manufacturing.  Sales gains concentrated in the transportation equipment
industry  Although the majority of industries posted higher sales
in January, the gains were mostly concentrated in the  motor vehicle  and parts industries as well as aerospace
product and parts.  Manufacturing sales of motor vehicles rose 26.0% to
$4.1 billion in January. The gain reflects large increases
at a number of assembly plants following slowdowns and
production difficulties in December caused by severe
weather conditions in Southern Ontario. The increase is
consistent with the 22.9% rise in exports of passenger
autos and chassis recorded for January. Related to the
rise in motor vehicle assembly, sales in the motor vehicle
parts industry rose 23.2%.  Production in the aerospace product and parts industry
was up 25.2% to $1.3 billion. The increase in January was
the largest since December 2009.  Sales advanced 6.7% in the machinery industry to $2.6
billion. The rise reflects higher sales of agricultural,
mining and construction machinery, as well as increased
sales by engine, turbine and power transmission equipment
manufacturers.  In the  food industry , sales were up 2.2% to $7.1
billion. Part of the increase reflects a 0.3% rise in food
prices, as recorded by the Industrial Product Price Index.  Sales gains focused in four provinces  Higher sales were reported by four provinces in
January, representing 81% of total manufacturing.  Sales increased 5.8% to $21.9 billion in Ontario. The
increase was largely a result of higher sales in the motor
vehicle (+27.1%) and motor vehicle parts (+24.4%)
industries. Food (+3.3%) also contributed to the
provincial gain.  In  Quebec , sales advanced 7.4% to $11.8 billion. A
substantial 48.7% increase by manufacturers in the
transportation equipment industry was responsible for just
over half of the provincial gain. Other industries with
sales increases included food (+8.1%), petroleum and coal
products (+4.3%) and wood products (+8.0%).  Rounding out the gains in January, sales in British
Columbia rose 3.2%, while sales in  New Brunswick  increased
3.8%.  On the downside, sales fell 4.2% in Manitoba to $1.2
billion, as a result of declines in the transportation
equipment and chemical product industries. Sales fell 3.0%
in Saskatchewan, mostly reflecting declines in the
province's non-durable goods industries.  Inventory levels continue to advance  Inventories held by manufacturers rose 1.2% in January
to $61.5 billion. Increases were reported by manufacturers
in 16 of 21 industries, led by the food (+2.9%),
fabricated metal product (+3.0%) and primary metal (+1.7%)
industries. Inventories have risen in six of the past
eight months, since their most recent low of $58.6 billion
in May 2010.  Manufacturers in the motor vehicle industry reported a
25.2% drop in inventories to $1.0 billion. In December,
inventories in the industry had increased a substantial
37.9%, as severe weather conditions in Southern Ontario
affected production at some plants. The decline in January
reflects a return to a level more comparable to values
reported during the rest of 2010.  The inventory-to-sales ratio fell from 1.33 in December
to 1.29 in January. This was the lowest level for the
ratio since July 2008 (1.26).  Unfilled orders rise for the first time in five months  Unfilled orders rose 1.6% in January to $52.3 billion,
mostly reflecting an increase in the aerospace product and
parts industry. The overall gain was the first increase
since August 2010.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, unfilled
orders increased 3.4% to $21.7 billion in January.
Excluding aerospace, unfilled orders edged up 0.3%.  Unfilled orders in the fabricated metal product
industry were up 2.0% in January, contributing to the
backlog of orders.  Declines in unfilled orders in the railroad rolling
stock (-1.8%), computer and electronic product (-1.1%) and
food (-8.8%) industries partly offset the overall gains.  New orders increased 8.6% to $48.5 billion in January.
The leading contributors to the increase included the
aerospace product and parts, motor vehicle, motor vehicle
parts and fabricated metal product industries.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise
specified.  Preliminary data are provided for the current reference
month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated
for the three previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills,
clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and
related support activities, petroleum and coal products,
chemicals, and plastics and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components,
transportation equipment, furniture and related products
and miscellaneous manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the  aerospace industry  and shipbuilding industries,
the value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting
monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change
in inventories of goods in process and finished products
manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will
contribute to future sales assuming that the orders are
not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the
current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum
of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled
orders from the previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
