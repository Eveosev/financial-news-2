OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  jumped the most in
three weeks after three people with knowledge of the matter said
that OAO Mechel is considering acquiring shares in the Russian
coal producer.  The stock climbed 3.2 percent to 189.5 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest gain since Feb. 21.  Mechel,  Russia â€™s largest miner of coal for steelmaking, is
considering acquiring shares in Raspadskaya as soaring demand
for the commodity spurs expansion, the people said, who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential.  Mechel may offer to exchange shares in its coal unit for
Raspadskaya stock, they said. Raspadskaya management and
steelmaker Evraz Group SA, which hold a combined 80 percent
stake, are seeking money rather than shares and have refused to
study the idea, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
