helicopters to drop water on the Fukushima facility today, even
as officials battled to prevent any of the four stricken
reactors at the site from suffering a meltdown. Clouds of white

workers from establishing whether their efforts had extinguished
the blaze.  Japan’s earthquake should have a “limited” impact on U.S.
growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist  Alec
Phillips . Disruptions to Japanese output could shift demand to
U.S. products, according to Phillips.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
