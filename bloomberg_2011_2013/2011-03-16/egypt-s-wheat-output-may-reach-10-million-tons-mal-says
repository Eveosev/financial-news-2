  Egypt ’s wheat harvest may reach 10
million metric tons in 2011 compared with 8 million tons last
year,  Al Mal  reported, citing Ahmed Ghonema, an adviser at the
economic affairs department at the Agriculture Ministry.  The ministry encouraged farmers to increase their wheat
cultivation areas and raised the price of grain it buys from
them to 350 Egyptian pounds ($59.1) per ardeb (150 kilograms)
compared with 250 pounds in the previous harvest season, the
Cairo-based newspaper quoted Ghonema as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
