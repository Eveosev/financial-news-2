The Japanese earthquake may
threaten the world’s supply of BT resin, used in electronic
devices including handsets, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Japan accounts for about 90% of global BT supply, Pauline
Chen and Josette Chang, analysts at the brokerage, wrote in
today’s report. IC substrate companies including  Kinsus
Interconnect Technology Corp. (3189)  and  Unimicron Technology Corp. (3037) 
will “suffer the most” from shortages, given the resin is
“the key” material, the analysts wrote.  Nonetheless, the “potential insufficient supply of BT”
could be a “bigger problem” for the overall technology supply
chain, the analysts wrote. “On a relative basis, we feel that
the handset supply chain might see a bigger negative impact, due
to market’s high expectations and its dependence on Japan for
upstream/precision components.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
