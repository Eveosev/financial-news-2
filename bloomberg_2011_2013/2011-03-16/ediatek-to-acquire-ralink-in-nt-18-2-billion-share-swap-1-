  MediaTek Inc. (2454) , Taiwan’s biggest
chip designer, said it will buy all of  Ralink Technology Corp. (3534) 
in a share swap valued at NT$18.2 billion ($616 million).  Ralink shareholders will get one Mediatek stock per 3.15
Ralink shares they currently hold in an acquisition to be
completed by Oct. 1, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based chip designer
said in a  statement  today. The ratio values Ralink stock at
NT$104.29 each, a 6 percent premium to the average closing price
over the past 30 days, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Mediatek’s purchase allows it to tap into Hsinchu-based
Ralink’s portfolio of chips used in WiFi wireless Internet and
digital subscriber line communications equipment. Mediatek’s
stock has fallen 21 percent this year as sales slowed.  “For phones it’s important to have a WiFi solution, while
DSL is important for commercial products and Ralink gives us
both,” Mediatek President CJ Hsieh said in a press conference
in Taipei today.  The Ralink transaction is the largest technology
acquisition in  Taiwan  since November 2009 when Innolux Display
Corp. announced it would buy Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. in a
deal valued at NT$318 billion, according to Bloomberg data based
on Mediatek and Ralink’s closing prices today. Mediatek will
issue new shares equal to 4.58 percent of the combined entity
after the acquisition, David Ku, general manager of finance at
Mediatek said.  Ralink, rose by its 6.9 percent daily limit to NT$103.50 at
the 1:30 p.m. close of trading in Taipei, before the
announcement. MediaTek climbed 3.1 percent to NT$328.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
