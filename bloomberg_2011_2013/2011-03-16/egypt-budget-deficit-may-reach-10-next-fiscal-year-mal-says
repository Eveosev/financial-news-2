  Egypt ’s budget deficit may reach 10
percent in the fiscal year starting in July if workers’ demands
continue to hinder the production process,  Al Mal  reported,
citing Finance Minister Samir Radwan.  The deficit is likely to reach between 8.3 percent and 8.5
percent by the end of the current fiscal year in June, and
economic growth may decline to 3.5 percent in the same period,
the Cairo-based newspaper cited Radwan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
