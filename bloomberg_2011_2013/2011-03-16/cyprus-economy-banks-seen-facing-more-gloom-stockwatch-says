economy as a whole will face continuing difficulties this year,
Stockwatch cited  Hellenic Bank Pcl (HB)  Chief Executive Officer Makis Keravnos as saying.  Two recent downgrades of  government bonds , together with
inflation and public-debt prospects, are worsening the economic
climate and the government is moving too slowly with measures to
tackle the crisis, according to Keravnos, the financial website
reported  today .  To contact the reporter on this story:
