Former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov’s conviction for stealing
the firm’s trade secrets by appropriating its computer source
code, should be upheld, a federal judge said.  In a March 14 order unsealed today, U.S. District Judge  Denise Cote  in New York rejected a request by Aleynikov’s lawyer
to set aside his conviction. Cote also denied Aleynikov’s
request to dismiss the indictment or grant him a new trial.  Aleynikov was convicted in December of violating the
Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Property Act. He faces as long as 10 years in prison on
the espionage charge and five years for the interstate
transportation charge when he’s sentenced March 18.  The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
