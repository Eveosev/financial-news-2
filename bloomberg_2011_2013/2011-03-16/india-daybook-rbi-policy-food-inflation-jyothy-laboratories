  India â€™s central bank may raise  interest rates  today, a Bloomberg News survey showed, after
inflation accelerated last month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may raise its repurchase rate by
a quarter-percentage point to 6.75 percent, all 26 economists in
the survey said. It may boost the reverse repurchase rate to
5.75 percent from 5.5 percent, according to 25 of 26 forecasts,
with one predicting no change.
