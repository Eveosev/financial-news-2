Egyptian prosecutors ordered the
detention for 15 days of a foreign citizen accused of spying for  Israel , the state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported today without
saying how it got the information.  The suspect entered the country after the Jan. 25 uprising
to “collect information related to the security of the
country,” the newspaper said. He confessed to spying, the paper
said. Investigators are looking into the possibility of partners
working with the suspect, it said. The newspaper didn’t identify
the nationality of the suspect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
