Gold rose in  New York  amid
speculation that yesterday’s decline to a one-month low was
overdone.  The metal dropped 2.3 percent yesterday following a slump
in equities and commodities. Japanese stocks rose today for the
first time in five days as the nation attempts to prevent a
nuclear disaster.  “Some of the panic-selling that we saw yesterday is
subsiding,” said Matt Zeman, a market strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago . “The commodity’s bull run is not over,
and people are looking to buy gold on dips.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $9.40, or 0.7 percent,
to $1,402.20 an ounce at 12:02 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday, the price touched $1,380.70, the lowest since Feb.
17. Gold reached a record $1,445.70 on March 7.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced 53.3 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $34.65 an ounce. Yesterday, the price fell as much
as 6.3 percent to $33.565. The metal has doubled in the past
year.  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed $3.70, or 0.5
percent, to $708.60 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for April delivery rose $3.40, or 0.2
percent, to $1,709 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
