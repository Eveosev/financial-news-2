South Korea’s financial regulator
plans to review whether  Lone Star  Funds is the legitimate owner
of  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  at a meeting today as  Hana Financial
Group Inc. (086790)  awaits approval to acquire it from the buyout firm.  The  Financial Services Commission  will discuss whether
Dallas-based Lone Star should be ordered to reduce its 51
percent stake in Seoul-based Korea Exchange Bank, the
regulator’s spokesman Ernst Lee said by telephone today. The
agenda doesn’t include a discussion of whether to approve Hana’s
takeover, Lee said.  Lone Star, the buyout fund controlled by  John Grayken , has
tried for more than five years to sell its holding in Korea
Exchange Bank as regulators examine the circumstances
surrounding its 2003 investment in the lender. Hana Chairman Kim Seung Yu agreed in November to buy the stake for 4.7 trillion
won ($4.2 billion).    South Korea  allows financial institutions to hold as much
as 10 percent of its banks, while limiting other investors to 4
percent. The purchase of a stake exceeding those limits is
subject to regulatory approval.  Lone Star’s holding in Korea Exchange Bank came into
question following a probe that began in 2006 into allegations
that it paid artificially low prices for the stake. The nation’s
top court last year cleared the fund.  Korea Exchange Bank rose 1 percent to 8,990 won as of 11:27
a.m. in Seoul trading, while Hana Financial advanced 0.4 percent
to 42,150 won. The Kospi index increased 1.2 percent.  Lone Star had to scrap an attempt to sell its Korea
Exchange Bank stake to HSBC Holdings Plc in 2008 amid the
regulator’s delay in ruling on the eligibility. Kookmin Bank,
now part of  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , walked away from talks to
buy control of Korea Exchange Bank in November 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
