  Algeria ’s imports of steel products
may drop “significantly” this year following the completion of
infrastructure projects in the country, said Mohamed-Laid
Lachgar, secretary general of the Arab Iron & Steel Union.  “This decline is attributed to the completion of most
major infrastructures and public works projects launched by
Algeria during the last five years,” Lachgar said yesterday in
an interview in Algiers, the capital. He didn’t give a figure
for the likely drop.  Algeria’s steel imports rose about 10 percent in 2010 to 4
million metric tons, Lachgar said. The country produced 1.5
million tons of steel products in the year, of which 1.1 million
came from  ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Annaba unit and the rest from Algerian
companies, he said.  A 25 million-ton production estimate for Arab countries in
2011 will be revised downwards because of the political turmoil
in some parts of the region, he said. Steel demand in Arab
countries will be 30 million tons in 2011 and 35 million tons in
2012, Lachgar said.  “Many plants are idle, notably in Egypt, Bahrain and  Tunisia ,” Lachgar said. “Others are outright shut down, such
as the plant of Misurata in  Libya .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
