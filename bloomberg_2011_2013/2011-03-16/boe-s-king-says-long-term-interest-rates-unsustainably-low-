Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said that global policy makers’ response to the financial
crisis of 2008 has left borrowing costs too low.  “This extraordinary policy response has simply postponed
much of the required adjustment in spending patterns around the
world,” King said in prepared remarks to the Central Party
School in Beijing today. “And long-term real  interest rates  are
unsustainably low.”  King’s remarks were similar to those delivered in Stanford,
California, on  March 11 .  --Kevin Hamlin. Editor: Chris Anstey, Ken McCallum  To contact the reporters on this story:
