The Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries may reassess global demand for oil after an
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , Nigerian Foreign Minister Odein Ajumogobia said.  OPEC is set up to “stabilize the market,” he said in New
Delhi today. “OPEC is currently maintaining its ceiling. I
think the current events in North Africa will probably inform
the decision as to where those ceilings will be increased.”  Nigeria, the sixth-largest OPEC producer, plans to raise
crude production capacity to 4 million barrels a day from 2.5
million barrels, Ajumogobia said. The West African nation is
willing to increase output if requested by OPEC to compensate
for declining shipments in Libya, state-owned Nigerian National
Oil Corp. said March 9.  Attacks by armed groups targeting the oil industry cut more
than 28 percent of the country’s crude output from 2006 to 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The actions have
subsided after thousands of militants campaigning for more local
control of the delta’s energy resources accepted a government
amnesty and disarmed two years ago.  Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. crude imports.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,
Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  operate
joint ventures with NNPC that pump most of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
