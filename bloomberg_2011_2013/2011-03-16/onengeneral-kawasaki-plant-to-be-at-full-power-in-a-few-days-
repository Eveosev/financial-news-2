TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. has
brought back a “portion” of its 335,000 barrel-a-day Kawasaki
refinery near  Tokyo  to full operations, the company said in a
statement yesterday.  The plant shut after the March 11 earthquake off  Japan ’s
northeast coast. A restart of the other units at the Kawasaki
refinery will start “as early as” tomorrow with the entire
complex operating at full capacity “a few days later,”
according to the statement on the company’s website.  Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd.’s 175,000 barrel-a-day
facility in Chiba, near Tokyo, is preparing to start up its
units, the statement said. The company is a joint venture
between TonenGeneral and Mitsui & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
