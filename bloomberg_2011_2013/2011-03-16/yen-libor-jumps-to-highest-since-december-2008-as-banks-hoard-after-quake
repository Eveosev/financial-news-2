Yen borrowing costs between banks
in  London  jumped to the highest level in more than two years as
lenders hoarded the currency after the nation’s worst earthquake.  The London one-day interbank offered rate, or Libor, for
yen loans climbed 38 basis points to 0.491 percent yesterday,
the highest level since Dec. 9, 2008, according to the British
Bankers’ Association. Libor for one week gained 9 basis points
to 0.206 percent, the most since April 16, 2009, while the rate
for three-month loans added about one basis point to 0.2 percent.  “During yesterday’s London trading, pressure increased to
swap currency from dollars to yen,” Yoichi Muto, director at
the Tokyo branch of Commerzbank AG. “Some foreign banks
couldn’t help but raise rates and secure funds because certain
financial institutions were hoarding yen and not investing.”  The yen was at 80.85 per dollar as of 1:47 p.m. in  Tokyo 
from 80.72 yesterday in  New York .  The  Bank of Japan  added 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) to the
system today after pouring in a record 15 trillion yen on March
14 and 8 trillion yen yesterday in one-day funding. It doubled
an asset-purchase program to 10 trillion yen on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
