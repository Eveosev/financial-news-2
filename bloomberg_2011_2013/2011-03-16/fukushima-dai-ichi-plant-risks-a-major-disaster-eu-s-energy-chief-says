European Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger said his assessment that  Japan ’s crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant risks provoking a “major
disaster” is based on information from the European Union, the
EU mission in  Tokyo , the  International Atomic Energy Agency  and
media reports.  “The site is effectively out of control,” Oettinger told
a European Parliament committee today in Brussels. “In the
coming hours, there could be further catastrophic events.”  Oettinger, who represents the European Commission, the 27
nation EU’s executive arm, said a further deterioration in the
situation could lead to the deaths of people in Japan. “We are
somewhere between a disaster and a major disaster,” he said.
“We are very much concerned and deeply distressed by the
pictures we are seeing from Japan.”  That assessment is based on information from the Brussels-
based commission, the Tokyo-based EU mission to Japan and the
IAEA in Vienna, as well as media reports, Oettinger said after
his appearance in the parliament. “All these experts who read with
better glasses than mine,” Oettinger said.  Oettinger’s spokeswoman,  Marlene Holzner , told reporters in
a briefing earlier today in Brussels that the information the
commission has about the situation in Japan “is partly from the
media, partly from the government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
