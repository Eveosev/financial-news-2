  Harris Corp. (HRS) , a provider of
information technology services to the government, said it will
team with EMC Corp.’s security division and the Virtual
Computing Environment Co. to produce secure cloud products.  The partnership aims to “further accelerate the adoption
of cloud infrastructure as a service” in government and
corporations by adding more security features to assure
customers their data is safe, Melbourne, Florida-based Harris
said in a statement today.  U.S. Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra is pushing
agencies to adopt cloud computing for networks and applications,
in which organizations share computing resources managed by
private contractors. The initiative is part of a greater effort
by the Obama administration to cut  government spending  in
response to a federal  budget deficit .  The partnership will provide so-called multitenant cloud
services, in which more than one organization shares a cloud
platform.  “The core inhibitors to cloud adoption are concerns over
secure multitenancy,” Bret Harman, chief technology officer for
EMC’s security division, said in the statement. “Organizations
require assurances that shared resources don’t mean shared data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
