European Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger said his assessment that  Japan ’s crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant risks provoking a “major
disaster” is based on information from the European Union, the
Japanese government, the  International Atomic Energy Agency  and
media reports.  “The site is effectively out of control,” Oettingger told
a European Parliament committee today in Brussels. “In the
coming hours, there could be further catastrophic events.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
