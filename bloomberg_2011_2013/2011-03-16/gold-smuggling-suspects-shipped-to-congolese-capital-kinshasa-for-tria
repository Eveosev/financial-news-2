The Democratic Republic of Congo
transferred four foreign nationals accused of smuggling more
than $25 million in gold and cash to the capital, Kinshasa, for
trial, according to Julien Paluku, governor of the North Kivu
province.  Two Nigerians, a U.S. citizen and a French national were
flown to Kinshasa yesterday from Goma, North Kivu’s capital,
where they had been held since Feb. 4, Paluku said by phone
today, without commenting further.  Soldiers in Congo’s army are also implicated in the case,
in which $6.5 million in cash and more than 400 kilograms
(12,860 troy ounces) of gold was seized, Paluku said on Feb. 25.
Their U.S.-registered plane, which had flown in from  Nigeria  and
was impounded in Goma, is now in Kinshasa, Congo’s Minister of
Communications Lambert Mende said by phone today.  Congo is struggling to break the links between armed groups
and illicit mineral exploitation, which has fuelled more than
fifteen years of conflict in the country’s east. More than 80
percent of gold mined in the country is smuggled out, according
to the Ministry of Mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
