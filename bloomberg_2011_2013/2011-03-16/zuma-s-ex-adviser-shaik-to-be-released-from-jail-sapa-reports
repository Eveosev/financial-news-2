Schabir Shaik, South African
President  Jacob Zuma ’s former financial adviser, will be
released after being arrested for violating his parole
conditions, the South African Press Association said, citing the
Department of Correctional Services.  Shaik hit Mohammed Ismail outside a mosque in Durban, the
Sunday Times reported on March 13. The department could not find
Ismail to help with its investigations, Johannesburg-based Sapa
said, citing unidentified department officials.  In 2005, Shaik was convicted of trying to solicit a bribe
for Zuma from arms dealers. Shaik served 28 months of his 15-
year prison sentence before being freed on medical parole,
granted to terminally ill inmates, in March last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
