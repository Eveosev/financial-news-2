(Corrects interest margins in fourth paragraph of story
published yesterday.)    Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-
largest brewer, proposed terms on a credit line to refinance a 2
billion-euro ($2.8 billion) facility maturing next year,
according to three people with knowledge of the situation.  Heineken is seeking to pay 42.5 basis points over the euro
interbank offered rate on money it draws from the five-year
revolving credit with two one-year extension options, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again
once it’s been repaid. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Amsterdam-based company plans to replace the loan
signed in 2003 with a similar-sized transaction, Heineken
spokesman John-Paul Schuirink said today by telephone. He
declined to comment on the terms of the new deal.  Heineken’s existing  credit line  pays lenders an interest
margin of 17 basis points on drawn funds, according to company
filings. The loan was priced with an initial margin of 22.5
basis points by arrangers  Barclays Capital , JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
