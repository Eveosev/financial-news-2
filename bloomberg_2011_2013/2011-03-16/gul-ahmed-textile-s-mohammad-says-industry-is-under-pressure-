Bashir Ali Mohammad, chairman,  Pakistan ’s  Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd. (GATM) , comments on higher
cotton prices and the delay in arrivals of Pakistan’s cotton
crop. Mohammad, also president of the International Textile
Manufacturers Federation, spoke at a conference in Dubai today.  On impact of higher cotton prices:  “The entire cotton textile value chain is under
pressure.” Input costs are “difficult to pass on,” he said.  On cotton arrivals in Pakistan:  “Due to bad weather in Pakistan our crop is delayed by
three weeks and if the crop is not coming in because of these
high prices, we fear a mill closure, a considerable mill
closure, in May and June.”  ---Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
