Treasuries fluctuated as
earthquakes continued to rattle  Japan  and workers struggled to
avert a meltdown at a nuclear power plant. Bonds fell initially
as Japanese stocks gained.  A fire and aftershocks struck the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
plant north of Tokyo today, and officials said fuel rods at two
reactors may have been damaged since last week’s earthquake and
tsunami. Shares trimmed early advances, bolstering demand for
the relative safety of government debt.  “Yields will fall due to the flight to quality,” said
Tsutomu Komiya, a  fund manager  in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $106.3 billion
and is part of Japan’s second-biggest brokerage by market value.
“We’re still feeling the aftershocks.”  U.S. 10-year yields were unchanged at 3.31 percent as of
1:12 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.625
percent note maturing in February 2021 traded at price of 102
21/32.  The note was down as much as 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, and up as much a 1/8 in Asian trading.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 4 percent, after
rallying as much 6.6 percent earlier today. It plunged 11
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
