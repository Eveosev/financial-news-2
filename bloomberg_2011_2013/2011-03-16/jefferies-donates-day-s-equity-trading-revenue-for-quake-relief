  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , repeating a
fundraising strategy that last year generated $7.5 million for
Haiti’s earthquake victims, will donate today’s global net
equity-trading revenue to disaster-relief efforts in  Japan .  Jefferies also is donating an entire week’s equity-trading
revenue from its Asia offices, contributing an additional $1
million and inviting employees to give a day’s salary, the New
York-based firm said yesterday.  “One of the things I’m most proud of with our company is
that we’ve got a lot of employees, clients, shareholders and a
board that really care,” Chief Executive Officer Richard B. Handler, 49, said in a telephone interview.  The magnitude-9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami that
struck Japan on March 11 killed at least 2,743 people, with
3,743 missing as of 6:30 p.m. local time yesterday, according to
official police figures. Fatalities may reach 10,000 in Miyagi
prefecture, police said. The nation also is working to contain
the spread of radiation following a series of explosions at
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima nuclear power plant.  Jefferies raised $7.5 million for victims of the 7.0-
magnitude earthquake that struck  Haiti  in January 2010, the
company said in a statement at the time. Clients generated $5.5
million of global trading commissions in one day, Jefferies
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
