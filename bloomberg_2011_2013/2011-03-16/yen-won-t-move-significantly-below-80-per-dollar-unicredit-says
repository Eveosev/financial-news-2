The yen will not strengthen
“significantly” past 80 per dollar as the  Bank of Japan  is
likely to intervene to counter the aftermath of last week’s
earthquake, according to UniCredit SpA.  The Japanese currency approached a 16-year high versus the
dollar today as nuclear crisis at a quake-damaged power plant
intensified, increasing speculation companies and investors will
repatriate funds to help pay for reconstruction.  “Risk aversion and repatriation flows should contribute to
yen-positive factors,” Stephan Maier, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Unicredit in Milan, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “However, the BOJ should prevent a collapse in dollar-
yen to levels significantly below the 80 watermark.”  Given the scale of the disaster, the central bank is
unlikely to face international criticism for any intervention,
and so may “prove more aggressive in  currency markets  in the
current situation than it had been last year,” Maier wrote.  Japan’s government sold 2.12 trillion yen ($26 billion) in
September, its first intervention in the foreign-exchange market
since 2004.  The yen was little changed at 80.71 per dollar at 9:54 a.m.
in  New York . The currency reached 80.22 yen on Nov. 1, the
strongest since April 1995, when it touched a post-World War II
high of 79.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
