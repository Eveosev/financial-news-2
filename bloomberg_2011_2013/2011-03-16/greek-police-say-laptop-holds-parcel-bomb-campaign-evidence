Greek police said a computer seized
in a raid this week held files in which an urban guerrilla group
claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to foreign
dignitaries and embassies in November.  The laptop, containing files from the Conspiracy of the
Cells of Fire, was found when police raided a property in Nea
Ionia, Volos, in a March 14 operation in which six people were
arrested, police said in an e-mailed statement. It also
contained a file in which the group claimed responsibility for a
bomb sent to  Greece â€™s justice ministry in February.  Police found three assault rifles, seven pistols, one
revolver, ammunition, police uniforms, wigs and wireless
communication devices in the raid.  Three of those arrested were wanted for participation in
the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire, which claimed
responsibility for the packages sent in November, causing
explosions in the Swiss and Russian embassies in  Athens .  To contact the reporter on this story:
