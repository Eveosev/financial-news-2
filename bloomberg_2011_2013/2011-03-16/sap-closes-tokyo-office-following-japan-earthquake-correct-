  SAP AG (SAP) , the world’s biggest
business software company, closed its office in Tokyo and asked
employees to work from home following the Japan earthquake.  Most employees in Japan are in sales, marketing and
development, said SAP spokeswoman Angelika Pfahler. A center in  China  provides support for customers in Japan, she said.  The German company, which has about 1,100 employees in
Japan, mostly in Tokyo, has reserved 520 rooms in Osaka and Kobe
that employees and their families can use as needed. The rooms
have been reserved “indefinitely,” Pfahler said.  The magnitude-9 earthquake on March 11 and a subsequent
tsunami devastated northeastern Japan, forcing some companies to
shut down offices and factories.  Japan  generated 513 million
euros ($714 million) of revenue for SAP last year, or about 4
percent of its total revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
