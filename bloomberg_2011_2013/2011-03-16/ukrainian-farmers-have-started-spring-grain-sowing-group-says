Planting of spring grains has begun
in  Ukraine , said Ivan Tomych, head of the Ukrainian farmers’
association.  “Farmers are already in the fields,” he said today an
Adam Smith Conference in Kiev. “They are sowing without knowing
if they will be able to sell their crop in July and August at”
attractive prices.  Ukraine’s government last year restricted grain exports in
an effort to keep domestic prices down. Current caps of 4.2
million metric tons are in force through the end of March.
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Feb. 22 that
the government was to decide by the middle of March whether to
increase wheat and corn quotas.  Spring sowing has started in Crimea, the peninsula that
extends from southern Ukraine into the  Black Sea , Liza Malyshko,
an analyst at Kiev-based researcher UkrAgroConsult, said today
by phone. Other southern regions will start sowing after March
25, and planting across the country will begin in April, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
