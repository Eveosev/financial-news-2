State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  may
reach an agreement with Turkey’s Botas on the transit and sale
of gas from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz project this year, company
President Rovnag Abdullayev said in televised comments.  Socar, as the state-run explorer is called, is also in
talks with Bulgaria on the sale of the Shah Deniz gas,
Abdullayev said today in remarks broadcast by the Lider
television channel.  The European Union is seeking to secure Azeri gas supplies
to diversify the 27-nation bloc’s imports away from reliance on
Russia by building links through Turkey. European energy
companies are vying for supplies from the $20 billion second
phase of Shah Deniz as they plan pipelines via  Turkey  from the
region. Russia has also expressed interest in buying Azeri gas.  Turkey and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum on gas transits
in June last year, which could trigger “major energy projects
in the region,” Turkish Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said at
the time.  Shah Deniz is the only potential supplier of so-called
Southern Corridor pipeline projects to  Europe  that has advanced
to the sales stage, Olav Skalmeraas, a Statoil vice president
for natural gas, said in November in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
