  Saudi Arabia ’s consultative body,
the  Shura Council , is worried about the amount of natural gas
such as methane and ethane allocated for petrochemical makers,
Al-Eqtisadiah  said , citing a report from the council’s Committee
on Economic Affairs and Energy.  The committee said that the picture for gas allocations in
the country is not clear, according to the newspaper. The
Ministry of Petroleum and  Mineral Resources  reported that it had
increased its gas allocation to local producers while the
authority for petrochemicals hubs Jubail and Yanbu said that new
plants and current expansion plans of many producers are on hold
due to the shortage of gas feedstock, the paper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
