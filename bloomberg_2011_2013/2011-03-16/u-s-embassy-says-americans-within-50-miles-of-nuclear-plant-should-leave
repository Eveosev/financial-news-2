The U.S. Embassy in  Tokyo  is
recommending that American citizens living within 50 miles of
the damaged nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, evacuate
or take shelter indoors as a precaution against possible
radiation exposure.  In a statement, U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos cited
reasons such as weather, wind direction and speed, and the risk
of radioactive contamination.  White House press secretary  Jay Carney  told reporters in  Washington  this afternoon shortly after the embassy statement
was released that the call to evacuate was prompted by a U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission review.  The NRC’s “independent analysis of the deteriorating
situation” in Japan spurred the U.S. to issue a recommendation
that goes further than the Japanese government’s guidelines,
Carney said. “We’re obviously very concerned about the safety
and security of American citizens in Japan.”  NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko briefed President  Barack Obama 
on the commission’s analysis today.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant was
damaged in the wake of the March 11 magnitude-9 earthquake and
tsunami. The containment vessel of the No. 2 reactor may have
been breached, said Masahisa Otsuku, a company nuclear-
maintenance official.  The Japanese government has recommended a 20-kilometer
(12-mile) evacuation zone around the stricken nuclear reactors,
located 220 kilometers north of Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
