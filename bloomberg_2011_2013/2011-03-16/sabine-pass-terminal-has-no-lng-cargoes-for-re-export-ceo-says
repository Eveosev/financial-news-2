  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  has no
liquefied natural gas stored at the Sabine Pass terminal in
Louisiana, Chief Executive Officer Charif Souki said in a phone
interview.  Sabine Pass and Freeport LNG in Texas are only terminals in
the U.S. that are authorized to export previously imported LNG
cargoes.  Sabine Pass sent three cargoes to the U.K., Spain, and
India in January, according to the Energy Department.  Anne Rappold, a spokeswoman for Freeport LNG in Houston,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail asking
whether it had LNG available for re-export.  Gas prices rose yesterday on speculation that shut nuclear
plants in  Japan  after the country’s worst earthquake on record
would lead to increased imports of LNG.  Natural gas for April delivery was down 1.8 cents to $3.923
per million British thermal units at 12:24 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
