  South Korea ’s biggest economic test
is taming inflation as price gains are set to remain elevated in
the coming months, central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  Price stability is “the greatest challenge facing the
Korean economy,” Kim said in the prepared text of a speech.
Officials need a multipronged approach to countering the “very
wide range of factors” driving inflation, he said.  South  Korea  joined Thailand and Vietnam in raising  interest
rates  last week as the Bank of Korea tries to stop consumer-
price growth exceeding its 4 percent ceiling for a third
straight month in March. The government is also applying price
controls and Kim said preventing wage increases spurred by
inflation expectations is also “vital.”  The governor also said he hopes  Japan  recovers quickly from
the earthquake and ensuing tsunami that struck March 11, aided
by worldwide economic cooperation to assist the nation in “its
hour of need.” He was due to give his speech in Seoul today from
about 12:35 p.m. local time.  The central bank on March 10 raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point for the second time this year, to
3 percent. Inflation climbed to a 27-month high of 4.5 percent
in February from a year earlier, and Kim said it may remain at a
“high level for some time.”  He maintained the Bank of Korea’s economic growth forecast
of 4.5 percent this year, while saying risks include rising oil
prices stoked by unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, and
the impact of a domestic outbreak of food-and-mouth disease.  To contact the reporters on this story:
