The Greek government’s sale of
state assets and real estate represents a long-term opportunity
for international investors partly because of the country’s
attraction as a tourist resort, said Constantinos Michalos,
President of the  Athens  Chamber of Commerce & Industry.  The government will outline a plan to raise 50 billion
euros ($70 billion) in state asset sales and real estate
ventures by the end of the month, the Greek Finance Ministry
announced on March 13.    Greece  continues to have geostrategic advantages as well
as offering investment opportunities,” Michalos said at a
conference in Athens today organized by the Greek-Russian
Chamber of Commerce.  Russian investors may be especially attracted by the sale
of real estate that will enable hotel complexes and theme parks
to be expanded, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
