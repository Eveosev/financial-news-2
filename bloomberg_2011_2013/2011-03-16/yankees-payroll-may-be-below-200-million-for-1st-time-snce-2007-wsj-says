The  New York Yankees  may begin the
2011 Major League Baseball season with a payroll of less than
$200 million for the first time since 2007, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing unidentified team officials.  The payroll is $189 million, and may rise to as much as
$193 million depending on the opening day roster, the Journal
said. Last year, the Yankees had opening day salaries of $206
million.  The team still stands to pay a luxury tax of 40 percent on
its expenditure over the $178 million limit, the Journal said.
Last year, the Yankees and Boston Red Sox both were charged for
exceeding the payroll limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
