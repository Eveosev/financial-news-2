Radiation levels in  Osaka , the
largest city in western Japan, remain low after explosions at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant about 600 kilometers
(373 miles) to the northeast, a researcher said.  Measurements taken as of noon by five monitoring devices at
Kyoto University’s Reactor  Institute  in Kumatori, southern Osaka,
show normal levels, Tomoyuki Takahashi said today by telephone.
The prefectural government yesterday asked the institute, which
doesn’t disclose precise figures, to report radiation levels
hourly, he said.  “We can’t predict what’s going to happen from now,”
Takahashi said. “It depends how strong the winds are and what
direction they take.”  He said radiation levels measured at 11 stations run by the
Osaka government office also show the situation remains normal.
An  average  of 0.049 microsieverts per hour was recorded at the
sites as of 3 p.m.  A fire and aftershocks today struck the Fukushima plant
that was crippled by  Japan ’s magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami,
hampering efforts to contain radiation leaking from the facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
