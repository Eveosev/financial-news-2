Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said today she intends to complete four years as secretary of
state, though she doesn’t want to serve in the cabinet or seek
elected office again.  Clinton, in an interview with  CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer, said she
would not be interested in serving as secretary of state or
defense if President Barack Obama were to win a second term, nor
would she run for vice president or president.  “I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment
in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath,” she
said from Cairo, referring to “opportunities and challenges
that we see right here in  Egypt  and in the rest of the region.”  “There isn’t anything that I can imagine doing after this
that would be as demanding, as challenging or rewarding,”
Clinton said. “I am doing what I want to do right now, and I
have no intention or any idea even of running again. I’m going
to do the best I can at this job for the next two years.''  Clinton has repeatedly ruled out future runs for elected
office in numerous interviews. Last Dec. 3 she told an audience
in Bahrain that she expected her post as secretary of state to
be her ‘‘last public position,’’ and would likely return to
‘‘advocacy work, particularly on behalf of women and children’’
around the world.  In an interview with PBS’s Tavis Smiley two months ago,
Clinton said she could not see herself serving a second term as
the top U.S. diplomat.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
