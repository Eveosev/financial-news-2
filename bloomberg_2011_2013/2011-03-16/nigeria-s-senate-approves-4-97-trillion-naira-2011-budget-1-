Nigeria’s Senate passed a 4.97
trillion-naira ($31.8 billion) budget for the 2011 fiscal year,
17 percent more than what President  Goodluck Jonathan  proposed
in December.    Africa ’s top oil producer is basing its spending plans on
crude output of 2.3 million barrels a day, an oil price of $75 a
barrel, $10 more than was originally in Jonathan’s budget, and
an exchange rate of 150 naira to a dollar. Jonathan must sign
the plan before it becomes law.  The budget includes 2.47 trillion naira for recurrent
spending and 1.56 trillion naira for capital projects, Senate
President David Mark said in parliament today in the capital,
Abuja. Statutory transfers to government agencies will account
for 496.6 billion naira, and 445.1 billion naira will go toward
servicing the debt.  The government is determined “to establish and strengthen
sound macroeconomic environment” and “to facilitate private
sector growth, boost employment generation and ensure wealth
creation,” said Iyiola Omisore, the chairman of the Senate
Committee on Appropriation and Finance.  The  budget deficit  will narrow to 3.62 percent of gross
domestic product, he said, from 6 percent in last year’s 5.16
trillion-naira spending plan. Oil provides Nigeria more than 80
percent of its revenue.  Power Investment  The government plans to invest in infrastructure projects,
including power and railways, that will help create employment
in Africa’s most populous nation, Jonathan said on Dec. 15.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy should expand
by 7.98 percent in 2011, up from 7.85 percent last year,
according to the  National Bureau of Statistics .  The 7 percent GDP growth is achievable as oil output
continues to rise,  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of
Lagos-based  fund manager , Financial Derivatives Co. Ltd., said
by phone today.  “The  exchange rate  at 150 naira to a dollar is a bit
ambitious,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
