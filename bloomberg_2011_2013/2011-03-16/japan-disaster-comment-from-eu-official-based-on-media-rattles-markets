Investors on edge over the prospect
of a Japanese nuclear meltdown took their cue from a European
Union commissioner who proclaimed a “major disaster” may be on
its way, before admitting his remarks were partly based on media
reports.  U.S. stocks tumbled after EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger testified to a European Parliament committee today in
Brussels that the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power
plant risks provoking a “major disaster” in  Japan .  “The site is effectively out of control,” Oettinger told
the panel. “In the coming hours, there could be further
catastrophic events.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 1.6 percent after his
remarks.  Oettinger also said a further deterioration in the
situation could lead to the deaths of people in Japan. “We are
somewhere between a disaster and a major disaster,” he said.  His overall assessment is based on information from the
European Commission in Brussels, the Tokyo-based EU mission to
Japan and the  International Atomic Energy Agency  in Vienna, as
well as media reports, Oettinger told Bloomberg after his
appearance in the parliament. “All these experts who read with
better glasses than mine,” Oettinger said.  Oettinger’s spokeswoman,  Marlene Holzner , told reporters in
a briefing earlier today in Brussels that the commission’s
information about the situation in Japan “is partly from the
media, partly from the government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
