Dutch banks will have to pay about
400 million euros ($550 million) annually to create a guarantee
fund to reimburse depositors when a bank fails, replacing the
current system, Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said.  Banks in the Netherlands will pay an annual premium of 0.1
percent of deposits to cover an estimated total 400 billion
euros, starting in July 2012,  De Jager  told lawmakers in The
Hague today. He expects to submit the plan to parliament by the
end of the year.  Currently banks pay to reimburse depositors only after a
lender has failed. Dutch banks, including Rabobank Groep NV and  ING Groep NV (INGA) , paid hundreds of millions of euros under the
existing deposit guarantee program to compensate clients of DSB
Bank NV after the regional lender collapsed in October 2009. The
current system guarantees deposits up to 100,000 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
