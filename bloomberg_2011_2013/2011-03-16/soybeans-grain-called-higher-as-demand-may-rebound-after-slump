What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 25 cents to 30 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand rebounds following
yesterday’s 5.2 percent slump, the most in four months, said Dax Wedemeyer, a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,
Iowa. Purchases of U.S. supplies may climb as rains damage crops
in  Brazil  and delay the harvest, he said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open 1 cent to 1.1 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $3 to $5 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 18 cents to 22 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as warm, dry weather threatens the early
development of winter crops across the southern Great Plains,
Wedemeyer said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on renewed demand following yesterday’s 4.5
plunge, the most in four months, Wedemeyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
