British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan financial services group, erased its biggest gain this
year and closed unchanged even as the local stock market
recorded the longest winning streak in more than three years.  British-American shares closed trading unchanged at 4
shillings by 3 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, after rising as
much as 5 percent, the most since Dec. 30, to 4.20 shillings.  The  NSE All Share Index (NSEASI)  was up 0.5 percent today, a 14th
straight gain, the longest stretch since June 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. This year, the index has risen 12
percent, after dropping 30 percent in 2011.  “The market has been a bit vibrant and most of the
company’s investments are in the equities market so the returns
from their portfolio are expected to move up,” Eva Njuguna, a
trader at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
