The  Philippine peso  gained for a
second week on speculation money sent home by Filipinos working
abroad will support demand for the currency.  Remittances, which contribute 10 percent to the $200
billion economy, increased 6.2 percent in December. The central
bank is due to issue January figures on March 15. Private
investors have agreed to swap about 95.7 percent of Greek debt,
more than the threshold needed to win a second aid package and
avoid a default. Stocks indexes across  Asia  rose.  “Remittances are driving up the peso,” said Goh Puay Yeong, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at Credit
Suisse group AG. It’s “risk-on” in the market, he said.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent this week to 42.585 per dollar
at the close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency was little changed today. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate used to price options, was steady
this week at 6.5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Consumer prices increased 2.7 percent in February from a
year earlier, the slowest pace since September 2009, official
data showed on March 6. The  Philippines  is also due to issue
export data for January on March 13. Shipments probably
contracted for a ninth month, falling 18.5 percent from a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the 6.375 percent government bonds due January
2022 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.22
percent and was down one basis point today, according to noon
fixing prices from the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
