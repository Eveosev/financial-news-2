India â€™s cotton-export ban is not
applicable for consignments for which Let Export Orders had been
issued up to midnight on March 4, the Commerce Ministry said.  The customs authority sends export data daily to a
department in the Commerce Ministry generated out of its trade
reports, which are based on Let Export Orders issued that day,
the ministry said. Any consignment for which an LEO has been
issued is reported as having been exported, it said. So
consignments for which LEOs had been issued up to midnight on
March 4 are outside the ban, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
