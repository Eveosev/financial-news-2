Kenya ’s shilling gained against the
dollar to its strongest level in almost two weeks as businesses
paid taxes and the country’s interbank rate rose.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.2 percent higher at 82.65 as
of 5:10 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the most since Feb. 27.  “The shilling has strengthened with businesses settling
their employees’ tax obligations and market liquidity is tight
as exhibited by the high interbank rate,” Duncan Kinuthia, a
dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  Employee taxes are due today, according to the Kenya
Revenue Authority’s  website . Kenya’s average  interbank rate  rose
to 22.59% in the week to Feb. 29.  Tanzania’s shilling  strengthened for the second time this
week, gaining 0.2 percent to 1,592 shillings.  “Bank of Tanzania has supplied dollars to meet the
available demand from the oil importers and manufacturers,” Fred
Siwale, a dealer with  CRDB Bank Plc (CRDB) , said today by phone from
Dar es Salaam, the commercial Capital.  The Ugandan shilling appreciated, gaining as much as 1.6
percent before paring its rise to 1 percent at 2,440 shillings
in Kampala, the capital.  “The shilling has gained due to tight liquidity in the
market following the sale of  government securities ,” Ahmed
Kalule, a trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said in a phone
interview from Nairobi.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in  Dar es Salaam
