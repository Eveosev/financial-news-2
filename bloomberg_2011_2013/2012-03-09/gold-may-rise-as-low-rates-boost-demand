Gold rose for a third straight
session, tracking gains in equities and commodities, after a
report showed U.S. payrolls gained more than forecast, boosting
the outlook for economic growth and raw-material demand.  U.S. employers boosted payrolls by 227,000 last month,
topping economists’ median projection of 210,000, the Labor
Department said today. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of
24 raw materials climbed as much as 1 percent. The S&P 500 Index
of equities climbed as much as 0.6 percent. Automatic purchases
by computer programs may have contributed to the rally after
prices rose above $1,700 an ounce, said Adam Klopfenstein, a
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc.  “We saw the optimism in the equity markets finally have a
rub-on effect on commodities, including gold,” Klopfenstein
said in a telephone interview from  Chicago .  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,711.50 at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices rose 0.1 percent this week, the third gain in four.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 1.1 percent to $34.212
an ounce on the Comex. Still, the metal declined 0.9 percent
this week, the second straight loss.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery advanced 1.5 percent to $709.95 an ounce. Platinum
futures for April delivery climbed 1.7 percent to $1,684.90 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
