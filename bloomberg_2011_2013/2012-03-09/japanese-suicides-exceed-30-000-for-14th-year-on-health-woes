Suicides in  Japan  exceeded 30,000
for a 14th straight year in 2011, driven mainly by health issues,
government figures show.  The number of cases fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier to
30,651, the Cabinet Office said in a  report  today. Suicides rose
in April, May, June and August -- the months following the March
11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated towns in northeastern
Japan and triggered a nuclear crisis.  In May, cases jumped 21 percent to 3,375, an increase that
Tomohiko Karube, an official working on suicide prevention at
the Cabinet Office, said was at least partly due to the economic
fallout from the disaster. “Businesses may have suffered from a
drop in exports,” Karube said.  The proportion of women who took their own lives last year
rose 2 percentage points to 32 percent, the highest in 14 years,
the figures show. Men accounted for 68 percent of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
