Thailand ’s baht rose to this week’s
high before trading little changed on speculation overseas
insurance companies are stepping up purchases to pay claims
related to the nation’s worst floods in almost 70 years.  Exchange data showed international investors bought $209
million more Thai equities than they sold in March. Private
investors agreed to swap about 85 percent of their Greek
 government bonds  for new securities in a deal that closed
yesterday, according to a banker briefed on the results.  “There remains speculation about insurance inflows in
relation to the floods, which supports the baht,” said Satoshi Ushijima, vice president of the treasury division in Bangkok at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “In addition, the risk-on mood is
prevailing in the market due to developments in  Greece .”  The baht was little changed at 30.53 per dollar from a week
ago as of 8:52 a.m. in Bangkok after reaching the high of 30.50,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of price swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5250 percent.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said on March 7 the
economy may expand between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent this year
following 0.1 percent growth in 2011.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.42
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
