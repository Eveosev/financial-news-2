Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  named company
veteran K. Venkataramanan as chief executive officer, as  India ’s
biggest builder of power networks and airports undertakes a
reorganization to boost growth.  Venkataramanan , a director on the board and head of Mumbai-
based Larsen’s hydrocarbon business, will become the CEO and
managing director from April 1, the company said in a statement
today. A.M. Naik, chairman and managing director, will become
executive chairman for five years.  Venkataramanan will oversee the builder’s attempt to revamp
operations into 10 independent businesses as it seeks to improve
focus on  segments  that include heavy engineering, shipbuilding,
computer software and electrical equipment. He will also face
the challenge of boosting orders from overseas as  growth slows 
at home.  “I will focus on cost reduction, looking at geographies
beyond the  Middle East  and Southeast Asia, and on time
completion of projects,” Venkataramanan said at a press
conference in Mumbai today.  Venkataramanan will remain in his position till 2015, Naik
said at the press conference. A search for a new CEO will begin
from Jan. 1, 2015, he said.  Larsen  rose  5.2 percent to 1,302.35 rupees at the close in
Mumbai trading, the biggest jump since Feb. 15. The stock has
gained 31 percent this year.  Venkataramanan, a chemical engineering graduate from Indian
Institute of Technology, Delhi, joined Larsen in 1969 as a
trainee, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
