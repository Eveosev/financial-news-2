Greece  extended its offer to private
creditors holding non-Greek law bonds to exchange their holdings
for new securities to March 23 and said after this deadline
sweeteners will no longer be available, Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said.  After the deadline, which is also for bonds from state-
owned companies guaranteed by the government, “there will be no
further opportunity for creditors holding those instruments to
benefit from the package of EFSF notes, co-financing and GDP
linked securities which form an important and integral part of
our invitations,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed statement from
the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
