Eric Joyce, a member of Britian’s
lower House of Parliament, has been banned from entering bars
for three months after drunkenly assaulting four people in the
House of Commons last month.  Joyce was suspended by the U.K. opposition  Labour Party  the
day after the Feb. 22 incident. The former army officer today
admitted attacking colleagues including the Conservative Stuart
Andrew and Labour’s Phillip Wilson in Parliament’s Strangers’
Bar.  Prosecutor Zoe Martin told magistrates Joyce had said to
police, “You can’t touch me, I’m an MP,” a reference to his
status as a member of Parliament, according to the British
Broadcasting Corp. After the hearing today, at which he was
fined 3,000 pounds ($4,700) and ordered to pay 1,400 pounds to
victims, Joyce told reporters he wouldn’t resign from
Parliament. He previously said he won’t be a candidate at the
next general election.  He said he wanted to apologize to “all the other people
that were involved and clearly that’s a long list and a
significant litany of sins on the evening. I am aware that I’ve
been fortunate to avoid jail for something that was a very
serious offense or series of offenses.”  Joyce, 51, a former army major, has represented the
Scottish district of Falkirk since 2000 and served as a
parliamentary aide to ministers in the administrations of both
 Gordon Brown  and  Tony Blair .  To contact the reporter on this story:
