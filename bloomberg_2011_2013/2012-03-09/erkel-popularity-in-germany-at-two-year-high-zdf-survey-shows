Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
popularity within  Germany  reached a two-year high this month
amid her government’s efforts on a new Greek bailout, a  ZDF 
Television poll showed.  Merkel, 57, widened her lead over her next rival, Frank- Walter Steinmeier of the opposition Social Democrats, and has an
approval rating of 1.9 compared with 1.8 in the previous month,
ZDF said. The 10-point scale measures approval rates for 10
Cabinet members, with +5 marking the highest and -5 the least.
Steinmeier is at 1.5.  Merkel has defended  Greece ’s place in the euro, saying on
Feb. 27 that the advantages of endorsing a second bailout
outweigh the risks to the currency area and the global economy.
As the number of critics in her own party’s ranks grow, she will
need opposition party support to get approval for setting up a
permanent European rescue fund and for tightening the euro-
area’s budget regime.  ZDF said Merkel’s standing among voters was at a two-year
high, while its monthly poll showed her party of  Christian
Democrats  dropping one point to 36 percent in March compared
with 30 percent for the Social Democrats, a one-point increase.
Her Free Democrat allies stayed at 3 percent, not enough to
qualify for parliament in a federal election.  ZDF polled 1,246 voters between March 6-8. The survey has a
margin of error of as much as three percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
