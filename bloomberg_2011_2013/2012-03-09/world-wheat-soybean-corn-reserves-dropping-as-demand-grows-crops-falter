Global inventories of  wheat  and
soybeans are falling more than forecast, while U.S. corn
reserves head to a 16-year low, as farmers fail to keep pace
with rising demand for food, livestock feed and biofuel.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  today cut its forecast
of world wheat stockpiles on May 31 by 1.7 percent to 209.6
million metric tons, less than all 21 estimates collected in a
Bloomberg survey. Soybean reserves on Aug. 31 will drop to a
three-year low of 57.3 million tons, while the amount of corn
held in the U.S., the world’s top grower and exporter, will slip
to the lowest since at least since 1996, the agency said.  U.S. farm exports rose to a record $136.3 billion in 2011
on surging demand for grain and meat in  Asia . The government
today boosted its forecast of U.S. wheat exports by 2.6 percent
from February, which will send domestic stockpiles to a three-
year low. Global food prices tracked by the  United Nations  rose
for a second consecutive month in February on higher costs for
cereals, cooking oils and sugar.  “This was probably one of the best reports we’ve seen in
wheat in six or seven months,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of
Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana ,
said in a telephone interview. “Corn is getting replaced by
wheat in the feed rations and some of the food rations even,
because of the price discount.”  Feed Demand  Global use of wheat in livestock feed will reach a record
131.06 million tons, up from 130.66 million estimated last
month, the USDA said. Corn futures for May delivery are trading
near parity with wheat on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, compared
with an average discount of about 89 cents in the past year.
Global wheat exports may reach 142.93 million tons, up from
140.25 million forecast last month.  Today’s report is “neutral-to-bullish wheat on higher U.S.
exports, lower global stocks,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by
 Hussein Allidina  said in a report. “Higher imports in Iran and
North Africa are needed to satiate higher domestic demand,
providing the impetus for higher exports from Australia, Brazil
and Kazakhstan, as well as the U.S.”  Wheat prices are up 9 percent since reaching this year’s
low on Jan. 18, after prices dropped 18 percent last year. Wheat
futures for May delivery rose 1.3 percent to settle at $6.43 a
bushel at 1:15 p.m. in Chicago.  Soybean prices are up 18 percent since November on the CBOT
on concern that hot, dry weather would hurt crops in  South
America . Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 0.1 percent
today to $13.3775 a bushel, after earlier climbing as much as
1.3 percent.  Soy Crop  Soybean production in Brazil and  Argentina , the two biggest
growers after the U.S., will fall to 115 million tons from 124.5
million last year and 127 million forecast in  December , the USDA
said today. The reductions since December in South America have
now exceeded those seen three years ago when hot, dry weather
also damaged crops, Rabobank said today in a report.  The declining production in South America “will continue
to give soybeans further upside,” Rabobank analysts led by Luke Chandler in  London  said. “The combined production cuts were
more aggressive than we expected.”  Global soybean production at 245.07 million tons would be
about 19 million tons lower than a year earlier, the biggest
year-over-year drop since at least 1965, USDA data show.  The government’s outlook for domestic corn supplies,
unchanged at a 16-year low of 801 million bushels, still was
bigger than the 776.5 million expected by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. World corn stockpiles may total 124.53 million
tons before the 2012 harvest in the Northern Hemisphere, down
0.7 percent from last month’s estimate, while more than the
123.43 million analysts expected.  “Even though the report was neutral to slightly negative,
we are still historically tight in corn and coarse grains,”
Zuzolo said.  Corn futures for May delivery rallied 1.5 percent to settle
at $6.45 a bushel on the CBOT. The price declined 1.5 percent
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
