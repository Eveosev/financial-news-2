Most Asian currencies pared this
week’s losses after  Greece  secured agreement with 95.7 percent
of bondholders for a debt swap and China’s inflation slowed.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks climbed 1.1 percent,
capping its biggest two-day advance in two months. Consumer
prices in China rose in February by the least since June 2010,
providing scope for the central bank to ease monetary policy and
support economic growth. Malaysia’s ringgit fell, after
yesterday’s biggest rally in three weeks, ahead of an interest-
rate decision.  “The optimism was priced into the market before the
announcement and the announcement is a nice relief,” said
Choong Yin Pheng, manager for economic and bond research at Hong
Leong Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “ China  is growing relatively
strongly and people are hopeful for more supporting policies.”  India ’s rupee appreciated 0.6 percent to 49.9869 per dollar
as of 2:30 p.m. in Mumbai, limiting its weekly decline to 1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia’s
rupiah rose 0.1 percent to 9,135 per dollar, reducing the weekly
loss to 0.6 percent. Taiwan’s  dollar  climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.504 and was down 0.2 percent from March 2.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  climbed as much as
0.1 percent earlier and was last little changed at 117.35,
halting a three-week advance. The index’s 60-day historical
 volatility  dropped to 3.35 percent, the lowest measure of price
swings since August, signaling reduced market uncertainty.  Yuan Gains  Bondholders tendered 152 billion euros ($201 billion) of
Greek-law bonds, or 85.8 percent, after the government offered
to swap their holdings for new securities. Another 20 billion
euros of foreign-law bonds were also tendered, the  finance
ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Greek government will activate so-called collective
action clauses to achieve full participation from holders of
Greek-law bonds, a move that Standard Chartered Plc said is
“highly likely” to trigger payouts on credit-default swaps.  China’s yuan gained the most this month after data showed
consumer prices rose  3.2 percent  in February from a year earlier,
less than the 3.4 percent estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The currency climbed 0.09 percent to 6.3107 per
dollar, paring this week’s loss to 0.2 percent, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  “Easing inflation is good news for  China’s economy  as it
means more room for policy easing,” said  Daniel Chan , chief
economist at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “Expectations
that Greece could restructure its debt lifted the yuan.”  Policy Rates  Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 0.1 percent to 3.0080 per dollar
before today’s policy meeting. Nineteen of 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the central bank will keep the
benchmark overnight rate at 3 percent. One predicted a cut to
2.75 percent. The decision is due at 6 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The Bank of  Korea  left its seven-day repurchase rate on
hold for a ninth straight month at  3.25 percent  yesterday, while
Bank Indonesia kept its  reference rate  at 5.75 percent.  South Korea ’s won closed the week 0.2 percent lower at
1,117.90, while the Philippine peso strengthened 0.3 percent
42.585. Vietnam’s dong was little changed today and climbed 1
percent to 20,830 in the five-day period. Thailand’s baht
dropped 0.2 percent today and from a week ago to 30.59.  To contact the reporters on this story:
