Zenyatta, the 2010 Horse of the Year
and first mare to win the  Breeders’ Cup Classic , gave birth last
night to her first foal, a 130-pound colt.  The dark bay colt was born at around 10:10 p.m. local time
at Lane’s End Farm in Versailles,  Kentucky , according to the
horse’s website. Zenyatta and the newborn are both healthy,
according to the post.  The colt, whose name wasn’t given, is the son of
Bernardini, winner of the 2006  Preakness Stakes . Owners Ann and
Jerry Moss were on the farm for the birth, according to the
website.  The winner of 19 of her 20 races, Zenyatta won the 2009
 Breeders’ Cup Classic ,  North America ’s richest thoroughbred
horse race. She retired in November 2010 with career earnings of
more than $7.3 million, at the time a North American record for
a filly or mare.  Zenyatta was first bred to Bernardini in February 2011, but
a routine scan last March revealed she had lost the pregnancy,
according to the  Daily Racing Form . She was bred again to
Bernardini in April.  Zenyatta is the second former Horse of the Year to give
birth to her first foal this year, the Daily Racing Form said.
On Jan. 22,  Rachel Alexandra , who won the honor in 2009,
delivered a 125-pound colt sired by Curlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
