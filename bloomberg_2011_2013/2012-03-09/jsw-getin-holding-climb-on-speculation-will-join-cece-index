Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW)  and
 Getin Holding SA (GTN)  advanced after Bank Zachodni WBK SA’s brokerage
said they are likely to join the CECE Composite Index next week.  JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer,
gained as much as 2.7 percent and was 1.9 percent higher at
102.9 zloty as of 11:26 a.m. in Warsaw. Getin Holding, the
financial-services group controlled by billionaire Leszek
Czarnecki, soared as much as 7.1 percent, the most in more than
a month, and last traded 4.2 percent higher at 2.48 zloty.  JSW and Getin are likely to join the index of central
European companies after the March 14 session, Zachodni wrote in
a note today. Software producer Asseco Poland SA, property
developer Globe Trade Centre SA and television network TVN SA
may drop out from the index this month, according to
calculations Warsaw-based Zachodni sent to clients.  The CECE Composite Index is a free float weighted price
index made up of the most liquid stocks traded in Budapest,
 Prague  and  Warsaw Stock Exchange , according to Wiener Boerse
AG’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
