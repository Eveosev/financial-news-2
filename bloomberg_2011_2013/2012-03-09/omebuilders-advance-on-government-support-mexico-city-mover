Mexican homebuilders gained the most
in seven weeks amid optimism the government will support the
industry with subsidies aimed at curbing a housing deficit.  The  Habita (HABITA)  index of six homebuilders climbed 2.6 percent at
3 p.m. in  Mexico  City, the most since Jan. 18, as companies held
meetings with investors at a conference in  New York , which began
yesterday. The benchmark IPC index fell 0.3 percent.  Speculation government-subsidized mortgages will drive a
pickup in housing demand is boosting optimism among investors,
according to Banco Santander SA.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) ,
Mexico’s largest homebuilder by sales, has positioned itself to
take advantage of the subsidies, Chief Executive Officer Gerardo de Nicolas Gutierrez said in an interview yesterday.  “Industry participants made clear that the support toward
the sector from the federal government would likely remain
intact after the upcoming presidential elections, irrespective
of the final outcome,”  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  analysts led by
Rogelio Urrutia wrote in a note today.  Mexicans pick a new president on July 1. President Felipe Calderon isn’t on the ballot because the country doesn’t allow
second terms.  Homex climbed 2 percent to 39.87 reais. Corp. Geo SAB,
Mexico’s second-largest homebuilder, rose 4.3 percent to 20.15
pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
