Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose after
the central bank signaled it will cut  interest rates . The dong
was little changed.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will reduce its refinancing and
repurchase rates by 1 percentage point in the “next few days,”
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said on March 6 in Hanoi, following a
request from Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. The central bank
will also lower the maximum interest rate banks can pay for
deposits in dong, he said.  Consumer prices  rose 16.44 percent in
February from a year earlier, after increasing 17.27 percent in
January, according to government data.  “Yields dropped because investors expect the central bank
will cut interest rates as soon as Monday,” said Nguyen Duy
Phong, Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities.
“Also, investors continue to buy bonds amid enhanced system
liquidity and a better economic outlook.”  The  yield  on five-year notes fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.53 percent as of 3:57 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
Yields also dropped three basis points this week.  The dong was little changed at 20,830 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
