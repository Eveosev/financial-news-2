President  Barack Obama  today will
highlight a $1 billion federal grant proposal designed to boost
manufacturing innovation, the White House said in a statement.  Obama plans to make the announcement during an appearance
at the  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  Crosspointe jet engine disc
manufacturing facility in Prince George County, Virginia.  The fiscal 2013 budget proposes a national network of
institutes for manufacturing innovation with as many as 15
regional hubs, according to a White House fact sheet.  The institutes would bring industry, universities,
community colleges, federal agencies, states and manufacturers
under one roof to help close the gap between basic research and
product development.  Each of the technology hubs would focus on a specific
manufacturing technology geared to the region, such as
developing lightweight materials for use in next-generation
automobiles, aircraft, ships and trains.  The $1 billion plan requires congressional approval.  Separately, Obama will use $45 million in existing funds to
begin a pilot institute, according to the fact sheet. That seed
money will come from the departments of Defense, Energy and
Commerce and the  National Science Foundation  and would be used
to show how the program would work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
