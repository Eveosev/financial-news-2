First Data Corp., (FDC)  the credit card
processor bought by KKR & Co. in 2007, plans to sell $850
million of notes to pay down loans.  First Data  will offer the bonds due 2019 to repay a portion
of its term loans, the company said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire .  There’s “no real credit improvement” for First Data,
according to Scott Dinsdale at KDP Investment Advisors Inc.
Dinsdale remains concerned about the company’s “substantial
leverage” and “increased interest expense associated with
taking out low cost bank debt with new notes,” according to a
report published today by the Montpelier, Vermont-based credit
research firm.  KDP expects the new bonds to be similar in terms and
covenants to First Data’s 7.375 percent notes due 2019 and 8.875
percent notes due 2020.  The Atlanta-based company has struggled to reduce
borrowings since it was acquired by KKR for $25.6 billion in the
2007 leveraged buyout. First Data had $22.7 billion of total
borrowings as of Dec. 31, according to a March 5 regulatory
filing.  Fitch Ratings  said in December that refinancing its senior
secured debt due in 2014, along with a higher rate to extend
$1.5 billion of notes due in 2015, may result in “material
negative free cash flow” at First Data.  Lender Consent  The company received lender consent to extend $3.2 billion
of first-lien term loans to March 2017 from September 2014, said
a person with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  The extended debt will pay interest at 5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company was offering lenders a 10
basis-point amendment fee, the data shows.  First Data’s 11.25 percent notes due 2016 have risen 0.25
cent today to 92.5 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The bonds yield 13.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
