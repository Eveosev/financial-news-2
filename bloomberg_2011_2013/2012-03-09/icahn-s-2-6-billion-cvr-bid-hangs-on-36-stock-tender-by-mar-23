(Corrects description of contingent right in third
paragraph of story published March 9.)  Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  will
withdraw his hostile bid for oil refiner  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  unless
holders of 36 percent of the stock agree to sell to him by March
23.  “If I do not receive 36 percent, I will respect the wishes
of shareholders, drop the proxy fight and move on,” Icahn said
in a statement today. Icahn is the largest shareholder in the
 Sugar Land , Texas-based refiner, with about 14.5 percent of the
stock.  Icahn announced his intention last month to offer $30 a
share, a proposal that values the company at at least $2.6
billion, according to Bloomberg calculations. If he gains
control of the company he will seek another buyer and give CVR
holders a right to additional money in the event of a sale,
Icahn said today.  CVR’s board reiterated its opposition to the takeover
today.“His offer is simply his vehicle to put his employees and
friends on the board of CVR Energy at an inadequate price,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  CVR  rose  6 percent to $27.57 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 24 percent since the company disclosed Icahn
had taken a stake in it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
