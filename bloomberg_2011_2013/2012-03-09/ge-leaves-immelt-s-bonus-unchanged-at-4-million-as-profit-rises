General Electric Co. (GE)  resumed its
practice of awarding stock grants tied to performance as part of
Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt ’s compensation after
issuing him  stock options  last year.  Immelt, whose 2011 salary and bonus were unchanged from
2010, will receive 250,000 performance stock units that convert
to shares if GE boosts cash flow from industrial operations and
stock returns meet or exceed those of the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX) , according to a U.S. regulatory filing. He received a
“special grant” of 2 million stock options last year after
previously being paid in the units since 2003.  GE attached similar performance measures to the options
after “constructive conversations” with shareholders before
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company’s 2011 annual meeting,
according to the proxy statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  GE fell 2 percent last year, compared with no change in the
 S&P 500  and a 3 percent decline for industrial companies in the
index, even as the world’s largest maker of  jet engines  and
diesel locomotives expanded profit and amassed a record $200
billion order backlog.  Immelt’s realized compensation rose 38 percent to $7.82
million last year. The measure includes his $3.3 million salary,
$4 million cash bonus and $447,000 of other compensation,
according to the proxy statement. Immelt, 56, declined to accept
a bonus in 2008 and 2009 as GE shares underperformed.  Total compensation, including a $10.1 million increase in
pension value, was $21.6 million under SEC rules.  Immelt became CEO less than a week before the September
2001 terrorist attacks that pushed the U.S. deeper into a
recession. In 2009, amid the worst economic slump since the
Great Depression, he cut GE’s dividend for the first time in
more than 70 years to preserve cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
