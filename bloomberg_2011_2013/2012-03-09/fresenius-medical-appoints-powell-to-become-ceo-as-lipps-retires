Fresenius Medical Care AG (FME)  said Chief
Executive Officer Ben Lipps will retire at the end of the year,
and Rice Powell, who runs the German dialysis provider’s North
American unit, will replace him.  Powell, 56, has been a member of the Fresenius Medical
management board since 2004 and has more than three decades of
experience in the health-care industry, the Bad Homburg-based
company said today in a statement.  Lipps, 71, has worked in the Fresenius dialysis division
since 1985. He became CEO and chairman of the management board
in 1999, when Fresenius Medical Care’s annual sales were $3.8
billion. Revenue totaled $12.8 billion last year.  Mats Henriksson will succeed Rainer Baule, 63, as CEO of
the Kabi unit of  Fresenius SE (FRE) , which owns about 30 percent of
Fresenius Medical. Both Powell and Henriksson, 44, will join the
Fresenius SE management board in January.  Fresenius Medical shares fell 1.6 percent to 51.21 euros at
12:46 a.m. in  Frankfurt . Fresenius SE declined 0.4 percent to
77.92 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
