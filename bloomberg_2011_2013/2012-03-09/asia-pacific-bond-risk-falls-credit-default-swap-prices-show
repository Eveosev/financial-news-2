The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 156 basis points
as of 8:15 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The index is headed for its lowest close since
Sept. 2, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index lost 1.5 basis points to 140
as of 9:18 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge
is set for its lowest close since Feb. 29, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 3 basis points to
143 as of 11:14 a.m. in Sydney, according to Deutsche Bank AG.
The index has fallen almost 100 basis points since reaching a
more than two-year high on Oct. 4.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
