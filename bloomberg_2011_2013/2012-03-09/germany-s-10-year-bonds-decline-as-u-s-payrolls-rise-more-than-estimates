German 10-year bonds declined after
a report showed U.S. payrolls rose more than economists
estimated in February.  The yield on the bunds rose two basis points to 1.82
percent at 1:32 p.m. London time.  The 227,000 increase in payrolls followed a revised 284,000
gain in January that was bigger than first estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000 rise
in February employment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
