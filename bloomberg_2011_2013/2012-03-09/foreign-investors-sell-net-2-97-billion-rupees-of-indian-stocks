Overseas  investors  sold a net  2.97
billion rupees  ($58.6 million) of Indian stocks on March 7,
paring their investment in the equities this year to 368.3
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 23.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
26.6 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They poured 252.1 billion rupees in
February, helping the BSE India Sensitive Index post its second
straight monthly gain for the first time since September 2010.  Overseas investors sold a net 11 billion rupees of bonds,
reducing their inflows into debt this year to 245.4 billion
rupees, the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in
2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.812 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.453 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the  Sensex (SENSEX)  the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
