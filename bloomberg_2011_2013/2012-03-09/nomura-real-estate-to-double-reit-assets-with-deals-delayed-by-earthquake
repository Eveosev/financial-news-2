Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc. (3231) ,
which set up  Japan ’s first private real estate investment trust,
is set to complete acquisitions that will double the size of its
REIT after a six-month delay following the earthquake last year.  The company will add eight buildings to its private REIT,
which targets investors including pension funds. The properties
will boost the size of the trust to 40 billion yen ($490 million)
when the transactions close in mid-March, said Atsushi Ogata,
senior managing director and head of the fund management
division at Nomura Real Estate Asset Management Co., a Nomura
Real Estate unit.  The acquisitions are the first for the private REIT since
it was first set up in November 2010. The purchase of the
properties, which consist of two office buildings, five rental
apartments and a warehouse in  Tokyo , signals concerns after the
March 11 earthquake have eased.  “We thought it would be difficult to expand our private
REIT after the earthquake, so we decided to hold off the plan,”
Ogata said in a phone interview in Tokyo today. “Investor
interest has returned.”  Other Japanese property funds are also planning
acquisitions.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) , the nation’s biggest developer
by sales, said yesterday it set up a private REIT with 72.7
billion yen. Mitsubishi Estate Co. the second-largest developer
by sales, also manages a private REIT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
