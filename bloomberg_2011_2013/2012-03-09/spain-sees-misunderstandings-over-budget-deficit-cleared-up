Spain  expects to be able to clear
up any misunderstandings with European partners over its
decision to raise a budget-deficit goal by proving a commitment
to controlling its finances, a government official said.  At a meeting of European finance ministers next week, Spain
wants its partners to recognize that it has explained why its
2011 deficit target was missed on the previous government’s
watch and that it’s committed to meeting next year’s target of 3
percent of gross domestic product, the official said yesterday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Spain is unlikely to be
sanctioned for changing its deficit target, he said.  On March 2, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  defied EU allies
by raising Spain’s 2012 budget-deficit goal after attending a
summit in which leaders pledged to observe stricter budget
rules. Rajoy said it was Spain’s sovereign decision to increase
the target to 5.8 percent of gross domestic product from 4.4
percent.  Spain changed the target because the previous one was based
on an economic growth estimate of 2.3 percent, while the
government now expects the economy to shrink 1.7 percent this
year, said the official, speaking to reporters on condition of
anonymity in line with government policy.  Spain’s partners will understand that circumstances have
changed, the official said, adding that they and investors will
also take into account efforts Rajoy’s new government is making
to promote growth by overhauling  labor laws  and its banking
system. They also know that a very deep recession in the country
caused by an over-rigid deficit target would hurt growth in
surrounding countries, he said.  Spain provided European officials visiting the country this
week full data on last year as part of an EU review of why Spain
overshot its 2011 deficit target, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said at a news conference in  Madrid 
yesterday after a weekly cabinet meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
