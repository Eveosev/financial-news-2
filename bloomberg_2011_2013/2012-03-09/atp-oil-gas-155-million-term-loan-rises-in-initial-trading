ATP Oil & Gas Corp.’s (ATPG)  $155 million
term loan to be used for general corporate purposes rose in
initial trading, according to data provider Markit Group Ltd.  The debt, due in January 2015, began trading at 99.5 cents
on the dollar, according to Markit. The loan was sold to
investors at 99 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG arranged the financing for the
Houston-based company, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 7.25 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent minimum on
the benchmark, the data show. Libor, the rate at which banks say
they can borrow in dollars from each other, serves as a
reference for about $360 trillion of financial instruments
worldwide.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
