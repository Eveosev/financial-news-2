Japanese  shares  rose for a second
day, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average touching 10,000 for the
first time since August, as  Greece  completed the biggest
sovereign-debt restructuring in history and the yen slipped
against the euro.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for more than a fifth
of its sales, climbed 4.3 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s top publicly traded bank, gained 2.4 percent
on optimism Greece would avoid default.  Nippon Steel (5401)  Corp. and
 other makers of the material  rose as confidence in the global
economic recovery gained momentum.  “It’s big that Greece is becoming less of a drag as the
global economy rebounds,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment
officer of RCM Japan Co. “Confidence is spreading in the
markets. The weaker yen has led investors to buy Japanese
stocks.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  rose 1.7 percent to 9,929.74 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , with a weekly gain of 1.6 percent. The gauge
outperformed every other major Asian equity index today,
reaching as high as 10,007.62 with volume 60 percent higher than
the 10-day average. The broader  Topix Index  (TPX) gained 1.5 percent
to 848.71. It has risen 11 percent since March 2009, the bottom
of the global equities slump that followed the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.  Greek Debt Deal  Shares rose today after people familiar with Greece’s debt
negotiations said the government had clinched enough bondholder
participation to complete a debt swap essential to containing
Europe’s crisis. After the market closed, Greece announced a
95.7 percent participation rate.  The Topix’s volume and trading value reaching the highest
level since March after the settlement price for Nikkei 225
futures and options contracts for March delivery, also known as
the “special quotation” was fixed at 9,946.46.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The measure rose 1 percent in New York yesterday after
about 85 percent of bondholders tendered their Greek government
debt for new securities. Financial stocks rose on optimism for
the writedown.  Finance Stocks Climb  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rose 2.4 percent to 425 yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest
bank by market value, climbed 1.8 percent to 2,784 yen.  The 17-nation euro currency rose after the  European Central
Bank  kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged and President
 Mario Draghi  said recent surveys showed signs of economic
stabilization. The yen fell against all of its major
counterparts, lifting prospects for exporters.  Sony rose 4.3 percent to 1,718 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronics maker that gets almost 20 percent of its sales in
Europe, gained 2.2 percent to 7,460 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,

today in Tokyo, compared with 107.18 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Japan’s currency weakened to 81.89 against
the dollar from 81.34. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Steelmakers Rise  Steelmakers gained the most in the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest maker of the material,
increased 4.5 percent to 233 yen. JFE Holdings Inc. jumped 5.4
percent to 1,687 yen.  Exporters to  China  rose as the nation’s inflation beat
estimates, easing to the slowest pace in 20 months in February,
providing more room to stimulate the world’s second-biggest
economy as investment and export growth weaken.  TDK Corp. (6762) , an electronic parts maker that gets almost a
third of its revenue from China, rose 2.3 percent to 4,310 yen.
Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., an excavator maker that gets
more than half of its sales in Asia, climbed 4.6 percent to
1,778 yen.  -- With assistance from Satoshi Kawano and Yoshiaki Nohara in
