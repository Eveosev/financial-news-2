U.S. stocks pared gains after an
industry group ruled that Greece’s debt restructuring is a
“ credit event ” that will trigger $3 billion in default
insurance.  The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
said that an auction will be held in respect to outstanding
credit-default swap transactions on March 19.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.3 percent at
1,369.78 as of 2:59 p.m. in  New York  after rising as much as 0.7
percent. Financial shares were up 0.6 percent, trimming a 1.3
percent gain in half.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
