The Czech economy contracted less
than initially estimated in the last three months of 2011,
confirming the country returned to a recession for the first
time since 2009 as government spending cuts damped demand.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.1 percent from the previous
quarter, when it showed the same contraction, the Czech
Statistics Office said today on its website. The reading
compares with a 0.3 percent decline reported in a preliminary
estimate on Feb. 15. GDP rose 0.6 percent from the same quarter
a year ago.  The government in  Prague  has cut spending and plans to
increase taxes to trim the shortfall to less than the European
Union limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013. The economic outlook
has worsened because of the crisis in the euro area, which buys
about 70 percent of Czech exports.  “On the demand side, foreign trade was still able to
increase its surplus to offset declines in quarterly government
expendidure and capital creation,” the statistics office said.  The central bank on Feb. 2 lowered its forecast for this
year’s GDP growth to zero from 1.2 percent, following a similar
revision by the  Finance Ministry , which cut its estimate to 0.2
percent on Jan. 31 from 1 percent and didn’t rule out a
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
