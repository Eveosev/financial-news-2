Heating oil fell as the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries trimmed its outlook for 2012
oil consumption and a stronger dollar reduced the investment
appeal of commodities.  Futures declined as OPEC, supplier of more than 40 percent
of the world’s oil, lowered its demand estimate for this year by
130,000 barrels a day to 88.63 million, according to the group’s
Vienna-based secretariat. The U.S. currency rose 1.2 percent
against the euro at 10:01 a.m. in  New York .  “OPEC revised downward demand for 2012 and that is
probably putting some pressure on prices,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  April-delivery heating oil lost 0.57 cent to $3.2638 a
gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Gasoline for April delivery slipped 0.11 cent to $3.3129 a
gallon.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.758 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices have increased 15 percent this year, and are 6.6 percent
higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
