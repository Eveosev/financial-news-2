What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  reduced its estimates for global inventories and
South American crops,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in telephone
interview.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open 0.3 cent to
0.5 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up $1
to $2 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents a bushel lower to 2 cents
higher on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as world inventories will remain at
the second-highest level on record even after the government
raised its forecast for global consumption and lowered its
outlook for reserves, Roose said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents a bushel lower to 2
cents higher in  Chicago  after the USDA raised its estimate of
world production, leaving adequate inventories before U.S.
farmers begin harvesting a record crop, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
