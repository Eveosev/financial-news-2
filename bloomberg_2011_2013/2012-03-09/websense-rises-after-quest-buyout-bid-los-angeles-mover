Websense Inc. (WBSN) , a provider of data
security, rose the most in more than two months on speculation
the company may become a buyout target after Insight Venture
Partners offered to buy  Quest Software Inc. (QSFT)   Websense increased 3.8 percent to $19.32 at the  New York 
close, its biggest gain since Dec. 20 and making the San Diego-
based company the third-best performer on Bloomberg’s
 Infrastructure Software (BIGISFTC)  Index of 55 companies.  Websense is an attractive takeover target in an industry
that is consolidating, said Frederick Ziegel, an analyst for
Topeka Capital Markets Inc. in New York, who rates the stock
hold.  “It’s got all the attributes of an M&A target,” said
Ziegel. “Websense would be right in the sweet spot in terms of
the markets they serve.”  Quest Software, a competing data-security company that
received an offer of about $2 billion buyout from Insight, was
the biggest mover in the Infrastructure Software Index, followed
by  Trend Micro Inc. (4704) , the Tokyo-based provider of anti-virus
software.  Quest Software jumped above Insight’s $23-a-share offer to
$24.07, signaling investors may anticipate higher bids. Quest
Software said it would solicit other bids for 60 days.  Websense executives are traveling and unavailable for
comment, spokeswoman Patricia Hogan said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
