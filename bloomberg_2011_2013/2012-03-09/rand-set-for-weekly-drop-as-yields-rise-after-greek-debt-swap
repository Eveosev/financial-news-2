The rand fell for the first time in
three days, set for its first weekly decline in four, after
 Greece  forced investors to take part in its debt swap, damping
demand for riskier assets including South African bonds.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy weakened 0.6
percent to 7.5285 per dollar as of 2:10 p.m. in Johannesburg,
retreating from a one-week high. The rand is down 0.1 percent
this week, its first such drop since Feb. 10. The yield on the
77 billion rand of 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.85 percent. The nation’s
dollar-bond spreads over  U.S. Treasuries  widened to the most in
more than a week.  Investors with 95.7 percent of Greece’s privately held
bonds will participate in the swap after so-called collective
action clauses are triggered, the Greek Finance Ministry said.
 Germany  and fellow euro-area governments declared the debt swap
a success. U.S. payrolls probably increased by 210,000 in
February, down from 243,000 the previous month, economists said
before a Labor Department report today.  “I think people are just a bit wary and saying maybe it’s
time to take a bit of profit” following the rand’s 1.5 percent
advance yesterday, Ion de Vleeschauwer, the Johannesburg-based
chief dealer at Bidvest Bank, said by phone. “Today can be a
volatile day with the U.S. numbers.”  Attention now shifts to euro-region finance ministers, who
must decide whether the swap justifies proceeding with a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) second bailout. Officials from the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association meet today to
consider a “potential  credit event ” relating to Greece.  “This will not be the end of Greece’s problems,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. For the rand to resume
gains, “we will have to have a decent U.S. jobs report this
afternoon”, he added.  The yield on  South Africa ’s $1.5 billion of 4.665 percent
bonds due 2024 rose four basis points to 4.23 percent, the
highest since Feb. 28. The extra yield investors demand to hold
the debt rather than U.S. Treasuries widened four basis points
to 223 basis points, the most since Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
