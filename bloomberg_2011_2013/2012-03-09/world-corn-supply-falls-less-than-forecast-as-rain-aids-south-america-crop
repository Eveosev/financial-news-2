Global corn stockpiles before this
year’s Northern Hemisphere harvests will decline less than
analysts expected after rain last month eased dry conditions in
 Brazil  and  Argentina , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  World  inventories  on Sept. 30 will fall 0.7 percent to
124.53 million metric tons from 125.35 million projected in
February, the smallest in five years, the USDA said today in a
report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 123.43
million, on average. Brazil’s crop was expected to be 62 million
tons, up 1.6 percent from last month, while Argentina’s
production forecast was left unchanged at 22 million tons.  “South America crops are a little better than people
expected because the rains the past month boosted yield
potential,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president with the
Linn Group in  Chicago , said before the report. “We still need
to grow a big U.S. crop this year to rebuild inventories.”  The U.S.  surplus  on Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year,
was projected at 801 million bushels (20.35 million tons),
unchanged from last month and less than 1.128 billion a year
earlier.  U.S. exports will total 1.7 billion bushels, unchanged from
last month’s forecast and down from 1.835 billion a year
earlier, the department said. Demand for corn to produce ethanol
will remain unchanged at 5 billion bushels, unchanged from a
month earlier and down from 5.021 billion in the previous year,
according to the report.  Tighter Supply  The prospect of tighter supply may increase costs for
 Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) , the second-largest ethanol
processor, and  Tyson Foods Inc., (TSN)  the top U.S. meat producer,
which buys grain for livestock feed. Smaller reserves also could
prompt farmers to increase the number of acres planted this
year, boosting demand for fertilizer from CF Industries Holdings
Inc., Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and Agrium Inc.  Corn futures for May delivery yesterday fell 0.5 percent to
close at $6.355 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has risen 7.3 percent since falling to this year’s low on
Jan. 18 at $5.925.  U.S. farmers probably will plant the most corn since 1944
this year after the average price for the grain reached a record
high in 2011, the USDA said on Feb. 23. A bigger harvest in the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter, would help compensate for
shortages in the current crop year.  The USDA estimated world  production  in the 2011-2012
season, which began Oct. 1, at 864.96 million tons, up from
864.11 million forecast in February and from 829.24 last year.  China (US09PRCN) , the second-largest producer, will harvest 191.75
million tons, unchanged from last month, the USDA said. The
country will import 4 million tons, unchanged from last month’s
estimate and up from and 980,000 tons in the previous year,
according to the report.  Global consumption will reach 869.49 million tons, up from
867.59 million estimated last month and more than 844.35 million
tons last year, the USDA said. It would be the third straight
year world consumption exceeds output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
