U.S. stock futures gained,
Treasuries retreated and the dollar rose after government data
showed the economy added more jobs than forecast last month,
bolstering optimism that the labor market is improving.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
advanced 0.3 percent to 1,364.2 at 8:38 a.m. in  New York . Ten-
year U.S. Treasury yields climbed three basis points to 2.04
percent and the Dollar Index added 0.7 percent.  The 227,000 increase in payrolls followed a revised 284,000
gain in January that was bigger than first estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . Job growth over
the last six months was the strongest since 2006. The median
projection of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a
210,000 rise in February employment.  Today is the third anniversary of the 2009 bear-market low
for the S&P 500. The benchmark gauge has risen 102 percent since
closing at 676.53 on March 9, 2009 on speculation the economy
would recover from the worst contraction since the Great
Depression. The index had tumbled 57 percent from its record
high on Oct. 9, 2007, before starting its recovery three years
ago. It’s still 13 below its all-team peak.  The S&P 500, which closed at an almost four-year high last
week, completed its biggest two-day advance of the year
yesterday as  Greece  moved closer to completing the biggest ever
debt restructuring.  Greece said today it convinced private investors to forgive
more than 100 billion euros ($132 billion) of debt, opening the
way for a second rescue package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
