Employers in the U.S. boosted
payrolls more than forecast in February, capping the best six-
month streak of job growth since 2006 and sending stocks higher.  The 227,000 increase followed a revised 284,000 gain in
January that was bigger than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median projection of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000 rise.
The  jobless rate  held at 8.3 percent, even as 476,000 more
workers sought employment.  More jobs are helping fuel the wage gains that drive
 consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the
economy. The latest pickup in employment bolsters President
 Barack Obama ’s bid for re-election, while it may not be enough
to satisfy Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who last
week said the job market remains “far from normal” and
repeated that borrowing costs will probably remain low through
late 2014.  “The labor market has found its legs in the last few
months, and it looks like there’s enough of a broad base that
the momentum can be sustained,” said  Julia Coronado , chief
economist for  North America  at BNP Paribas in  New York , who
projected a 225,000 gain in payrolls. “This leaves the Fed in a
bit of limbo, as it’s not strong enough to convince them that
we’re about to accelerate to much stronger rates of economic
growth.”  Stocks Climb  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,370.87 at the close in New York. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.03 percent from 2.01 percent
late yesterday.  Some 1.2 million jobs were created in the past six months,
the most since the same period ended May 2006. Revisions added a
total of 61,000 jobs to payrolls in December and January.  Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said he sees signs of a rebound in consumer spending
that would help improve earnings at the second-biggest U.S.
lender.  “The American consumer is healing,” Moynihan, 52, said in
an interview that aired on Bloomberg Television today. “There’s
still an unemployment problem, we all have to work to solve
that. But this economy is much better than it was six months ago
or six months before that. It just keeps feeling better.”  Sold Assets  Bank of America sold $33 billion in assets and announced
30,000 job cuts last year as Moynihan sought to trim expenses in
line with stagnant revenue.  A separate report today from the Commerce Department showed
the  trade deficit  widened in January to the largest since
October 2008 as imports rose to a record.  The gap increased 4.3 percent to $52.6 billion from a
revised $50.4 billion in December. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a deficit of
$49 billion in January. Exports of capital goods, as well as
cars and automobile parts, climbed to a record.  The U.S. unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey
of households, was forecast to remain at 8.3 percent, according
to the survey median. The jobless rate held steady even as the
survey showed the  labor force  grew. Employment climbed by
428,000 in February, while the labor force rose by 476,000.  Circuit Breakers  “There is hiring going on,” Richard Fearon, chief
financial officer at  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  said at a March 6 industrial
conference in New York. The Cleveland-based maker of circuit
breakers and truck transmissions will “definitely need more
manpower to serve” growing demand for tractor-trailers and for
the equipment used in construction and hydraulics, he said.  The participation rate, which indicates the share of
working-age people in the labor force, rose to 63.9 percent from
63.7 percent.  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, rose
233,000 in February after a revised gain of 285,000 the prior
month that made it the biggest increase since February 2006.
They were projected to climb by 225,000. Manufacturing payrolls
increased by 31,000 after a revised 52,000 gain.  Even with the “positive developments” in the job market,
Bernanke told lawmakers last week the “modest and uneven”
expansion needs the support of monetary policy. The central bank
said in January that economic conditions are likely to warrant
low  interest rates  at least through late 2014.  March 13 Meeting  Policy makers meeting on March 13 are likely to repeat that
view while refraining from any additional easing measures, say
economists, including  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond
James & Associates Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida .  The Commerce Department last week reported the economy grew
at a 3 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after a 1.8
percent gain in the prior three months.  “The  unemployment rate  remains elevated, long-term
unemployment is still near record levels and the number of
persons working part time for economic reasons is very high,”
Bernanke said during a Feb. 29 testimony to Congress. Fed policy
makers judge “that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for
monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives”
for stable prices and maximum employment, he said.  Employment at service-providers increased 203,000. Retail
payrolls fell 7,400 in February. Professional and business
service employment increased 82,000 last month, including a
45,200 pickup in temporary hiring.  Education, Health  Education and health services employment jumped 71,000, the
most since September 2006, according the Labor Department.  Construction companies reduced payrolls by 13,000 workers
last month, the biggest drop since January 2011.  Government payrolls decreased by 6,000 in February,
reflecting cutbacks at the federal and state levels.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent to $23.31, today’s
report showed. The workweek for all employees averaged 34.5
hours for a third consecutive month.  The so-called  underemployment rate , which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking, decreased to a three-year
low of 14.9 percent from 15.1 percent.  The report also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed
Americans. The number of people without a job for 27 weeks or
more fell as a percentage of all jobless, to 42.6 percent from
42.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
