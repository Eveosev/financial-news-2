The  trade deficit  in the U.S. widened
in January to the largest since October 2008 as imports rose to a
record high.  The gap increased 4.3 percent to $52.6 billion, more than
forecast, from a revised $50.4 billion in December, the Commerce
Department in Washington said today. The median  estimate  of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a deficit of $49
billion in January. Exports of capital goods, as well as cars and
automobile parts, climbed to a record.  Imports may keep rising as  labor market  gains put consumers
in a better position to continue spending while businesses
rebuild stockpiles and replace outdated equipment. Rising energy
costs may also keep the trade gap widening.  “The increase in imports reflects the strengthening in
 consumer spending  on cars and trucks, so it looks like it’s
promising for autos,” said  Omair Sharif , a U.S. economist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , who had the closest
forecast. At the same time, he said, “U.S. exporters are
looking pretty good right now. Exports have been a hefty part of
this recovery.”  Stock-index futures held gains after the trade and
unemployment figures were released. Standard & Poor’s 500 futures
expiring in June added 0.3 percent to 1,364.80 at 8:43 a.m. New
York time. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose
to 2.05 percent from 2.01 percent late yesterday.  The median forecast in the Bloomberg News survey of 79
economists called for the deficit to rise from a previously
estimated $48.8 billion in December. Estimates for January ranged
from gaps of $46.5 billion to $51 billion.  Petroleum Imports  The cost of petroleum imports in January slid to $17.2
billion from $17.4 billion the previous month.  Overall imports in January advanced 2.1 percent to $233.4
billion. In addition to petroleum, Americans also bought more
capital goods such as computer accessories and telecommunications
equipment from overseas.  Exports increased 1.4 percent to $180.8 billion, boosted by
aircraft sales and computers to buyers overseas. That caused the
trade gap excluding petroleum to narrow to $22.9 billion in
January from $23.2 billion the prior month. The rise in exports
of cars and parts may reflect a new method for calculation by the
Commerce Department.  Some U.S. exporters are betting on increased demand from
abroad.  Deere & Co., (DE)  the world’s largest maker of agricultural
machinery, said last week it will invest $70 million to expand
tractor production in Waterloo,  Iowa .  The investment will increase capacity by more than 10
percent by mid-2013, the Moline, Illinois-based company said in a
statement. Deere’s Waterloo operations build large farm tractors
that are shipped to more than 130 countries, the company said.  After eliminating the influence of prices, which are the
numbers used to calculate gross domestic product, the trade
deficit grew to $49.1 billion from $48.3 billion.  The fourth-quarter average of $50.2 billion was larger than
the $47 billion in the previous three months.  Annual Growth  The world’s largest economy expanded at a 3 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter after growing at a 1.8 percent pace in
the prior three months, Commerce Department figures showed on
Feb. 29. The  trade gap  subtracted 0.07 percentage point from GDP
in the final three months of 2011, after adding 0.43 points in
the prior quarter.  The January trade gap with  China  widened to $26 billion from
$23.1 billion as imports climbed, today’s report showed.  Exports to the European Union decreased 7.5 percent and
imports fell 8.7 percent, shrinking the trade gap to $8.5 billion
from $9.6 billion.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , based in Peoria,  Illinois , is building and
expanding factories as demand for trucks and shovels used in
mines rises and old equipment is replaced in the U.S. and  Europe .
The world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment
said it will build a one-million-square-foot factory in  Georgia ,
which will employ 1,400 workers. The plant, which will make small
tractors and excavators, will support an additional 2,800
positions in the U.S. at suppliers and supporting companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
