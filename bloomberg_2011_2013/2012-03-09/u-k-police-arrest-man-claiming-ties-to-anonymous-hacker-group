Police in the U.K. arrested a man,
who claims to have links to the group Anonymous, on suspicion he
hacked the British Pregnancy Advisory Service’s website.  The 27-year-old man, who wasn’t named, is in custody at a
 West Midlands Police Station , police said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “We have taken rapid action to identify and arrest a
suspect involved in hacking,” Detective Inspector Mark Raymond
from the Midland Police e-Crime unit said in the statement.
“This was done to prevent personal details of people who had
requested information from the BPAS website being made public.”  Data stolen from the website, which enables people to make
personal inquiries about contraception, abortion, pregnancy and
testing for sexually transmitted diseases, didn’t contain the
medical details of women who received treatment or the reasons
they contacted the council, Raymond said.  The U.K. arrest follows a crackdown on Anonymous in the
U.S., where some members were among six people charged on March
6, including Hector Xavier Monsegur, who was described as an
influential member of the group. The underground hacking
movement attracted worldwide attention by defacing the website
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and stealing customer
data from Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
