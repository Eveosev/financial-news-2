million for a two-floor condominium in the Ritz-Carlton hotel
facing  New York  City’s Central Park.  The 10,888-square-foot (1,010-square-meter) condo has 14
rooms on the 30th and 31st floors of the former home of the St.
Moritz Hotel, according to a broker  website . The building,
renovated by Millennium Partners in 2006, has more than 250
hotel rooms as well as apartments on the top 12 floors.  Closely held  Millennium Partners , founded in 1990 and based
in New York, develops hotels, luxury condos and office and
retail space in New York, Boston,  Washington , Miami,  San
Francisco  and Los Angeles, according to the company’s website.  Jeffries bought the condo in 2003 for an undisclosed price,
according to New York City Department of Finance records. He
sold another condo, on the building’s 29th floor, for $28.5
million in 2008, according to property records.  Jeffries didn’t immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment after regular business hours yesterday. The
 listing  agent, Kyle W. Blackmon of Brown Harris Stevens, also
