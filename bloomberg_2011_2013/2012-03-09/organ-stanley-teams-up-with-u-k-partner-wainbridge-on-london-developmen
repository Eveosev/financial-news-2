A  Morgan Stanley (MS)  unit and  Wainbridge
Capital Ltd.  reached a joint-venture agreement to develop London
real estate, the two companies said in a statement today.  The partnership will seek to “unlock significant value
through redevelopment, refurbishment and other asset management
initiatives” from office buildings in London, according to the
statement.  A “fund of funds” managed by Morgan Stanley Alternative
Investment Partners will take a 49 percent stake in  FC200 , a
164,000 square foot office development at Park Royal in west
London, as the first joint project. It was bought by
Wainbridge’s Global Opportunities London fund in September and
both sides will pay an undisclosed amount to complete the
building, according to the statement.  “There are still significant investment opportunities in
the London office market, and the relationship can enable our
investors to benefit from Wainbridge’s expertise,” David Boyle,
 executive director  and portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley AIP
Real Estate, said in the statement.  Wainbridge, a property investment manager based in Jersey,
 Channel Islands , raised capital for its fund from high net-worth
investors, the majority of which are Russian, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
