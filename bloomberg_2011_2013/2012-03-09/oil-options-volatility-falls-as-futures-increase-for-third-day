Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose for a third day after the U.S. boosted
payrolls more than forecast, bolstering optimism for growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.8 as of 3 p.m. in New York, down from
28.7 yesterday.  Crude for April delivery rose 82 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $107.40 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Since Feb. 17, the front-month contract has traded in a range of
$104.26 and $110.55. May futures gained 81 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $107.87 a barrel.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
June $73 puts, with 6,176 lots changing hands at 3:04 p.m. They
fell 1 cent to 10 cents a barrel. April $105 puts, the second-
most active options, declined 34 cents to 57 cents with 3,381
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
