Returns for Capesize vessels that
haul iron ore fell to the lowest in two weeks because of a
surplus of ships and slowing demand.  Rents for the ships that transport at least 150,000 metric
tons of cargo declined 0.6 percent to $5,786 a day, the lowest
since Feb. 24, according to data from the London-based  Baltic
Exchange  today.  Slowing demand for cargoes and the surplus of available
vessels is spurring the decline in rates, RS Platou Markets AS,
an Oslo-based investment bank, said in an e-mailed note today.
Declining congestion at ports in  China , Brazil and  Australia  is
adding vessels to the market, swelling supply, it said.  Capesizes are the largest vessels within the  Baltic Dry
Index (BDIY) , a broader measure of shipping costs. The index advanced
for a 12th straight session, increasing by 1.5 percent to 824,
the data show.  Daily returns for Panamaxes, the biggest ships that can
navigate the Panama Canal, advanced 1.8 percent to $7,129 a day,
according to the exchange today.  Supramax (BSRATCR)  rates added 2.8
percent to $9,035.  Handysizes (BHSATCR) , the smallest ships in the gauge,
rose 1.2 percent to $7,106, the highest price in seven weeks,
the exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
