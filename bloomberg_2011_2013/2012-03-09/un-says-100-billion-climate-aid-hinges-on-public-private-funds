A pledge by rich nations to channel
$100 billion in climate aid to poorer countries will only be met
by combining public and private funds, according to United
Nations envoy Christiana Figueres.  “If you look at the potential cost of addressing climate,
there is not enough public or private finance if you look at
them separately,” Figueres said today in London. “It is only
when you creatively bring them together that you can begin to
responsively address the cost of climate.”  The world’s wealthiest nations pledged $100 billion of aid
two years ago to help  developing countries  adapt to the effects
of rising temperatures and cut  greenhouse gases . At UN talks in
 South Africa  in December, delegates agreed to administer part of
that aid through a Green Climate Fund, which has so far failed
to receive any financing commitments, according to Figueres.  “No one has come through specifically with any numbers
yet,” she said. “My sense is that those governments that are
willing to contribute to the startup costs, which is what is
necessary this year, are identifying the sources of finance and
also waiting for the board to be constituted,” which is due by
the end of the month, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
