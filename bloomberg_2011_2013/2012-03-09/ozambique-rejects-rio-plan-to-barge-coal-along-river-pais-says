Mozambique’s government rejected a
proposal by  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  to transport “low-cost” coal along the
Zambezi River,  O Pais  reported, citing Transport Minister Paulo Zucula.  The decision may mean exporting the fuel won’t be viable
for mining companies because rail costs are too expensive, the
Maputo-based newspaper said, citing Casimiro Francisco, chairman
of the Mozambique Coal Development Association. The government
hasn’t provided any reasons to substantiate its decision,
Francisco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
