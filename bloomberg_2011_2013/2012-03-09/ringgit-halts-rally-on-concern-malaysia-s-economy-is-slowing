The ringgit halted a two-week rally
on concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is slowing Southeast
Asia’s third-biggest economy.  The central bank will leave borrowing costs on hold when it
reviews monetary policy today, economists predicted, after
government data showed this week exports rose the least in 15
months in January. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
halted a two-day advance as Greece completed its debt swap.  “We think there’ll be no interest-rate cuts for the rest
of the year,” said Saktiandi Supaat, the Singapore-based head
of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd.  The ringgit was at 3.0070 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur , compared with 3.0038 on March 2 and yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of price swings that options traders use,
held steady at 7.40 percent.  Bank Negara Malaysia  will leave its benchmark overnight
rate at 3 percent, according to 19 of 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. One predicted a 25-basis point cut.  Five-year government bonds were little changed for the
week. The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016
was 3.24 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
