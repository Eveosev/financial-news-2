Metallurgical coal prices on the
U.S. spot market fell this week because of slack demand, Energy
Publishing Inc. said today.  Low-volatility coal decreased $3.87, or 1.9 percent, to
$201.13 a ton and high-volatility coal dropped $1.75, or 0.9
percent, to $187.50, according to Energy Publishing.  “Price sentiment hasn’t collapsed on the buy or on the
sell side, though it has gotten more bearish,” the data
provider wrote in a weekly report.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
