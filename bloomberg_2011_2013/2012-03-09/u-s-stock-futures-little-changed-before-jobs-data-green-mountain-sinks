U.S. stocks rose, capping the fourth
straight weekly rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after
a government report showing stronger-than-forecast payroll
growth bolstered optimism in the world’s largest economy.  Financial shares had the biggest gain among 10 groups in
the  S&P 500  as  Greece ’s private creditors agreed to a debt swap.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  BB&T Corp. (BBT)  added at least 1.2 percent.
 Lennar Corp. (LEN)  and  D.R. Horton  Inc. rallied more than 3 percent,
pacing gains in homebuilders, after Credit Suisse Group AG
raised its recommendations for the companies.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) 
rose 2.9 percent on plans to introduce a new single-cup brewer.  The S&P 500 added 0.4 percent to 1,370.87 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The index rose 2.1 percent in four weeks. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average gained 14.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,922.02. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies jumped 1.3
percent to 817. About  6.2 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, or 6.4 percent below the three-month average.  “The jobs report was solid, but not spectacular,” said
 James McDonald , chief investment strategist at Northern Trust
Corp. in  Chicago . His firm manages $663 billion. “This helps
depict the U.S. as the standout Western economy continuing to
slowly, but steadily repair. We didn’t see any improvement in
the  unemployment rate . That tells me the Fed is going to stay
accommodative. The path of least resistance for stocks is up.”  Today is the three-year anniversary of the  bull market  in
U.S. stocks that followed the global  financial (S5FINL)  crisis. The S&P
500 has rallied 103 percent from its 12-year low on March 9,
2009, on better-than-estimated economic and corporate data. The
index is up 9 percent in 2012.  Jobs Data  Equities rose today amid the best six-month streak of job
growth since 2006. The 227,000 increase in payrolls last month
topped the median projection of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The jobless rate held at 8.3 percent. The latest pickup
in employment may not be convincing enough for Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who last week said the labor market
remains “far from normal,” a sign policy makers continue to
see merit in keeping  interest rates  low for several years.  Investors also watched developments in  Europe ’s attempts to
tame its debt crisis. Greece pushed through the biggest
sovereign restructuring in history, opening the way for a second
rescue package. An industry group ruled that Greece’s debt
restructuring is a “ credit event ” that will trigger $3 billion
in default insurance.  “This is a story of isolating Greece and preventing a
massive financial contagion,” said Brad Sorensen, director of
market and sector analysis at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab
Corp., which has $1.74 trillion in client assets.  Banks Rally  Nine of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 gained today, led by
financial shares. The KBW Bank Index rallied 1 percent as 23 of
its 24 stocks advanced. JPMorgan advanced 1.5 percent, the most
in the  Dow (INDU) , to $41.03. BB&T increased 1.2 percent to $29.46.  A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes rallied 3.3
percent. Lennar increased 3.1 percent to $25.45, while D.R.
Horton climbed 6.3 percent to $15.47. The shares were raised to
the equivalent of buy at Credit Suisse.  Starbucks rose 2.9 percent to $51.84. The Verismo machine
will make espresso-based beverages and brewed coffee. Starbucks
will advertise and sell the machine and single-cup pods through
a strategic relationship with closely held Krueger GmbH.  Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  tumbled 16 percent to $52.59.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  surged 6.9 percent to $2.78. The
request by regulators for  Verizon Wireless  and cable operators
led by Comcast Corp. to provide more data on the companies’
proposed $3.6 billion airwaves deal appears to be “a partial
victory” for smaller wireless operators such as Sprint, Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. said in a note.  Biggest Takeover  Molycorp Inc. (MCP)  soared 19 percent to $30.89. After losing
two-thirds of its  value  in 10 months as demand for rare-earth
metals imploded, it’s now seeking to boost shareholder returns
with its biggest takeover.  The owner of the largest rare-earth deposit outside  China 
yesterday agreed to buy  Neo Material (NEM)  Technologies Inc. for C$1.3
billion ($1.3 billion) in cash and stock. With Neo Material,
Molycorp will gain the ability to produce more types of magnets
and increase sales to China, boosting profitability, Byron
Capital Markets Ltd. said.  “It actually makes it a stronger story,” Jonathan Hykawy,
a Toronto-based analyst at Byron Capital, said in a telephone
interview. “Molycorp effectively has the pieces of the puzzle
if this acquisition goes through to basically do the entire
magnet industry. That’s a big, big, added slice of added  cash
flow  that Molycorp really isn’t paying all that much for.”  HP Slumps  Ten stocks in the Dow retreated today.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
the world’s biggest personal-computer maker, slumped 1.9 percent
to $24.18. The shares had the biggest decline in the 30-stock
index, after rallying for two straight days.  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)  lost 1 percent to $32.27. The
largest maker of analog semiconductors reduced its first-quarter
sales and profit forecasts, citing lower demand for products
that let wireless devices connect and run applications.  Pall Corp. (PLL)  fell 3.1 percent, the  most  in the S&P 500, to
$59.30. The supplier of filters for drugmakers and refineries
was cut to neutral by Wedbush Securities, citing softness in
markets including China.  Dynegy Inc. (DYN)  slumped 36 percent, the most in the Russell
2000 Index, to 76 cents. The independent power producer’s
transfer of coal-fired  power plants  from a unit it later put
into bankruptcy was fraudulent and harmed creditors, a court-
ordered investigation found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
