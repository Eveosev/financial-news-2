Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Employment was unchanged in February. A decline in the number
of people searching for work pushed the unemployment rate down
0.2 percentage points to 7.4%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment was up by 121,000 (+0.7%), with the bulk of the
increase occurring in the first half of the period.  Employment  There was little change in full-time and part-time employment
in February. Compared with 12 months earlier, the number of
full-time workers was up 1.5% (+204,000), while part-time
employment declined 2.5% (-83,000). At the same time, the total
number of hours worked grew 1.7%, with all of the increase
occurring in the first half of the period.  Employment for the month declined in retail and wholesale
trade; transportation and warehousing; health care and social
assistance; and public administration. These declines were
offset by increases in finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing; educational services; and business, building and other
support services.  Provincially, there was little employment change in February,
with the exception of a decline in  New Brunswick .  Employment in February fell among youths aged 15 to 24, while
it increased among people aged 55 and over. For those aged 25 to
54, employment was unchanged.  Employment was little changed among employees and the self-
employed. Compared with 12 months earlier, all of the growth was
among private sector employees (+1.4%), while both self-
employment (-0.7%) and public sector employment (-0.5%) were
down slightly.  Unemployment rate  Industry perspective  Employment in retail and wholesale trade fell by 37,000 in
February. The trend in this industry has been relatively flat
over the past three years, with employment fluctuating between
2.6 million and 2.7 million over the period.  The number of people working in transportation and
warehousing declined by 22,000, bringing employment in this
industry down to a level similar to that of 12 months earlier.  Health care and social assistance also posted a decline in
employment, down 22,000, leaving employment in this industry at
its level of 12 months earlier.  Employment in public administration declined by 15,000 in
February. As a result, employment in this industry was down 1.3%
(-12,000) compared with 12 months earlier.  Employment in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing
increased by 41,000, offsetting half of the declines that
occurred over the previous five months. The number of people
working in this industry was 1.2% (-13,000) below the level
recorded 12 months earlier.  Employment in educational services increased 17,000 in
February, bringing employment growth in this industry to 2.7%
(+34,000) over the previous 12 months.  The number of people working in business, building and other
support services rose by 16,000 in February. With this increase,
employment in the industry was 1.7% (+12,000) higher than 12
months earlier.  Employment in natural resources edged up in February,
bringing growth over the past 12 months to 10.2% (+34,000), the
highest rate of all industries.  There was little change in construction and manufacturing
employment in February. Over the past 12 months, employment in
construction increased by 26,000 (+2.1%), while in manufacturing,
it declined by 41,000 (-2.3%).  Provincial summary  Employment in New Brunswick declined by 2,600 in February,
pushing the  unemployment rate  up 0.6 percentage points to 10.1%.
As a result of this decline, employment in the province was
similar to its level of 12 months earlier.  While employment in Ontario was little changed in February,
the unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 7.6%, the
result of a decline in the number of people seeking work. Over
the past 12 months, employment in Ontario has risen 0.8%
(+54,000), with the growth occurring entirely in the first half
of the period.  Employment in  Quebec  was unchanged in February, as was the
unemployment rate, which stood at 8.4%. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment in the province was down 1.2% (-49,000).  The number of people working in  Alberta  was little changed in
February, and the unemployment rate was 5.0%, one of the lowest
in the country. Over the past 12 months, employment in the
province was up 2.8% (+58,000), the highest growth rate of all
provinces.  Declines among youths and gains among people 55 and over  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 fell for the fifth
consecutive month, down 27,000 in February, and their
unemployment rate was 14.7%. Compared with February 2011, youth
employment was down 69,000 (-2.8%). With fewer youths
participating in the labour market, their participation rate in
February was 63.3%, down from the most recent peak of 68.1% in
September 2008.  Among people aged 55 and over, employment rose by 24,000 in
February, with most of the increase among men. Over the past 12
months, employment for this age group has grown 4.0%, the
highest rate of growth among all demographic groups, and mostly
because of population aging.  For people aged 25 to 54, employment was unchanged in
February. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for this
group was up 0.6% (+67,000)  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a sample,
and are therefore subject to sampling variability. Estimates for
smaller geographic areas or industries will have more
variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates, and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends.  Statistics Canada  is moving to one release time, 8:30 a.m.,
for all data releases in The Daily. This will mean a change in
the release time for the LFS, which is currently 7:00 a.m. This
change will be implemented with the release of LFS data on April
5, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
