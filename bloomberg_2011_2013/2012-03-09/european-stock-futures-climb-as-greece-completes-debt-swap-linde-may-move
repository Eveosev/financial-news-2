European (SXXP)  stocks climbed for a third
day as a report showed the U.S. economy added more jobs than
predicted and Greece’s private creditors agreed to a debt swap.  Linde AG (LIN)  surged 5.6 percent after earnings for the fourth
quarter topped analysts’ estimates.  Lagardere SCA (MMB)  plunged 6.1
percent as the largest publisher in France reported full-year
net income that missed analysts’ estimates.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.5 percent to 265.44 at
the close after Greece announced the results of the private-
sector involvement in its debt restructuring. The gauge has
still dropped 0.7 percent this week.  “Although not blowout numbers, the non-farm payrolls
survey continues to point to a steady recovery in the U.S.
economy,” said Espen Furnes, an Oslo-based  fund manager  at
Storebrand Asset Management, which oversees $72 billion. “With
an upwards revision of last month’s numbers, this signals that
the  U.S. economy  is in good health. This is no jobless
recovery.”  The Stoxx 600 has  rallied 68 percent  since March 9, 2009,
when the index reached its lowest level in more than 12 years.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has  surged 103 percent  over the
same period. The Stoxx 600 has  gained 8.6 percent this year  as
the  European (SXXP)  Central Bank lent regional financial institutions
more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) for three years and
U.S. economic reports topped estimates.  U.S. Payrolls, Unemployment  A Labor Department report today showed that the U.S.
economy added more jobs in February than forecast. The 227,000
increase in payrolls followed a revised 284,000 gain in January,
the release showed. Job growth over the last six months was the
strongest since 2006. The median projection of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000 increase in the
workforce in February. The  unemployment rate  held at 8.3
percent.  Greece ’s government said that bondholders tendered 152
billion euros of Greek-law bonds, or 85.8 percent, for the debt
swap. The Mediterranean nation will swap their holdings for new
securities under the debt exchange. Creditors also tendered 20
billion euros of foreign-law bonds, according to the country’s
 Finance Ministry .  Greece’s use of collective-action clauses forcing investors
to take part in the sovereign restructuring should trigger $3
billion of insurance payouts under rules governing credit-
default swap contracts.  VStoxx Declines  The VStoxx Index, which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, slid 8.8 percent.  “It’s clear that the market is happy with the fact that
this is more or less over, having saved Greece from the abyss,”
 Philippe Gijsels , head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global
Markets, said in a phone interview from Brussels. “In the short
term, much of these problems are behind us.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 12 of the 18 western-
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 0.7 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5 percent, while France’s CAC 40
Index advanced 0.3 percent.  Linde climbed 5.6 percent to 133.05 euros after predicting
an  increase in earnings  and sales this year as demand in  Asia 
and liquid- and cylinder-gas orders helped the world’s second-
biggest maker of industrial gases report higher-than-estimated
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  LSE, Cable & Wireless  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  surged 6.4 percent to 955
pence, its biggest increase in eight months. The owner of
 Europe ’s oldest independent bourse agreed to buy a majority
stake in LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. for 463 million euros as it
looks to expand its post-trade services.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  soared 5.9 percent to 36.2
pence after saying that Vodafone Group Plc has until March 12 to
make an offer for the company. Tata Communications Ltd. also has
until that date to bid for the fixed-line network company.  Straumann Holding AG and Nobel Biocare Holding AG, two
Swiss makers of dental implants, surged 8.7 percent to 153.80
Swiss francs and 8.1 percent to 11.40 francs, respectively,
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its recommendations on the
companies.  Straumann (STMN)  was raised to buy from sell and  Nobel
Biocare (NOBN)  was upgraded to buy from neutral. The stocks posted the
two biggest gains on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  today.  Hunting Plc (HTG) , a U.K. oil-services provider, rose 8.1 percent
to 925.5 pence. HSBC Holdings Plc revised its share-price target
to 1,015 pence from 960 pence.  Lagardere plunged 6.1 percent to 22.32 euros. The owner of
the Europe 1 radio station posted full-year adjusted  net income 
of 226 million euros, compared with 284 million euros a year
earlier. The publisher forecast flat Ebit this year.  Red Electrica Corp., the operator of Spain’s electricity
network, fell 4.9 percent to 36.03 euros. The national energy
regulator, known as CNE, said the country should cut the cost of
its regulated power market.  Hermes International SCA (RMS) , the French maker of Birkin bags
and silk scarves, lost 2.1 percent to 264.60 euros. The stock
was cut to underweight from neutral at HSBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
