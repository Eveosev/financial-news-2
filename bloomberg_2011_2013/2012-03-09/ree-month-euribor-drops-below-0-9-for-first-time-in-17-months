The  rate  at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months dropped
below 0.9 percent for the first time in more than 17 months,
according to the European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
fell 0.8 basis point, or 0.008 percentage point, to 0.894
percent, data from the federation showed.  Thatâ€™s the 57th consecutive daily decline, the longest run
since April 2009, and the  lowest  rate since Sept. 30, 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
