The lira weakened against the dollar
for the first time in three days on concern higher energy costs
will widen  Turkey ’s  trade deficit  and after the U.S. currency
strengthened off the back of strong employment data and
completion of the Greek debt-swap deal.  The lira depreciated 0.6 percent to 1.7868 per dollar as of
5:18 p.m. in Istanbul. The dollar gained 1.2 percent against the
euro to 1.3116, also for the first time in three days.  Yields (BENCH)  on
the benchmark two-year bonds increased, up three basis point to
9.18 percent.  Oil rose this year on concern sanctions against Turkey’s
neighbor Iran will lead to military conflict in the  Middle East ,
where more than half the world’s crude reserves are located. Oil
for April delivery gained $1.2, or 1.1 percent, to $107.79 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Turkey’s energy bill
would reach $65 billion if  oil prices  remain at their current
levels, Economy MinisterZafer Caglayan said in Istanbul March
7, up from $54 billion in 2011.  “The increase in oil prices is negative for the lira,”
Burcin Metin, chief currency trader at ING Bank AS in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  Employers in the U.S. boosted payrolls more than forecast
in February, capping the best six month streak of job growth
since 2006. The  unemployment rate  held at 8.3 percent. The
227,000 increase in payrolls followed a revised 284,000 gain in
January that was bigger than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The median projection of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000 rise
in February employment.  Turkey’s  current-account deficit  narrowed in the last two
months of 2011 after surging to a record $78.6 billion in
October. It is still about 10 percent of gross domestic product,
the second-highest in the world after the U.S. The country is
dependent on imports for almost all of its energy requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
