China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-
controlled developer, said 2011 profit rose 34 percent after the
company sold more homes and earned higher rental from an
expanding investment property portfolio.  Net income increased to HK$8.07 billion ($1.04 billion), or
HK$1.472  Hong Kong  cents a share, from a restated HK$6 billion,
or HK$1.188 Hong Kong cents, a year earlier, the company said in
a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Sales rose to
HK$35.8 billion from HK$25.7 billion.  Earnings at the company, one of the two mainland Chinese
developers included in Hong Kong’s benchmark property index, has
benefited from an earlier push to expand its commercial real
estate development. Rentable area of its investment portfolio
will probably double between now and the end of 2013, according
to a March 7 report by Deutsche Bank AG.  “This planned increase should drive growth in the
company’s recurrent rental income,”  Tony Tsang  and Jason Ching,
analysts at Deutsche Bank, wrote in the March 7 report. More
completed investment properties “‘should help bring down the
gearing levels on the balance sheet and further enhance its
financing capacities,” they said.  Income from investment properties jumped 40 percent to
HK$1.1 billion last year, while those from property sales
climbed 30 percent to HK$10.3 billion, the company said.  Shares of  China Resources  increased 11 percent this year,
the worst performer in the seven-member  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP) ,
which rose 19 percent over the same period. They gained 2.1
percent to HK$13.82 at the close today in Hong Kong before the
earnings were announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
