General Electric Co. (GE)  will focus this
year on dividend increases and making acquisitions of as much as
$3 billion to reward shareholders in a “continuously unstable”
global economy, Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  said.  “Don’t look for any big deals in 2012,” Immelt wrote in
his annual letter to shareholders. Keeping purchases in a range
of $1 billion to $3 billion and in familiar fields “improves
our chance for success,” he wrote.  GE is digesting $11 billion in energy-related acquisitions
completed in 2011, including  Dresser Inc. (DRC)  and Lineage Power
Holdings Inc. For 2012, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
is emphasizing international markets, seeking to boost sales in
faster-growing, resource-rich countries from  China  to Australia
to  Peru  by 15 percent to about $40 billion, Immelt wrote.  “I would argue that when the environment is continuously
unstable, it is no longer volatile,” wrote Immelt, 56.
“Rather, we have entered a new economic era.”  Sales outside the U.S. were a highlight of GE’s March 7
presentation to investors in Rio de Janeiro. Vice Chairman John Rice cited China, Australia and Peru as being among the so-
called growth markets that GE projects will account for half its
industrial revenue by 2020.  Raising GE’s dividend is “one of our top priorities,”
Immelt wrote. The company has increased its quarterly payout,
now at 17 cents a share, four times since July 2010.  In 2009, GE cut the dividend to 10 cents from 31 cents, the
first reduction since the Great Depression, as the global
recession and credit crunch sapped profit at its finance unit
and threatened the company’s credit rating.  The shares rose less than 0.1 percent to $19.04 at the
close in  New York . It was GE’s third straight daily gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
