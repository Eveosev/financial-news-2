Following is the text of the February employment
report from the Labor Department.  Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 227,000 in February, and the unemployment
rate was unchanged at 8.3 percent, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported
today. Employment rose in professional and businesses services, health care and
social assistance, leisure and hospitality, manufacturing, and mining.  Household Survey Data  The number of unemployed persons, at 12.8 million, was essentially unchanged in
February. The unemployment rate held at 8.3 percent, 0.8 percentage point below
the August 2011 rate.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.7
percent), adult women (7.7 percent), teenagers (23.8 percent), whites (7.3
percent), blacks (14.1 percent), and Hispanics (10.7 percent) showed little or
no change in February. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.3 percent, not
seasonally adjusted.  The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was
little changed at 5.4 million in February. These individuals accounted for 42.6
percent of the unemployed.  Both the  labor force  and employment rose in February. The civilian labor force
participation rate, at 63.9 percent, and the employment-population ratio, at
58.6 percent, edged up over the month.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes
referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at 8.1
million in February. These individuals were working part time because their
hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.  In February, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,
essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally
adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were
available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.
They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in
the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 1.0 million discouraged workers in
February, about the same as a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally
adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work
because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.6 million
persons marginally attached to the labor force in February had not searched for
work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance
or family responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 227,000 in February. Private-sector
employment grew by 233,000, with job gains in professional and business
services, health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality,
manufacturing, and mining.  Professional and business services added 82,000 jobs in February. Just over half
of the increase occurred in temporary help services (+45,000). Job gains also
occurred in computer systems design (+10,000) and in management and technical
consulting services (+7,000). Employment in professional and business services
has grown by 1.4 million since a recent low point in September 2009.  Health care and social assistance employment rose by 61,000 over the month.
Within health care, ambulatory care services added 28,000 jobs, and hospital
employment increased by 15,000. Over the past 12 months, health care employment
has risen by 360,000. In February, social assistance employment edged up
(+12,000).  In February, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 44,000, with
nearly all of the increase in food services and drinking places (+41,000). Since
a recent low in February 2010, food services has added 531,000 jobs.  Manufacturing employment rose by 31,000 in February. All of the increase
occurred in durable goods manufacturing, with job gains in fabricated metal
products (+11,000), transportation equipment (+8,000), machinery (+5,000), and
furniture and related products (+3,000). Durable goods manufacturing has added
444,000 jobs since a recent trough in January 2010.  In February, mining added 7,000 jobs, with most of the gain in support
activities for mining (+5,000). Since a recent low in October 2009, mining
employment has increased by 180,000.  Construction employment changed little in February, after 2 consecutive months
of job gains. Over the month, employment fell by 14,000 in nonresidential
specialty trade contractors.  Overall, employment in retail trade changed little in February. A large job loss
in general merchandise stores (-35,000) more than offset an increase in January
(+23,000). Employment in  motor vehicle  and parts dealers continued to trend up
in February.  Government employment was essentially unchanged in January and February. In
2011, government lost an average of 22,000 jobs per month.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged
at 34.5 hours in February. The manufacturing workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to
41.0 hours, and factory overtime was unchanged at 3.4 hours. The average
workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls
edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours.  In February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls rose by 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $23.31. Over the past 12 months,
average hourly earnings have increased by 1.9 percent. In February, average
hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose
by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $19.64.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised from
+203,000 to +223,000, and the change for January was revised from +243,000 to
+284,000.  The Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on Friday, April
6, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  To contact the reporter on this story:
