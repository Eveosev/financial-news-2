Hungary ’s economy expanded 1.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from a year earlier as
agricultural output boosted gross domestic product.  GDP increased 1.4 percent from a year earlier and rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from the third quarter, matching
preliminary estimates, the  statistics office  in Budapest said in
an e-mailed report today.  The European Commission last month forecast that Hungary’s
economy will probably shrink 0.1 percent this year. One of the
“main questions” is whether Hungary can avert a recession this
year, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said yesterday.  The government is scaling back its projection for economic
growth this year, maintaining that the country will probably
avoid a recession,  Mihaly Varga , Orban’s chief of staff, said on
Feb. 20. The Cabinet’s estimate ranges between stagnation and
0.5 percent growth, Varga said last month. The official forecast
is still 0.5 percent growth.  The forint rose 0.2 percent to 293.5 per euro at 9:32 a.m.
in Budapest.  Agriculture added 0.9 percent to growth in the fourth
quarter, according to the statistics office, followed by 0.8
percent for industrial output. Household consumption spending
was unchanged in the final three months of the year compared
with the year-ago period, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
