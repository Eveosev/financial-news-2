Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos thanked creditors for participating in the biggest
debt restructuring in history, saying they have “shared the
sacrifices” of the Greek people.  “I wish to express my appreciation to all of our creditors
who have supported our ambitious program of reform and
adjustment and who have shared the sacrifices of the Greek
people in this historic endeavour,” Venizelos said in an e-
mailed statement today. “With the support of our official
sector and private creditors,  Greece  will continue implementing
the measures needed to achieve the fiscal adjustments and
structural reforms to which it has committed, and that will
return Greece to a path of sustainable growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
