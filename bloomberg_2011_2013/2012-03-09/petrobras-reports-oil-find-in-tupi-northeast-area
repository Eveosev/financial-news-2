Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, discovered “good quality” oil
near the country’s biggest field as it accelerates exploration
in deep waters of the South Atlantic.  Petrobras, as the producer is known, found an oil column
more than 290 meters (951 feet) thick at the Tupi Northeast area
in the Santos Basin, the company said in a statement today. The
find is northeast of the Lula field, the biggest discovery in
the Western Hemisphere since  Mexico ’s Cantarell in 1976.  “They’re getting lucky, it compares favorably” to other
discoveries in the so-called pre-salt region in Brazil’s deep
waters, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and geology
professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. “The key is how
much of those 290 meters is good reservoir and not rock that
doesn’t hold oil.”  Petrobras, based in  Rio de Janeiro , will continue drilling
the well to gauge the reservoir’s size and will conduct a well
test to determine potential output, the company said.  Petrobras is spending more than any oil company as it
develops the pre-salt, an area off the coast of Rio and  Sao
Paulo  state the size of Florida that holds at least 50 billion
barrels of oil trapped under a layer of salt. It has a $224.7
billion, five-year investment plan.  Petrobras fell 0.5 percent to 23.98 reais in Sao Paulo at
11:25 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
