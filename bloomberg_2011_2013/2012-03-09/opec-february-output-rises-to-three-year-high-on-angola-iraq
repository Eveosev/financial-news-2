OPEC’s crude production rose last
month to the highest level in more than three years as  Libya ,
 Iraq  and Angola increased supplies.  Output from the 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries increased to 30.97 million barrels a day in
February, the producer group’s Vienna-based secretariat said
today in its monthly oil market report. That compares to 30.82
million in January.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
raised its output ceiling to 30 million barrels a day in
December, setting its target closer to production levels. That
limit includes Iraq, which was previously exempt from quotas.  Libya pumped 1.19 million barrels a day last month,
compared with 1.01 million in January, while Angola’s production
rose to 1.82 million barrels a day from 1.74 million, OPEC said.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest crude exporter, reduced
its  output  in February by 0.4 percent to 9.66 million barrels a
day, according to OPEC estimates, which are based on secondary
sources.  The group set its biggest-ever supply cuts at the end of
2008 amid a collapse in global demand, reducing production
limits by 4.2 million barrels a day to 24.845 million. Most
members exceeded quotas last year as they sought to take
advantage of higher prices.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya,  Nigeria , Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
