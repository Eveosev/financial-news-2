Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) , Japan’s largest
computer-services provider, expects its system-chip unit to turn
profitable as early as the third quarter next fiscal year on
higher demand for digital cameras and smartphones.  Sales of system LSI, or large-scale integration,
semiconductors may rise as the Olympics in  London  in July and
August, and the U.S. presidential elections in November spur
demand, Kiyoshi Watanabe, corporate senior vice president of
 Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd. , said in an interview today.  The wholly owned unit of Fujitsu, which had the third
consecutive  quarterly loss  in the three months ended Dec. 31
after slower global growth depressed demand, expects sales to
increase later this year.  “There are many events toward the second half of the year,
so we expect the demand to increase,” said Watanabe, at the
unit’s head office in Yokohama,  Japan . “It’s said the demand
increases in the Olympics year.”  System LSI chips are used for functions ranging from
processing images for television screens to crunching data.  Fujitsu  rose  1.6 percent to 444 yen at close on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 11 percent this year,
compared with a 17 percent increase in the benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
