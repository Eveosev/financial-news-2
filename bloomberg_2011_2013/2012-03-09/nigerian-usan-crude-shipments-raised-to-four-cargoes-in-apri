Exports of the new Nigerian Usan
crude were raised to four 950,000-barrel cargoes in April from
the original plan for three lots, according to a revised loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Vitol Group will receive the extra cargo, the plan shows.
 Total SA (FP) , the operator of the field, Exxon Mobil and Glencore
International Plc were allocated one shipment each.  Exxon Mobil is offering its cargo for April 8 to April 9 at
30 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, after failing to sell
it via a tender, said two traders who declined to be identified
because they arenâ€™t authorized to speak on the matter.  Total sold its shipment on March 2 through a tender to Cia.
Espanola de Petroleos SA, or Cepsa, according to three traders
who participate in the market.  The French company announced the start of production at
Usan in an e-mailed statement on Feb. 24. The field has a
capacity to pump 180,000 barrels a day.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
