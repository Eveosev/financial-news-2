Bahraini protesters taking part in
an anti-government rally today hurled stones at riot police,
prompting security forces to take action against them, the
Interior Ministry said in a posting on Twitter.  “The situation has been dealt with” according to “legal
regulations,” the Manama-based ministry said, without
elaborating.  Thousands of demonstrators filled Budaiya Highway,
responding to a call by the country’s top Shiite Muslim cleric,
Ayatollah Issa Qassem, to participate in the protest, organized
by al-Wefaq, the largest Shiite group. “The people reiterated
their willingness to offer more sacrifices to reach their demand
for democracy,” al-Wefaq said in an e-mailed statement.  Tensions in Bahrain persist a year after the government
quashed a month of anti-government rallies by mostly Shiite
demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
