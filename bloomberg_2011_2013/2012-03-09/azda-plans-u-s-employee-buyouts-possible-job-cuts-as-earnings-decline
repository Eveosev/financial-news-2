Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ,  Japan ’s most
unprofitable  major carmaker , plans to offer buyouts to U.S.
employees and may make mandatory job cuts as earnings are hit by
exchange rate pressure.  Employees of Mazda’s U.S. unit in  Irvine ,  California , will
be notified next week of buyout options, said Jeremy Barnes, a
spokesman for the company. Dismissals are possible as a next
step if too few workers leave voluntarily, he said.  “It’s a result of the global headwinds we are facing,”
Barnes said. He declined to say how large a reduction Hiroshima,
Japan-based Mazda seeks. The company has 701 U.S. employees.  The decision comes even as Mazda’s U.S. sales are surging
this year, up 48 percent through February. The company is
Japan’s most export-reliant carmaker and has forecast a 100
billion yen ($1.2 billion) annual loss after the yen appreciated
against all major currencies during 2011. Mazda said last year
that it plans to stop making Mazda6 sedans at a Flat Rock,
Michigan, plant shared with  Ford Motor Co. (F)   Unlike larger rivals Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co.
and Nissan Motor Co., which have North American plants, Mazda
hasn’t been able to shift production outside of Japan to
moderate currency losses. The company this week said it plans to
raise as much as 151.2 billion yen in a record share sale to
replenish capital as it braces for its biggest annual loss in 11
years.  Mazda’s plan for U.S. job cuts was reported earlier by
Automotive News, a trade publication.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
