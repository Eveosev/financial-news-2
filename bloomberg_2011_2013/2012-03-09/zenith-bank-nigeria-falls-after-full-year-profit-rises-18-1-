Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  Nigeria ’s biggest
lender by market value, fell for the first time in three days
after weaker-than-expected full-year results, FBN Capital Ltd.
said.  Net income for the year through December rose 18 percent to
44.2 billion naira ($281 million) as revenue jumped 27 percent
to 244 billion naira, according to results released today by the
Lagos-based lender. Zenith proposed a dividend of 95 kobo per
share.  The stock declined 2.5 percent to 13.56 naira, its lowest
price since March 1, by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  “The source of the disappointment in the results was the
provisions line,” FBN Capital said today in an e-mailed note.
Zenith’s provisions for bad loans in the year amounted to 24.3
billion naira, three-quarters of which fell in the fourth
quarter and probably were loans to a fuel retailer, according to
FBN Capital.  The dividend, up 10 kobo from the 85 kobo it paid last
year, will be paid on April 5, Zenith said. “The implied yield
of 6.8 percents will be appreciated by the market, we believe,”
FBN Capital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
