Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , after losing two-
thirds of its  value  in 10 months as demand for rare-earth metals
imploded, is now seeking to boost shareholder returns with its
biggest takeover yet.  The owner of the largest rare-earth deposit outside China
yesterday agreed to buy Neo Material Technologies Inc. for C$1.3
billion ($1.3 billion) in cash and stock. At 4.7 times earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the deal
is the cheapest by a diversified metals producer on record,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Molycorp’s stock
rallied by the most on record after the announcement.  While Molycorp is opening a rare-earth mine in the  Mojave
Desert  to compete with Chinese producers that control more than
90 percent of global supplies, shareholders have  lost money 
since it reached an all-time high in May as prices plummeted for
the elements used in hybrid cars, fluorescent bulbs and guided
missiles. With  Neo Material (NEM) , Molycorp will gain the ability to
produce more types of magnets and increase sales to China,
boosting profitability, Byron Capital Markets Ltd. said.  “It actually makes it a stronger story,” Jonathan Hykawy,
a Toronto-based analyst at Byron Capital, said in a telephone
interview. “Molycorp effectively has the pieces of the puzzle
if this acquisition goes through to basically do the entire
magnet industry. That’s a big, big, added slice of added  cash
flow  that Molycorp really isn’t paying all that much for.”  Jim Sims, a spokesman at Molycorp, said in an e-mail that
“both sides of the transaction believed that a fair price was
achieved. We believe this transaction will provide for growth
and increased  shareholder value .”  Today’s Trading  Molycorp climbed 19 percent to $30.89 a share in New York
today, the most since going public in July 2010 and the biggest
gain in the  Russell 1000 Index. (RIY)  Neo Material surged 37 percent
to C$10.94 in Toronto.  Neo Material will get C$8.05 in cash and 0.122 of a
Molycorp share for each Neo Material share held,  Greenwood
Village , Colorado-based Molycorp said in a statement yesterday.  The offer was equal to C$11.19 a share based on yesterday’s
price, and represented a 32 percent premium to Toronto-based Neo
Material’s average in the 20 days before the deal was announced.  Relative to Neo Material’s Ebitda, the agreement was struck
at a 40 percent discount to the median multiple of 7.8 times for
acquisitions of at least $500 million made by diversified metals
producers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Molycorp, which owns a 2,222-acre site located 60 miles
southwest of  Las Vegas  that once met almost all of the world’s
demand, will get Neo Material’s processing factories.  Periodic Table  It also will obtain its patented Magnequench range of metal
powders used to make neodymium-iron-boron magnets, which can be
found in electronic motors and sensors.  The acquisition “puts the upstream and the downstream
together in a very significant way,” Molycorp Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Smith  said in a telephone interview. “This
acquisition allows Molycorp to access 100 percent of the demand
in the world now.”  The rare-earth elements are 17 chemically similar metals,
such as lanthanum, neodymium and dysprosium. They are used in
mobile devices, electric cars,  wind turbines  and targeting
systems for tanks. IPads by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM) ’s BlackBerrys,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s plug-in Volt, Raytheon
Co.’s Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Toyota Motor Corp.’s Prius
all use rare-earth metals.  In 2010, rare-earth prices soared after China, the world’s
biggest supplier of the metals, imposed a quota on exports.  Light Versus Heavy  Many “light” rare-earth elements, including lanthanum and
cerium, rose 600 percent to 700 percent on average that year,
according to Mackie Research Capital Corp.  While the surge helped Molycorp jump more than fivefold
after its initial public offering, the company lost $4 billion
in market value in the past 10 months as concern over a global
economic slowdown sapped rare-earth demand and caused companies
to cut back on components made from the elements.  China  shipped only 60 percent of its export quota last
year, Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said March 7.  While Morgan Stanley anticipates that lower prices will
drive a revival in rare-earth demand and benefit producers such
as Molycorp, Alpine Mutual Funds’ Brian Hennessey said its
greatest need is access to “heavy” rare-earth metals, which
command the highest prices.  Lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium, the
“light” rare earths, accounted for 60 percent of Molycorp’s
sales from its mine near Mountain Pass,  California , last year.  Shareholder Value  “I would not be surprised to see them acquire mines to get
them into heavy rare earth,” Hennessey, a Purchase,  New York- 
based analyst at Alpine, said yesterday before the deal was
announced. “There most likely is going to be a surplus in many
of the light rare earths that Molycorp is mining.”  Acquiring Neo Material’s processing business can still help
boost profit margins and increase the company’s value among
investors, according to Byron Capital’s Hykawy.  The $2.2 billion company traded at just 2.8 times analysts’
Ebitda estimates for 2013 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That was less than 97 percent of metals and mining
companies globally with at least $1 billion in market value.  “There’s been a lot of volatility on the name,” Scott Goginsky, a research analyst and portfolio manager at Milford,
Pennsylvania-based Biondo Investment Advisors LLC, which
oversees $450 million and owns shares of Molycorp, said in a
telephone interview before the deal was announced. “Certainly
at this price the stock is really cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
