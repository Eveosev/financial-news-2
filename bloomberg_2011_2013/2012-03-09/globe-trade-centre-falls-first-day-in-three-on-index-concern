Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC) , Poland’s
biggest property developer by market value, declined for the
first time in three day after Bank Zachodni WBK SA’s brokerage
said it may be removed the CECE Composite Index next week.  GTC tumbled as much as 7.6 percent and was 4.7 percent
lower at 7.12 zloty as of 12:15 p.m. in Warsaw.  The property developer will probably leave the index of
central European companies after the March 14 session, Zachodni
wrote in a note today.  The CECE Composite Index is a free float weighted price
index made up of the most liquid stocks traded in Budapest,
Prague and  Warsaw Stock Exchange , according to Wiener Boerse
AG’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
