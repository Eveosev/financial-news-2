Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s daily page views
rose less than 1 percent in the U.S. last month, following a
slight decline in January, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   Page views per day increased 0.3 percent in February from
the previous month, the research firm said today. In January,
the figure dropped 0.8 percent. Total U.S. visitors fell 2.9
percent to 158.7 million in February because the month was
shorter than January, ComScore said.  Facebook (FB) , the world’s largest social-networking site, is
trying to maintain growth as it prepares for an initial public
offering. Page views show how engaged users are with the service
and the potential for advertising --  Facebook ’s main source of
revenue. The site has more than 845 million members worldwide,
the company said in its IPO filing.  Daily page views rose 27 percent in February when compared
with the year-earlier month, reaching 3.66 billion. The number
of U.S. visitors climbed 5.4 percent from a year ago, Reston,
Virginia-based ComScore found.  Revenue at Facebook, based in Menlo Park,  California ,
almost doubled to $3.7 billion last year, according to its
filing. The company said it reached 179 million monthly active
users in the U.S. and Canada last quarter, up 16 percent from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
