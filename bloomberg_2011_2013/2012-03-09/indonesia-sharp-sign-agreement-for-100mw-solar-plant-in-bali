Indonesia  signed a memorandum of
understanding with  Sharp Corp. (6753)  to build a solar power plant with
a capacity of 100 megawatts on the country’s resort island of
Bali.  The plant may need an investment of $2.5 million to $3
million for each megawatt of generating capacity, Kardaya

minerals ministry, said in a press release on the ministry’s
