Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria rose
for a third day, leading Czech stocks toward the longest winning
streak in more than a month, after Greece completed its debt
swap and investors awaited the U.S. government’s jobs report.  Erste climbed 1.5 percent to 469.2 koruna as of 9:44 a.m.
in Prague, paring this week’s losses to 3 percent. The  PX (PX)  equity
index, where Erste has a 22 percent weighting, advanced 0.6
percent to 1,002.4, its third day of gains.  European stocks advanced after the Greek government said it
reached its target in the biggest sovereign restructuring in
history, with a 95.7 percent participation rate among investors.
China’s consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two
years and German exports exceeded forecasts. A U.S. report may
show that employers in the world’s largest economy added 210,000
jobs in February, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
