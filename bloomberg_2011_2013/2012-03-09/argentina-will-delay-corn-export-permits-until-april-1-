Argentina , the world’s second-
largest corn exporter, will delay granting more export permits
for the grain until April as it studies crop damage caused by a
drought, Agriculture Minister Norberto Yauhar said.  The government will issue permits on April 19 that will
surpass the 7.5 million ton allocation that has already been
granted, Yauhar told reporters in  Buenos Aires  today. A second
and final issuance of permits will take place within 60 days, he
said.  The government estimates this year’s corn harvest will
total between 21 and 22 million metric tons, Yauhar said. Rains
in January and February improved parched crops that were damaged
by a drought late last year, he said.  The downpours so far this year “may mean we get similar
yields that result in the exports we have had in previous
years,” he said.  Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  limits
exports of some food products to ensure sufficient supplies are
available in the domestic market. Argentina will need 8 million
tons of this year’s corn crop for domestic use, Yauhar said.  Yauhar also announced the government will issue export
permits for another 3.6 million tons of wheat on March 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
