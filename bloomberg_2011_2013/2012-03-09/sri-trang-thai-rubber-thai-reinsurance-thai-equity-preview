Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Thailand  trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Bangkok.  The  SET Index (SET)  fell 0.8 percent to 1,158.71, the most since
Feb. 27. The gauge dropped 0.6 percent this week, the first
decrease in 10 weeks.  Bangkok Dusit Medical Services Pcl (BGH)  , Thailand’s
biggest private-hospital operator, climbed 4.8 percent to 82.5
baht, the steepest advance since Oct. 6. The company’s stock
rating was upgraded to outperform from neutral at KGI Securities
(Thailand) Pcl., meaning that it expects the stock’s return to
exceed the average among its peers.  Indorama Ventures Pcl (IVL)  , the country’s largest
polyester producer, lost 3.1 percent to 38.75 baht, the most
since March 2. Morgan Stanley lowered its cotton estimate for
2011-12 to 90 cents a pound, from $1 a pound on “weak global
demand,”  Hussein Allidina , an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said
in a report e-mailed today. Polyester competes with cotton as a
substitute fiber in textile.  Thai Reinsurance Pcl (THRE)  , the nation’s only
reinsurer, gained 3.4 percent to 3.64 baht, halting a three-day
slide. The company may manage the government’s 50 billion baht
($1.64 billion) disaster insurance fund, Krungthep Turakij
reported, citing Pravej Ongartsittigul, secretary-general of the
Office of Insurance Commission. It’s the only insurance company
to submit a bid to manage the fund, the Thai-language newspaper
said. Pravej wasn’t immediately available for comment after a
call to his office.  Thai Vegetable Oil Pcl (TVO)  , the nation’s largest
soybean supplier, rose 1.9 percent to 21.6 baht, the highest
close since Sept. 21. Soybean futures gained as much as 0.4
percent to $13.44 a bushel in  Chicago , the highest level for the
most-active contract since Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
