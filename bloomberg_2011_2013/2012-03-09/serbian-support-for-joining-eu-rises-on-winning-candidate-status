The European Union’s approval of
 Serbia  as a candidate for membership helped recover popular
support in the country for joining the bloc.  The two-stage poll conducted a few days before and after
the EU granted the status to Serbia on March 1, showed the
support increased to 54.2 percent from 51.3 percent, while the
level of opposition fell to 31.8 percent from 33.1 percent, said
the  Center for Democracy and Development , which conducted the
survey on Feb. 20-25 and March 4-7.  The percentage of the undecided dropped to 14 percent from
15.6 percent, among the 1,550 people surveyed by telephone, the
the Novi Sad, Serbia-based non-government organization said. The
sentiment faltered last year amid controversies over which
conditions the country must meet to become a candidate.  The EU move also improved the rating of the ruling
 Democrats  of President  Boris Tadic , ahead of elections expected
in May, the poll showed. Support for the pro-Western party
increased half percentage point to 27.5 percent, whereas the
biggest opposition group, the  Serbian Progressive Party  remained
at 29 percent. No margin of error was provided.  “The positive message from Brussels brought the Democrats
a mild increase in popularity, whereas rejection would have been
a horrible blow, a much bigger drop” in the rating, said
analyst Branko Radun at the presentation of the poll in Belgrade
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
