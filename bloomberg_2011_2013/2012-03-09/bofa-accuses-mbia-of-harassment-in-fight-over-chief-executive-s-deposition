Bank of America Corp.  asked a judge
to block Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan’s deposition in
 MBIA Inc. (MBI) ’s lawsuit against the bank, accusing the bond insurer
of harassment.  MBIA’s attempt to depose Moynihan is intended to impose
“unnecessary burdens” on Bank of America and the CEO, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender argued in seeking a
protective order to block the deposition.  “We have evidence this effort to depose Brian Moynihan is
for harassment purposes,” Jonathan Rosenberg, a lawyer for the
bank, said today at a hearing in Manhattan. “It is clearly
disruptive to Bank of America’s business.”  MBIA sued Bank of America’s Countrywide Financial unit in
2008 over  mortgage loans . MBIA agreed to guarantee payments to
investors that bought securities backed by pools of the lender’s
loans, which MBIA claims didn’t live up to their promised
quality.  MBIA, based in Armonk,  New York , said in court papers that
Bank of America’s request for a protective order is
“frivolous” and called Moynihan an appropriate witness with
knowledge relevant to the company’s claims.  New York State Judge Eileen Bransten didn’t rule on the
dispute at the hearing.  The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
