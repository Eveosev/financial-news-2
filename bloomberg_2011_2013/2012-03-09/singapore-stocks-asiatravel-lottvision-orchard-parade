hotel and travel reservations, added 1.5 percent to 33 Singapore

This will generate increased demand for the company’s services,
said Boh Tuang Poh, executive chairman of Asiatravel.  LottVision Ltd. (LVIS)   jumped 15 percent to 1.5

biggest carrier by market value, slipped 0.4 percent to S$10.85.
The company offered pilots the option of taking voluntary no-pay
leave of up to two years as it currently has a surplus of first
officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
