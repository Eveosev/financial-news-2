The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars gained against the yen as global stocks rallied after a
U.S. jobs report grew more than forecast.  Demand for the so-called Aussie and kiwi was limited
against the greenback as strong U.S. employment figures dimmed
prospects for further monetary stimulus from the  Federal
Reserve , an action that would devalue the U.S. currency. The
South Pacific nations’ currencies advanced against the euro
after Greece said it would trigger an option forcing investors
to take part in its debt restructuring, spurring speculation
credit-default swaps protecting Greece’s debt will be triggered.  “The Australian dollar is strengthening on the back of
stock gains,” said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in  Tokyo  at
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s largest
currency-margin company.  Australia ’s dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to 87.37 yen as
of 11:23 a.m. in  New York . It fell 0.4 percent to $1.0597,
heading for a 1.3 percent weekly drop.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.9 percent to 67.83 yen from
yesterday, when it rallied 1.5 percent. It lost 0.2 at 82. U.S.
cents, set for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent.  The MSCI World Index Index  climbed  0.2 percent. Three years
ago today, global stocks reached a bottom amid the global
financial crisis and have since rallied about 90 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6 percent.  Economic Data  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 227,000 in February
after rising by a revised 284,000 the prior month, data from the
Labor Department showed today. The  unemployment rate  held at a
three-year low of 8.3 percent.  The report showed that U.S. job growth during the past six
months was the strongest since 2006. The median projection of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for 210,000 rise.  The Australian dollar earlier fell after  imports  outpaced
exports by A$673 million ($715 million) in January, from a
revised A$1.33 billion surplus in December, the Bureau of
Statistics said in a report in Sydney today. The median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists was for a surplus of
A$1.5 billion.  “A weak number, and it’s putting some downward pressure on
the Australian dollar,” said Greg Gibbs, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney.  Greece  said the participation rate in its swap of
government debt for new securities will reach 95.7 percent with
the activation of a so-called collective action clause, a move
that could prove to be ruled a default.  To contact the reporters on this story:
