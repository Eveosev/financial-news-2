MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Rwandan unit lost
market share in the fourth quarter to its main competitor, Tigo
Rwanda, the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency said.  MTN Rwanda’s share stood at 65 percent compared with 72
percent a year earlier, while Tigo’s grew to 35 percent from 19
percent, the Kigali-based regulator said in a report yesterday.
MTN had 2.89 million subscribers in the East African country as
of December, while Tigo had 1.55 million, it said.  “Our affordable tariff structure has clearly played a major
part in this achievement,” Tigo Chief Executive Officer Diego
Camberos said in a phone interview yesterday. MTN Rwanda Chief
Marketing Officer Yvonne Makolo didn’t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment.  Rwanda’s mobile-phone penetration rate may increase to 60
percent this year after  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  begins operating in
the East African country, the regulator said in January. The
proportion of the Rwandan population with a mobile phone rose to
41.6 percent in December from 41.3 percent in November.  MTN Rwanda began operations in 1998, while Tigo, which is
owned by Luxembourg-based  Millicom International Cellular SA (MICC) ,
obtained its license in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
