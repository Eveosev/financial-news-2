Emerging-market stock funds took in
$907 million in the week ended March 7, the 10th week of inflows
and the longest run of gains since 2010, according to EPFR
Global.  Inflows were lured as an easing in tensions with  Iran 
outweighed the prospect of slower growth in  China , according to
EPFR. Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $22.6 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $19.6
billion for the same period of 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net inflow for the week of $1.3 billion, the data show.
Asian funds excluding  Japan  recorded a net outflow of $418
million,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-
mail today.  China cuts its economic growth target to 7.5 percent on
March 5, from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005.  Russia equity funds posted their sixth consecutive week of
net inflows of more than $100 million. The funds brought in $121
million for the week that included the election of Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  as president.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 3.1
percent loss for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 13.05
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $1.37
billion, the second-largest weekly total for the year, Brandt
said. The largest was $2.14 billion of inflows in the week ended
Feb. 8, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
