The yuan strengthened the most in a
month as  Greece  moved closer to completing its sovereign debt
restructuring and a government inflation report suggested  China 
has room to support growth in the economy.  Consumer prices  climbed 3.2 percent in February from a year
earlier, lower than a 3.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists and the 4.5 percent increase in January.
Private investors agreed to swap about 85 percent of their Greek
 government bonds  for new securities in a deal that closed
yesterday, according to a banker briefed on the results. The
People’s Bank of China raised the yuan’s  reference rate  by 0.26
percent, the most since Oct. 28, to 6.3073 today.  “Easing inflation is good news for China’s economy as it
means more room for policy easing,” said  Daniel Chan , chief
economist at BWC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “The
expectations that Greece could restructure its debt lifted the
yuan today. However, the yuan remains sluggish this year,
showing how cautious the central bank is on global outlook.”  The yuan rose 0.09 percent, the most since Feb. 8, to close
at 6.3107 per dollar in Shanghai, limiting this week’s loss to
0.2 percent, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either
side of the daily fixing.  Offshore Rates  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
used to price options, rose 45 basis points this week to 2.1
percent, after PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the nation may
“appropriately” widen the yuan’s trading band.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.04
percent to 6.3040. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were
little changed at 6.2958 today, a 0.24 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts declined 0.2 percent this week.  The yuan will keep rising 3 percent to 5 percent in the
next couple of years, said  Stephen Roach , a professor at  Yale
University  and the former non-executive chairman for Morgan
Stanley in Asia. The currency fell 0.3 percent this year, after
advancing 4.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
