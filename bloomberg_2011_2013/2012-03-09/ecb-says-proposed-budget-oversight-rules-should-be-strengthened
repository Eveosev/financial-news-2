The  European Central Bank  said draft
regulations aimed at strengthening budget discipline in the euro
area should be toughened.  “The ECB welcomes the proposed regulations and recommends
some amendments aimed at further strengthening the budgetary
discipline of the euro-area member states,” the Frankfurt-based
ECB says in a  legal opinion  published on  its website . The
amendments also aim at “further enhancing the surveillance of
the euro-area member states experiencing or threatened with
serious difficulties with respect to their financial
stability.”  In the aftermath of a fiscal crisis that’s seen  Greece 
undertake the largest restructuring in history, euro-area
leaders are attempting to shore up faith in their budgetary
discipline. A so-called fiscal compact agreed on Jan. 30
requires balanced-budget rules and speeds sanctions on countries
exceeding deficit limits.  The ECB opinion says euro-area member states should submit
draft budget and medium-term fiscal plans to the European
Commission.  In turn, the commission should be able to “issue an
opinion where the draft budgetary plan would lead to non-
compliance with the budgetary policy obligations laid down in
the Stability and Growth Pact and a structural deficit higher
than that foreseen,” the ECB says.  To strengthen oversight of fiscal developments in member
states, the ECB says the commission should be free to decide to
subject a country to “enhanced surveillance,” even if the
country isn’t receiving financial support, and that the European
Systemic Risk Board should be informed of the results of that
surveillance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
