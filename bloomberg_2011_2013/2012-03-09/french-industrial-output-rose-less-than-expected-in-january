French industrial production rose
less than expected in January, after a steep decline at the end
of last year.  Output at factories, mines and utilities  rose 0.3 percent,
after dropping a revised 1.3 percent in December, Insee, the
national statistics office in Paris, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Economists had forecast an increase of 0.5 percent,
according to the median of 22 estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  December’s drop had initially been reported as 1.4 percent.  Manufacturing production, which excludes utilities, rose
0.2 percent in January after falling 1.3 percent in December.
December’s decline was also revised from 1.4 percent in the
initial report a month ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
