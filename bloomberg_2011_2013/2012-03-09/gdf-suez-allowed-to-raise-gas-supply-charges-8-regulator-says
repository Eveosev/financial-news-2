A unit of  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , operator of
 Europe ’s biggest natural-gas network, will be allowed to raise
fees for distributing the fuel by 8 percent, the regulator said.  The increase by the GRDF unit, which sought an 18.4 percent
jump, is applicable from July 1 and takes into account a drop in
2011 volumes and bolstering of network security,  Commission de
Regulation de l’Energie  said in a ruling on its  website.   It works out to a 2 percent increase in regulated rates for
consumers using the fuel for home heating, said the regulator,
which also oversees power charges. For the years to 2015, it
will allow increases of 0.2 percentage points above inflation.  The gas rate, reviewed every four years, was increased by
5.6 percent from July 1, 2008.  GDF Suez, the monopoly for household gas supply in  France 
until July 2007, plans to cut its share of profit from Europe
amid the region’s debt crisis, curbs on French regulated tariffs
and Belgian taxes on nuclear power. The company is seeking to
double sales of liquefied natural gas to emerging markets by
2020 as it expands into faster-growing economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
