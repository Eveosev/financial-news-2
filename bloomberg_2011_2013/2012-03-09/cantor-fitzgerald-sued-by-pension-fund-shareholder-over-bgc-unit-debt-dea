Cantor Fitzgerald  LP was sued by a
pension fund investor in its BGC Partners unit over debt and
stock offerings that it claims enriched Cantor’s Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Lutnick  at the expense of shareholders.  International Painters and Allied Trades Industry Pension
Fund said that the company made a $150 million debt transaction
at an “unfair interest rate” that diluted the shareholders’
stock, according to a complaint filed today in New York State
Supreme Court.  BGCP (BGCP) , then known as eSpeed Inc., was spun off as a public
company by Cantor in 1999. After a merger in 2008, the company
became BGC partners. The $150 million debt deal was made at the
time of the merger at a 5.19 percent  interest rate . That debt
was later replaced by notes at an 8.79 percent rate that could
be converted into stock, thus diluting the shares, according to
the complaint.  Cantor owns 56 percent of BGC Partners’ Class A stock and
100 percent of its Class B shares, according to the suit. BGCP
is an electronic brokerage company based in New York.  The complaint also names Cantor directors Stephen Curwood,
John Dalton, Barry Sloane and Albert Weis as defendants.  Sandra Lee, a spokeswoman for New York-based Cantor, didn’t
immediately reply to messages seeking comment on the suit.  The case is International Painters and Allied Trades
Industry Pension Fund v. Cantor Fitzgerald LP, 650736-2012,
 Supreme Court  of the State of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
