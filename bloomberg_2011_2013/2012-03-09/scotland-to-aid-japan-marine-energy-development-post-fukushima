Scotland  will help  Japan  develop
marine energy as the nation seeks to find alternatives to
nuclear power following the accident at the Fukushima atomic
plant a year ago.  Scotland’s European Marine Energy Center Ltd. signed an
agreement with the Ocean Energy Association of Japan to help set
up Japan’s first marine energy test center, EMEC said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The facility, called the Japanese Marine Energy Center,
will develop new energy sources. Japan’s  Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7012)  said last year that it plans to test tidal
energy technology at the Orkney-based EMEC.  The EMEC is a test facility for devices that harness the
power of waves and tides. It was set up in 2003 with 30 million
pounds ($47 million) of funding including from the U.K and
Scottish governments as well as the European Union. The Orkney
institution could provide advice and support on the design and
operation of the Japanese center, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
