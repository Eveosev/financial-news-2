Taiwan ’s dollar advanced for a
second straight day after international investors added to
holdings of the island’s assets.  Government bonds  declined.  Global funds bought $83 million more Taiwanese shares than
they sold today, exchange data showed.  Stock indexes  jumped
across  Asia  after private investors agreed to swap about 96
percent of their Greek government bonds for new securities,
according to a banker briefed on the results.  “Risk-taking sentiment prevails today after the good news
on Greece,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.504 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency weakened 0.2 percent this week. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of price swings that options traders use,
dropped six basis points to 4.64 percent today.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 rose one basis point to 1.264 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market showed. The rate was little changed this week.  “The movement in yields will be limited as the central
bank may keep  interest rates  unchanged for the rest of the
year.”  The central bank, which next reviews monetary policy on
March 22, left its benchmark rate at 1.875 percent on Dec. 29.  The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed today
and from last week at 0.399 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
