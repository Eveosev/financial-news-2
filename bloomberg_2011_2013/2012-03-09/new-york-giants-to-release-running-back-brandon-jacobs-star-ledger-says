The  New York Giants  will release
 Brandon Jacobs  after the National Football League’s Super Bowl
champions failed to reach an agreement with the running back on
a pay cut, the  Star-Ledger  of Newark, New Jersey, reported.  The Giants last month asked the 29-year-old to reduce his
scheduled $4.9 million compensation, the newspaper said, citing
a person familiar with the transaction who asked not to be
identified because the team hasn’t announced it.  Jacobs, the NFL team’s fourth-round draft-pick in 2005,
leaves with 4,849 yards and 56 touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
