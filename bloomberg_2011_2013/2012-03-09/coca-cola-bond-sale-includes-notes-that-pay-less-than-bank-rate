Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  sold $2.75 billion of
bonds, including short-term notes that pay less interest than an
interbank lending benchmark, taking advantage of corporate
borrowing costs that are near the lowest on record.  The world’s largest soft-drink maker issued $1 billion each
of two- and three-year notes today, as well as $750 million of
six-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
two-year notes pay a floating rate that’s five basis points less
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, the first
time a U.S. company paid less than the measure in over a month.  Coca-Cola’s three-year notes have a 0.75 percent coupon,
while the six-year notes pay 1.65 percent a year, Bloomberg data
show. Libor was set at 0.474 percent today.  Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, is taking advantage of
increasing investor demand for highly rated debt to reduce its
borrowing costs. The average yield on investment-grade bonds was
3.45 percent yesterday, near the record low of 3.4 percent
reached on March 2, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  The soft-drink producer is following competitor PepsiCo
Inc. to the  bond market . Last month, Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo paid the least interest it ever had on a three-part bond
sale, issuing $750 million of 0.75 percent notes due in March
2015, $1.25 billion of 2.75 percent securities maturing in March
2022 and $750 million of 4 percent, 30-year bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  On Feb. 1,  Procter & Gamble Co . issued $1 billion of
floating rate notes that pay 8 basis points less than Libor,
which is the rate banks say they charge to lend to each other.
It was the first to pay less than Libor since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
