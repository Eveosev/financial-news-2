The pound fell for the first time in
three days against the dollar after  Greece  forced investors to
take losses on holdings of the nation’s bonds, damping demand
for assets linked to European growth.  Two-year note yields headed for a second weekly advance as
a report showed U.S. payrolls rose more than economists
estimated in February. The euro fell after Greece invoked powers
known as collective action clauses to boost investor
participation in its government bond swap.  “The euro is encountering some profit taking and the pound
is just matching that euro softness,” said Michael Derks, chief
strategist at FXPro Financial Services Ltd. in London. “A good
result from Greece had been priced in.”  The pound fell 1 percent to $1.5677 at 5:05 p.m.  London 
time and headed for a 1 percent weekly decline. Sterling was 0.3
percent stronger at 83.62 pence per euro. The 17-nation common
European currency was 1.3 percent weaker at $1.3107.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association  is due
to rule whether a “potential  credit event ” occurred relating
to Greece, following the results of the nation’s private-sector
involvement plan. Determining that it constitutes a
restructuring credit event would cause a payout of swaps
insuring the securities Greek government bonds  Key Resistance  The pound may fall to $1.5645 if it fails to rise through a
key resistance level, according to Fabien Manac’h, a technical
analyst at Societe Generale SA in Paris, citing trading
patterns.  “We expect the $1.5880-$1.5885 resistance zone to contain
any other upward attempt and force pound-dollar to head south
again,” he wrote in a note to clients.  The $1.5880-$1.5885 level represents the so-called long-
term resistance line, Manac’h wrote. A resistance level refers
to an area on a chart where analysts anticipate sell orders are
clustered.  Sterling has dropped 1.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar weakened 2.1 percent and
the euro fell 0.8 percent.  Two-year U.K. government notes were little changed after a
report showed the U.S. created 227,000 jobs in February. The
median projection in a Bloomberg News survey called for a
210,000 rise.  The yield on the security maturing in March 2014 was at
0.44 percent, up from 0.39 percent a week earlier.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries have
dropped 0.5 percent and German  government bonds  have gained 0.3
percent.  The 10-year gilt yield, at 2.15 percent today, has fallen
from 3.13 percent on March 9, 2009, when the global  bull market 
in equities began. The pound has gained 11 percent against the
dollar and euro in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
