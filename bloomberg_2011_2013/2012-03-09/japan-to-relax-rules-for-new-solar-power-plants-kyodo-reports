Japanese Trade and Industry Minister
 Yukio Edano  plans to ease regulations governing the construction
of solar-power plants,  Kyodo News  reported.  His ministry will consider exempting facilities from the
Factory Location Act, which requires operators to inform local
governments of plans for new projects and plant trees at sites,
Kyodo said, citing Edano.  Japan  is introducing a feed-in tariff, an above-market rate
for clean energy, in July. In January, a  revision  of the act
increased the area that solar plants can occupy on any given
site to 75 percent of the total from 50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
