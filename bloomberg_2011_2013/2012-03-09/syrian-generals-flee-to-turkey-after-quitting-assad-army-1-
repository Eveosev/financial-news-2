Four Syrian generals fled to refugee
camps in  Turkey  after defecting from President Bashar al-Assad’s
military amid an increase in the number of people crossing the
border to escape yearlong violence.  At least 234 people, including the generals as well as two
colonels, a lieutenant colonel and two sergeants, arrived in the
southern Hatay province’s Reyhanli district, Turkey’s state-run
Anatolia news agency reported, citing local governor Yusuf Guler
and people it didn’t identify. There are more than 10,000
Syrians in camps set up by the Red Crescent in Hatay by the
border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
