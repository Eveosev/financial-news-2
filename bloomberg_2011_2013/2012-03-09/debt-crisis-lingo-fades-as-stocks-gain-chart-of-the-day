Investors have rediscovered their
appetite for stocks at the same pace as the media has lost its
enthusiasm for writing about the euro area’s debt crisis.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows in blue the word count for
“debt crisis” from news feeds on the Bloomberg since March
2011. The red line tracks the inverse performance of the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index of the euro area’s biggest stocks.  “Market sentiment has shifted to say the glass is
potentially not half empty, but actually half full,” said
Mouhammed Choukeir, who helps oversee $8.1 billion as chief
investment officer at  Kleinwort Benson  in  London . “The market
is less concerned by the euro-zone crisis and is much more
focused around growth. That is what we characterize as the
animal spirits of the market.”  The Euro Stoxx 50 slumped 17 percent in 2011 as bailouts
for  Greece  and  Portugal  triggered speculation that other
countries in the 17-nation currency area would struggle to pay
back their debt. Greece said today that private creditors
holding 85.8 percent of eligible bonds will take part in the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
