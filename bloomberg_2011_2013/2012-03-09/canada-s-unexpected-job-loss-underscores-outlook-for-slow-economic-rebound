Reports of declines in  Canada ’s job
market and exports underscore that the country’s economic
recovery may be a slow one.  Employment fell by 2,800 in February, the third drop in
five months and one that wasn’t anticipated by any of the 25
economists in a Bloomberg News  survey . Some 37,900 people left
the workforce in the month, the largest drop since January 2009.
Statistics Canada also reported the merchandise trade  surplus 
narrowed to C$2.10 billion ($2.11 billion) from a revised C$2.86
billion in December as exports fell by the most in 11 months.  Job growth has been  slowing  since the middle of last year
after hiring gains led the economy out of a recession in 2009.
Yesterday, the  Bank of Canada  kept its key  interest rate  at 1
percent in the longest pause since the 1950s and said there are
some signs of improving domestic spending and diminished risks
from the global financial crisis.  “It’s going to be a slow process, even though we see
sentiment recovering a bit,” said  Jimmy Jean , a strategist in
the fixed-income group at Desjardins Capital Markets in
 Montreal . “In terms of the domestic picture that the Bank of
Canada referred to as being a little bit firmer, these reports
could be a disappointment.”  The drop in the number of people in the  labor force  drove a
decline in the  jobless rate  to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent,
 Statistics Canada  reported from Ottawa.  Waiting for Developments  “The employment data I find most disappointing, it’s six
months we’ve been waiting for more positive developments,” Jean
said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast an
increase of 15,000 jobs and a 7.6 percent unemployment rate.  The U.S. today reported its best six-month job streak since
2006, with a non-farm payrolls gain of 227,000 in February.  The Canadian dollar was little changed from yesterday at
99.01 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 3:37 p.m. in Toronto, erasing
earlier losses after the U.S. figures were released. One
Canadian dollar purchases $1.0100. Yields on two-year Canadian
 government bonds  increased 1 basis point to 1.18 percent.  By industry, retailing and wholesaling led the job decline
with a 37,400 decrease, followed by a 21,900 drop for
transportation and warehousing, Statistics Canada said. Health
care and social assistance fell 21,700 while public
administration declined by 14,700.  Young workers, defined as those aged from 15 to 24,
accounted for almost all of the lost jobs in February, with a
decline of 26,800. Men older than 24 gained 25,800 jobs, while
women in that age group lost 1,700, Statistics Canada said.
Youth unemployment rose to 14.7 percent from 14.5 percent.  ‘Temper Expectations’  “All told, a disappointment,” said  Avery Shenfeld , Chief
Economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto,
“and one that will temper expectations after yesterday’s
statement that the Bank of Canada is moving towards hiking rates
sooner rather than later.”  Employment in finance, insurance real estate and leasing
rose by 41,200 in February, recouping half the industry’s losses
over the previous five months. Construction rose by 14,000 and
natural resources gained 6,800, capping a 10.2 percent gain over
the past year, the fastest of any industry.  Atco Ltd. said March 5 it won its largest-ever Canadian
contract to build housing for a natural resources project, a
2,586-person lodge for  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Jansen potash site in
Saskatchewan.  ‘Gradual Recovery Coming’  “There is a gradual recovery coming,” Terry Carr, head of
Canadian fixed income at Manulife Asset Management Ltd. in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview yesterday. He helps
oversee about C$16 billion in Canadian fixed-income assets.
“The Bank of Canada is ‘‘unlikely to do anything until the Fed
shows its hand.’’  Federal Reserve policy makers said they expect to keep U.S.
interest rates low through at least late 2014.  Canada’s central bank yesterday said that first-quarter
growth may exceed its January forecast of a 1.8 percent
annualized expansion due to temporary factors it didn’t specify.
It has forecast growth of 2 percent for this year, with
consumption being tempered by exports as the strong dollar hurts
competitiveness.  ‘‘While today’s jobs report is disappointing overall,
nevertheless, I would point out there are some positive elements
that I think shouldn’t be ignored,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper told reporters in Toronto today. “We’re seeing a trend
of the number of full-time jobs continuing to increase,”  Budget Measures  “There will be a lot of measures in the budget to create
jobs and to get us on a long-term, sustainable track,” Harper
said. The fiscal plan is due March 29.  Canada added 220,200  full-time jobs  from January to
September of last year and since then the total has declined by
40,700 to about 14.06 million.  Today’s trade report showed  exports  fell 2.3 percent to
C$41.4 billion, as industrial goods fell 11.9 percent to C$9.26
billion and machinery and equipment declined by the same
percentage to C$6.63 billion.  Imports (CATBTOTI)  dropped 0.6 percent in January to C$39.3 billion.
Industrial goods fell 3.8 percent to C$8.24 billion and energy
declined 5.9 percent to C$4.20 billion.  “It’s a breather after a couple of fantastic months,”
said  Peter Hall , chief economist at  Export Development Canada ,
by telephone. “This kind of thing was due to happen.”  The  trade surplus  was the third straight and marked the
longest string since November 2008.  Today’s release is the last time the jobs report will be
published at 7 a.m. in Ottawa. Beginning next month, Statistics
Canada will release all indicators at 8:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
