Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
largest independent U.S. oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, rose after announcing an Algerian tax settlement that
will increase revenue by $1.8 billion in the first year.  Anadarko climbed 1.9 percent to $85.25 at the close in  New
York .  The company values the settlement at $4.4 billion,
including revisions to its production-sharing agreement and tax
liability, spokesman  John Christiansen  said in a telephone
interview today.  The agreement with Sonatrach, Algeria’s state-run oil
producer, increases Anadarko’s share of crude from Algerian
wells and extends the production-sharing agreement to 25 years,
according to a statement today.  “We are very pleased to have reached a fair and balanced
resolution that will return significant value to Anadarko,” Al
Walker, chief operating officer of The Woodlands, Texas-based
company, said in the statement.  The value of the revised profit-sharing agreement and the
tax settlement is $2.6 billion, in addition to the increased
crude share the first year, Christiansen said.  Subject to government approval that is expected within four
months, the agreement will also lower payments under  Algeria ’s
2006 exceptional-profits tax, the source of the dispute, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
