Asian  stocks  fell this week, with
the regional benchmark index snapping its longest-ever weekly
winning streak, after  China  cut its economic growth target.
Shares pared losses in the last two days as  Greece  clinched a
debt-swap deal seen as key to containing  Europe ’s crisis.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s
biggest lender by market value, fell 5.7 percent in  Hong Kong .
 Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  declined 11 percent after the
mainland developer’s profit missed estimates. Rio Tinto Group,
the third-largest global miner, fell 2.7 percent in Sydney after
metals prices declined. Nintendo Co., a Japanese maker of game
consoles that depends on Europe for a third of its sales, pared
losses to finish the week down 1.1 percent.  “Asia is all about moderation now,” said  Andrew Pease ,
Sydney-based chief Asia-Pacific investment strategist at Russell
Investment Group, which manages about $150 billion. “While the
risk of financial Armageddon in Europe is gone, Europe is still
going to have a large recession. Europe is China’s biggest
export market. That tempers optimism on how much the risk rally
can continue.”  MSCI Slides  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 1 percent to 126.90 this
week, ending an 11-week winning streak. The measure entered a
bull market on Feb. 29, gaining more than 20 percent from an Oct.
5 low, after U.S. economic optimism and monetary easing in
Europe,  Japan  and China fueled the fastest rally in more than
two years.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  has surged 91 percent from
a low reached on March 9, 2009, amid deepening global recession.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 1.6 percent this
week, extending its rally this year as a weaker yen boosted the
outlook for exporters. The gauge also climbed after a report
showed Japan’s economy contracted less than initially estimated
in the fourth quarter. The index yesterday surged above 10,000
for the first time since Aug. 1. Tomorrow marks the one-year

gained 3.2 percent to 3,420 yen.  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , an electronic
equipment maker that gets almost half its revenue outside Japan,
increased 1.9 percent to 475 yen.  China Cuts Growth  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent after China
trimmed its economic growth target to 7.5 percent from an 8
percent goal in place since 2005. Separately, the nation’s
inflation eased to the slowest pace in 20 months in February, a
report showed yesterday.  ICBC dropped 5.7 percent this week to HK$5.30 in Hong Kong.
Agile Property slumped 11 percent to HK$9.15 after reporting
full-year net income of 4.11 billion yuan ($652 million),
missing the median analyst estimate of 4.39 billion yuan.  “The market is digesting its gains over the past few
months and consolidating,” said Khiem Do, the Hong Kong-based
head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management
(Asia) Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. “China is
slowing down and the U.S. is growing, but at a modest pace.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.2 percent. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies declined 4.1
percent. The city’s stock exchange shortened its lunch break by
30 minutes to an hour this week.  Kospi Falls  South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.8 percent as the central

previous three months, half the pace economists estimated.  Rio Tinto slumped 2.7 percent to A$64.13 this week in

retreated 2.8 percent to A$34.71. The London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial commodities including copper
and aluminum lost 3.6 percent in the four days through March 8
on concern that slower growth in China will hurt demand.  Asian shares pared losses in the latter half of the week
amid speculation Greece would strike a deal with creditors. The
government yesterday said it reached its target in the biggest
sovereign restructuring in history, with a 95.7 percent
participation rate among investors.  Nintendo finished the week down 1.1 percent to 11,680 yen
in Osaka after recovering from a decline of as much as 5.3
percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as
its biggest market, dropped 3.8 percent to HK$18.52 in Hong Kong.  “We are seeing a correction after a rapid rally,” said
Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust
& Banking Co. “The market will remain sensitive to European
news flow.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
