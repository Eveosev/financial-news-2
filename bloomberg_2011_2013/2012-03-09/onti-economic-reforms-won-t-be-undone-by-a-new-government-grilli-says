Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
overhaul of the Italian economy won’t be undone should a new
government take over after elections next year, Deputy Finance
Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said.  “It’s not that the things we are doing are new things or
unexpected things,” he said in an interview in  Rome  today with
Bloomberg Television. “I think the political parties knew that
these were necessary things, but there was not sufficient
biparitsan cooperation, so this is the change. This government
has had a wide bipartisan support to put in place things that
everyone knows were necessary and I don’t think whoever comes
into power will have any incentive” to undo them.  Once the government passes changes to labor-market rules
expected later this month, the administration will turn
attention to implementing the changes already adopted, including
measures to reduce bureaucracy, fight tax evasion and open up
closed professions to spur competition and growth, he said.  Grilli said that the government hasn’t abandoned its
strategy of trying to lengthen the maturity of its outstanding
debt, the second-biggest in  Europe , by selling bonds with
maturities of more than 10 years.  “Here we want to be tactical,” he said. “Our strategy
has always been to lengthen our average maturity and duration
but given the fragility of the markets, we don’t want to go
against the wind.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
