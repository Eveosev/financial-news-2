Poland  blocked a planned European
Union declaration on climate policy for the second time in nine
months, highlighting the difficulty that the EU faces in
deepening emission reductions and bolstering carbon-dioxide
prices.  The Polish government, flexing its weight at a meeting of
European environment ministers today in Brussels, vetoed a
political statement on the path for the EU to meet a political
goal of cutting greenhouse gases including CO2 by at least 80
percent in 2050. Conclusions after EU ministerial meetings,
which often lead to new legislation, require unanimous support.  Denmark , current holder of the 27-nation EU’s rotating
presidency, announced the result after seeking support from all
member countries for the cheapest potential emission-reduction
targets identified by the European Commission. The commission,
the EU’s regulatory arm, said in a strategy paper last year that
the best scenario for  Europe  would be to cut emissions by 40
percent in 2030 and 60 percent in 2040 compared with 1990
levels.  The EU is already on track to meet its binding goal of
lowering discharges of  greenhouse gases  by 20 percent in 2020.
The bloc may exceed this target and reduce emissions by 25
percent as long as nations step up energy savings, the
commission said in the paper, known as the 2050 low-carbon road
map.  Poland, which relies on coal for about 90 percent of its
electricity generation and blocked an EU declaration on climate
policies in June last year, has repeatedly said it would oppose
any more stringent climate policies than those already agreed.
Poland also opposes any decisions on post-2020 goals before
Europe gets more clarity on a global emissions-reduction deal
that countries worldwide agreed to achieve by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
