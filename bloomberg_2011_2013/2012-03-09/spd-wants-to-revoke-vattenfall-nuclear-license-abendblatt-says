The Social Democrats and the  Green
Party  in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein said they’ll
exploit all legal possibilities to revoke Vattenfall AB’s
operating license for the closed Brunsbuettel and Kruemmel
nuclear reactors if they win a state election in in May,
 Hamburger Abendblatt  reported.  The decision follows an incident in which damaged
containers with atomic waste were found at Brunsbuettel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
