International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said today that she plans to
recommend 28 billion euros ($36.7 billion) in financial aid for
Greece to support that country’s “ambitious economic program
over the next four years.”  The 28 billion euros that Lagarde is proposing includes 9.7
billion euros that remained from a previous support package
approved in May 2010, the IMF said in an e-mailed statement
today. The entire 28 billion euros will need to be approved by
the IMF executive board.  “Restoring competitiveness and a sustainable fiscal
position will require Greece to undertake sustained and deep
structural reforms over a prolonged period,” Lagarde said in a
separate statement in  Washington . “The scale and length of the
fund’s support is a reflection of our determination to remain
engaged.”  Greece  pushed through the biggest sovereign restructuring
in history after getting private investors to forgive more than
100 billion euros of debt, opening the way for the second
bailout.  Euro-region finance ministers agreed that with the swap
Greece had met the terms for a 130 billion-euro rescue package
arranged with the IMF. Ministers freed up 35.5 billion euros in
payments and interest for bondholders, with a decision on the
balance of the bailout funds to be made at a March 12 meeting in
Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
