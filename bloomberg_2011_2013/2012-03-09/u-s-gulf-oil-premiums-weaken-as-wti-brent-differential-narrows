Premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet
and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oils weakened after the difference
between West Texas Intermediate and Brent narrowed for the first
time this week.  Brent’s premium to WTI based on April futures contracts
narrowed 28 cents to $18.58 a barrel. When Brent decreases
versus WTI, it weakens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that
compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to WTI narrowed $1 to
$19.25 a barrel at 4:08 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  weakened $1 to a
premium of $21.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI lost 70 cents to $18.80 and
 Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  decreased 50 cents to a premium of $14.80. Poseidon’s
premium narrowed 85 cents to $13.90. Southern Green Canyon’s
gained 50 cents to $15 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 20 cents to $4.50 a
barrel.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  weakened 75 cents to $35.75 below
WTI. The discount for Bakken oil narrowed $4 to $18 a barrel.
The discount for Syncrude widened $2.50 to $16 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
