Japan ’s government plans to use
money earned from investing the nation’s currency reserves to
repay short-term debt tied to foreign-exchange operations,
according to a bill approved by the Cabinet today.  Proposed legislation taking effect April 2013 will
authorize using the cash to pay off financing bills, such as
those sold to fund currency interventions. Since April 2011,
temporary approvals have allowed such transactions, and a law
would set up a permanent mechanism. The bills are also used to
generate yen when the government wants to lend money from the
foreign-exchange account.  Management of the nation’s finances is under scrutiny as
the government seeks to weaken the yen and support a recovery
from last year’s earthquake without swelling the world's 
biggest public debt burden. Standard and Poor’s said last 
month that another downgrade of the nation’s AA- debt 
ranking is likely if medium-term growth prospects worsen.  Japan had 20.6 trillion yen ($253 billion) of profits in
its foreign-exchange reserve account from investments of the
currency holdings as of March last year, according to the
 finance ministry . At the end of last year, outstanding financing
bills, which are of three, six and 12-month maturities, stood at
123.8 trillion yen, the government says.  To contact the reporters on this story:
