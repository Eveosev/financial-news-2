Bubba Watson has a one-shot lead
over  Justin Rose  as he enters the third round of the Cadillac
Championship, the second  World Golf Championships  event of the
year.  Watson shot a 10-under-par yesterday at the TPC Blue
Monster Course in Doral, Florida. The American had an eagle,
nine birdies and one bogey to finish 12-under par for two
rounds, a stroke ahead of Rose, an Englishman who shot 8-under
today playing alongside Watson.  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy, playing his first event as
the leader of the  Official World Golf Ranking , was 3-under
yesterday and 2-under for the tournament, which doesn’t have a
halfway cut to play on the weekend.  Tiger Woods followed his even-par round two days ago with a
bogey-free 5-under 67 yesterday, leaving the former top-ranked
golfer seven strokes off the lead.  Adam Scott  of Australia, ended the second round at 10-
under; Peter Hanson of Sweden was 9-under; and Thomas Bjorn of
Denmark and Keegan Bradley of the U.S. completed play at 8-
under, while Charl Schwartzel of South Africa,  Martin Kaymer  of
 Germany  and Charles Howell III of the U.S. were at 7-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
