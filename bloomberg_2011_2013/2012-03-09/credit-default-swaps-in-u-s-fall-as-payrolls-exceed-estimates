A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk dropped for a third day as job gains topped
estimates, reinforcing confidence in the pace of economic
growth.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell 0.3 basis point to 95.75
basis points at 4:59 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group
Ltd.  Employers boosted jobs more than forecast in February, with
the 227,000 increase in payrolls exceeding the median projection
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey which called for a
210,000 rise.  Greece  pushed through the biggest sovereign
restructuring in history, easing concern that  Europe â€™s fiscal
crisis may spread, while industry group the International Swaps
& Derivatives Association ruled the event will trigger payouts
on about $3 billion in default insurance.  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has declined since
touching 98.3 basis points on March 6, the highest level since
Feb. 22, according to Markit.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
