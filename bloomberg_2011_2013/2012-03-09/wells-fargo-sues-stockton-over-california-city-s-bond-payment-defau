Stockton (3654MF) ,  California , trying to
avert becoming the biggest U.S. city in bankruptcy, was sued by
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  for failure to make payments on $32.8 million
in bonds for parking garages.  Stockton, 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of San Francisco,
missed a $779,935 payment due Feb. 25 on the revenue bonds
issued in 2004, the bank said in documents filed March 7 in San
Joaquin County Superior Court.  The Stockton City Council voted Feb. 28 to default on about
$2 million in bond payments and pursue negotiations with
creditors under a new state law aimed at preventing municipal
bankruptcy filings. The farming center of 292,000 has struggled
under mounting retiree health-care costs, dwindling tax revenue
and accounting errors.  “The parking structures bring in revenue to the city,”
City Council member Dale Fritchen said today in a telephone
interview. “It doesn’t make any sense as to why we would
default on those properties that we are making money on.”  A Stockton parking-revenue bond sold in June 2004 and
maturing in September 2014 traded Feb. 29 at an average yield of
5.31 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The action taken by the creditor was not unanticipated,”
a Stockton spokeswoman, Connie Cochran, said by e-mail. She
declined to comment further.  Wells Fargo said in its complaint that it was acting in its
capacity as indenture trustee for the bonds issued by the
Stockton Public Finance Authority.  The case is Wells Fargo Bank, National Association v. City
of Stockton, 2012-00277662, Superior Court of San Joaquin County
(Stockton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
