Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
awarded Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester 1.6 million
pounds ($2.5 million) of shares under a long-term incentive
plan, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  He would only receive the stock in 2015 subject to how the
bank performs in the meantime, said the person, who declined to
be identified before a public announcement.  Hester in January waived his 963,000-pound bonus for 2011
after the U.K.â€™s opposition  Labour Party  said it would ask
Parliament to vote on the award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
