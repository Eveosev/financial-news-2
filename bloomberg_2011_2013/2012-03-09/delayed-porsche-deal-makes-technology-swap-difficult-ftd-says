Michael Macht,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
production chief, said the delay of the carmaker’s planned
takeover of Porsche AG is making the exchange of technologies
between the two companies more difficult,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported today, citing an interview with Macht.  An integration of Porsche into the Volkswagen group will
lead to better utilization of the two companies’ plants and more
flexibility in their production, Macht said, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
