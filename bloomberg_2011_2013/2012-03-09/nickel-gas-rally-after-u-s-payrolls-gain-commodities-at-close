The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose to the highest level in six days,
increasing 0.6 percent to 707.22 at 4:07 p.m. in  New York , after
U.S. payrolls gained more than forecast, boosting the outlook
for economic growth. Nickel, natural gas and copper led the
gain.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices advanced for a
third day, by 0.7 percent to 1632.259 at 4:19 p.m. in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper gained the most in two weeks on speculation that
China, the world’s biggest metals user, will take steps to boost
growth and on signs the  U.S. economy  is improving.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of equities climbed as much as
1.4 percent on bets that Chinese authorities will act to
stimulate growth after reports showed lower-than-expected
industrial output and slowing inflation. U.S employers boosted
payrolls by 227,000 last month, topping economists’ median
projection of 210,000. Copper has jumped 12 percent this year.  Copper futures for May delivery gained 1.8 percent to

three days on speculation that prices near the lowest since 2002
will bring buyers into the market.  Gas gained 2.3 percent after settling at 10-year lows the
past two days. The futures have traded between $2.25 and $2.81
per million British thermal units for most of this year and
holding above a January low of $2.231 provided technical
support, said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy
Management Institute in New York.  Natural gas for April delivery rose 5.2 cents to $2.324 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  after dropping 1.3 percent yesterday to $2.272, the
lowest settlement price since Feb. 15, 2002. The futures this
week dropped 16 cents, or 6.4 percent.  The price discount, or spread, of the April contract to May
futures widened 0.1 cent to 10.1 cents.  Gas has dropped 22 percent this year, making it the worst
performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index, as a

China, the world’s top pork consumer, will increase U.S. grain
purchases to meet rising demand for livestock feed. Soybeans

boost production volume by 50 percent this year. The U.S.

$13.3775 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $13.555, the

analysts, signaling more demand for the grain used in food and
livestock feed.  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 1.3 percent to settle
at $6.43 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
