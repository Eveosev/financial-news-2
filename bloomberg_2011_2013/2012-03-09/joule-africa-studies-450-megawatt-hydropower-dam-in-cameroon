Joule  Africa , a unit of San
Francisco-based Joule Investments, is conducting a 24-month
study for a hydropower dam in  Cameroon  on the Katsina-Ala River,
said Energy and Water Resources Minister Basile Atangana Kouna.  The 450-megawatt plant will be built within four years of
the study’s end, he told reporters in Yaounde, the capital,
yesterday. The output will boost Cameroon’s electricity
generation by 40 percent, Kouna said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
