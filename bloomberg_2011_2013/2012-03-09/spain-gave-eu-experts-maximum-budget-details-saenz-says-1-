The Spanish government provided
European Union official visiting the country with complete
information on budget data for last year as part of an EU review
of why  Spain  overshot its deficit target.  European Commission officials “were given maximum
information with the greatest transparency and the government
also took advantage of the visit to convey explanations to the
commission about the important reforms that are being
implemented in all sectors,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters in  Madrid  after the weekly Cabinet
meeting.  Spain failed to tackle the  euro area’s  fourth-biggest
budget gap in 2011 and the government said it will miss its
original target set for this year as the economy faces its
second  recession  since 2009 with unemployment forecast to rise
to 24.3 percent.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , who came to power in
December, defied his EU partners on March 2 by raising the
country’s deficit target for this year to 5.8 percent of gross
domestic product from the 4.4 percent previously agreed with the
EU. Rajoy said the old target wasn’t realistic after Spain’s
2011 deficit reached 8.5 percent, compared with the 6 percent
pledged by the former Socialist government.  “We have no reason to doubt the figures supplied by
Spain,” commission spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in
Brussels today. “What we need is to establish clarification on
the figures,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
