The pound reversed a gain versus the
euro and extended its decline against the dollar after
manufacturing rose less than economist estimates.  Sterling was little changed at 83.82 pence per euro at 9:36
a.m.  London  tim, after strengthening to 83.89 pence. The pound
was 0.4 percent weaker at $1.5764.  Factory output rose 0.1 percent from December, the Office
for National Statistics said today in London. The median
forecast of 30 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
increase of 0.3 percent. Overall industrial output unexpectedly
dropped 0.4 percent. A separate report showed producer prices
rose more than forecast in February as crude  oil prices 
increased.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
