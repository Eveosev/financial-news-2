Spain ’s bonds rose for a third day
after Greece got the biggest sovereign restructuring in history
as private investors forgave more than 100 billion euros ($131
billion) of debt, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  Italy’s  10-year bonds  headed for a ninth weekly gain as
government reports showed German exports rose and U.S. employers
hired more workers than economists forecast, fueling optimism a
global recovery will make it easier for  Europe ’s highly-indebted
nations to meet their obligations. German 10-year yields were
two basis points from a seven-week low as  Fitch Ratings 
downgraded Greece to Restricted Default after the debt swap.  “Overall, we think this is positive for markets,” said
Anders Moller Lumholtz, an analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “The big disaster on  Greece  has been averted and
the improvement in risk we saw yesterday is continuing. There
are still some details that we don’t have, but overall the
reaction is positive.”  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5 percent at 3:17 p.m. London time. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 climbed 0.505, or 5.05
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 106.53.  The Italian 10-year  yield  has fallen six basis points this
week to 4.85 percent, extending its decline to 226 basis points
in 2012. It climbed four basis points today.  Aid for Greece  Euro-region finance ministers agreed on a conference call
that the swap meant Greece had met the terms to proceed with a
130 billion-euro rescue package designed to prevent a collapse
of the economy. Ministers freed up 35.5 billion euros in public
sweeteners and interest now, with a decision on the balance to
be made at a March 12 meeting in Brussels.  Greek  government bonds  due to be issued after the swap were
priced at less than 30 percent of face amount, reflecting
concern the country will still struggle to meet its new
obligations amid a recession. The economy shrank 7.5 percent in
the fourth quarter from the same period in 2010, the Athens-
based Hellenic Statistical Authority said today.  The 2 percent bonds maturing in February 2023 were bid at
25.75 cents on the euro, BNP Paribas SA data on Bloomberg
showed. They were offered at 26 cents, according to Jefferies
Group Inc. That left the yield on the securities bid at 19.56
percent and offered at 19.42 percent, the data showed.  “It would be a big mistake to think we are out of the
woods,” German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told
reporters in Berlin after the conference call.  Fitch lowered Greece’s long-term foreign and local-currency
issuer default ratings from C, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  German Exports  German exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, increased 2.3 percent in January from December, when
they dropped a revised 4.4 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office said. U.S. payrolls climbed 227,000 last month, the Labor
Department said in  Washington . Economists predicted 210,000 new
jobs, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  German 10-year yields were little changed at 1.79 percent
after falling to 1.77 percent on March 7, the lowest since Jan.
16. Two-year yields were also little changed, at 0.17 percent.
They declined to a record 0.134 percent on Jan. 12.  Euro-area government bonds have returned 11 percent since
March 9, 2009, when the global  bull market  in stocks began,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. The Stoxx Europe 600
 Index (SXXP)  of shares has rallied 68 percent and the Standard & Poor’s
500  Index (SXXP)  has surged 102 percent over the same period.  German bonds have gained 0.3 percent this year and 18
percent the past three years, the indexes show. Italian bonds
climbed 13 percent since Dec. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
