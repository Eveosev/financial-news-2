Barclays Plc (BARC)  cut Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Diamond ’s remuneration by almost a third last
year and froze his salary for 2012 after the lender missed its
profitability target.  Diamond received 6.3 million pounds ($9.9 million) in
salary, bonuses and stock last year, down from 9 million pounds
the previous year, the London-based lender said in its annual
report today. Barclays said last month it may fail to hit the 13
percent target for return-on-equity by 2013 after it fell to
what Diamond said was an “unacceptable” 6.6 percent in 2011.  “The board and the committee recognize that our return on
equity has to improve,” Alison Carnwath, chairman of the
board’s remuneration panel, said in the report. “In order to
achieve this, our operating costs need to be reduced.
Remuneration has its part to play in that.”  Diamond is Britain’s second-best paid bank CEO after  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s  Stuart Gulliver , who received 7.16 million
pounds. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking
Group Plc, Britain’s two government-owned banks, today gave
their CEOs about 7 million pounds in stock vesting in 2015 after
they declined cash bonuses for 2011 amid political criticism.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  in January urged banks to show
“proper regard” in limiting bonuses and demonstrate how pay is
related to performance as the government executes the tightest
fiscal squeeze since World War II.  Barclays Capital  Diamond, the former head of Barclays Capital, is now only
the third highest-paid executive after two unidentified bankers
received 6.7 million pounds and 6.5 million pounds respectively.
Officials at Barclays declined to identify the two individuals.  Pretax profit at  Barclays Capital , the investment banking
arm led by  Rich Ricci  and Jerry Del Missier, fell 32 percent to
2.97 billion pounds in 2011, the lender said last month. The
bank reduced bonuses for the 24,000 employees at the investment
banking unit by 30 percent to 64,000 pounds a person.  Diamond’s package includes a 2.7 million-pound stock bonus
and a further 2.25 million pounds depending on how the bank
performs in future years. His base salary will remain at 1.35
million pounds. He won’t receive a cash bonus.  Barclays made a 5.75 million-pound so-called tax
equalization payment on Diamond’s behalf to tax authorities
after he relocated to the U.K. from the U.S., the company said.
He also received 675,000 pounds in cash instead of a pension
contribution and received benefits worth 474,000 pounds
including medical insurance, a company car and tax advice.  Deferred Bonus  In 2011, Diamond also took 3.71 million pounds from a 2008
performance share plan award, based on shareholder returns, and
1.08 million pounds from part of a 2010 performance share plan
award. He also took 7.81 million pounds from his executive share
award plan, another deferred bonus. The awards vested in March,
the bank said in the annual report.  Separately, Lloyds gave Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio shares valued at about 3.4 million pounds as part
of his long-term incentive plan, the lender said in a statement
today. His counterpart at RBS,  Stephen Hester , will receive
shares valued at as much as 3.6 million pounds under a similar
plan, the bank said in its annual report today.  Lloyds said it paid its eight top executives a combined
16.2 million pounds last year. The bank gave nine executives a
total of 3.89 million pounds of shares vesting over the next
three years. Horta-Osorio and the nine executives, including
consumer banking chief Alison Brittain and Chief Risk Officer
Juan Colombas, will also share in 14.4 million pounds of shares
vesting in 2015.  U.K. bank executives’ pay is still lower than for their
U.S. competitors:  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  CEO Jamie Dimon is likely
to receive about $23 million for 2011, people familiar with the
plans said in January. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S.
bank, awarded CEO Vikram Pandit $14.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
