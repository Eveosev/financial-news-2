ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  has no plans to
merge with  Siemens AG (SIE)  and can manage to improve the company’s
competitiveness and growth opportunities on its own,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview with
ThyssenKrupp Chief Executive Officer Heinrich Hiesinger.  The German steelmaker has “incredibly many chances” to
boost its existing business before it acquiring other companies,
the newspaper cited Hiesinger as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
