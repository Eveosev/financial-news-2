Lithuania’s budget revenue exceeded
the government’s target in January and February, rising 9.9
percent from a year earlier.  Revenue increased to 3.36 billion litai ($1.28 billion),
the  Finance Ministry  in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an
e-mailed statement. That’s above the government’s target of 3.22
billion litai, or 4.4 percent, it said.  The Baltic nation’s government plans to cut the budget
deficit to 3 percent of  gross domestic product  this year from an
estimated 5.3 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
