The Ottawa Senators won 4-1 to hand
the  New York Rangers  their second consecutive loss in the
National Hockey League.  The defeat leaves the Rangers with 91 points, two points
behind the league-leading St. Louis Blues, who beat the Anaheim
Ducks 3-1 last night.  New York leads the Eastern Conference by six points over
the  Pittsburgh Penguins , who have won seven straight games. The
Senators are seventh in the Eastern Conference with 80 points.  Ryan Callahan gave the Rangers (42-17-7) a 1-0 lead 4
minutes, 36 seconds into the first period last night at
Scotiabank Place in Ottawa.  Zack Smith and Nick Foligno scored for Ottawa in the first
period and Kyle Turris and Jason Spezza added goals in the final
period to give the Senators (36-25-8) their second straight
victory.  The Rangers are 15-6-3 in their past 24 games away from
their home ice at Madison Square Garden in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
