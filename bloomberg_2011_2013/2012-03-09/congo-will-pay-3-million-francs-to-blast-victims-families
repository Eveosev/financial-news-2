Republic of Congo will build 5,000
new homes and pay 3 million  CFA francs  ($6,000) to the families
of victims of the March 4 explosion at an arms depot in the
capital, Brazzaville, in which at least 250 people died,
Planning Minister Pierre Moussa said.  “A living allowance of 3 million CFA will be paid by the
government to each family of the victims,” Moussa told
parliament in a broadcast today on state-owned TeleCongo. “This
has nothing to do with compensation, the details of which will
be determined later.”  The new homes will be built 25 kilometers (16 miles) north
of Brazzaville in Kintele, government spokesman Bienvenu Okiemy
said on state-owned Radio Congo today. The government will also
expedite the building of 1,000 new housing units already under
construction “to respond to the housing demand of our affected
compatriots,” Okiemy said.  More than 2,315 people were injured in the blast and 13,854
people have been left homeless, Moussa said. The explosion
occurred when a short circuit set alight a cache of armaments,
some of which were slated for destruction, according to the
government. Congo is  Africa ’s fourth-largest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
