Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,  Spain ’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, climbed the most in three years
after agreeing to sell four U.S. wind-power projects to
 Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQN)  for almost $900 million.  The stock jumped as much as 16 percent to 2.65 euros and
was the top gainer on Spain’s benchmark IBEX 35 index, which
fell 0.4 percent as of 11:39 a.m. local time. Gamesa is  trading 
82 percent below its five-year weekly average of 14.92 euros.  “This is positive news because it boosts Gamesa’s
earnings,” Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist at
FGA/MG Valores, said by phone today. “The market didn’t expect
the company could sell the parks as the U.S. market is in
standby, due to regulatory issues.”  The deal will increase Gamesa’s earnings before interest
and tax by about $35 million, the Zamudio, Spain-based company
said in a statement today. The wind parks, in Pennsylvania,
Iowa, Texas and Illinois, will have 240 Gamesa-made turbines and
a total generating capacity of 480 megawatts, Algonquin said.  The transaction between Gamesa and Algonquin, a Canadian
electricity provider, will need regulatory approval from the
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which may take about 45
days, Gamesa said. Additionally, both companies reached an
agreement to develop wind projects in the U.S. and  Canada .  Gamesa will run and maintain the parks for 20 years.  “It’s definitely a good signal and even more given that
it’s a profitable deal,” Salvador said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
