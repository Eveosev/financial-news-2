Mexico ’s posted a weekly advance as
a bigger-than-forecast increase in U.S. payrolls last month
boosted the outlook for exports from the Latin American country.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 12.6425 per U.S. dollar at
a.m. in Mexico City, from 12.6785 yesterday. The currency’s
third-straight daily gain pushed its weekly advance to 0.9
percent and 10.2 percent on the year. It’s risen 23.1 percent
since the global stock market bottomed and began a  bull market 
three years ago today.  Employers in the U.S. boosted payrolls by a more-than-
forecast 227,000 in February, Labor Department figures released
today showed. Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its exports to
the U.S., may grow more than the government’s 3.5 percent
forecast as there could be “positive surprises,” Mexican
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said yesterday in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York .  “The situation in the U.S. is a little bit rosier than it
was several months ago,” Aryam Vazquez, an emerging-markets
economist at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said in a telephone interview
from Harrington Park,  New Jersey . “That’s obviously very peso-
supportive.”  Companies in the U.S. added 216,000 workers last month,
according to a March 7 report by ADP Employer Services.  The yield on the country’s peso-denominated debt due in
2024, known as Mbonos, rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 6.38 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price fell 0.23 centavo to 131.54 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
