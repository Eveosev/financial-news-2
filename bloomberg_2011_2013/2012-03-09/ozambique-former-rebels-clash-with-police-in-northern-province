Mozambican police arrested 34 former
National Resistance of Mozambique fighters after clashes in the
northern Nampula province in which a policeman and a protester
died, police spokesman Inacio Joao Dina said.  Police confiscated guns and ammunition from the former
rebel fighters yesterday who were preparing to participate in
protests, Dina said in a phone interview from Nampula today.
Afonso Dhlakama, the opposition leader from Renamo, as the party
is known, claims the ruling Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, known as Frelimo, rigged the election in 2009 and
hasnâ€™t fulfilled electoral promises.  Renamo fought an almost two-decade long civil war against
Frelimo until 1992. Frelimo extended its rule since independence
from  Portugal  in 1975 after winning 76 percent of the 2009 vote.
Renamo won 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
