Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  awarded
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio shares valued at
about 3.4 million pounds ($5.3 million) as part of his long-term
incentive plan.  Horta-Osorio will receive 9.6 million shares valued at
34.79 pence each, the London-based lender, 41 percent government
owned, said in a statement today. He will only receive the
shares in 2015 if certain performance conditions are met, the
company said.  The CEO said in January he’ll spurn his 2011 bonus, given
the bank’s full-year loss and his nine-week absence for
exhaustion last year. The bank’s former CEO,  Eric Daniels , was
stripped of 40 percent of his bonus last month, losing about
580,000 pounds in deferred stock as he was penalized for the
bank’s improper sale of payment-protection insurance.  Lloyds’s head of  consumer banking , Alison Brittain,
received a deferred bonus award of 2.41 million shares, valued
at about 840,000 pounds and long-term compensation of about 1.6
million pounds, the bank said today. Chief Risk Officer Juan Colombas will receive a bonus of about 620,000 pounds and a
long-term award of about 1.4 million pounds.  Lloyds said last month it cut the money it set aside for
employee bonuses by 30 percent to 375 million pounds. Cash
payments will be capped at 2,000 pounds and above that level
will be subject to deferral and clawback, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
