Investors should increase holdings
of U.S. Treasuries on any drop in price because haven assets
will be in demand as Greek credit default swaps, or CDS, are
triggered after its debt exchange,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA said.  “Use any dip in U.S. Treasuries to increase long duration
positions,” strategists led by  Vincent Chaigneau , global head
of interest-rate strategy in Paris, wrote in a research report
yesterday. “Markets will be relieved that a disorderly default
has been avoided. But CDS will be triggered. That is a big leap
into the unknown. Concerns on growth are rising in Europe, while
the momentum in the U.S. recovery is questionable. The good news
has now been fully priced.”  The U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.02
percent at 6:55 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
