Gasoline in New York Harbor
strengthened amid speculation that shipments of the fuel from
Europe to the U.S. are set to drop.  Cargoes of the motor fuel will fall to an eight-week low, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  plans to
halt units at its Godorf refinery in Germany for maintenance
until March 24, making it the fourth plant in the country to
carry out shutdowns.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  narrowed 1.25 cents to 23.25 a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:26 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
2.45 cents to $3.0935 a gallon.  Traders and oil companies booked 10 tankers for the two
weeks to March 22 and eight more are likely to be hired,
according to the median estimate in a survey yesterday of seven
shipbrokers, traders and owners who specialize in transporting
gasoline. Thatâ€™s the fewest since the two weeks begun Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
