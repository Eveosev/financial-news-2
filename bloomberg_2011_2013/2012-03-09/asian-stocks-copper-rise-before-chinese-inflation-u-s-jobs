Stocks and the dollar rose, while
Treasuries fell, as growth in U.S. jobs boosted optimism in the
world’s largest economy. Equities pared gains as an industry
group ruled that  Greece ’s debt restructuring will trigger
payouts on $3 billion in default insurance.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.4 percent to
1,370.87 at 4 p.m. in New York, leaving it up 0.1 percent for
the week. The euro lost 1.2 percent to $1.3119. The yield on the
10-year Treasury rose two basis points to 2.03 percent. Italy’s
10-year bond yield increased three basis points to 4.84 percent,
erasing earlier declines. Copper rallied 1.8 percent, while oil
increased 0.8 percent to $107.40 a barrel.  The U.S. added 227,000 jobs last month, topping the median
economist forecast for a 210,000 rise. Greece’s debt swap, the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history, allowed the nation
to activate collective action clauses forcing investors to take
losses. The International Swaps & Derivatives Association said
the deal will be considered a “ credit event ” and default swaps
on the debt may now be settled.  “We can sit back because the U.S. is not going into a
recession even though Europe is in a recession,”  Stephen Wood ,
the New York-based chief market strategist for Russell
Investments, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
$137.6 billion. “These jobs numbers are not fantastic, but they
are consistent with that slow, non-recessionary economic growth
forecast.”  Bull Market Anniversary  Today marked the three-year  anniversary  of the  bull market 
in U.S. stocks that followed the global financial crisis. The
 S&P 500  has rallied 103 percent from its 12-year low on March 9,
2009, and is still down about 12 percent from its 2007 record.
The index has advanced for four straight weeks and is up 9
percent so far in 2012, its best start to a year since 1998.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Travelers Cos., DuPont Co. and Intel
Corp. rose at least 0.8 percent to lead gains in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , which climbed 14.08 points to 12,922.02.
Financial and consumer-discretionary shares led gains among the
10 main industry  groups  in the S&P 500, rising at least 0.5
percent.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  gained 2.9 percent on plans to introduce a
new single-cup coffee brewer, sending shares of Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters Inc., maker of the Keurig brewers, down 16
percent.  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) , the largest maker of analog
semiconductors, fell 1 percent after cutting sales and profit
forecasts.  The dollar strengthened against 13 of 16 major peers,
rising 1 percent versus the yen. The Dollar Index, a gauge of
the currency against six major counterparts, climbed 1.1
percent, the most intraday in almost two months. Today’s jobs
data fueled speculation that the American economy is improving
enough that the  Federal Reserve  will not see a need to undertake
a third round of bond purchases known as quantitative easing, or
QE3.  ‘Good News’  “It’s good news for the  U.S. economy , arguably good enough
news that prospects of QE3 start to become much more remote,”
said  Greg Anderson , a senior currency strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in New York. “The knee-jerk dollar strength was across the
board.”  Two shares rose for each that declined in the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP) .  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  rallied 6.4 percent,
the most since June, after agreeing to  buy  a majority stake in
LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. for 463 million euros ($612 million). 
Lagardere SCA (MMB) , France’s largest publisher, tumbled 6.1 percent
after its 2012 outlook prompted analysts to cut profit targets.  Among major national benchmarks in Europe, the FTSE-100
Index added 0.5 percent and Germany’s DAX increased 0.7 percent.
The euro weakened versus 10 of 16 major peers.  ‘Restricted Default’  Greek government bonds due to be issued after the nation’s
debt swap is completed were priced at less than 30 percent of
face amount, signaling concern the country will struggle to
repay its revised obligations. The 2 percent bonds maturing in
February 2023 were bid at 25.5 cents on the euro at 4:25 p.m.
London time, BNP Paribas SA data on Bloomberg showed. They were
offered at 26 cents, according to Jefferies Group Inc. That left
the yield on the securities bid at 19.7 percent and offered at
19.42 percent, the data showed.  Greece’s debt swap was met with a 95.7 percent
participation rate among investors. A total 4,323 credit-default
swap contracts can now be settled after ISDA’s determinations
committee ruled the use of collective action clauses is a
restructuring credit event. Before the ruling, Greek swaps rose
to a record $7.68 million in advance and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of debt for five years.  ‘Restricted Default’  Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece to “restricted default”
from C after the debt-swap announcement. The “sanctity” of
bondholders’ contracts has been diminished by Greece’s pushing
through the restructuring, according to Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s  Bill Gross .  “The rules have been changed here,” Gross, co-chief
investment officer at Pimco, said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. “The
sanctity of their contracts is certainly lessened. Bondholders
have that to look forward to going into the future.”  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  advanced 0.7 percent,
paring this week’s drop to 1.9 percent. The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) 
and the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese stocks
listed in Hong Kong both advanced 0.8 percent after a report
showed consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two
years. The  BUX Index (BUX)  jumped 1.2 percent in Budapest. The  BSE
India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  rose 2.1 percent as trading resumed after
yesterday’s holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
