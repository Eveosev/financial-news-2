A measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend to one another dropped for the 10th week to
the lowest level in seven months as bond investors agreed to
 Greece ’s debt swap and central-bank funds buoyed credit markets.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 55 basis
points at 12 p.m. in London from 56 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure has fallen every week this year to
the lowest level since Aug. 5.  Private investors forgave more than 100 billion euros ($132
billion) of Greek debt in a bond exchange that’s the key element
in European leaders’ efforts to ease the region’s two-year-old
sovereign crisis. Credit markets have already rallied since
December when the  European Central Bank  started offering banks
cheap loans through longer-term refinancing operations.  “The news that the Greek bond swap looks to be going ahead
with high participation is a positive development and
contributes to this morning’s tightening,” said  Brian Barry , a
strategist at Investec Bank Plc in London. “The fact that banks
have secured LTRO funding for the near term is obviously the
catalyst for a large part of the spread contraction.”  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 62.5
basis points below Euribor from minus 64 yesterday. The measure
was minus 114 at the start of the year.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 53 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the ECB for the third day
yesterday, placing 801 billion euros with the Frankfurt-based
central bank from 807 billion euros on March 7.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.894 percent from 0.902 percent.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.318 percent from 0.319 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.474 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
