Global wheat inventories will
be 1.7 percent less than forecast a month ago and smaller
than expected on increasing use of the grain in livestock
feed, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  World stockpiles will total a record 209.58 million
metric tons as of May 31, down from 213.10 million
estimated last month, the USDA said today in a report. In a
Bloomberg survey, 21 analysts expected supplies of 212.83
million tons, on average.  Global use of wheat in livestock feed will total
131.06 million tons, up from 130.66 million estimated last
month, the USDA said. Corn futures for May delivery are
trading near parity with wheat on the Chicago Board of
Trade, compared with an average discount of about 91 cents
in the past year. Global wheat exports may reach 142.93
million tons, up from 140.25 million forecast last month.  “Wheat feeding is still an issue,”  Dale Durchholz , a
senior market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,
Illinois, said in a telephone interview before the report.
Supplies are “going to be a little tighter, and everyone
is kind of encouraged about exports.”  Wheat prices have tumbled 19 percent in the past year
on the Chicago Board of Trade as global production
rebounded from drought the previous year in  Russia , eastern
 Europe  and  Australia . Yesterday, futures for May delivery
fell 0.7 percent to settle at $6.3475 a bushel.  U.S. inventories at the end of May will total 825
million bushels (22.45 million tons), 2.4 percent lower
than last month’s estimate of 845 million, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 837.2 million bushels, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
