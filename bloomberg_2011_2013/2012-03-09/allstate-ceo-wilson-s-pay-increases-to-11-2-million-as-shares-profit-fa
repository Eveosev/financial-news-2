Allstate Corp. (ALL) ’s  Thomas Wilson , who
presided over his fourth annual stock decline in five years as
chief executive officer, was given total compensation of $11.2
million for 2011, up 20 percent from the previous year.  Wilson’s pay included $1.1 million of salary, $2.31 million
of stock awards and $4.29 million of option awards, the
Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said today in a filing. The
annual incentive award of $2.25 million was 102 percent of the
company’s target for Wilson, also the company’s chairman.  Wilson, 54, recorded investment losses during the 2008
credit crunch and faced costs last year tied to natural
disasters. Allstate, which has fallen by more than half since
Wilson took over as CEO in January 2007, slid 14 percent last
year as  net income  declined 15 percent.  “Strong adjusted underlying operating income and an
improvement in book value per share resulted in funding at 102.4
percent of target,” Allstate said of Wilson’s incentive award.
“Threshold performance was not achieved for the growth in
policies in multicategory households measure as management
actions to improve returns in the homeowners business negatively
impacted the measure.”  Allstate rival  Chubb Corp. (CB)  gained 16 percent last year in
New York trading, while Travelers Cos. rose 6.2 percent. Since
the end of 2006, Warren, New Jersey-based Chubb has advanced 27
percent and New York-based Travelers is up 7.3 percent.  Hartford gained less than 1 percent to $20.07 in regular
New York trading today. It has advanced  24 percent  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
