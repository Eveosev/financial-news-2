El Paso Corp. (EP) ’s shareholders
approved  Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) ’s $24 billion takeover, which will
create the biggest U.S. pipeline company.  About 79 percent of shareholders voted and 95 percent voted
in favor of the deal, El Paso said in a statement today. The
vote was delayed three days to give shareholders time to
consider a Delaware judge’s ruling in a lawsuit challenging the
merger, which pointed out conflicts of interest among the
advisers and executives who negotiated the deal.  The premium that  Kinder Morgan (KMI)  offered was high enough to
offset those concerns, said Dan Spears, a partner at Swank
Capital LLC in  Dallas  whose firm owns shares in both Kinder
Morgan and El Paso.  “I think it was a good value for the shareholders,” he
said in an interview.  The merger is still being reviewed by the Federal Trade
Commission,  Kinder Morgan  said in a March 7 filing. It is
expected to close in the second quarter of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
