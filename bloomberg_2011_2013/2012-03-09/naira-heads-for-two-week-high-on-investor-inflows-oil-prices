Nigeria ’s naira headed for the
highest in two weeks against the dollar after foreign investors
bought the nation’s debt and on support from high  oil prices .  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer advanced 0.3
percent to 157.2 per dollar, the strongest on a closing basis
since Feb. 23, at 12:20 p.m. in Lagos, heading for a second
weekly gain.  Oil rose for a third day in  New York  on speculation that
rising U.S. payroll numbers and an easing European debt crisis
will spur demand for crude. A Central Bank of Nigeria sale of
150.1 billion naira ($955 million) of treasury bills on March 8
was oversubscribed, bids totaling 328.8 billion naira, with
yields on 364-day notes at 15.57 percent.  “We’ve experienced foreign investors coming into” bonds
and treasury bills, Edgar Ebinum, an analyst at Lagos-based
Cowry Asset Management Ltd., said by phone today. “The oil
price has been upbeat and it has a way of strengthening our
external reserves and we expect the CBN to maintain their
intervention strategy over time.”  High borrowing costs have fueled demand from foreign
investors seeking better returns,  central bank  Governor Lamido Sanusi said Feb. 28. An auction last week for 35 billion naira
of 2022 bonds sold at a yield of 15.893 percent was 2.35 times
subscribed.  The central bank has  sold  $300 million to lenders at two
foreign-exchange auctions this week. The regulator, based in the
capital Abuja, offers dollars at auctions on Mondays and
Wednesdays to maintain exchange rate stability.  Ghana’s cedi climbed 0.2 percent to 1.7102 per dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
