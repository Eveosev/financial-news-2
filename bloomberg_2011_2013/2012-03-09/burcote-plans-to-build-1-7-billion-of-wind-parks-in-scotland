Burcote Wind Ltd., a U.K. renewable
energy developer, plans to build 10 wind parks in  Scotland , with
an investment of about 1.08 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) and
enough capacity to supply power to half a million homes.  The company, based in Dunfermline, Fife, plans to build 800
megawatts of projects from Aberdeenshire to Dumfries and
Galloway, the company said in a statement. It will seek partners
for the investment after getting approval for the sites.  First Minister  Alex Salmond  said that while the parks need
planning approval, they show the opportunity for green industry
in Scotland, which has reaffirmed a pledge to get all its energy
from renewables by 2020. A planned U.K. Green Investment Bank to
spur low-carbon developments will be based in the Scottish
capital of Edinburgh, the central government said yesterday.  Scotland’s renewable energy sector got about 750 million
pounds of investment in the year to October 2011, Salmond said.  Burcote is studying four zones at Meikleton, Creggan, Sandy
Knowe and Benshinnie and will submit planning applications in
the next 18 months, according to today’s statement. The parks
may create about 600 jobs in Scotland and power 554,000 homes.  Scotland has about a quarter of  Europe ’s wind resources,
according to the company. “It would be crazy not to harness
that power, especially as fossil fuels become scarcer and ever
more expensive,” Chairman Graham Brown said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
