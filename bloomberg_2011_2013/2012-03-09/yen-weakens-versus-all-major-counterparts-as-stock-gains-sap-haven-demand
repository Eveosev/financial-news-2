The yen weakened against all 16 of
its most-traded peers as gains by Asian stocks damped demand for
the currency as a haven.  The yen fell 0.3 percent to 108.58 per euro as of 11:53
a.m. in  Tokyo . It slid 0.3 percent to 87.09 per Australian
dollar. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks rose 0.7 percent,
gaining for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
