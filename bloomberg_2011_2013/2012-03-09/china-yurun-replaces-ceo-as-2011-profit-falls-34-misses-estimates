China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068) , the
country’s second-largest meat-product supplier, replaced its
chief executive and said its first-quarter earnings are still
suffering from last year’s news report about illegal additives
in some of its meat.  The company’s first-quarter profit will be “far from
reaching normal levels” even as it has improved from the fourth
quarter, Chairman Zhu Yicai told reporters in  Hong Kong 
yesterday. Yurun posted a 34 percent decline in 2011 profit that
lagged analyst estimates.  “We believe our business has reached the light at the end
of the tunnel and we are confident that our business will
gradually return to normal,” Zhu said, without giving a
timeframe.  To “enhance business management” the company said
yesterday it appointed Executive Director Yu Zhangli as the new
chief executive officer, replacing Zhu Yiliang. It takes effect
on March 9.  Yurun said it was under “enormous pressure” after the
National Business Daily reported in September that meat sold by
one of the company’s units contained clenbuterol, an illegal
additive. Weakened  consumer confidence  and continuous increase
in labor and raw material, especially hog prices, dented
earnings, it said a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  The Nanjing-based meat processor said its 2011 profit
dropped to HK$1.8 billion ($233 million), lagging the median
 estimate  of HK$1.94 billion from 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Hog Price Drop  Average hog prices are expected to drop 15-20 percent in
2012 from a year earlier and this may boost profit margin this
year, Vice President Rosa Lee said. Gross profit margin fell 5.8
percentage points to 8.6 percent in 2011, according to the
company’s statement.  Yurun’s sales increased 50 percent to HK$32.3 billion last
year, driven by chilled pork products and low temperature meat
products, the key source of the company’s revenue, it said.  China  has pledged to step up food protection after baby
formula tainted with the chemical melamine killed at least six
infants and sickened about 300,000 others in 2008. The
government said in March last year it would ban the use of
clenbuterol as an additive to induce the growth of lean meat
when fed to pigs.  Yurun rose 3 percent to HK$11.94 at the close in Hong Kong
yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The stock has
dropped 53 percent in the past year, compared with the 11
percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
