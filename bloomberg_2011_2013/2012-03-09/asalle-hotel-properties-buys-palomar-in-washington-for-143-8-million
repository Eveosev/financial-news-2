states and the  District of Columbia . It focuses on owning,
redeveloping and repositioning properties in urban, resort and

asset through our ownership of several other hotels in the
neighborhood,” LaSalle Chief Executive Officer Michael Barnello
said in the statement. “The hotel is in great physical
condition and offers several attractive amenities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
