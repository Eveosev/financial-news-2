Konami Corp. (9766) , a Japanese video game
maker, rose to the highest in two months in Tokyo trading after
 saying  it would publish its games on social network game maker
Zynga Inc.’s new platform.  Konami jumped 4 percent to 2,315 yen, the highest since
Jan. 4, at the close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The Tokyo-based maker of “Metal Gear Solid” games will
have access to 240 million monthly active users by publishing
and promoting their games on the new network starting April 1,
Zynga said today in a statement published on Business Wire.
Zynga, the biggest developer of games played on Facebook Inc.’s
social networking site, is seeking new sources of revenue after
raising $1 billion in its initial public offering in December.  The San Francisco-based maker of “FarmVille” plans to
operate the Zynga Platform, its own service to promote other
developers and reduce its dependence on  Facebook .  Game makers Playdemic and Rebellion will also publish on
the Zynga platform, according to Zynga’s statement.  Facebook accounts for more than 90 percent of sales and
takes a 30 percent cut of virtual goods sold in Zynga games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
