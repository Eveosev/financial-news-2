Lindsey Vonn  became the first
American to win four overall  World Cup  skiing titles by taking
today’s giant slalom race in Are, Sweden.  Vonn, 27, finished in 2 minutes, 28 seconds on the Olympia
course to beat Italy’s Federica Brignone by 0.48 seconds.
Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg, the discipline’s season leader,
was more than a second back in third.  “I’m thrilled; it’s crazy,” Vonn said in a televised
interview after her 11th World Cup win of the season and 52nd of
her career. “I’m really, really excited.”  Vonn’s four overall titles moves her past Phil Mahre for
the most by an American and is two behind the record of six won
by  Austria ’s Annemarie Moser-Proell.  Today’s win gave her an unbeatable 554-point lead over
Slovenia’s  Tina Maze , who finished sixth, in the standings with
five races, worth a maximum 500 points, left in the season.  Vonn also moved into second place in the giant slalom
standings, pulling within 95 points of Rebensburg heading to
next week’s World Cup finals. She’s already clinched her fifth
straight downhill title and third consecutive super combined
championship this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
