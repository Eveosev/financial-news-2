The forint gained the most in almost
four weeks after a government official said Hungary is making
progress toward starting bailout talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union.  The forint appreciated 1 percent to 291.02 per euro by 5
p.m. in Budapest, the biggest one-day rally since Feb. 13 and
paring its decline this week to 0.5 percent.  The date for the start of talks “hinges on a decision by a
top policy maker,” Roland Natran, a deputy state secretary at
the  Economy Ministry , told  Gazdasagi Radio  yesterday in an
interview, according to a summary and audio file posted on the
station’s website today. “This could be tomorrow or it could be
later but on the basic questions the positions have moved very
close to one another.”  Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern member,
has failed to restart talks on financial assistance since last
year because of disputes with the international aid providers
over legislation. The forint strengthened for the first time in
a week yesterday after Tamas Fellegi, the minister in charge of
aid negotiations said Hungary’s “only goal” is to reach a
financing agreement  “fast” with no “Plan B.”  “Although the start of formal talks will be delayed, the
agreement with the IMF will take place in the second quarter,
helping Hungarian assets to appreciate in the second half,”
Orsolya Nyeste and Zoltan Arokszallasi, Budapest-based
economists at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
