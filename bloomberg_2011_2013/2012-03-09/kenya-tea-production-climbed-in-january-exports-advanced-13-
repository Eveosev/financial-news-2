Tea production in  Kenya , the world’s
biggest exporter of black tea, rose in January.  Output climbed to 36.2 million kilograms (79.8 million
pounds) compared with 35.9 million kilograms a year earlier,
Sicily Kariuki, managing director of the Kenya Tea Board, said
in an e-mailed response to questions. Frost and dry weather
didn’t have a major impact on production, she said.  Tea exports climbed 13 percent to 37.9 million kilograms
compared with 33.6 million kilograms a year earlier, Kariuki
said. Average auction prices were $2.91 a kilogram compared with
$3.16, she said.  Tea is the biggest source of foreign currency in Kenya,
 East Africa ’s largest economy. The country produced 377.9
million kilograms of the crop last year, earning 109 billion
shillings ($1.3 billion). Agriculture accounts for 21 percent of
Kenya’s total economic output.  -- Editors:  Alex Devine , Tony Barrett  To contact the reporter on this story: Consolatah Lucas in
