(Corrects Nationstar description in final paragraph.)  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  bonds rose the
most in three weeks after the New York Post reported  Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG)  is in talks to buy Residential Capital LLC,
the company’s mortgage division.  The largest U.S. auto lender’s $2 billion of 8 percent
notes due November 2031 rose 1.6 cents to 111.25 cents on the
dollar at 1:31 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The yield fell to 6.94 percent from 7.08 percent.  Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, and Gordon Runte, a
spokesman for Fortress, declined to comment on the reported
sale.  The U.S. Treasury Department rescued Detroit-based Ally,
originally known as GMAC, with a $17.2 billion bailout in 2008
after the firm was deemed crucial to the health of automakers.  The U.S. now holds a 74 percent stake in the company and
$5.9 billion of its convertible preferred stock, according to a
March 7 report from bond research firm Gimme Credit LLC.  ResCap would be sold in a bankruptcy court-administered
deal, the  New York  Post reported. The unit faces at least 22
mortgage-linked securities lawsuits that threaten to take away
profit from Ally.  ResCap has about $2.4 billion in debt maturing over the
next three years, and had $390 million in unrestricted liquidity
at year-end, Gimme Credit said in the report.  Most Active Bonds  Ally bonds are the most actively traded U.S. high-yield
corporate securities today, with 48 trades of $1 million or more
as of 12:59 p.m. New York time, Trace data show.  The cost to protect against a default by ResCap jumped to
the highest in more than two months after the New York Post
report. Credit-default swaps on the lender rose 2.2 percentage
points to 59 percent upfront, according to data provider CMA.
That means it would cost $5.9 million initially and $500,000
annually to protect $10 million of the mortgage unit’s debt from
default for five years.  Swaps on Ally dropped 18 basis points to 414.8 basis
points, meaning an annual cost of $414,800 for five years, CMA
prices show.  Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., the residential mortgage
loan servicer controlled by Fortress, priced an initial public
offering March 7 that raised $233.3 million, the Lewisville,
Texas-based company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
