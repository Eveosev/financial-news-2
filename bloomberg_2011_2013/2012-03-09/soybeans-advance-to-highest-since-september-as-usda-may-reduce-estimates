Soybean futures rose for a second
day to the highest level in five months in Chicago after  Brazil ,
the largest shipper of the oilseed, cut its forecast for
production this year.  Farmers in Brazil will harvest 68.7 million metric tons of
soybeans in the crop year through August, less than a February
estimate of 69.2 million tons, after dry weather parched crops
in the south, government crop forecaster Conab reported
yesterday.  Brazil is the second-largest grower of soybeans after the
U.S. and the biggest exporter, according to data from the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . The USDA is scheduled to update its
production estimates later today, and may pare its estimate for
Brazil’s output to 69.5 million tons, from 72 million tons last
month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Soybeans continue their upward spurt on largely better-
than-expected export figures and because of the expectation of a
downward revision by the USDA of South American production,”
Paris-based farm adviser Agritel wrote in a market comment.  May-delivery soybeans rose as much as 1.3 percent to
$13.555 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the highest
level for the most-active contract since Sept. 19, before
trading at $13.5275 by 11:41 a.m. London time. That took the
five-day gain to 1.5 percent, the fourth weekly advance and the
longest such winning streak since July 22.  U.S. exporters sold 165,000 tons of soybeans to  China  for
delivery in the 2012-13 season that starts Sept. 1, the USDA
reported yesterday.  South America Weather  “Everybody’s waiting to see what the USDA comes out with
later today,” Neil Burgess, a commodity analyst at  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC) , said from Sydney. “The weather conditions out of
 South America  have been playing on people’s minds.”  In  Argentina , the third-largest grower behind the U.S. and
Brazil, output will probably reach 46.2 million tons, unchanged
from a previous estimate, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said
yesterday.  The USDA’s outlook on the global supply and demand for
soybeans, corn, wheat and other crops is scheduled at 8:30 a.m.
in  Washington  today. Today is the three-year anniversary of the
beginning of a  bull market  in U.S. stocks that began after the
housing crisis in 2008.  Corn for May delivery gained 0.4 percent to $6.38 a bushel
in Chicago, paring the weekly loss to 2.6 percent. Wheat for May
delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.3875 in Chicago, trimming the
weekly loss to 5.3 percent, still the biggest such decline since
the five days ended Sept. 23.  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 1.6 percent to 207 euros ($273.63) a ton, while
the November-delivery contract climbed 0.9 percent to 194.75
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
