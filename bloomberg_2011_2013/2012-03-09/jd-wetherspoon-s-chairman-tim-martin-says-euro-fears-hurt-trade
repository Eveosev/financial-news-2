JD Wetherspoon Plc (JDW)  chairman Tim Martin said that consumer fears over issues such as the euro
area debt crisis have helped create an “odd six months” of
trading for the company.  “It’s been an odd six months,” Martin said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV today. “A very good Christmas, pretty
reasonable first-half overall. Things got tough in January. This
year people will have a little more money but they are worried
about things they see on the news about the euro. This all gets
through to people.”  Martin also said the euro currency is “doomed,”
reiterating comments he made earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
