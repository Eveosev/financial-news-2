U.S. stocks  rose, with a three-day
rally helping the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index avoid its second
weekly decline of the year, as stronger-than-forecast American
jobs data and  Greece ’s debt restructuring offset China’s lower
growth target and  Europe ’s economic contraction.  Equities climbed as the  S&P 500 , which has surged 103
percent since March 9, 2009, marked the three-year anniversary
of the  bull market .  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  led
gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rallying more than
1.5 percent this week.  D.R. Horton  Inc. climbed 11 percent,
leading homebuilders higher, after Credit Suisse Group AG
recommended the shares. Molycorp Inc. soared 26 percent after
agreeing to its biggest acquisition.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,370.87 this week,
rebounding from a 1.5 percent drop on March 6 that was the
largest loss since December. The index has rallied nine out of
10 weeks this year. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  slumped
55.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,922.02 this week.  “The labor market is gradually healing,” Joseph Tanious,
who helps oversee $394 billion as a market strategist at
JPMorgan Funds in  New York , said in a telephone interview.
“Once people realized that the outcome of Greece having a
disorderly default was unlikely and economic data continued to
beat expectations to the upside -- that helped fuel the rally.”  The S&P 500 advanced after U.S. employers boosted payrolls
by 227,000 in February, capping the best six-month streak of
growth since 2006, and jobless claims remained at a level
consistent with an improving economy. Greece completed the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history. The three-day rally
erased losses spurred by concern over global economic prospects
as  China  cut its growth target to 7.5 percent and Europe
reported a 0.3 percent contraction for the fourth quarter.  ‘Inflection Point’  “We’re at an important inflection point,” Steve Listor,
the New York-based head of equity trading at BNY Mellon Wealth
Management, which oversees about $168 billion, said in a phone
interview. “We have those continuing cross-currents between
bulls and bears. The divergence can be a warning.”  U.S. stocks completed the third year of a bull market that
followed the global financial crisis, rallying on speculation
the economy would recover from the worst contraction since the
Great Depression amid low  interest rates . The S&P 500 has risen
25 percent from its low in October on better-than-estimated
earnings and  economic data . The gauge is up 9 percent in 2012.
It has fallen 0.2 percent after reaching the highest level since
2008 on March 1.  Not Slowing  The rally in equities isn’t slowing, and recent losses
shouldn’t deter investors from staying in stocks,  Laszlo Birinyi , who was among the first to suggest buying stocks in
March 2009, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  “While we may have stumbled for a day or two, I think the
race is still on,” he said. “The market is saying some very
good things about the economy which no one has factored in.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  still has the potential to reach a record high
of 1,700 this year should economic growth surprise investors the
same way falling bond rates did in 1995, Birinyi wrote in a
March 1 note.  Telecommunications stocks rallied the most in the S&P 500
this week, advancing 1.1 percent as investors favored shares of
companies less tied to economic growth. Consumer discretionary
and staples companies had the second- and third-biggest gains in
the S&P 500, adding more than 0.6 percent. Materials and energy
stocks slumped the most, losing at least 1 percent.  Homebuilders Rally  Consumer discretionary companies  were boosted as
homebuilders rallied. D.R. Horton climbed 11 percent to $15.47
after the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume was lifted to
outperform from neutral at Credit Suisse, which cited increased
buyer traffic in a monthly survey of real estate agents.  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , which was also raised to outperform at Credit
Suisse, advanced 11 percent to $25.45.  Wal-Mart and Home Depot posted the two biggest gains in the
Dow. Wal-Mart, the  world’s largest retailer , increased 1.8
percent to $60.08, while Home Depot, the world’s largest home-
improvement retailer, rose 1.5 percent to $48.10.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  rallied 11 percent to $2.78 for the
biggest gain in the S&P. The request by regulators for  Verizon
Wireless  and cable operators led by Comcast Corp. to provide
more data on the companies’ proposed $3.6 billion airwaves deal
appears to be a “partial victory” for smaller wireless
operators such as Sprint, Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said in a note.  Rare-Earth Deposit  Molycorp (MCP) , the owner of the largest rare-earth deposit
outside of China, rose 26 percent to $30.89 for the biggest
rally in the Russell 1000 Index this week. The company agreed to
buy Canada’s Neo Material Technologies Inc. for about C$1.3
billion ($1.3 billion) to increase Chinese sales and gain
technology used to make magnets.  Monster Worldwide Inc. rose 23 percent, the most since
October 2010, to $9.11. The online recruiting service hired
Stone Key Partners LLC and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
to help it review strategic alternatives.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., facing an increasing
number of rivals for its Keurig coffee machines, tumbled 23
percent to $52.59 after Starbucks Corp. announced plans to start
selling a single-cup coffee system.  “The market has almost gone in one direction and it’s
probably due for some sort of a pause,”  Hank Smith , chief
investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor,
 Pennsylvania , said in a phone interview. His firm manages about
$6.5 billion. “The market, certainly on a fundamental basis,
has room to move higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
