Asian  stocks  rose for a second day
as  Greece  struck a deal with creditors to help Europe contain
its debt crisis and slowing inflation gave Chinese authorities
room to stimulate growth in the world’s second largest economy.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for a fifth of its
sales, rose 4.3 percent. Guangzhou R&F Properties Company Ltd.
led Chinese developers higher on speculation China may ease
curbs on bank lending.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  advanced 4.2 percent
in Sydney after metal prices gained. Lynas Corp. jumped 9.3
percent even after a local group filed an appeal to block the
miner’s rare-earths refinery project in  Malaysia .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 1.1 percent to 127.40 as
of 5:25 p.m. in  Tokyo . The measure has lost 0.6 percent this
week, snapping a record 11-week advance. The gauge has risen 80
percent since March 2009, the bottom of a global equities slump
that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc., as
central banks from  China  to the U.S. eased monetary policy.  “People have got ammunition to be a bit more upbeat about
investment markets,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more than
$350 million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “What we are
likely to see today and overnight is a reminder for people that
the Greek risk, at least for the moment, has been taken off the
table and economic data is all heading off in the right
direction.”  Index Performance  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.7 percent. The
gauge outperformed every other major Asian equity index today,
rising above 10,000 for the first time since Aug. 1. A decline
in the yen against the dollar buoyed shares of exporters from
Sony to Toyota Motor Corp.  Volume for the Nikkei 225 was 67 percent above the 30-day
average as investors settled on the price for futures and
options on the gauge.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1 percent, and South
Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 0.9 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index gained 0.9 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index, which
tracks the bigger of China’s stock exchanges, climbed 0.8
percent. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1
percent after the gauge rose 1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Asian shares maintained gains after Greece’s government
said it clinched enough bondholder participation to complete a
debt swap seen as essential to containing Europe’s crisis.
People with knowledge of the matter earlier said the deal was
near completion.  Sony added 4.3 percent to 1,718 yen in Tokyo.  Esprit
Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong-Kong based clothier that counts Europe as
its biggest market, rose 1.5 percent to HK$18.52.  U.S. Jobs Data  In the U.S., the number of people filing claims for  jobless
benefits  rose to 362,000 last week, a level still consistent
with an improving labor market. The Labor Department will
release its February jobs report today.  Mainland developers gained after the China reported today
that consumer-prices rose in February at the slowest pace in 20
months. Separate reports showed industrial production and retail
sales missed analyst forecasts.  The data “gives the Chinese government much more scope to
adopt supportive policy measures,” White Funds Management’s
Gluskie said. “That’s potentially a real positive coming on top
of this Greek resolution.”  Chinese Developers  Guangzhou rose 2 percent to HK$10.10.  Shimao Property
Holdings Ltd. (813)  advanced 3.1 percent to HK$8.74.  China Resources
Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled property developer, increased 2.1
percent to HK$13.82.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , a
machinery maker whose biggest market is China, gained 4.6
percent to 1,778 yen in Tokyo.  Mining companies rose after the London Metal Exchange Index
increased 0.5 percent, the first advance for the gauge of metals
prices since March 1. Newcrest Mining climbed 4.2 percent to
A$31.93. St. Barbara Ltd. advanced 2.4 percent to A$2.16.  Lynas rose 9.3 percent to A$1.18. Shares rose even after
the rare-earths miner said an appeal had been filed to block a
project in Malaysia.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 10.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.6 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and an 8 percent increase by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
