Brazil ’s government is considering
measures to spur investments and stimulate long-term financing
in  Latin America ’s biggest  economy , said  Luciano Coutinho , the
national development bank’s president.  “Extending maturity of financial instruments is the most
relevant financial agenda in the country today”, Coutinho told
reporters in Sao Paulo today. He said there will be an increase
in investments and that “the government is discussing stimulus
for investments and savings.”  Brazil’s investments fell to 19.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2011 from 19.5 percent a year earlier, according to
the national statistics agency, known as IBGE. Coutinho said the
rate may be higher than 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
