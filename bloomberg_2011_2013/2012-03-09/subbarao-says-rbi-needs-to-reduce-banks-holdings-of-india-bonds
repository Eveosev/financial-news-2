Reserve Bank  of India Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao comments on the statutory liquidity ratio, or
the proportion of deposits lenders need to invest in  government
bonds . He was speaking in the western Indian city of Pune today.  “Indian banks are holding a high amount of government
bonds because the fiscal deficit is high.  ‘‘It also happens because the Reserve Bank of India has
prescribed a statutory liquidity ratio requirement of 24
percent, considered by many people as high, on banks. Going
forward, we need to reduce it but there are a number of
preconditions which have to be met.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
