Colombia ’s peso posted a 10th week
of gains, its longest winning streak since at least 1992, as a
report showing the U.S. added more jobs than forecast boosted
the outlook for the world’s biggest economy and buoyed demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 1,762.35 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,765 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,759.60, the strongest
intraday level since July 27. The peso advanced 0.7 percent this
week and has jumped 9.3 percent in the past three months, the
best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
weekly winning streak is the longest since at least 1992 when
Bloomberg data began.  The Colombian currency also climbed amid rising foreign
direct investment and on speculation higher  interest rates  in
the Andean country will lead to increased portfolio investment
from abroad, said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  “Optimism after the U.S. payrolls data is boosting gains
in currencies in  Latin America ” including the Colombian peso,
Cardozo said. “FDI continues to rise and the higher interest
rates in Colombia should also help attract more portfolio
investment.”  Labor Department figures showed employers in the U.S.
increased payrolls by 227,000 in February, more than the median
projection for a 210,000 rise in a Bloomberg survey. Today is
the third anniversary of the 2009 bear-market low for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The benchmark gauge has risen 103
percent since closing at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.  Colombia’s central bank raised the benchmark lending rate a
quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent on Feb. 24, the second
straight monthly increase. Cardozo forecasts policy makers will
increase the key rate this month to 5.5 percent and leave it at
that level through year-end.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.21 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
rose 0.108 centavo to 122.292 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
