Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  said that lengthy approval procedures and public
protests against electricity grid expansion may endanger
Germanyâ€™s exit from nuclear power,  Bild am Sonntag  reported.  A fast grid expansion is necessary to meet the planned
deadlines, the newspaper cited the executive as saying in a
preview of an article for its next edition. Construction of new
gas and coal power plants are also necessary to ensure power
supply, Loescher also said according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
