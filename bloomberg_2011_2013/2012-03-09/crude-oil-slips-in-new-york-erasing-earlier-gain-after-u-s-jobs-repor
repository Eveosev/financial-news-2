Crude oil erased earlier gains on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , where the April contract was
down 24 cents at $106.34 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. London time,
after rising as much as 0.8 percent to $107.42.  The contract gave up gains as the dollar strengthened
following a report that showed employers in the U.S. boosted
payrolls more than forecast in February while the jobless rate
held steady at a three-year low.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
