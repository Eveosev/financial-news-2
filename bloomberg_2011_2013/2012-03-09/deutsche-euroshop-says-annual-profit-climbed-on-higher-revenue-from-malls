Deutsche Euroshop AG (DEQ) ,  Germany ’s
largest shopping-center owner, said full-year earnings rose 34
percent as the company’s malls generated more revenue.  Operating profit climbed to 165.7 million euros ($219
million) from 124 million euros a year earlier, the Hamburg-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts expected 163.4
million euros, the average of nine estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 32 percent to 190 million euros.  Deutsche Euroshop, which owns or has stakes in 19 shopping
centers in Germany,  Austria , Hungary and  Poland , plans to pay an
unchanged dividend of 1.1 euros a share. The company reported
net income of 93.4 million euros and restated the year-earlier
figure to a loss of 7.8 million euros because of a change in the
way it applies a tax deduction, according to the statement.  The mall investor forecast an increase in operating profit
to 177 million euros to 181 million euros for 2012, while
revenue will rise to 207 million euros to 211 million euros.  “Last year, insurance companies and foreign pension funds
were very active in the German shopping center market,” Chief
Executive Officer Claus-Matthias Boege said in the statement.
“Contrary to expectations, the first ten weeks of the new
financial year have been rather quiet.”  Deutsche Euroshop gained 1.8 percent to 26.40 euros in
Frankfurt trading, the highest since Feb. 13. Before today, the
shares had lost 5 percent in six months, while the CDAX
Performance Index gained 24 percent.  The company reported net asset value of 27.65 euros a share
for 2011, a 5 percent increase from the previous year. Funds
from operations, a measure of a company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to 1.61 euros a share from 1.35 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
