Treasuries headed for a weekly loss
as economists said a government report today will show U.S.
employers hired more than 200,000 workers for a third month,
adding to signs the economy is gathering momentum.  Demand for the relative safety of U.S. debt was also damped
as European stocks held yesterday’s rally after the Greek
government said it reached its target in the biggest sovereign
restructuring in history.  Interest-rate  swap spreads indicate
increasing demand for yields higher than those on Treasuries.  “The firmer tone to so-called risk assets such as equities
imparts a bit of an upside bias” to yields, said  Marc Ostwald ,
a strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “A lot
clearly hangs on the U.S. payrolls data today. The key issues
for Treasuries at the moment are sentiment in the equities
market and domestic data.”  Yields on 10-year notes were little changed at 2.01 percent
at 7:19 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2 percent securities maturing in February 2022
traded at 99 29/32. The yields have increased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, this week, the most since the five
days ended Feb. 10.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed after rising
1.6 percent yesterday. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index were also little changed.  Estimates for the number of U.S. workers hired in February
range from 125,000 to 275,000, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of 94 economists before today’s report from the Labor
Department. The median estimate is for an increase of 210,000.
January’s gain of 243,000 was the most since April.  Swap Spread  The  difference  between the two-year swap rate and the yield
on  U.S. debt  of a similar maturity narrowed to 24 basis points
today, the lowest in almost seven months.  U.S. government bonds have lost 0.5 percent this year,
while corporate debt has returned 3.2 percent, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Treasuries fell yesterday as a majority of investors
signaled their readiness to forgive some of  Greece ’s borrowings,
boosting risk appetite and damping demand for the refuge.  Greece said today it has a 95.7 percent participation rate
among investors after it received approval to activate so-called
collective action clauses.  The U.S. government will sell $32 billion of three-year
notes, $21 billion of 10-year debt and $13 billion of 30-year
bonds next week. The auctions will take place over three days
starting March 12.  Fed Operation  The  Federal Reserve  plans to sell as much as $8.75 billion
of U.S. debt due from August 2013 to January 2014 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  The central bank is in the process of swapping $400 billion
of shorter-maturity Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term
bonds to cap borrowing costs.  The Fed’s Open Market Committee is scheduled to hold a
policy meeting on March 13. The central bank said in January
that it would keep the benchmark interest rate at almost zero
through at least late 2014.  The Fed has held its target for overnight lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. The  MSCI All
Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks reached the lowest level since
2003 on March 9, 2009, three years ago today. It has returned
about 90 percent since then including reinvested dividends.
Treasuries gained 15 percent in the period, the Bank of America
indexes show.  Treasury Volatility  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures
price swings based on options, rose to 76.6 yesterday after
dropping to 75.1 the previous day. The measure has tumbled from
117.8 on Aug. 8 as central banks stepped up efforts to ease
tension in financial markets.  Ten-year yields, which have been in a range of 1.79 percent
to 2.09 percent this year, will advance to 2.53 percent by Dec.
31, according to the average forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
