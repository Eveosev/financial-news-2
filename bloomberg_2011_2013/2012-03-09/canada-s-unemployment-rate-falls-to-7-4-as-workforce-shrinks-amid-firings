Canada ’s  jobless rate  fell for the
first time in five months in February even as employment
declined, due to a larger drop in the number of people in the
workforce.  Employment fell by 2,800 after a January increase of 2,300,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The  unemployment rate 
fell to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent as 37,900 people left the
 labor force , the largest drop since January 2009. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast an increase of 15,000
jobs and a 7.6 percent unemployment rate.  Canada’s job growth has been  slowing  since the middle of
last year after hiring gains led the economy out of a recession
in 2009.  Consumer spending  aided by low  interest rates  is still
helping drive growth, the  Bank of Canada  said yesterday, while
keeping its key policy rate at 1 percent.  “All told, a disappointment,” said  Avery Shenfeld , Chief
Economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto,
“and one that will temper expectations after yesterday’s
statement that the Bank of Canada is moving towards hiking rates
sooner rather than later.”  The Canadian dollar remained weaker after the report,
falling 0.2 percent at 99.21 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 7:14 a.m.
in Toronto. One Canadian dollar purchases $1.0080.  Youth Unemployment  Young workers, defined as those aged from 15 to 24,
accounted for almost all of the lost jobs in February with a
decline of 26,800. Men older than 24 gained 25,800 jobs while
women in that age group lost 1,700,  Statistics Canada  said.
Youth unemployment rose to 14.7 percent from 14.5 percent.  By industry, retailing and wholesaling led the job decline
with a 37,400 decrease, followed by a 21,900 drop for
transportation and warehousing, Statistics Canada said. Health
care and social assistance fell 21,700 while public
administration declined by 14,700.  Employment in finance, insurance real estate and leasing
rose by 41,200 in February, recouping half the industry’s losses
over the previous five months. Construction rose by 14,000 and
natural resources gained 6,800, capping a 10.2 percent gain over
the past year, the fastest of any industry.  Atco Ltd. said March 5 it won its largest-ever Canadian
contract to build housing for a natural resources project, a
2,586-person lodge for  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Jansen potash site in
Saskatchewan.  U.S. Report  The U.S. may report at 8:30 a.m. that non-farm payrolls
increased by 210,000 in February, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Canadian part-time employment fell by 12,000 in February
while full-time jobs increased by 9,100.  Workers classified as employees fell by 15,100 while the
self-employed increased by 12,300, Statistics Canada said.  Private-sector employment decreased by 1,700 and public-
sector jobs fell by 13,400.  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 2.1
percent in February from a year earlier. The Bank of Canada says
that figure is a key indicator of inflation.  Today’s release is the last time this indicator will be
published at 7 a.m. in Ottawa. Beginning next month, Statistics
Canada will release all indicators at 8:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
