Japan  is seeking to buy 47,000
metric tons of food wheat and 20,000 tons of food barley on
March 16 through a tender system introduced to loosen government
grain-import controls, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said.  Shipment must be made by June 30, Masafumi Otsuka at the
ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said today by phone.  The tender will be held under the so-called simultaneous
buy-and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
