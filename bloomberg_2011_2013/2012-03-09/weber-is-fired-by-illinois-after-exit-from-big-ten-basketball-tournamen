Bruce Weber  was fired as men’s
basketball coach at the  University of Illinois , one day after
the Fighting Illini were eliminated from the Big Ten Conference
tournament.  Weber won’t coach the team if it is invited to play in the
National Invitational Tournament and he’ll be paid $3.9 million
for the remaining three years on his contract, the school said
in a statement.  “This is an extremely difficult decision, especially with
the success Bruce Weber had early in his career here,” Mike
Thomas, the schools’ athletic director, said in a statement.  The Illini reached the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championship game in 2005, losing 75-70 to  North
Carolina .  Shaka Smart, who led Virginia Commonwealth University to
the national tournament’s Final Four last year and worked with
Thomas at the University of Akron, is expected to be among the
candidates to succeed Weber, ESPN reported, without citing a
source for its information.  Illinois  (17-15) lost 12 of its last 14 games, including a
64-61 defeat to Iowa yesterday in conference tournament play. The
Illini went 6-12 in the Big Ten during the regular season, tying
for ninth place.  Weber was 210-101 in nine years at the Champaign, Illinois,
school since leaving Southern Illinois to replace Bill Self in
April 2003. His career record as a head coach is 403-155.
The team made NCAA tournament appearances six times during his
tenure, though it went 50-56 in conference play over the last
six seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
