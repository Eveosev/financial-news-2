The  European Investment Bank  will
cut this year’s commitments to new projects worldwide, including
the Western Balkans, while stepping up disbursement of loans
approved in the past to clear the backlog and make its aid more
efficient, EIB Vice President Dario Scannapieco said.  New “signatures” in the Western Balkans, where the
European Union’s lending arm finances infrastructure, key to
luring new foreign investment, and assists small- and medium-
sized enterprises, will probably drop by “around 20 percent”
from 1.03 billion euros ($1.36 billion) in 2011, tracking the
global trend, Scannapieco told a news conference in Belgrade
today.  The change follows calls by the European Council to the
bank to “more support” the crisis-hit EU economies as well as
the economies of EU candidate countries, he said.  The AAA-rated lender will be seeking to clear a backlog of
signed  project financing  waiting to be disbursed to Albania and
former Yugoslav republics of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Macedonia and Montenegro, worth 1.8 billion euros in 2011.  EIB disbursed 859 million euros-worth of loans to the five
nations in 2011, with Serbia consuming 67 percent of the funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
