Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
government scrapped some of its special takeover defenses in
former state-owned companies to try to end an infraction
procedure brought by the European Commission over Italy’s so-
called golden share.  The changes adopted at a Cabinet meeting in Rome today will
limit the use of the golden share to block takeovers in key
industries such as defense, energy, telecommunications and
transportation. Italy still has golden shares in former state-
owned companies such as Telecom Italia SpA, oil producer  Eni SpA (ENI) 
and defense contractor  Finmeccanica SpA. (FNC)   The European Union has repeatedly urged Italy to modify its
law on golden shares to comply with the region’s rules. The
government hopes today’s overhaul will lead to the closing of an
infraction procedure opened in 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
