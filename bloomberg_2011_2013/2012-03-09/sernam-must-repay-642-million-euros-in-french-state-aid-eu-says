Sernam SA , a French rail and road
transport operator, must repay 642 million euros ($849 million)
in illegal aid given by the French state to the former unit of
state-owned railway operator Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Francais, or SNCF.  Sernam was ordered to pay back 41 million euros in 2004 and
didn’t, prompting European Union regulators to open an
investigation in 2008 that also covered the company’s spinoff in
2005, for which the French state provided 503 million euros to
help in the restructuring, the European Commission said.  “The French authorities failed in their obligation to
recover the 41 million euros in illegal aid,” the European
Commission said today in a statement. Sernam must “reimburse
that amount as well as all other aid which Sernam benefited
from, or a total of over 642 million euros” plus interest.  Spokeswomen for the French Finance Ministry and Sernam
declined to comment immediately on the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
