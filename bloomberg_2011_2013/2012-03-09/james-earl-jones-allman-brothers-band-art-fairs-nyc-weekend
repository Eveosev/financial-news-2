Immerse yourself in some of the
numerous and confusing art fairs now taking place in the city.  The biggie is the annual Armory Show at the Hudson piers.
Nordic art is this year’s focus.  Pier 94 is more contemporary, while postwar modern work is
next door at Pier 92.  At the Park Avenue Armory, meanwhile, there’s the Art
Dealers Association, with 72 members exhibiting everything from
19th century works to cutting edge contemporary pieces by
Matthew Monahan and Sarah Sze.  Other venues are all around town -- here’s a guide.  The Piers are at 12th Avenue and 55th Street. Information:
+1-212-645-6440;  http://www.thearmoryshow.com .  The Armory is at 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-744-
8180;  http://www.artdealers.org .  Saturday Matinee  “ Gore Vidal ’s The Best Man,” about dirty tricks and
political infighting, made its Broadway debut in 1960. (In the
1964 film,  Henry Fonda  and Cliff Robertson played the leads.)  With a starry cast that includes James Earl Jones,  Angela Lansbury , John Larroquette, Eric McCormack and  Candice Bergen ,
this revival is sure to be far more entertaining than the
current presidential campaign.  As one character declares, “There is nothing like a low-
down political fight to put the roses in your cheeks!”  In previews at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, 236 W. 45th
St., for an April 1 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

 Metropolitan Opera ’s grand revival of Mussorgsky’s
“Khovanshchina.”  Kirill Petrenko is in the pit, drawing ardent performances
from orchestra and chorus.  Bass Anatoli Kotscherga makes a formidable appearance as
the elder Khovansky, while Olga Borodina sings Marfa, the doomed
mystic.  By the time the flames rise around the Old Believers,
you’ll be overwhelmed.  Runs through March 17 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-
212-362-6000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org .  On a different note, the Allman Brothers Band is in New
York for its annual spring run at the Beacon Theatre.  The group, which won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award
earlier this year, is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the
1972 live album “Eat a Peach.”  Runs through March 25 at the Beacon, 2124 Broadway.
Information: +1-212-465-6500;  http://www.beacontheatre.com .  Sunday  Take a look at youthful self-portraits created by Rembrandt
and Degas, for the first time seen side by side.  During his 20s, Degas was in  Italy  studying the Old
Masters, whose reputation was reviving after a period of
decline.  You can see him making contact with the Dutch artist in
“Young Man in a Velvet Cap, After Rembrandt” (1857).  Focused on self-portraits and prints, the show allows you
to explore the Old Master’s influence on the young
Impressionist.  “Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man” runs through May 20 at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art,
1000 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-535-7710;
 http://www.metmuseum.org .  Stroll over to Brasserie Julien for some French-inflected
food. Sip a Parisian Mojito, savor some homemade country pate,
and then work your way through a pot of Prince Edward Island
mussels or a cheese fondue.  At 1422 Third Ave. Information: +1-212-744-6327.  Sunday Matinee  Patti LuPone ,  Richard Thomas , Mary Beth Hurt and James
Yaegashi are just a few of the performers appearing in  New
York ’s “Shinsai: Theaters for  Japan .”  It’s a benefit for the Japanese theatrical community
devastated by last year’s earthquake and nuclear accident.  Ten-minute plays and mini musicals by artists including
 Edward Albee ,  Stephen Sondheim , Shoki Kokami, Oriza Hirata,
Suzan-Lori Parks, John Guare and Tony Kushner will be presented
under the direction of Bartlett Sher.  Performances are at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Great Hall at
Cooper Union, 3rd Avenue at 7th Street. Tickets, $25 for each
performance, are available online and at the Public Theater Box
Office, 425 Lafayette St.  Information: +1-212-967-7555;  http://www.publictheater.org .  Sunday Afternoon  When you hear a lively chorus singing “Twenty love-sick
maidens we,” it can only be Gilbert and Sullivan.  Head to Symphony Space for “Patience,” a spoof of white-
hot celebrity and its attendant squealing fans.  First performed in 1881, the comic opera makes fun of
battling rival poets, Reginald Bunthorne of the fleshly school,
and the idyllic Archibald Grosvenor, as well as their swooning
female devotees.  The New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players perform, with
Albert Bergeret conducting a 25-piece orchestra.  At 2537 Broadway. Information: +1-212-864-5400;
