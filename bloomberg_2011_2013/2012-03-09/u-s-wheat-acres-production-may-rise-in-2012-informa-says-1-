U.S. farmers may increase the area
planted with wheat to 57.745 million acres in 2012, less than
expected last month,  Informa Economics Inc.  said today in a
report to clients.  In January, the Memphis, Tennessee-based researcher
predicted 57.905 million acres would be sown, and the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said Feb. 24 that wheat planting would
rise to 58 million acres, up from an estimated 54.409 million
last year.  Production of all wheat varieties may rise to 2.276 billion
bushels from 1.999 billion harvested a year earlier, Informa
said. In January, Informa forecast a crop of 2.272 billion. The
USDA forecast a crop of 2.165 billion in February.  Spring wheat may be planted on 13.793 million acres,
compared with Januaryâ€™s forecast of 13.493 million, Informa
said. Farmers sowed 12.394 million acres in 2011. Durum-wheat
planting may rise to 2.415 million acres from 1.369 million in
2011.  Winter wheat was planted on 41.537 million acres from
September to December, up from 40.646 million a year earlier,
Informa said. The USDA said Jan. 12 that farmers planted 41.947
million. Farmers will harvest 1.623 billion bushels, up from
1.494 billion a year earlier, Informa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
