Latvia ’s  economy  expanded at a
quicker pace than previously estimated in the fourth quarter as
trade, manufacturing and construction grew.  Gross domestic product rose a revised 5.7 percent from a
year earlier, compared with an initial 5 percent estimate, the
 statistics office  in the capital, Riga, said today. It grew 1.1
percent from the previous quarter and 5.5 percent in the whole
of 2011.  The Baltic nation’s  economy  has been growing for two years
after a debt-fueled property bubble burst, export markets closed
and lending tightened, erasing almost a quarter of GDP. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for Latvia’s 2012
growth to 1.5 percent as turmoil in the euro area curbs export
and manufacturing growth.  Trade expanded 8.5 percent from a year earlier, while
manufacturing rose 9.1 percent and construction grew 25.9
percent, according to the statistics office.  The country exited a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.9 billion)
lending program from a group led by the European Commission and
the IMF in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
