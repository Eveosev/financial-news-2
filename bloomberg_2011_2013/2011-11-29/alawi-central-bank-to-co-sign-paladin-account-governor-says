Malawi’s central bank said it will
be a co-signatory to an offshore account held by a unit of
 Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) , which mines uranium in the north of the
country.  “It is common knowledge in any country that proceeds of
main exports are recorded as part of the foreign reserves of
that country,” Reserve Bank of Malawi Governor Perks Ligoya
said in a statement published in the Blantyre-based Daily Times
newspaper today. “We have now agreed with Paladin Africa Ltd.
that Reserve Bank of Malawi will be a co-signatory to the
offshore account. This will improve levels of accountability.”  Paladin, based in Perth, is the biggest investor in the
southern African nation’s mining industry, spending $500 million
since 2009, when its Kayelekera uranium mine became fully
operational. The southern African nation’s government holds a 15
percent stake in Paladin Africa, the unit through which the
Malawian assets are held.  Paladin Africa received the central bank’s request to be a
signatory to its offshore account in November last year and
provided it with the documents to enable this, International
Affairs General Manager Greg Walker said by phone today from the
capital, Lilongwe.  “Until today, the documents are still with the bank,”
Walker said. “Every month we send a report to the  Reserve Bank 
on the operations of Kayelekera because we believe in
transparency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
