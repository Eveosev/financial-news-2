Japan  aims to start a program to
work with companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
developing countries in 2013, according to a new set of  action
plans  to be introduced at the climate talks in Durban today.  The government has been preparing the bilateral offset
credit mechanism program to cut emissions by establishing energy
management systems and forest protection projects with Japanese
companies such as  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  in developing
countries. This is the first time that Japan has said when it
wants to start the program.  Japan opposes an extension to the greenhouse gas
restrictions when the Kyoto Protocol treaty expires next year.
China and  India  say setting new limits under the treaty is
essential to keep the talks alive.  Japan has started feasibility studies to run the program in
28 countries and plans to expand consultations with more nations
than the five it is currently negotiating with, according to the
document.  Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda today reiterated the
country’s calls for a new global framework, instead of extending
Kyoto’s restrictions.  “We must hurry up in preparing a fair and effective legal
framework so the world can work together on climate change,” he
said during a meeting of cabinet ministers to approve the action
plans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
