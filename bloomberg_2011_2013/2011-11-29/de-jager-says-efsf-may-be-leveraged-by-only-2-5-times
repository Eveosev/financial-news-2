The euro area will probably manage
to leverage the 440 billion-euro European Financial Stability
Facility by no more than 2.5 times, Dutch Finance Minister Jan
Kees  de Jager  said.  “The situation is quite urgent and we need solutions
including an emergency fund,” De Jager told reporters today in
Brussels. “Obviously, for a lot countries, increasing
the EFSF is not an option now.”  “We have talks about leverage through private money,” De
Jager said. “We have to wait for the outcome of that, but
probably it will be between maybe two or 2.5 times an increase.
So not sufficent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
