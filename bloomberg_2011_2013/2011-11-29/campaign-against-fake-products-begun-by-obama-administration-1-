The Obama administration is starting
a public education campaign to fight the purchase and sale of
counterfeit and pirated products.  The campaign, announced at the White House today, is aimed
at highlighting the ways intellectual property theft, such as
counterfeit pharmaceuticals and illegal Internet downloads, harm
the economy and threaten consumer safety, according to a U.S.
Justice Department statement.  “For far too long, the sale of counterfeit, defective, and
dangerous goods has been perceived as business as usual,”
Attorney General Eric Holder said in a prepared statement. “But
these and other IP crimes can destroy jobs, suppress innovation,
and jeopardize the health and safety of consumers.”  The campaign will include radio and print ads, online
videos, podcasts and a television public service announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
