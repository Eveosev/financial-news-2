Nigeria  wants energy explorers to
invest in five previously unexplored basins known to have
potential for hydrocarbons reserves, Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said.  Areas identified include the Benue, Gongola and Anambra
basins as well as Bida and Sokoto, she said in a speech at a
conference today in Lagos, the commercial capital.  “The next 25 years is promising for Nigeria’s oil sector
with growth in hydrocarbons reserves,” Alison-Madueke said.  Nearly all of the oil currently pumped by  Africa ’s top oil
producer was discovered onshore and offshore the southern Niger
River delta. Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil
imports and its low-sulfur, light crude is valued by refiners
for the quantity of fuel it yields.  Nigeria produced 27 billion barrels of oil from 1958 to
2008, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
