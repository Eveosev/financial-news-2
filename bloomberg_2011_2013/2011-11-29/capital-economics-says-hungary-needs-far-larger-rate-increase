Capital Economics  comments on the
Hungarian central bank’s decision to raise the benchmark
interest rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent.  Neil Shearing , chief emerging markets economist, comments
in an e-mailed report today.  “If this afternoon’s 50 basis point hike in Hungarian
 interest rates  was intended to shore up the forint, the move has
flopped. But in truth it was always likely that a far larger
increase would be needed to strengthen the currency.  ‘‘With the euro crisis set to intensify and a deal with the
IMF still some way off, we think there remains a greater than
50:50 chance that the National Bank will be forced into more
aggressive interest rate hikes over the next three to six
months.  ‘‘The decision to hike interest rates was driven by growing
strains in Hungarian markets. This has been most evident in the
dramatic sell-off in the forint.  ‘‘But the  bond market  also appears to be in meltdown –
several debt auctions over the past month have failed.  ‘‘Meanwhile, there are mounting signs that Hungarian banks
are being increasingly squeezed in external funding markets.  ‘‘The problem is that in order to have a dramatic impact on
 market sentiment  the move needed to be large and, as things
stand, there appears to be no consensus in favor of an
aggressive hike in rates among policymakers. This seems to be
especially true of the government appointed external members of
the Council.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
