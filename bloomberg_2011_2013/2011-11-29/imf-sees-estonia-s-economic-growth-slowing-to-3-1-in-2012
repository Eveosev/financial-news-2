Estonia’s economy will slow next
year as export growth decelerates and business and consumer
confidence ebbs because of  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The Baltic nation’s economy may expand 3.1 percent in 2012
after growth of 7.5 percent this year, the Washington-based
lender said today in an e-mailed statement. Inflation will
probably average 3.1 percent next year, slowing from 5.1 percent
in 2011, it added.  Estonia is the fastest-growing country in the 27-member
European Union this year on higher export demand among its main
trading partners, Sweden and  Finland . Its $19 billion economy,
which adopted the euro in January, the first former Soviet
republic to do so, faces faltering foreign demand toward year-
end as the global economy slows, the European Commission said
Nov. 10.  “Estonia faces an increasingly challenging environment as
it looks to continue implementing policies preserving
macroeconomic policy credibility and safeguarding sustainable
growth,” the IMF wrote in the statement. “Estonia’s fiscal
position will remain strong but there will be a need to limit
the stimulative impact of the 2012 budget.”  The IMF’s growth forecast compares with the  Finance
Ministry ’s estimate of 3 percent expansion and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 3.2 percent
projection. Stockholm-based SEB AB last week reduced its 2012
growth outlook to 2 percent from 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
