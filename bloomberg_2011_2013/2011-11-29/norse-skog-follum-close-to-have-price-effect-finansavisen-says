Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  has
accounted for a 225 million-krone ($38 million) “market
effect” from the close of its Norwegian Follum paper mill,
Finansavisen reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Sven Ombudstvedt.  Viken Skog BA, a Norske Skog shareholder that had made a
bid on the mill, said it is “extremely” difficult to calculate
such an effect, the Oslo-based newspaper reported, citing the
Viken head Ragnhild Borchgrevink. Norske Skog announced last
week the shutdown of Follum after rebuffing a 280 million-krone
offer from Viken Skog, a forestry cooperative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
