Newedge Group SA, the brokerage
joint venture of  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,
named Michael Dann as global head of agriculture.  Dann, previously head of cocoa, coffee and sugar, takes
over from Franck Borgel, acting head of the team in the past six
months in addition to his position as chief operating officer of
fixed income, currency and commodities, Newedge said in an e-
mailed  statement  today.  The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of agricultural commodities
advanced 8.5 percent in the past two years,  compared  with a 0.5
percent decline for the MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities. World food prices tracked by the  United Nations ’ Food
and Agriculture Organization reached a  record  in February.  “Michael’s experience in the sector, combined with the
respect he has earned from colleagues and clients as an
established leader within Newedge, positions him and the team
well to drive continued success,” John Fay, global head of
fixed income, currency and commodities, said in the statement.  Dann started his career in 1980 with Marshall French &
Lucas in  New York , according to the broker.  Newedge named Paul Prescott and Jonathan Proctor as joint
heads of cocoa, coffee and sugar to replace Dann, spokesman
Richard Newmann said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
