Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
bankrupt investment bank seeking approval for a $65 billion
liquidation plan next month, named a committee to select
directors to oversee the process.  The selection committee of creditors’ representatives will
include Thomas Tormey of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , part of a
group that proposed an alternative liquidation plan; Christian Wyatt of Fir Tree Partners, representing a so-called ad hoc
group; and Noel Purcell of Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., co-
chairman of an existing creditor committee, according to a court
filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  Robert Ryan  of Elliott Management Corp., the defunct firm’s
president, John Suckow, and liquidators of Lehman affiliates,
also are on the list.  Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
in September 2008, has said it can probably get a judge’s
approval for a plan to pay an estimated $370 billion in claims,
with distributions starting early next year.  Lehman filed for bankruptcy with $613 billion in debt.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
