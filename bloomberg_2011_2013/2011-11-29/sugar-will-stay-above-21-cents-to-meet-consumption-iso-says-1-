Sugar prices will stay above 21
cents a pound in the next two or three years to encourage
producers to boost output and meet increased demand, according
to the London-based International Sugar Organization.  Global sugar consumption will climb to 201 million metric
tons by 2020, driven by demand in the Indian subcontinent and
the  Far East , Leonardo Bichara, a senior economist at ISO, said
in an interview at the organization’s conference in  London 
today. Usage in the current season will be 167.8 million tons,
according to ISO estimates.  Raw sugar prices have dropped 27 percent in  New York 
this year on speculation of ample supplies. Global sugar
production will exceed demand by 4.5 million tons in the season
started last month after two years of shortage, the ISO
estimated in its latest monthly report.  “The cost of production is very high,” Bichara said.
“Production this year will rise because of favorable weather.
Prices need to remain high to stimulate production growth.”  Raw sugar for March delivery advanced 0.8 percent to 23.3
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. by 5:23 p.m. in London.  The  Indian subcontinent  and the Far East will account for
47 percent of the total demand by 2020, he said. Indian use of
the sweetener will total 32.7 million tons by 2020, and  China 
will surpass the European Union as the second-largest global
consumer by that year, he said, with China using 22.1 million
tons by 2020.  Brazil ’s Share  The world will need 18.5 million tons of sugar by 2020 from
countries other than top producers Brazil and India to meet
demand, Bichara said. Brazil’s share of world sugar production
will be little changed at 23 percent due to high production
costs, he said.  “In the next 10 years, the world will need to count on
sugar from other countries even if Brazil and  India  keep their
position as the top producers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
