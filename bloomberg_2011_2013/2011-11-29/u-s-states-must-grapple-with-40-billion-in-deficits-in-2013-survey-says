U.S. states must tackle at least $40
billion in budget gaps in the year beginning in July as federal
stimulus funds decrease and expenses rise, according to a survey
released today by the  National Governors Association  and the
 National Association of State Budget Officers .  Not all states have made forecasts for that year -- only 17
made deficit predictions -- and most are still grappling with
shortfalls for fiscal 2012, which total $95 billion, the groups
said. Revenue, while improved in 2012, won’t meet costs in areas
such as health care and prisons, the report said.  “Growth is weak and there is not enough money for all of
the bills coming in,” saidScott Pattison, executive director
of the budget officers group, in a statement. “State officials
will still be cutting some programs, and increases in funding
for any program except for health care will be rare.”  So far in the fiscal year, 15 states are seeing revenue
outpace estimates, 22 states are in line, and seven are
recording lower-than-expected collections. The national economy
may harm revenue collection, the survey said.  States are also limiting their flexibility by letting tax
increases expire, according to the paper. Their budgets reflect
a decrease of $2.6 billion in levies and fees, the report said.  Officials will have less room to maneuver in emergencies,
with reserves, deemed by the groups as a “crucial tool,”
making up 6.2 percent of expenditures in fiscal 2012, compared
with 12 percent in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
