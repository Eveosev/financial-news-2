Q-Cells SE , a German solar panel
maker, said its Solibro unit developed a test thin-film panel
with record aperture efficiency.  A lab-scale module based on Solibro’s CIGS technology
converted 17.4 percent of the light’s energy into power in a
test confirmed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy
Systems ISE, Thalheim-based Q-Cells said today in a website
 statement .  The test module that reached the efficiency “was
fabricated using processes fully scalable to cost-effective mass
production,” Q-Cells said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
