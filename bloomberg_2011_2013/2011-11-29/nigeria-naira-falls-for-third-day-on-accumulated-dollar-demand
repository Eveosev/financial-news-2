Nigeria ’s naira depreciated for a
third day against the dollar on accumulated demand after the
central bank failed to meet lenders’ requests at successive
foreign-currency auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.7
percent, before paring the loss to 0.4 percent at 160.83 per
dollar in interbank trading at 3:58 p.m. in Lagos. Nigeria sold
$200 million at an auction yesterday, less than the $315.6
million  sought  by lenders, failing to meet demand for the third
straight auction.  “The central bank has underfunded the market at the
official currency auction, thereby raising dollar demand at the
interbank,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive of Lagos-based
Valuechain Investment Ltd., which trades in currencies, said
today by phone. “There is high dollar demand for imports toward
the year-end and unless central bank intervenes, the naira will
remain under pressure for the rest of today.”  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange rate band at its twice-weekly auctions to 155 naira per
dollar from 150 naira, amid pressure from rising imports and
concern about weakening  oil prices , the source of more than 95
percent of Nigeria’s foreign-exchange income.  Ghana ’s cedi fell for a fifth session, declining 0.4
percent to 1.65 per dollar, at 3:58 p.m. in Accra, the lowest on
record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
