     Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Italy ’s new government must promote
broadband services for the country to bring the use of the
technology up to the levels of other European nations,  Telecom
Italia SpA  Chief Executive Officer Franco Bernabe said.  Growth in broadband use in Italy may narrow to 2.5 percent
this year from 6.5 percent in 2010, the CEO told a Senate
committee in Rome today.  “At that pace, Italy can’t overcome the significant delay
in broadband penetration built up in regard to other European
countries,” he said.  Bernabe said two important trend reversals occurred in the
third quarter of the year.  “There was less demand for access to fixed-line by
alternative operators, and on the other side there were overall
fewer broadband lines,” Bernabe said. This means “that all
operators are going to have to cut their  labor force .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
