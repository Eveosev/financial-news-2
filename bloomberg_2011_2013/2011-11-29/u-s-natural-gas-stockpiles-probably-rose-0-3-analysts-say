U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose last week as mild weather limited heating demand, according
to analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg  before a weekly
government report.  Inventories gained 10 billion cubic feet, or 0.3 percent,
to 3.862 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Nov. 25, based on
the median of five estimates. The five-year average change for
the week is a decrease of 29 billion cubic feet, according to
Energy Department data. Supplies fell 21 billion cubic feet a
year earlier.  Temperatures were mostly normal or above-normal in the
eastern and central U.S. last week, according to MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Gas  stockpiles  for the week
ended Nov. 18 totaled a record 3.852 trillion cubic feet, 6.4
percent above the five-year average for the week and 0.6 above
year-earlier levels.  A storage injection “would further strengthen the surplus
to both 2010 and the five-year average,” said Eric Bickel, an
analyst at Summit Energy Services Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky ,
a subsidiary of Schneider Electric SA. Heating demand in the
eastern U.S. was lower than normal last week, Bickel said.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 2 billion
to 18 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. Dec. 1 in
 Washington .  If analysts’ estimates are correct, the injection of 10
billion cubic feet would be the largest increase in supplies for
the fourth week of November since 2001.  The low temperature in  New York  on Nov. 20 was 49 degrees
Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 9 above normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The low in  Chicago  was 40
degrees, 7 above normal.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 22.6 cents, or 6.8
percent, to $3.542 per million British thermal units last week
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today gained 10.8
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $3.633.  To contact the reporter on this story:
