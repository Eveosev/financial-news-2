U.S. stocks rose, after the biggest
gain in a month for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as consumer
confidence increased by the most since 2003 and European finance
ministers discussed efforts to tame the debt crisis.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  added 1.4 percent, pacing an advance in
energy shares, as oil rallied.  Yahoo! Inc.  jumped 2.3 percent as
 Thomas H. Lee Partners  is said to be considering a bid. Hewlett-
Packard Co. gained 1.4 percent after  RBC Capital Markets  raised
its rating for the shares. Gauges of technology and financial
stocks in the  S&P 500  fell.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  sank 3.2
percent.  AMR (AMR)  Corp. lost 84 percent after filing for bankruptcy.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,195.19 at 4 p.m. New York
time, rallying 3.2 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 32.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,555.63. The
Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 0.5 percent to 2,515.51. The
Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies, which gained 4.8
percent yesterday, declined 0.3 percent to 696.10 today.  “Consumer confidence will be critical to how we weather
the next few months,” Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than
$20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-
banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland, said in a telephone
interview. “Everybody is still on the edge of their chair about
whether or not you get the financial crisis solved in  Europe .”  The S&P 500 yesterday snapped a seven-day decline after
Thanksgiving-weekend sales rose to a record and amid speculation
European leaders will boost efforts to end the debt crisis. The
 benchmark gauge (SPX)  is still down 4.6 percent in November as a
measure of financial shares tumbled 11 percent.  Consumer Confidence  Stocks extended gains today after a report showed that
consumer confidence snapped back more than forecast in November
as Americans turned less pessimistic on the outlook for jobs.
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said the central bank
has leeway to spur the U.S. recovery by purchasing more assets.
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
in a separate speech that expanding securities purchases is
unlikely to give a sufficient boost to U.S. growth.  Europe’s effort to expand its bailout fund is falling
short, forcing euro-area finance ministers to consider greater
roles for the  International Monetary Fund  and the  European
Central Bank  to insulate Spain and Italy from the debt crisis. A
plan hammered out last month to expand the  European Financial
Stability Facility ’s firepower to 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) with leveraging will be “very difficult to reach,”
Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden told reporters today.  Energy shares had the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among 10
industries, rising 1.5 percent as a group. Exxon Mobil advanced
1.4 percent to $76.93. The Dow Jones Transportation Average
added 0.6 percent amid optimism about economic growth.  Yahoo Rallies  Yahoo gained 2.3 percent to $15.70. Thomas H. Lee Partners
joins a list of companies that are sizing up offers for Yahoo.
Private-equity firm Silver Lake is working with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
to bid for a minority stake in Yahoo, two other people familiar
with the matter said. Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital
firm, may join the Silver Lake-led group, another person said.  Hewlett-Packard added 1.4 percent to $26.90. The company
was raised to “outperform” from “sector perform” at RBC
Capital Markets. The 12-month share-price estimate is $32.  An index of technology shares in the S&P 500 lost 0.7
percent as  Corning Inc. (GLW)  sank 11 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $13.19. The world’s largest maker of glass for flat-
panel televisions cut its fourth-quarter earnings forecast
because of the loss of a contract and price declines for glass.  Banks Slump  Some of the biggest financial companies retreated. Bank of
America lost 3.2 percent, the most in the Dow, to $5.08.  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  declined 3.6 percent to $13.31. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
slid 2.1 percent to $28.56.  AMR tumbled 84 percent to 26 cents. With the filing,
American became the last of the so-called U.S. legacy airlines
to seek court protection from creditors. The company, which
traces its roots to 1920s air-mail operations in the Midwest,
listed $24.7 billion in assets and $29.6 billion in debt in
Chapter 11 papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.  Rivals gained.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  surged 6.3
percent to $17.63 and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  rallied 5 percent to
$7.80. The two largest U.S. carriers stand to benefit from AMR’s
bankruptcy, analysts said.  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  slid 8.7 percent to $67.22. The second-
largest luxury jewelry retailer cited “weaknesses” in sales in
Europe and the eastern U.S. as the holiday season began.  Facebook Inc.  Facebook Inc. is considering raising about $10 billion in
an initial public offering that would value the world’s largest
social-networking site at more than $100 billion, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. The company may file for the IPO
before the end of the year, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private.  The S&P 500 will probably be stuck in a 250-point range
next year as Europe’s debt crisis offsets optimism about U.S.
earnings, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The benchmark index for U.S. equities will most likely
fluctuate between 1,100 and 1,350, forming an “inside-range
year” by staying roughly within the band seen this year, said
Michael Krauss, JPMorgan’s New York-based head of technical
research. He sees a 12 percent chance of an economic recession
that would push the S&P 500 as low as 800. The odds of the index
rising to 1,500 because of progress on the crisis or stimulus
from central banks are 8 percent, Krauss said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
