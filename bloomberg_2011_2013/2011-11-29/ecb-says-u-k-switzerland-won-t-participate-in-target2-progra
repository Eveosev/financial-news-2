The U.K. and Switzerland won’t
participate in  Europe ’s planned Target2 Securities settlement
platform, the  European Central Bank  said.  “In the last few months, the Bank of England and the  Swiss
National Bank  have informed the Eurosystem that they will not
participate in T2S with their national currencies -- at least at
the beginning,” Jean-Michel Godeffroy, chairman of the TS2
Program Board, wrote in a quarterly review published on the
Frankfurt-based ECB’s website today. He said this will not
result in any change in pricing.  The settlements system for securities such as stocks and
bonds is being set up by the ECB to consolidate the existing
fragmented system in Europe. Godeffroy said the ECB’s Governing
Council has approved the framework agreement for T2S, which
promises to cut cross-border settlement fees by about 90 percent
and is due to begin operation in September 2014.  The  Bank of England  has in the past complained that the T2S
system would cede too much control to the ECB and that it wasn’t
clear that the costs of setting up the platform would be fully
recovered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
