U.S. Representative  Barney Frank ,
the Massachusetts Democrat planning to retire the end of his
current two-year term, said the possible election of a
Republican president could lead to the undoing of the financial
regulation law that bears his name.  “The most significant danger is the election of a
Republican president next year who would be committed to first
try and dismantle it and failing that, appoint people who
wouldn’t administer it,” Frank, the top Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, said today at a Washington news
conference where he discussed his decision to leave Congress.  Frank pointed to Republican presidential contenders,
including former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , Texas Governor
Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Governor  Mitt Romney , who
have said they would repeal the Dodd-Frank Act law if elected.
Republican lawmakers were nearly unanimous in opposing the
measure when it was passed last year, and they have continued to
complain that it over-regulates and fails to address problems
that contributed to the 2008 credit crisis.  In a wide-ranging, 55-minute news conference, Frank, 71,
said he wouldn’t want to serve as secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development after he leaves Congress at end of
next year. He said he would continue to defend Dodd-Frank after
he steps down.  The sovereign debt crisis in  Europe  has “held back” the
nation’s recovery, Frank said, adding that he believes U.S.
banks are “well prepared to deal with this unless everything
falls apart.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
