U.S. stocks trimmed gains as
declines in technology and financial shares tempered an early
rally triggered by a bigger-than-estimated jump in consumer
confidence.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,194.74 at 1:56 p.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.9
percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
