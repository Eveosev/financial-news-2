The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars reached two-week highs against their U.S. counterpart
after six developed-nation central banks acted to make more
funds available to lenders as Europe’s crisis threatens global
economic growth.  The South Pacific currencies gained earlier after  China  cut
the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves for the
first time since 2008, increasing demand for higher-yielding
assets. The Aussie gained for a fifth day versus the yen, the
longest stretch in more than a month, as business investment
rose more than economists forecast in the third quarter.  “It’s a way of alleviating the problem,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in
New York, referring to the central banks’ coordinated action.
“This is about couching confidence in the best way they
possibly can, which is good for risk.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 2.4 percent to $1.0243 at 12:14
p.m. in New York and touched $1.0328, the strongest level since
Nov. 14. The Aussie strengthened 2 percent to 79.49 yen after
reaching 80.04 yen, the highest since Nov. 9. Its last five-day
winning streak against  Japan ’s currency ended Oct. 10.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 2 percent
to 77.65 U.S. cents and reached 78.23, the highest level since
Nov. 14. It appreciated 1.6 percent to 60.25 yen.  Stocks climbed, with the MSCI World Index up 3.3 percent.  Dollar Swap Lines  The  Federal Reserve  and five other central banks agreed to
reduce the  interest rate  on dollar liquidity swap lines and
extend their authorization through Feb. 1, 2013. The rate was
cut to the dollar overnight index swap rate plus 50 basis
points, or half a percentage point, from 100 basis points, the
Fed said in a statement in Washington. The Bank of Canada, Bank
of England, Bank of Japan,  European Central Bank  and Swiss
National Bank are part of the coordinated move, the Fed said.  The People’s Bank of China separately said reserve ratios
will decline by 50 basis points effective Dec. 5. The move may
add 350 billion yuan ($55 billion) to the financial system,
according to UBS AG.  Australia’s statistics agency said private  capital
expenditure  rose 12.3 percent in the three months through
September. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for an 8 percent increase.  The kiwi climbed for a third day against the dollar after
home-building permits increased 11.2 percent from September,
when they slumped 17.2 percent, Statistics New Zealand said
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
