Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  canceled a trip to the Netherlands this week after
Hungary said it wouldn’t allow his plane to enter its airspace,
Iran’s  Shargh  newspaper said, citing an official in Tehran.  Hungary said the refusal to give clearance to the aircraft
was due to technical problems, an explanation the unidentified
Foreign Ministry official described as unconvincing, the Tehran-
based paper reported. The ministry has sought an explanation
from the Hungarian ambassador in Tehran, it said.  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said the decision was based
on European Union air-safety rules and unrelated to sanctions
against Iran. “The aircraft which the Iranian foreign minister
planned to use is on a banned list, according to a European
Commission directive relating to flight safety,” the ministry
in Budapest said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Accordingly, its entry into EU airspace can’t be permitted.”
Also,  Iran  requested entry one day before the flight, instead of
the 15 days needed, the ministry said.  Salehi was scheduled to attend an annual conference of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The
Hague held this week, the newspaper said. As a former head of
Iran’s atomic energy agency, he had been banned from traveling
to  Europe  by sanctions imposed in response to his country’s
nuclear program, the newspaper said. The ban was removed after
he was appointed foreign minister in January, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
