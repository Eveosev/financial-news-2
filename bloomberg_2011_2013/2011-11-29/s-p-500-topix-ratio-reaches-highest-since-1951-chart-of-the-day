Japanese stocks are lagging behind
U.S. equities by the most in 61 years, a sign that the  Tokyo 
Stock Exchange’s Topix Index may be poised to rally.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the so-called ST Ratio,
compiled by dividing the price of the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index by the Japanese measure, rose to 1.73 times on Nov. 11,
the highest since January 1951, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While the  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed 76 percent from March 9, 2009, when
markets bottomed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., through Nov. 28, the Topix rose just 0.7 percent. The
middle graph tracks the two indexes, and the lower panel
compares U.S. and Japanese 10-year bond yields.  The differential has averaged 1, meaning the two benchmark
gauges were equally priced, from 2000. The ratio is likely to
narrow, tracking what’s already happened in the  bond market  and
the outlook for corporate earnings, said Manabu Tamaru, a senior
investment manager at Baring Asset Management in Tokyo.  “The ST ratio is one of the ways to measure the relative
underperformance or outperformance between Japanese and U.S.
shares, and some investors use it for arbitrage trading,” said
Tamaru.  Earnings per share for companies in the  Topix  may increase
38 percent on average in the next 12 months, compared with 8.9
percent for the  S&P 500 , according to analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Stocks in the Topix trade at about 0.9 times
estimated book value, meaning they can be bought for less than
the value of their net assets, compared with 1.9 times for
companies in the U.S. measure.  “It’s easy for funds to head straight into Japanese
equities as they are cheap, being below 1 times book value,”
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co., said. “If investors start
to have a risk-on attitude, the ST ratio will begin to decline
as funds stream into  Japan  over and above what flows into U.S.
stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
