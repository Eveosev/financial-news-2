The  European Central Bank  alloted
265.5 billion euros ($355 billion) to banks in its seven-day
main refinancing operation, the most in more than two years.  That’s up from 247.2 billion euros at the previous weekly
refinancing auction conducted at a fixed rate of 1.25 percent.
The number of bidders was 192 compared with last week’s 178,
according to the Frankfurt-based central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
