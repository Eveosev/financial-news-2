Hungaryâ€™s parliament passed laws
abolishing early pensions and banning the construction of retail
units larger than 300 square meters, the state news service  MTI 
said late yesterday.  Under the new law, only women with 40 years of employment
will be entitled to an early retirement pension from Jan. 1,
while artists, miners, mayors, members of parliament and members
of the armed forces will have to work until the  retirement age 
to receive a pension, according to MTI.  Early retirement pensions already being paid will be
subject to personal income tax from next year, MTI said.  The ban on shopping centers may remain in place through
2014 and exemptions can be granted by the economy minister, the
news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
