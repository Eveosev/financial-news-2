Vietnam ’s two-year government bonds
snapped a three-day rally on speculation banks have less funds
to invest in the debt as the end of the year approaches. The
dong was steady.  The Southeast Asian nation will celebrate the Lunar New
Year, also known as the Tet festival, from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  “Commercial lenders are not interested in bonds as they
need to ensure liquidity ahead of the Lunar New Year, when
residents usually withdraw deposits,” said Tran Thi Ngoc Thanh,
deputy manager of the investment-banking division at Sacombank
Securities Joint-Stock Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City .  Yields  on the two-year debt rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 12.49 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 21,009 per dollar as of 4:26 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank set the  reference rate  at 20,803, unchanged since Oct. 28,
its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
