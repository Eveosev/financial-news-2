Estonia is increasingly losing
doctors to the wealthier countries of Finland and  Sweden ,  Eesti
Paeevaleht  reported, citing union representatives and social
ministry data.  About 1,000 Estonian doctors are working mainly in Finland
and Sweden where they earn wages up to four times higher than at
home, the Tallinn-based newspaper reported. Some 80 percent of
final-year medical students at  Tartu University , the only one
providing higher medical education, have started studying
Finnish, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
