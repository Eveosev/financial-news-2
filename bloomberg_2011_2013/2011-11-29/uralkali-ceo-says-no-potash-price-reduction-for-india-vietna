OAO Uralkali ,  Russia ’s largest
fertilizer maker by market value, has no plans to cut potash
prices for India after importers in the Asian country asked for
a discount as the rupee slumped against the dollar.  “There won’t be a price revision,” Chief Executive
Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said in a telephone interview.
“We cannot offer discounts for individual markets while global
demand is high and our plants are working at full capacity.”  India’s rupee fell to a record 52.73 per dollar during
trading on Nov. 22 on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt
demand for emerging market assets, prompting fertilizer
importers to ask suppliers to lower prices.  Uralkali (URKA)  has no plans to cut potash prices for  Vietnam 
either, Baumgertner said. The company’s trader Belarusian Potash
Co. agreed to sell about 275,000 tons of potash to Vietnam next
year for about $140 million, Belta reported today.  It’s a “misinterpretation” to assume those numbers
indicate a reduced price of $509 a ton, Baumgertner said.  “BPC signed a framework agreement, stating indicative
sales volumes only,” Baumgertner said. “The price for Vietnam
remains linked to the Southeast Asian spot price, which is now
$535 a ton.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
