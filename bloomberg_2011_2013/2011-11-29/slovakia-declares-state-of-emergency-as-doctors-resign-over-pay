The Slovak government declared a
state of emergency in 15 public hospitals after about 2,000
doctors resigned over low wages.  The state of emergency is effective today and will allow
the government to force doctors to remain in their jobs
regardless of their resignations effective on Dec. 1 or face
prison terms, Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  said late yesterday
in Bratislava, Slovakia.  The government has offered doctors a pay rise of 300 euros
($401) per month, which the doctorsâ€™ union considered
inadequate. The Health Ministry said the increase is the maximum
possible at a time when the second-poorest euro-region nation is
facing an economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
