Kenyan inflation accelerated to
19.72 percent in November as food and fuel costs increased,
adding to chances the central bank will raise interest rates
this week.  The  inflation  rate rose from 18.91 percent in October, the
Nairobi-based  Kenya  National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement today. Prices rose 1.52 percent in the month.  The shilling slumped 19 percent against the dollar in the
first nine months of the year, boosting import costs, including
fuel. Kenya’s central bank, led by Governor Njuguna Ndung’u,
raised its benchmark  interest rate  by 10.25 percentage points to
a record 16.5 percent in the past four months to help bolster
the shilling and curb inflation. Ndung’u said on Nov. 25 the
bank will continue to keep a “tight” monetary policy stance
until price pressures ease.  “Fuel prices are going up, and that ripples to other
sectors like transportation costs, hotels, almost every other
constituent of the  consumer price index ,” Renaldo D’Souza, an
analyst at Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview from
Nairobi before today’s data.  The shilling has gained 11 percent against the dollar since
the beginning of October, ranking it as the world’s best-
performer out of more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The government raised gasoline prices by 3 percent on Nov.
15. The central bank, which will make its next rate decision on
Dec. 1, is struggling to bring inflation below the government’s
target of between 7 percent and 11 percent in the fiscal year
ending June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
