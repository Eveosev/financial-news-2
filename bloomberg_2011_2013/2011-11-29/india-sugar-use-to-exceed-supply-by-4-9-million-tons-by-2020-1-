India ’s sugar consumption may
outpace output by 4.9 million metric tons by 2020, according to
Narendra Murkumbi, president of the Indian Sugar Mills
Association and director at Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd.  Sugar usage in the world’s biggest consumer may be 31.3
million tons compared with output of 26.4 million tons, he said
at a conference in London today.  Sugar consumption in India is growing at a faster rate than
production, he said. Land availability is limiting expansion of
sugar cane planting in the country, he said.  India is the world’s second-largest producer of
the sweetener, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
