A group of Chinese solar makers said
a U.S. petition to impose duties on imports from  China  would
hurt consumers.  A statement from the solar makers today said the U.S. solar
industry benefits from Chinese solar exports and said a probe by
the U.S. Department of Commerce will hurt the environment.  The U.S. unit of Bonn-based  SolarWorld AG (SWV)  and six other
companies asked the Obama administration to impose duties on
Chinese imports they say are being dumped with low-cost credit
from state-run banks. A U.S. International Trade Commission
panel will vote on whether thereâ€™s a case to continue with a
probe on Dec. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
