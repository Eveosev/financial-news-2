Northeast Utilities (NU) , owner of
Connecticut’s largest utility, tripled the amount of money it
has set aside for customers who lost power after an Oct. 29
snowstorm and said the fund will be administered by
 Kenneth Feinberg , the lawyer who oversaw payments to the
families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.  The company boosted the fund to $30 million from $10
million.  The initial sum was “insufficient,” Chief Executive
Officer Charles Shivery said in a statement today.  The reaction to the storm by  Connecticut Light and Power , a
unit of Northeast Utilities, is being studied by a panel formed
by Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat. Connecticut
Attorney General George Jepsen has asked state regulators to
review how the utility responded to the storm, which left some
residents without power for more than a week.  Feinberg, who designed and administered the Sept. 11
Victim Compensation Fund, agreed to help run the fund at the
request of Governor Malloy, according to the statement.  “Today’s announcement demonstrates our sincere desire to
keep faith with our CL&P customers by assisting those who were
without power the longest,” Shivery said in the statement.  Jeffrey Butler, CL&P’s president and chief operating
officer, resigned Nov. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
