Penta Investments Ltd., a Czech and
Slovak private equity group, filed a bid for the minerals and
metals unit of bankrupt Austrian engineering group  A-Tec
Industries AG (ATEC) , according to spokesman Martin Danko.  “We filed a bid for the unit,” Danko said in a phone
interview today without providing further comment.  A-Tec administrator Matthias Schmidt exercised his right to
start liquidating the group after it failed to raise by Sept. 30
funds required under a restructuring agreed with creditors last
year. Schmidt is seeking to sell all of A-Tec’s assets and pay
out the proceeds exclusively to creditors.  The administrator sold 98 percent of its ATB electric drive
unit to  China ’s Wolong Investment GmbH, a subsidiary of the
Asian nation’s Wolong Group, on Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
