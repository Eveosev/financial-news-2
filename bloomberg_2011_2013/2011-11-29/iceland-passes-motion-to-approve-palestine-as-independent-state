Iceland’s parliament passed a motion
to allow the government to ratify the Palestine Authority as an
independent country based on borders before the 1967 Six-Day
War.  The parliament called on Iceland’s government to
acknowledge the independence and said that the  Palestine
Liberation Organization  is the legitimate representative of all
the Palestinian people, according to the  motion .  The Althingi “also reiterates the right of Palestinian
refugees to return to their former homes in accordance to the
repeated resolutions of the  United Nations .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
