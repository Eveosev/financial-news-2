residential and office towers, rose 1.7 percent to 1.80 pesos,
ending a seven-day losing streak, after the government said it
won’t allow “big adjustments” in borrowing costs and Filinvest
Land Inc. President Joseph Yap forecast “steady growth” in the
real-estate market.  SM Prime Holdings Inc. (SMPH)  , the
nation’s largest builder of malls, rose 2.3 percent to 12.66
pesos, the sharpest gain since Nov. 8.  Belle Corp. (BEL)

stake in PhiGold Ltd. for $5 million, a stock-exchange filing
showed. The exchange said it suspended the shares “pending
compliance by the company with requirements” on disclosure
rules related to substantial acquisitions.  San Miguel Corp. (SMC)  , the nation’s biggest food and
drinks company, sank 2.3 percent to 122.80 pesos, the sharpest
loss since Nov. 10, after Marco Sardillo, executive director of
the Presidential Commission on Good Government, said the
solicitor general will ask the Supreme Court to reinstate its
appeal against a ruling upholding Chairman Eduardo Cojuangco’s
ownership of 20 percent of the company.  The  Supreme Court  ruled in July that the government had
failed to prove its case that Cojuangco had used public money he
managed in the 1980s to build a stake in San Miguel. He left the
country with former dictator  Ferdinand Marcos  in 1986 and was
reinstated as San Miguel chairman in 1998, when Joseph Estrada
was president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
