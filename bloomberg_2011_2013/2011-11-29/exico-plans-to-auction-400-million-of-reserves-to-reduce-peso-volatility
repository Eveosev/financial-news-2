Mexico ’s central bank will auction
$400 million of reserves starting Nov. 30 when the peso weakens
more than 2 percent.  The Banco de Mexico will offer the $400 million “via
auctions at an  exchange rate , as a minimum, will be 2 percent
greater than the exchange rate determined the previous working
day,” according to an e-mailed  statement  today from the nation’s
Currency Exchange Commission.  The measure aims to increase liquidity, the commission
said.  “It basically shows that Banxico is not getting
comfortable with the peso at these levels,” said Ram Bala Chandran, a Latin American currency and rates strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in a telephone interview from  New York . “It sort
of puts a cap on Mexico peso selloff in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
