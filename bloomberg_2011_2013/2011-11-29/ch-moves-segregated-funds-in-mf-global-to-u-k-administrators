LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the largest
interest-rate swap clearinghouse, passed all segregated client
money caught in the collapse of  MF Global U.K. Ltd. (MF)  to the
broker’s administrators, enabling KPMG LLP to return the funds.  The clearinghouse completed the transfer of more than 300
client positions to a clearing member of their choice, London-
based LCH.Clearnet said in a statement today. MF Global’s 14.7
billion euros ($20 billion) of fixed-income positions have been
liquidated, with a few exceptions. The process of managing the
remaining positions is “virtually complete,” the company said.  “We have managed the situation within margin and without
recourse to the default fund,” Ian Axe, chief executive officer
of LCH.Clearnet, said the statement.  MF Global Holdings  Ltd., the New York-based parent company,
sought  bankruptcy protection  in the U.S. last month after bets
on European debt soured. MF Global’s U.K. unit followed the
parent into administration. The broker’s British customers’
funds were frozen and put in a client money pool.  MF Global’s U.K. administrators have said they plan to
return some money to the collapsed broker’s clients by March.
KPMG, MF Global’s U.K. administrator, has asked clients to
submit claims for money and assets held by the broker by March
30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
