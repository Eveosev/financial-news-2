MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-biggest
payments network, will team up with Western Union Co. to offer
prepaid debit cards and money transfers worldwide amid a
continuing consumer shift from cash and checks to plastic.  The partnership makes Purchase, New York-based MasterCard
the preferred global brand for prepaid cards sold by  Western
Union (WU) , the world’s biggest money-transfer business, the
companies said today in a statement. It will let customers of
Englewood, Colorado-based Western Union move funds directly to
or from a MasterCard-branded credit, debit or prepaid card.  MasterCard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga, 52, and
Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek, 51, are marketing the products
to 2.5 billion adults worldwide deemed underserved by mainstream
financial services, according to the statement. The two firms
already have collaborated to offer 1.2 million prepaid cards in
the U.S., the CEOs said today during an interview in New York.  “The prepaid-card opportunity around the world is still
underdeveloped,” Banga said. “That’s what I’m trying to do,
get cards in the wallet instead of cash.”  MasterCard processed $2.05 trillion of credit- and debit-
card purchases last year, compared with $3.27 trillion for
larger rival  Visa Inc. (V) , based in San Francisco, according to
company data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
