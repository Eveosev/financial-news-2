Ecuador’s congress approved plans to
raise spending by 8.9 percent next year, financed in part by
Chinese loans and local bond sales, the government said.  President  Rafael Correa ’s 2012 budget proposal, which
forecasts economic growth will slow to 5.35 percent from an
estimated 6.5 percent this year, was approved with no changes in
a midnight vote last night, according to a statement published
today in the presidential gazette. Spending under the 2012
budget will be $26.1 billion, more than double outlays in 2007,
when Correa took power.  Ecuador has had limited financing sources since defaulting
in 2008 and 2009 on $3.2 billion of international debt. Next
year, the government forecasts a budget deficit of $4.23
billion, or 5.9 percent of gross domestic product, to be funded
in part by $600 million in loans from  China  and $456 million in
bonds sold in local markets. This year’s budget aims for a
deficit of 6 percent.  Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, sees crude prices averaging $79.7
a barrel in 2012, or $17.30 a barrel less than the median
forecast of 36 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Inflation will
slow to 5.14 percent next year from the 5.5 percent annual
increase reported last month, according to the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
