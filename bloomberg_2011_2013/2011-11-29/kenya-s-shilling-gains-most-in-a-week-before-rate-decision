Kenya ’s shilling gained the most in
a week against the dollar ahead of the central bank’s monthly
meeting to review the benchmark  interest rate  on Dec. 1.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy climbed 0.8
percent to 89.60 per dollar by 11:53 a.m. in Nairobi, the
biggest gain since Nov. 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We expect the Monetary Policy Committee to tighten
further to combat inflation, and that should be positive for the
local unit,” Christopher Makombe, a currency trader with
Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. in Nairobi, said by phone
today. “The governor has made it clear that as long as
inflation keeps rising, the central bank will keep increasing
its rate.”  Kenya’s central bank raised its benchmark rate to a record
16.5 percent at its last policy meeting to stabilize the
shilling and curb inflation, which, at 18.9 percent, is more
than double the government’s target. Governor Njuguna Ndung’u
has said he will keep monetary policy “tight” until price
pressures ease.  Tanzania’s shilling fell for the first session in four,
declining 0.3 percent against the dollar to 1,689.70.  The Ugandan shilling gained for a second session, reaching
its strongest level in five days, advancing 0.8 percent to 2,560
per dollar as of 11:47 a.m.  “The shilling has strengthened ahead of a Treasury bills
auction tomorrow which is expected to attract offshore players
because of the good yields offered by the central bank,”
Timothy Muzoora, a currency trader at Cairo International Bank
Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  The nation’s central bank will tomorrow offer 120 billion
shillings ($46.9 million) worth of three, six and 12-month
bills. The three-month bills attracted a yield of 22.171 percent
at the last auction on Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
