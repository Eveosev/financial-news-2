Prada SpA  reported third-quarter
profit that beat some analysts’ estimates and said it’s
confident of consolidating its performance over the year.  Net income  rose 75 percent to 93.6 million euros ($125
million) in the three months ended Oct. 31, compared with the
year-earlier period, the Milan-based luxury-goods maker said
today on its website. The average of two analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 89.9 million euros.
Revenue advanced 33 percent to 596.1 million euros.  Prada, which in June sold shares in  Hong Kong ’s biggest
initial public offering this year, plans to open about 80 stores
annually over three years as Asian shoppers splurge on leather
handbags and other luxury items. The owner of the Prada, Miu
Miu, Church’s and Car Shoe brands is confident of the Asian
market, Deputy Chairman Carlo Mazzi said in September. Personal
luxury-goods sales may rise 12 percent in the Asia-Pacific
region in 2011, excluding currency swings, Bain & Co. estimates.  The company’s retail sales pattern in November is in line
with previous months, Prada said. While the luxury-goods maker
is ready to react to defend profitability, “we remain highly
confident about the potential of the luxury market,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
