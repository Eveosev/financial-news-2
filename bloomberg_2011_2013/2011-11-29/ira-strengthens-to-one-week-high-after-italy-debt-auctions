The lira advanced to its strongest
level in a week on increased appetite for riskier assets after
the Italian government sold about 7.5 billion euros ($10
billion) of debt today and the Turkish central bank offered to
sell as much as $400 million in the next two days.  The lira advanced 0.5 percent to 1.8498 per dollar at 5:26
p.m. in Istanbul, the highest level since Nov. 22.  Yields  on
two-year debt fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
10.85 percent, according to a Royal Bank of Scotland index.  The  premium  investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year bond
instead of German bunds, the region’s benchmark, fell three
basis points to 490 basis points. The euro gained for a second
day against the dollar, adding 0.2 percent.  “We are moving in parallel with the global markets and
tracking the euro’s increase against the dollar,” Emir Baruh, a
currency trader at Akbank TAS, said in e-mailed comments.  Turkey ’s central bank may sell as much as $400 million for
liras in auctions tomorrow and Dec. 1, should the auctions be
deemed necessary. The bank sold $50 million for liras today, the
maximum amount it offered in the first auction it held since
Nov. 21 when it sold $140 million.  The bank has sold about $9 billion for liras since Aug. 5
to shore up the currency and control inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
