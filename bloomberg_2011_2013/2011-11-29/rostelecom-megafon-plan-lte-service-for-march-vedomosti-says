OAO Rostelecom ,  Russia ’s dominant
fixed-line phone company, and  OAO Megafon  are planning to
provide fourth-generation mobile services, also known as LTE, by
March,  Vedomosti  newspaper reported in its online edition,
citing officials at the companies that it didn’t name.  The agreement would give subscribers of Rostelecom and
Megafon fourth-generation mobile service a year before
competitors make it available, the newspaper said. It would
break an earlier pact in which Russia’s biggest cellular phone
companies, including also  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MTSC)  and  VimpelCom
Ltd. (VIP) , pledged to jointly develop a fourth-generation mobile
network, the newspaper reported.  Rostelecom and Megafon are in talks with Skartel, which is
the only company in Russia that has federal frequencies to build
a fourth-generation mobile network, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
