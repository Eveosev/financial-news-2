Press Release  Bloomberg helps corporate executives manage FX exposure  Melbourne,  Australia  and  New York , November 29, 2011 --
Medibank Private Limited, Australia’s largest private health
insurer, has chosen Bloomberg’s Foreign Exchange (FX) trading
platform to manage the exchange rate risk associated with its
$2.5 billion global equity portfolio, Bloomberg L.P. announced
today.  Medibank uses the Bloomberg Professional service to research
global news, data and analytics to hedge its interest-rate
risk.  Now, Medibank will also use the system’s FXGO function
to manage its foreign-exchange risk, execute FX trades and get
requests for quotes (RFQs) in spot, forwards, swaps, options
and deposits.  “Bloomberg’s FXGO is the most efficient way of managing our FX
risk.  Like a lot of other companies, we were using the phone
to trade and waiting for the confirmation call. In the
meantime, the markets could move significantly. FXGO ensures
that trades happen immediately, the confirmation goes to our
back office and sends it to our custodian, all in one step,”
said Graeme Sala, Medibank’s Treasurer.  Tod Van Name, global head of Bloomberg’s Foreign Exchange
business, said, “Corporate executives all over the world are
discovering that the Bloomberg Professional services’ FXGO
makes managing foreign exchange risk intuitive, seamless and
cost-effective. They can get prices from their preferred
banks, execute trades and integrate with their order
management, risk management and back office systems all on one
platform.”  Amanda Dobbie, Bloomberg’s head of sales for Australia and  New
Zealand , said, “Companies are hanging up the phone and getting
on FXGO because it’s simple and they do not have to pay a
commission.  FXGO is free to both the sellers and buyers of
currencies and provides comprehensive pricing.”  For more information about Bloomberg FXGO or the Bloomberg
