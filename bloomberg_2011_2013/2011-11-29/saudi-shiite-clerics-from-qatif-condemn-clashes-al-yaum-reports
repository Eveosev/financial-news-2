A delegation of Shiite Muslim
scholars and clerics from the eastern Saudi Arabian city of al-
Qatif condemned recent clashes between Shiites and the kingdom’s
security forces,  Al-Yaum newspaper  reported.  The delegation pledged their loyalty to the Al Saud
leadership and expressed regret about the fighting, the
newspaper said, citing Sheikh Mohammed al-Jirani from Qatif. The
delegation met with Mohammed bin Fahd, governor of  Eastern
Province , the newspaper said.  Four people were killed and nine wounded in clashes in the
oil-rich province last week, according to the official  Saudi
Press Agency . Two died Nov. 24 in an exchange of gunfire at the
funeral of two people who died in the al-Qatif region, SPA said,
citing a Ministry of Interior statement.  Saudi Arabia’s Shiite minority is concentrated in the
eastern oil-producing hub, which lies across a 16-mile (26-
kilometer) causeway from Shiite-majority Bahrain, where there
were clashes in February and March as security forces crushed
protests by Shiites demanding democracy and representative
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
