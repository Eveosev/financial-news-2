Lebanon’s  central bank  governor,
Riad Salameh, said funds from neighboring  Syria  haven’t been
transferred to Lebanese banks and that the banks are capable of
abiding by sanctions targeting Syrian assets,  Al-Arabiya 
television reported.  Neither the central bank nor the government of Syria has
funds in Lebanese banks, Salameh told the Dubai-based channel,
reiterating remarks he made in October.  On Nov. 27, the  Arab League  issued sanctions against Syria
amid growing economic and political pressure for President
Bashar al-Assad to end a crackdown against protesters that began
in mid-March. The Arab bloc’s unprecedented measures, which
follow U.S. and European sanctions, halt dealings with the
Syrian central bank and ban financial transactions and trade
with the government, excluding basic commodities.  Salameh said the central bank is able to monitor all
transactions at banks operating in Lebanon, and that they are
following banking regulations. He said banks in the country are
bound by United Nations Security Council resolutions and have
shown they can abide by sanctions against certain Syrian people.  In a July 11 interview, Salameh denied a report by  the
Economist  that $20 billion left Syria’s banks after protests
against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government started in
March, and that much of it has found its way to Lebanon. Syria’s
banking industry had a total of about $28 billion in deposits at
the end of March, according to central bank figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
