Yemen’s Mohamed Salem Basindwah, who
was chosen to lead a national unity government after President
Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to relinquish power, said a new
cabinet will be formed within “days.”  Making fuel, electricity and cooking gas available for the
population will be among the new administration’s priorities,
Basindwah told reporters today in the capital, Sana’a.  Yemen plans to set up a fund for development projects and
has requested assistance from countries in the Gulf, Basindwah
said. Gulf states have also been asked to present plans for the
development of Sana’a and the cities of Taiz, Aden, Mukalla and
Hodiedah, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
