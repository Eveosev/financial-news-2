Gold futures climbed for the second
straight day amid a commodity rally after the dollar’s drop
boosted the appeal of raw materials as alternative investments.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 energy, metal and
agriculture prices rose as much as 1.6 percent as European
finance ministers work on a bailout fund. The greenback dropped
as much as 0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies.  “The strength in other commodities is helping gold,”
Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul ,
Minnesota, said in a telephone interview. “The weaker dollar is
also lending support.”  Gold futures for February delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,718.90 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Yesterday, the price gained 1.5 percent, the most in two
weeks.  Gold has climbed 21 percent this year, heading for the 11th
straight annual gain. The price reached a record $1,923.70 on
Sept. 6 as investors sought to diversify from equities and some
currencies.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$31.95 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery gained 0.5 percent to $584.25 an ounce. Platinum
futures for January delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,540.70 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
