The Canadian government needs more
time to consider whether to loosen foreign-ownership rules in
the country’s telecommunications sector, Industry Minister
Christian Paradis said.  The government is also not ready to set the ground rules
for an auction of wireless spectrum, Paradis told a conference
held by the International Institute of Communications in Ottawa
today.  “This is a complex environment to navigate,” Paradis said
in the prepared text of his remarks provided by his office. “We
are not looking at one discrete policy decision, but rather a
balance of interconnected decisions that must be considered in
concert.”  In March 2010,  Canada  pledged to open the industry to more
foreign ownership. One year ago, then-Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said the government would delay new rules until the
auction of spectrum in the 700 and 2,500 megahertz bands.  Paradis met in August with executives from telecom and
cable companies including  BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Telus Corp. (T)  and  Rogers
Communications Inc . to discuss options on foreign ownership and
the spectrum auction.  The government should move quickly to lay the ground rules
for the spectrum auction, even if it hasn’t decided on any
foreign-ownership rules, said John Bitove, executive chairman of
DAVE Wireless Inc., which offers the Mobilicity brand of mobile
phone.  “Let’s get on with it,” Bitove said before the speech.
“There’s enough new entrants that are operating in Canada under
the current structure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
