Hellenic Bank pcl , Cyprus’s third-
largest bank, posted a loss after increasing the writedown of
its Greek government-bond holdings.  The net loss was 69.3 million euros ($93 million) in the
nine months through Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 24.5
million euros a year earlier, the Nicosia-based bank said in a
Cyprus Stock Exchange  filing  today.  Hellenic wrote down the value of its Greek bonds by a
further 31.9 million euros in the third quarter, bringing the
total writedown to 55 million euros, or 50 percent of the 110
million euros of Greek bonds it holds, the filing showed.  The economic crisis in Greece worsened the loan-porfolio
quality of the lender’s Greek operations. Hellenic’s provisions
for bad loans in  Greece  were 27.9 million euros on Sept. 30, up
from 24.6 million on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
