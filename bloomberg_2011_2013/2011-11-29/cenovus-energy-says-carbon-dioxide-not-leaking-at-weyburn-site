Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-
largest energy company, said carbon dioxide it’s using to
increase oil recovery at an oilfield isn’t contaminating soil or
water above the site.  The CO2 Cenovus is injecting about 1.5 kilometers (0.9
miles) to pump more oil and store the compound isn’t leaking,
and CO2 in the soil was created naturally, the Calgary-based
company said today in a statement. Cenovus hired outside
specialists to determine whether CO2 was leaking from the
ground, according to the statement.  Landowners Cameron and Jane Kerr released a report in
January saying elevated levels of CO2 on their property were
coming from CO2 injected at Cenovus’s Weyburn site. The Kerrs
have since moved away.  “These results provide complete assurance to landowners
and the public that the CO2 we’re injecting about 1.5 kilometers
below the ground is staying put and that our Weyburn operation
is safe,” Brad Small, a vice president at the company, said in
the statement.  Cenovus has been injecting CO2 into the ground at Weyburn
since 2000, according to the statement. The gas can thin oil,
making it flow more easily to wells. The company is currently
storing more than 17 million tons of CO2 underground at the
site. Weyburn is one of  Canada ’s largest enhanced oil recovery
operations and the site of the largest geological greenhouse gas
storage project in the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
