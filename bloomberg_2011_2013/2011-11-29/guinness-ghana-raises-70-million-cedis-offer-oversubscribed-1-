Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL) , the
maker of drinks such as the stout of the same name and Star
lager, obtained all of the 70 million cedis ($42 million) it
sought in a rights offer, raising cash to cut debt and invest in
infrastructure.  The offer, which ran from Oct. 17 to Nov. 14, was
oversubscribed by 45 percent, the Accra-based unit of Diageo Plc
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Guinness Ghana will spend 40 million cedis to pay down
debt, Chairman David Harlock said on June 14. Another 29 million
cedis will be invested in water supply and electricity at the
companyâ€™s plants, he said.  The company reported fiscal first-quarter net income of 3
million cedis, compared with a loss of 6 million cedis in the
same period a year earlier. Revenue in the three months to Sept.
30 rose 21 percent to 57.5 million cedis, it said in a statement
e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange on Oct. 26.  The stock was unchanged at 1.51 cedis by 2:23 p.m. in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
