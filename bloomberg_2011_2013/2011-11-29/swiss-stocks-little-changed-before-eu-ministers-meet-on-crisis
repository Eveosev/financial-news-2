Swiss stocks (SMI)  closed higher as euro-
area finance ministers met to discuss insuring a portion of
bonds issued by debt-stricken countries and an Italian bond
auction was oversubscribed by investors.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) , the largest Swiss
bank and insurer respectively, each rose at least 1.3 percent.
 Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the biggest provider of offshore drilling rigs,
dropped 8.7 percent after selling shares.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the largest and most
actively traded companies, edged up 0.2 percent to 5,531.24 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, shifting between gains and losses
all day. The gauge has rebounded 15 percent from this year’s low
on Aug. 10 amid speculation that policy makers will act to
resolve the 17-member euro region’s debt crisis. The Swiss
Performance Index advanced less than 0.2 percent today.  “The bad news is that Italian rates are still very high,”
said Henrik Henriksen, chief investment strategist at PFA
Pension A/S, which manages $45 billion in Copenhagen. “The good
news is that someone actually wants to buy Italian bonds,”  Italy was again forced to pay above the 7 percent threshold
that led  Greece , Portugal and Ireland to seek bailouts when it
sold 7.5 billion euros ($10 billion) in bonds today, short of
the maximum target for the auction.  Demand for a 2014 bond was 1.5 times the amount sold, while
the bid-to-cover ratio for a 2022 bond was 1.34 times. That
compared respectively with 1.35 times and 1.27 times at the
previous auction on Oct. 28 auction.  UBS advanced 1.4 percent to 10.68 Swiss francs after the
auction and Zurich Financial Services rose 1.3 percent to 196.10
francs.  Finance Ministers Meet  Euro-area finance ministers are meeting in Brussels to
debate using their bailout fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility, to insure sovereign debt with guarantees.  President  Barack Obama  said agreeing on a sufficient
response to Europe’s problems is of “huge importance” to the
U.S., after meeting yesterday with European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  and European Commission President  Jose Barroso .  Moody’s Investors Services put 87 European lenders under
review for downgrade as subordinated, junior-subordinated or
Tier 3 debt ratings incorporates an assumption of government
support.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , Switzerland’s largest publicly
traded private bank, declined 1.7 percent to 31.43 francs.  Transocean dropped 3.72 francs to 39.20 francs, the most
since Nov. 3, after saying it will sell shares to help refinance
its acquisition of Aker Drilling ASA.  The offering for 26 million shares would allow the Zug,
Switzerland-based rig-owner to buy back $1.7 billion in debt,
the company said in a statement. The sale represents up to 8.9
percent of the company’s total issued and outstanding shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
