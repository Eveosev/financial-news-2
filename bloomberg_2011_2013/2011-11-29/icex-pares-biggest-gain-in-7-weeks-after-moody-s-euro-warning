Russian stocks fell, paring the
 Micex (INDEXCF) ’s biggest gain in seven weeks, after Moody’s Investors
Service warned of downgrades for European banks and the U.S.
urged the region’s leaders to act to save the single currency.  The Micex Index retreated 0.8 percent to 1,454.67 by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The index yesterday surged 3.9
percent, the most since Oct. 6. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
slid 0.6 percent to 1,466.36 today.  President  Barack Obama  renewed pressure on European leaders
to prevent a dismantling of the single currency before euro-area
finance ministers meet today to seek a resolution to the two-
year-old debt crisis. Moody’s said it may cut ratings of lenders
in 15 European countries as a “rapid escalation” of the crisis
threatens the region.  “The EU only really implements what bond markets want when
a crisis forces it upon them,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of
Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , wrote today in e-
mailed comments. “Until then we trade up and down on
headlines.”  All but seven of the Micex’s 30 component stocks declined,
led by pipeline operator OAO Transneft, mining company OAO GMK
 Norilsk Nickel  and coal producer OAO Mechel. Transneft dropped
2.4 percent to 49,403 rubles, while Norilsk Nickel slumped 3
percent to 5,205 rubles and Mechel fell 2.3 percent to 298.1
rubles.  Gazprom Neft, Magnit  Crude oil,  Russia ’s biggest export earner, erased an
earlier loss of as much as $1.09 and climbed $1.33 cents to
$99.52 a barrel in  New York .  OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of the world’s largest gas
producer, dropped 0.3 percent to 138.5 rubles.  OAO Magnit, the country’s biggest food retailer by market
value and potash producer OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  both rallied.  Magnit rose 0.4 percent to 2,888.7 rubles and Uralkali
climbed 0.9 percent to 243.34 rubles.  X5 Retail Group NV surged 5.9 percent to $24.45 in London
trading after the retailer said net sales jumped 39 percent to
$3.62 billion. The company reported a net loss of $2.1 million
in the third quarter after a foreign exchange loss, compared
with profit of $79.6 million a year earlier. X5 agreed to
acquire Russian discounter Kopeyka for 35 billion rubles ($1.1
billion) in December, beating off interest from Wal-Mart.  “The company has managed to mitigate the negative impact
from Kopeyka integration costs, which were scheduled to peak
this quarter and now Х5 has completed the integration process of
all Kopeyka stores,” Natalia Kolupaeva, an equities analyst at
TKB Capital, wrote in a report today.  The Micex has lost 14 percent this year, trading at 5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That compares
with a 19 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which trades
at 10.1 times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 11.4 times
estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 13.9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
