Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous
nation, plans to triple foreign direct investment, now at $3
billion a year, by 2015, Trade and Investment Minister Olusegun Aganga said.  The West African nation with 167 million people also aims
to create 3 million new jobs within the period, the minister
said in a speech he sent today to a conference in Lagos, the
commercial capital.  To achieve these, the government has “to promote Nigeria
as an attractive destination of investment and enhance quality
of live,” he said. One of the things the government will do is
make it easier to do business in the country, Aganga said.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, needs to diversify
its economy from dependence on revenue from the commodity.
Minister of Finance Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said on Nov. 14 that
Nigeria needs to invest $67 billion over the next four years on
infrastructure development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
