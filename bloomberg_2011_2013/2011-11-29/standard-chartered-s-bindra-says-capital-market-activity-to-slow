Jaspal Bindra, chief executive
officer of  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s  Asia  operations, said the
bank’s capital market activity will slow in the near term, even
as it remains committed to double-digit income growth this year.  On the business outlook:  “We remain committed to our outlook for double-digit
income growth for the full year. It’s difficult to forecast
activity by businesses because there is so much dependent on the
macro-economy.  ‘‘We foresee the likelihood of a slowdown in overall
capital market activity in the near term. But that can be
equally compensated, if not more, by market share opportunities
and re-pricing credit upwards.’’  On hiring:  ‘‘Whatever hiring we do, it will be disproportionately
higher in Asia. We expect to close 2011 with 86,000 people, from
80,000 in the first half of 2010. Next year, if the revenue
momentum continues, we will have a need to grow.  ‘‘Some businesses will need more hiring than others. Front-
end staff for private banking and small- and medium-enterprises,
and middle- and back-office-skilled staff for financial
markets.’’  On acquisitions:  ‘‘Anything in our footprint, we’d be interested in giving
it a very good look. Our core growth mantra is still organic. We
think that has largely been the contributor to our eight-plus
years of record performances.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
