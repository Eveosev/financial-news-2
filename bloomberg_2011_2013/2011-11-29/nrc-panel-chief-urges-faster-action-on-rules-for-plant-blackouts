The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission should expedite a rule requiring plant owners to
better prepare for a loss of electrical power, the chairman of
an independent advisory panel said.  The NRC staff’s Oct. 3 proposal to establish the rule
within 4 1/4 years is “is just way too long for an important
action of this type,” Said Abdel-Khalik, chairman of the
Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, said today during a
meeting at the NRC’s Rockville, Maryland, headquarters.  The NRC is weighing regulations for 104 U.S. commercial
nuclear reactors after a March earthquake and tsunami
interrupted power at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant, causing meltdowns and radiation leaks. The agency on
Oct. 20 directed staff to implement “without delay” seven
safety recommendations of a  task force , including reviews of
seismic and flooding hazards and power losses at plants.  The NRC should move quickly since the Fukushima disaster
occurred more than eight months ago, Abdel-Khalik said.  “With all due respect, all we’ve been doing is talk,” he
told the commission today.  The advisory panel agrees with an NRC goal to establish the
rule within two to three years, agency spokesman  David McIntyre 
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
