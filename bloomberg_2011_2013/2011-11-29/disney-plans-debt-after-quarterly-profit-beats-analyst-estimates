Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s biggest
theme-park operator, sold bonds for the third time this year
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates on growth in  cable television  and at U.S. resorts.  The owner of ESPN issued $1 billion 0.875 percent, three-
year notes and $600 million of 4.125 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A  Deere & Co. (DE)  unit
joined the Burbank, California-based entertainment company in
marketing a benchmark-sized offering today.  Companies are racing to sell debt as borrowing costs hover
within 60 basis points of a record low, propelling bond sales
this month to $98.6 billion as of yesterday, the highest since
May. Yields on investment-grade debt of 4.01 percent yesterday
compare with the record low of 3.45 percent reached in August,
and are down from 4.15 percent on Oct. 11, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  Disney said on Nov. 10 that profit in the fourth quarter
totaled 59 cents a share, exceeding analysts’ projections of 55
cents, the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Higher
fees from pay-TV operators, advertising gains and improved
results at resorts drove revenue and profit higher.  Rising Earnings  A rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is improving Disney’s leverage without the company
working toward any debt reduction,  Dave Novosel , an analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC wrote in a Nov. 14 note.  “Revenue and margins are increasing nicely, aided by an
improving economy and a much better advertising environment,”
he wrote.  Disney sold $1.85 billion of bonds in August and $500
million of notes in May, Bloomberg data show. The company’s 30-
year bonds priced to yield 125 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, and compare with $350 million of 4.375
percent bonds issued in August at an 87.5 basis-point spread.  John Deere Capital Corp. issued $500 million of 2 percent
debt due in January 2017 and $600 million of 1.25 percent debt
due in 2014, Bloomberg data show.  Borrowers issued $159 billion of corporate bonds in May,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
