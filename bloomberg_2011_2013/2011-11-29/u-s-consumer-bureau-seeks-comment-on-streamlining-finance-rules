The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau asked for public comment on ways to streamline
the regulations it inherited from other federal agencies when it
began work on July 21.  “Our goal is to make it easier for banks,  credit unions 
and others to follow the rules,” Raj Date, the adviser to the
Treasury secretary who is running the bureau in the absence of a
permanent director, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Reducing the regulatory burden could come by simplifying
regulations that have become incomprehensible, standardizing
definitions across different rules, updating rules that
technology has made outdated, or “removing unnecessary
restrictions on consumer choice or business innovation,” the
bureau said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
