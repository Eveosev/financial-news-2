Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) , Egyptâ€™s
biggest producer of packaged milk, rose the most on record after
one of its units completed an insurance compensation agreement
for a 2010 factory fire.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 10 percent, the
most since they were listed in June 2010, to 4.29 Egyptian
pounds at 11:50 a.m. in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained
5.3 percent.  Juhayna said its unit, the Egyptian Co. for Food
Industries, has signed the final agreement for a 93.7 million-
pound ($15.6 million) insurance settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
