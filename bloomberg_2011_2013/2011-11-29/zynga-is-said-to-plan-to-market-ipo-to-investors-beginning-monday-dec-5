Zynga Inc., the biggest maker of
games on Facebook Inc.’s site, plans to begin marketing its
initial public offering to investors on Monday, Dec. 5,
according to a person briefed on the matter.  The person asked not to be identified because the plans
haven’t been made public.  Zynga, which filed for a $1 billion IPO in July, aims to
lure investors who want to profit from rising demand for social
games. Founded in 2007, Zynga offers games for free and then
sells virtual items within applications, such as a townhouse in
“CityVille” or a shipyard in “Empires & Allies.”  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  are managing
the offering. Zynga’s shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock
Market under the symbol ZNGA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
