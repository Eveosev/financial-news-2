Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-0 to reach
the semifinals of English soccer’s Carling Cup, while a late
Sergio Aguero goal gave  Manchester City  a 1-0 win at Arsenal.   Maxi Rodriguez  and Martin Kelly scored for Liverpool as it
won at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge stadium for a second time in
nine days, following a Premier League victory earlier this
month.  Aguero’s 83rd-minute goal at the Emirates maintained City’s
unbeaten domestic record this season.  Cardiff City, which plays in the second-tier Championship,
defeated Blackburn, bottom of the Premier League, 2-0 with goals
from Kenny Miller and Anthony Gerrard.  Manchester United hosts Crystal Palace in tomorrow’s match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
