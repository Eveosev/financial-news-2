(Corrects name in first paragraph.)  German banks have less money
available for loans than a year ago, Die  Welt  reported today,
citing calculations carried out by  Thomson Reuters  on behalf of
the newspaper.  The countryâ€™s lenders borrowed 40.4 billion euros ($53.9
billion) in the first eleven months of this year while 92.5
billion euros of bonds were due in the same period, meaning
their balance sheet will shrink, the newspaper said. That
threatens the supply of credit to companies and private clients,
Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
