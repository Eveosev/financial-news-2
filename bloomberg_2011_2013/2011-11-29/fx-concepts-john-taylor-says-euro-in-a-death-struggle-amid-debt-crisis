John Taylor , founder of the world’s
largest currency hedge fund FX Concepts LLC, said the euro is in
a “death struggle” as European policy makers seek to salvage
the shared currency amid the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Even with a “bleak” outlook for the currency union
surviving in its present form, the 17-nation euro is trading
above its life-time average of $1.2044 because of debt purchases
by the  European Central Bank  and European financial institutions
repatriating funds, according to Taylor.  “Banks are shrinking and selling all of their offshore
assets and bringing them back to  Europe  and that means in fact,
that there is a persistent buyer of euros, which is their own
financial institutions,” Taylor said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “The
outlook is bleak, but there’s always the hope that the bleaker
it gets, the more the governments are going to wake up and do
something.”  Taylor, who manages about $5.5 billion from  New York ,
predicted several times since 2010 that the euro will fall to
parity versus the dollar. The common currency rose 0.1 percent
to $1.3333 at 10:50 a.m. in New York.  Europe’s effort to expand its bailout fund to 1 trillion
euros ($1.3 trillion) is falling short, forcing renewed
consideration of a role for the ECB in insulating Spain and
 Italy  from the debt crisis, two officials familiar with the
discussions said today.  Finance ministers will hold an initial discussion tonight
on channeling ECB loans to cash-strapped euro nations through
the  International Monetary Fund , aiming to bring the central
bank onto the front lines without violating its ban on direct
lending to governments, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are at an early stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
