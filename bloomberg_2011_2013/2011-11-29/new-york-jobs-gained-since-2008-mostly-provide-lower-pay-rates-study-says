New York  City and  state  job growth
since mid-2008 has occurred mainly in industries such as
tourism, where average annual wages are less than $45,000, the
 Fiscal Policy Institute  said in a study.  Industries paying low salaries have added 82,000 jobs
statewide, led by restaurants, educational consulting services,
and at-home health-care services, the nonprofit research group
said in the report released today. The Albany-based institute
receives funds from private foundations and labor unions.  Since mid-2008, when the report says the recession began in
New York, the state has lost more than 250,000 middle- and high-
wage jobs in areas such as manufacturing, construction,
government and finance, according to the institute. In the city,
121,000 high-paying jobs vanished, it said. The longest U.S.
slump since World War II started in December 2007 and lasted 18
months to June 2009, according to the  National Bureau of
Economic Research  in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  Combined, the recession and the weak economic recovery that
followed may have cost the state as much as $31 billion in
annual earnings, according to the report. Among the losses it
counted were 504,000 jobs, including about 96,000 that were
never created because of missed small-business opportunities as
unemployment curbed  consumer spending .  Growing Industry  This month, New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg   announced  the
city’s hotel-room inventory would reach a record 90,000 by
year’s end, up 24 percent since 2006. Travel and tourism
industries employ 323,000 people in the city, which Bloomberg
said has helped to offset jobs lost during the downturn,
including among manufacturers.  “Our growing tourism industry is one of the big reasons
why  New York City  entered the recession later and emerged from
it sooner than the rest of America,” Bloomberg said at a Nov.
14 news briefing in  Long Island City , Queens, where he dedicated
a new hotel.  The institute’s report based its calculations on a
hypothetical formula that assumed an unemployment  rate  of 4.5
percent, the state average for 2007. The state’s October
unemployment rate fell to 7.9 percent from 8 percent in
September. In the city, it rose to 8.8 percent from 8.7 percent.  Poverty rates in upstate cities ranged from 28 percent of
Albany residents to 30 percent in Buffalo and 34 percent in
Rochester and Syracuse last year, according to the report. The
proportion of children living in poor households in New York
City reached 30 percent in 2010, and was 43 percent in  Albany 
and 51 percent in Rochester.  “These figures underscore just how costly the recession
and weak recovery are for New York workers and their families,”
James Parrott, the institute’s Manhattan-based chief economist,
said in a statement that accompanied the report.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
