The rand gained for a second day as
an oversubscribed Italian debt auction and talks to expand
 Europe ’s bailout fund boosted appetite for riskier emerging
market assets, outweighing lower-than-forecast domestic growth.  South Africa’s currency rose as much as 1.5 percent to
8.2684 per dollar and traded 0.1 percent stronger at 8.3825 as
of 4:26 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand increased 1.8 percent
yesterday after La Stampa reported the  International Monetary
Fund  is preparing a 600 billion-euro ($799 billion) loan for
 Italy , which the Washington-based lender later denied.  Demand for Italy’s 2014 bonds was 1.5 times the amount on
offer, up from 1.35 times at the previous auction. The country
sold 7.5 billion euros ($10 billion) of debt. Finance ministers
are meeting in Brussels to discuss an expansion of the European
Financial Stability Facility, Europe’s bailout fund.  “The market is not really focusing on domestic factors,
it’s more focused on what is happening offshore,” David Gracey,
head of currency and derivatives trading at Investec Bank Ltd.
said by phone. “Essentially we are just tracking the euro.”  Gross domestic product  accelerated from an annualised 1.3
percent in the second quarter to 1.4 percent in the third,
Statistics  South Africa  said today in  Pretoria . The  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists was for the
economy to expand 1.8 percent.  “It’s not good news,” Nicky Weimar, an economist at
Nedbank Group Ltd., said in a phone interview from Johannesburg
today. “Manufacturing was a lot weaker than anybody expected.”  Bonds strengthened, with the yield on South Africa’s 8.25
percent bonds due 2017 falling 4.5 basis points, or 0.045
percentage point, to 7.552 percent.  Credit Growth Expanded  The Reserve Bank has kept the  benchmark rate  at a 30-year
low of 5.5 percent this year to support growth in the face of
increasing price pressures. Slower growth and a slump in
investors’ risk appetite caused the rand to plunge 20 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst-performer of the more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Credit growth expanded at a faster pace in October than in
the previous month as the lending rate remained at a 30-year
low.  Borrowing  by households and businesses rose 5.5 percent
from a revised 5.4 percent in September, the Pretoria-based
 Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The median  estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 16 economists was 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
