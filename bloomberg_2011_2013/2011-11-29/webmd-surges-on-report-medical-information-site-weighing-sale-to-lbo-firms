WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , the medical-
information provider, surged the most in five weeks after
TheStreet.com said the company was considering a sale to
private-equity firms.  WebMD rose 10 percent to $35.25 at the close in New York,
the biggest single-day jump since Oct. 24. The New York-based
provider of online and printed health advice is said to have
hired Credit Suisse to explore a deal, TheStreet.com  reported 
today, citing a source with knowledge of the situation.  Carl Icahn , the billionaire investor, raised his stake in
WebMD to 9.9 percent last week, according to a regulatory
filing, after earlier saying the company was “undervalued from
a long-term perspective.” George Soros’ investment firm also
said last month it had bought shares and convertible bonds
giving it the right to as much as 5.6 percent of WebMD’s equity.  Kate Hahn, a WebMD spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking a comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
