The  four biggest Dutch lenders (SR)  are
systemically important, must hold additional capital and draft
plans for an orderly default to limit risk to financial
stability, the  Finance Ministry  said.  ABN Amro Group NV,  Rabobank Groep  and the banking units of
 ING Groep NV (INGA)  and SNS Reaal NV, have until 2019 to meet
additional capital requirements of 1 to 3 percent of their risk-
weighted assets, the Dutch Finance Ministry said in its autumn
report today. The lenders must also draw up plans with the
central bank to enable an orderly wind-down in the event of
failure.  “The Netherlands has a large banking sector that fits in
an open economy,” the Finance Ministry said. “Yet the size
brings along risk for financial stability and the real
economy.”  Balance sheets of banks in the Netherlands outweigh the
size of the economy by almost five times, the Dutch central bank
 said  earlier this month. The finance ministry will decide
annually which banks qualify as systematically important.  ING, the Netherlands’ biggest financial-services company,
is the only Dutch firm among 29 international lenders that faces
a separate capital surcharge under plans approved by the Group
of 20 nations. Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen has said he
expects his bank will be in “the lower ranges of the score,”
under the international plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
