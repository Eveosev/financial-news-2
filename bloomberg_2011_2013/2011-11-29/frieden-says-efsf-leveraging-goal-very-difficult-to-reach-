Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said the goal of leveraging the European Financial
Stability Facility to boost its capacity to 1 trillion euros
will be “very difficult to reach” given current market
conditions.  “It will be very difficult to reach in view of the changed
market circumstances the initially envisaged leverage goal, but
we have to listen to the CEO of the EFSF before we can take a
decision on this,” Frieden told reporters today in Brussels.
“The EFSF alone will not be able to solve all the problems. We
have to do so together with the IMF and with the ECB in the
framework of its independence.”  “We need stability in euro area, that’s why we must take
action together with the ECB, the IMF and a stronger EFSF,”
Frieden said.  “You have to look at all options, but I think there are
simpler ways to give money to the  euro zone  via the IMF with the
approval of all  member states  than via the ECB,” Frieden said.
“Everybody’s competencies should be respected and not mix
them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
