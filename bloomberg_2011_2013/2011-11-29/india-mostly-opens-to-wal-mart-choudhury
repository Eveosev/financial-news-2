Welcome, Wal-Mart.Â  India 's coalition government made a surprise move last week by liberalizing  the country's retail sector . Halfway into its second term, the governing  United Progressive Alliance , long accused of being too passive and too wedded to the welfare state, ended years of hedging by successive governments by giving its consent to foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in India, allowing global supermarket chains to set up shop and help spur economic growth The move was probably, along with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), the most significant policy decision made by an Indian central government in the last decade. And while the NREGA is redistributive, the decision to open retail trade was aimed at increasing the size of the pie, promising to revolutionize the relationship of Indians in both cities and villages to consumption and production, and to stimulate the inflow of huge amounts of much-needed capital to modernize the country's creaking supply chain. The move also signaled the government's commitment to what are called "second-stage reforms," which follow  the liberalization of the Indian economy two decades ago . It also seemed intended to address the problem of  high food inflation , a consequence of a stagnant agricultural sector, an inadequate cold chain that results in large-scale waste of produce, and a gradual change in Indian diets away from cereals and toward protein-based foods as disposable income grows. The decision also had ramifications for a massive class of sellers. India's retail trade is currently worth about $450 billion annually, but what is most striking about the consumer market isn't so much its size -- the seventh largest in the world -- but the way in which it is organized. More than 90 percent of the market is currently serviced by small, independent shopkeepers, and India has one of the highest shop densities in the world, with about one shop for every 10 people. After agriculture, retail is the main source of employment for Indians, with most of those jobs in what is called "the unorganized sector." Although small shopkeepers and big Indian retail chains have co-existed for about a decade, jointly feeding off India's massive  consumer revolution , there has been very little backward integration. But the balance may have tipped now.  Sujay Mehdudia reported in The Hindu : The move set off a political firestorm. Parliament transacted no business for six days as parties to both the left and right of the Congress (around which the United Progressive Alliance is based)  agitated for a rollback  of the move. They included the main opposition party, the BJP, and some of the Congress's own allies in the government, such as  the Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham . The main fear voiced by critics of the decision was that it would destroy the livelihoods of several million small shopkeepers. But opposition to the move was by no means universal: many prominent voices in Indian industry gave their assent, and other political parties offered support. Among the parties supporting the decision, the most prominent was the Shiromani Akali Dal of Punjab, which represents much of the state's large class of farmers. This fact was emphasized in the Business Standard by Surinder Sud,  who observed : Much of the government's thinking behind the move, such as the  justification  offered by Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , seemed rooted in a study commissioned by the government in 2008, and carried out by a team of researchers from the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. Called " Impact of Organized Retailing on the Unorganised Sector ," the report argues that farmers receive a much larger slice of the final price of their produce when they sell to organized retailers, that often it is low-end consumers who save the most when shopping at organized retail outlets, and that unorganized retail has significant strengths that cannot be undone by big chains, such as "consumer goodwill, credit sales, amenability to bargaining, ability to sell loose items, convenient timings, and home delivery." It concludes: And an  editorial in The Times of India , which produced a chart of the arguments  for and against the decision , criticized its opponents: This view wasn't shared by groups hostile to the liberalization of the retail trade, such as  The National Association of Street Vendors . One body, called  India FDI Watch ,  put out a booklet  in several languages a few years ago that argues that India would be wrong to follow in the steps of the developed world. One section takes a "myth-and-reality" approach to the issue: The booklet's arguments echo those made against big retail chains by the left and by a certain class of consumers in many developed countries: But looking at Indian realities, particularly the indigence of farmers and the scale of wasted produce, it seems more perverse to leave things the way they are than to attempt to change them through a booster shot of investment. Nor is the move likely to be as apocalyptic as some make it out to be. Indeed, as the business analyst  Alam Srinivas pointed out on BBC News , the riders placed by the government on minimum investment and minimum procurement meant that only a few big international firms would have the necessary capital to enter the Indian market, and that the transformation of the retail landscape either desired or feared by different classes of Indians might be a decade or more. Srinivas concluded the step "appears a deliberate half-measure to move in the right direction." That seemed like a description, too, of how Indian democracy lumbers along, trying to reconcile various contradictory imperatives through the artful or resigned deployment of the half-measure.
