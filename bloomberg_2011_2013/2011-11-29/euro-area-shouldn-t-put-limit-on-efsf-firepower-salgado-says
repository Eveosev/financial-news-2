Spanish Economy Minister  Elena
Salgado  said the euro area shouldn’t put a numerical limit on
the size of its temporary bailout fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility.  “There is no maximum sum because it depends also on
private investors so there is no maximum defined amount at the
moment,” Salgado told reporters in Brussels today. “Setting a
strict quantified limit means markets will always bet on such a
limit. I think it is better option not to establish a limit and
simply to say it must be as much as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
