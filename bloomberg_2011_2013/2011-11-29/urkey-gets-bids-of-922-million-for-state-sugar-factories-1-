Turkey  got winning bids of $922
million in an auction of sugar factories in the center and east
of the country.  Ak-Can Seker Sanayi & Ticaret AS placed the highest bid of
$656 million in an auction of six factories in central Turkey,
beating five other bidders, said Sami Olmeztoprak, who conducted
the sale at the governmentâ€™s asset sales agency in Ankara today.  A partnership between Limak Holding AS and Kolin Insaat AS
bid $265.5 million for four plants in the east in the second
auction of the day and raised their offer to $266 million in
final talks with the agency.  Initial instalments are likely to be paid next year, when
the government is seeking $5.7 billion in revenue from asset
sales. The price for the central plants was more than the $606
million Ak-Can offered as the winning bid in a 2009 auction of
the same assets that was later canceled by the courts.  Ak-Can plans to pay at least 15 percent of the price up
front and the remainder in six instalments, Abdulkerim Demircan,
a representative of the group, said after the auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
