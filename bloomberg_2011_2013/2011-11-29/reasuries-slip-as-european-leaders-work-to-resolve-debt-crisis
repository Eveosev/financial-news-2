Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds  dropped 
below those on similar maturity German government securities for
the first time since May 2009 as European officials struggle to
contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Treasuries fell as finance ministers from the 17-member
European monetary union meet in Brussels amid speculation
regional officials are struggling to support member nations’
debt markets. Government debt  declined  earlier after a boost in
U.S. consumer sentiment eased concern the U.S. economy may
falter.  “The situation in  Europe  hasn’t really improved, instead
it seem to get worse,” said Larry Milstein, managing director
in New York of government and agency debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors. “The European sovereign debt issue is
still the biggest issue and that will continue to give
Treasuries support.”  The U.S. 30-year bond yields traded as low as 2.92 percent
while German 30-year yield reached as high as 2.96 percent,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Yields on 30-year bonds rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.96 percent at 5:05 p.m. New York time.
The 3.125 percent securities due in November 2041 fell 18/32, or
$5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 10/32.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent after
adding as much as 0.9 percent.  Total Returns  Treasuries have returned 1.2 percent this month and 9.3
percent in 2011 as of yesterday, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. German bunds have fallen 0.7 percent on the
month and have returned 6.3 percent year-to-date.  The U.S. 10-year yield has traded in a 28-basis-point range
during November, with a high of 2.15 percent and a low of 1.87
percent. That compares with a 70-basis-point range the month
before, with a high of 2.42 percent and a low of 1.72 percent.  “We’re going to stay in the range of 2.10 to 1.90 until we
have more evidence of our own economy either doing better or
worse,” said Dan Mulholland, a trader in New York at Royal Bank
of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
dropped 3.6 percent in September from the same month in 2010
after decreasing 3.8 percent in the year ended August, the group
said today in New York. The median forecast of 32 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey projected a 3 percent decrease.  Economic Indicators  Consumer confidence  climbed in November by the most in more
than eight years as Americans grew more upbeat about employment
and income prospects.  The Conference Board’s index increased to 56 from a revised
40.9 reading in October, the biggest monthly gain since April
2003, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed today. The gauge, at a four-month high, exceeded the
most-optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  Holiday sales figures and speculation about ECB assistance
for Italy “gives people reason to be more confident” about the
 U.S. economy , said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, a primary dealer.  Retail sales climbed 16 percent, and shoppers spent $398.62
on average, up from $365.34 a year earlier, according to the
 National Retail Federation , citing a survey from BIGresearch.
Holiday sales account for about 20 percent to 40 percent of
retailers’ annual revenue, the National Retail Federation said.  European Plan  Europe’s effort to expand its bailout fund to 1 trillion
euros ($1.3 trillion) is falling short, forcing renewed
consideration of a role for the  European Central Bank  in
insulating Spain and Italy from the debt crisis, two officials
familiar with the discussions said.  Italy  sold 3.5 billion euros of a new three-year bond, 2.5
billion euros of 2022 bonds and 1.5 billion euros in 2020 bonds,
just shy of the top range of 8 billion euros for the sale. The
2014 note yielded 7.89 percent, the highest since September 1996
for a three-year bond and up from 4.93 percent when similar-
maturity debt was sold last month.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the central bank has
leeway to spur the U.S. recovery and reduce unemployment by
purchasing more assets and clarifying its plan to sustain
record-low borrowing costs.  “The scope remains to provide additional accommodation
through enhanced guidance on the path of the federal funds rate
or through additional purchases of longer-term financial
assets,” Yellen said in remarks prepared for a conference held
at the San Francisco Fed. She said economic growth in the U.S.
and other advanced economies “has been proceeding too slowly to
provide jobs for millions of unemployed people.”  The U.S. central bank purchased $2.54 billion of Treasuries
due from 2036 to 2041 today as part of a plan announced in
September to replace $400 billion in shorter maturities with
longer-term securities to keep borrowing costs down.  To contact the reporters on this story:
