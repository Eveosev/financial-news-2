An Italian court convicted bankers
Cesare Geronzi and Matteo Arpe in a case related to the 2003
bankruptcy of  Parmalat SpA (PLT) , Radiocor news agency reported.  Geronzi was sentenced to five years in jail, while Arpe was
given a sentence of three years and seven months by the court in
Parma, Radiocor said. The bankers were accused of fraudulent
bankruptcy connected to the sale of water company Ciappazzi to
Parmalat.  Ennio Amodio, a lawyer for Geronzi, termed the sentencing
“profoundly unfair,” Radiocor said. Both of the bankers
previously have denied any wrongdoing. Spokesmen for Geronzi and
Arpe weren’t immediately available for comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
