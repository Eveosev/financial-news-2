German exports in 2011 will probably
breach the 1 trillion euro ($1.3 trillion) level for the first
time as demand from developing states offsets waning sales in
 Europe , the BGA Exporters and Wholesalers said.  Export sales will likely grow 12 percent this year to 1.075
trillion euros from last year and expand at least 6 percent in
2012 to 1.14 trillion euros, the Berlin-based group said today
in presenting its outlook. This year’s sales will yield a trade
surplus of 156 billion euros, or 3 billion euros more than in
2010, the group said.  “ Emerging markets  are hardly impacted by the debt crisis
and are continuing to invest strongly in future technologies,”
the BGA said in a statement. The group, led by President Anton Boerner, urged euro-region leaders to fight to save the euro
from which German exporters “profit massively.”  The euro region accounted for about 40 percent of the
country’s foreign sales in 2010.  Germany  would pay a “massive economic price” if the euro
collapsed, robbing exporters of a competitively priced currency,
the group said. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has
said the price of the nation’s exports would climb if the
deutsche mark was reinstated as its currency.  Exports led the German economy, Europe’s largest, out of
recession in 2009. The economy may grow over 3 percent this year
after export growth sparked domestic demand. Economic growth
will slow to 1 percent in 2012, according to government
forecasts that cite flagging demand in the 17-state euro region.  Surging commodity prices helped push up the cost of German
imports this year by 14 percent to 919 billion euros, the BGA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
