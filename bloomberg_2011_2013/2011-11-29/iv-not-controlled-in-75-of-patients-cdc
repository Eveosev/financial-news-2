Almost 3 in 4 Americans with HIV
don’t have their infection under control with medications,
raising their risk of poor health and spreading the AIDS virus,
according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  About 20 percent of those who have HIV haven’t been tested
and don’t know they have the virus, the Atlanta-based CDC said
today in a statement. It’s possible to be infected for years
without showing symptoms. Among those who are aware of their HIV
infection, just 51 percent are getting medical care and
treatment, the agency said today in a  report .  About 1.2 million Americans have HIV, according to the CDC.
The virus, once a death sentence, can be reduced to low levels
in the blood with use of combination antiviral medicines. Those
drugs also lower the risk of spreading HIV, the report said.  “By improving testing, linkage to care and treatment
services, we can help people living with HIV feel better and
live longer, and can reduce the spread of HIV dramatically,”
said  Thomas Frieden , the director of the CDC.  Only 28 percent of those infected with HIV have the virus
at low levels in their blood, which the CDC cites as “under
control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
