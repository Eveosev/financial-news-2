Calzedonia SpA, an Italian maker of
hosiery, lingerie and beachwear, will invest 20 million euros
($26.8 million) to expand its manufacturing in northern  Serbia .  The Verona-based company’s new 18,000-square meter (19,400-
square foot) plant in Subotica, will open in 2014, eventually
employing 1,000 for manufacturing its Intimissimo brand,
Francesco Ruffoli,  Calzedonia ’s executive director, said as he
signed a cooperation agreement with Serbia’s Economy Minister
Nebojsa Ciric in the capital Belgrade today.  Calzedonia opened its first Serbian plant in 2010 in nearby
Sombor, where it produces 20,000 items a day with 670 workers.
It will also add another 400 jobs at the first facility, with an
800,000-euro subsidy from the Serbian government, Ciric said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
