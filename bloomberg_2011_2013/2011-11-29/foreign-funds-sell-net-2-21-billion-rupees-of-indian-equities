Overseas  investors  sold a net  2.21
billion rupees  ($42.5 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
increasing their withdrawals from equities this year to 26.3
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 17.3 billion rupees of shares and sold
19.5 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They bought a net 586 million rupees of bonds,
taking total flows into debt this year to 199.2 billion rupees.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 22 percent this
year, the most in  Asia  after Taiwan’s  Taiex Index (TWSE) , on concern a
slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis may erode company
profits already threatened by the most aggressive interest-rate
increases among major Asian economies.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.445 trillion rupees in stocks
and 985.9 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
