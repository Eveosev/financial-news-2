Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co., the
state producer in the capital of the  United Arab Emirates , will
maintain a cut in shipments of its flagship Murban crude for
sale under long-term contracts for January.  Shipments of  Murban , refined to produce more diesel and
other light fuels, will be 5 percent lower than volumes agreed
to under long-term contracts, the company known as Adnoc said
today in an e-mail. That’s the same level of reduction announced
for Murban supply for December.  Adnoc will also trim January shipments of its Umm Shaif
grade by 5 percent below contracted amounts, in line with the
December reduction, it said.  Supplies of Upper Zakum crude, a high-sulfur variety that
yields mainly fuel oil, will be 3 percent lower, marking a
narrower reduction than the 5 percent cut announced for December
cargoes. Adnoc didn’t announce any decreases from contracted
levels for  Lower Zakum , according to the statement. That grade
was cut 5 percent in December.  The U.A.E. was the fourth-largest Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries producer in October, pumping 2.55 million
barrels of crude a day, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Adnoc plans to keep crude output unchanged for the rest of the
year at about 2.5 million barrels a day, Director-General
Abdullah Nasser al-Suwaidi said on Sept. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
