Turkey  agreed with  China Tianchen
Engineering Corp . to construct up to 1 billion cubic meters of
underground natural gas storage capacity in the center of the
country.  The project near Tuz Golu, a lake south of Ankara, will be
the biggest Chinese investment in Turkey to date, Fazil Senel,
director of state pipeline operator Botas Boru Hatlari Ile
Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas, told reporters today. Financing for
the project, estimated at about $640 million, is provided by a
World Bank loan signed in 2006.  Tianchen will construct the first 500 million cubic meters
of storage by 2016 and the second by 2019.  The facility will be able to release as much as 40 million
cubic meters of gas into the Turkish grid daily and will have an
operational life of 10 years, Senel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
