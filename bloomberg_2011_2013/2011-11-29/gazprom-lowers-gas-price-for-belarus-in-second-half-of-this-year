OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas export
monopoly, reduced fuel prices for Belarus in the second half of
this year and will allow the country to delay some payments
after agreeing to buy the national pipeline operator.  Beltransgaz, the Belarusian operator, will pay $244.80 per
1,000 cubic meters of natural gas for second-half supplies,
Moscow-based Gazprom said today in an e-mailed statement. That
represents a 12 percent discount from previously contracted
third-quarter prices and is 20 percent less than the fourth-
quarter level, according to the statement.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  and his Belarusian
counterpart Aleksandr Lukashenko agreed to slash  gas prices  next
year at a Nov. 25 meeting near Moscow as the countries integrate
into a single economic zone and Belarus struggles to contain a
balance of payments crisis.  Beltransgaz, the Belarusian pipeline company, will pay for
part of the second-half gas supplies this year and the rest in
monthly installments next year, Gazprom said.  Belarus will pay $165.60 per 1,000 cubic meters for gas
deliveries next year, according to the Nov. 25 agreement.
Belarus in return agreed to allow Gazprom to buy the half of the
operator that it didn’t already own for $2.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
