The company that controls the Empire
State Building, the landmark 102-story skyscraper in  midtown
Manhattan , may file to become a publicly traded real estate
investment trust in about three months.  Malkin Holdings LLC, supervisor of the company the holds
the title to the tower, has “embarked on a course of action”
that could result in it becoming part of a new  REIT (BBREIT) , Empire
State Building Associates LLC said in a regulatory  filing  today.
Documents may be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in about three months, according to the filing.  A public offering would give investors the opportunity to
own a piece of one of New York’s most famous buildings as the
city’s real estate values rebound after the recession. Midtown
Manhattan office property prices have gained 87 percent since a
mid-2009 trough, according to Green Street Advisors Inc., a REIT
research firm in  Newport Beach , California.  Malkin Holdings supervises property-owning partnerships led
by Peter Malkin and his son Anthony Malkin. It owns the 2.9
million-square-foot (269,000-square-meter) Empire State Building
in conjunction with the estate of Leona Helmsely.  Partnerships including the Malkins control more than 10
million square feet of office properties in Manhattan,  New
York ’s Westchester County and Fairfield County in  Connecticut .  Brandy Bergman, a spokeswoman for Malkin Holdings, declined
to comment beyond the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
