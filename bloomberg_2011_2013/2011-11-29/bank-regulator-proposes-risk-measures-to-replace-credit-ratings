U.S. banking regulators proposed a
rule required by the Dodd-Frank Act that would strip credit-
ratings references from quality standards used in evaluating
investment portfolios.  Under the proposal released today by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, banks would have to seek
alternative measures of creditworthiness in investment
securities, securities offerings, and foreign bank capital
equivalency deposits. The agency said in a  statement  that it
would take public comments on the proposal for the next 30 days.  “National banks and federal savings associations would be
expected to continue to maintain appropriate ongoing reviews of
their investment portfolios,” the OCC statement said, requiring
banks to verify they meet safety standards “appropriate for the
institution’s risk profile.”  For national banks purchasing securities, the proposal
replaces credit ratings with a demonstration that the security
issuer can “meet financial commitments under the security for
the projected life of the asset or exposure.”  The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul required
federal agencies to replace references to ratings with an
“appropriate” alternative after  Moody’s Investors Service (MCO)  and
McGraw-Hill’s  Standard & Poor’s  unit gave high marks to subprime
mortgage bonds that contributed to the housing bubble. In
February,  John Walsh , acting Comptroller of the Currency, told
lawmakers that the credit-rating ban could make it difficult for
U.S. regulators to adopt the Basel III capital and liquidity
framework.  To contact the reporter on this story:
