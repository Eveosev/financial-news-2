Some farmers in  Guatemala  may lose
coffee output as heavy rains spur crop diseases, the country’s
National Coffee Association said.  National crop losses are limited, while some producers will
lose as much as 30 percent of their harvest, Nancy Mendez, an
association spokeswoman, said in an e-mail on Nov. 26 in
response to questions from Bloomberg News. The country will
produce 3.7 million bags this season, the group has said. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  The farms most affected are in the municipality of San
Pedro Yepocapa, in the department of Chimaltenango, Mendez said
today in a telephone interview from  Guatemala City , the capital.  “The area’s production represents a small percentage of
national output,” Mendez said. “That’s why we are not changing
production estimates yet.”  Honduras is Central America’s biggest coffee grower,
followed by Guatemala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
