Denmark’s home-loan industry , the
world’s biggest issuer of mortgage-backed covered bonds, is
looking to Germany to avoid a repeat of the housing bubble that
sent Scandinavia’s weakest economy to the brink of a recession.  Realkredit Danmark A/S ,  Denmark ’s second-largest mortgage
lender, wants the $495 billion industry to reject loan
applications if  house prices  exceed what German banks call the
mortgage lending value, which strips out temporary price
fluctuations to arrive at a long-term valuation.  “When mortgage banks come forward and say, ‘We cannot go
to market value,’ that would send a powerful signal” that
there’s a bubble in the making, said Klaus Kristiansen,
executive vice president of asset liability management at
Realkredit Danmark, the mortgage unit of  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE) 
“Those warnings weren’t clear enough in the 2000s.”  Denmark is the only Nordic country at risk of lurching into
a recession, as falling house prices and rising joblessness
erode  consumer confidence  and undermine demand. Household
sentiment dropped this month to its lowest in more than two
years. The government on Nov. 3 cut its forecast for private
spending this year to a 0.6 percent contraction, versus its
previous estimate for growth.  Denmark’s economy shrank more than economists surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated in the third quarter, contracting 0.8
percent from the three months through June, the statistics
office said today.  ‘Worrying’ Development  “It’s worrying because it’ll be more difficult to reverse
the development,” said  Steen Bocian , chief economist at Danske
Bank. “In contrast to 2008-2009, there’s not much room for a
more expansive fiscal policy.”  Denmark’s Social Democrat-led government, elected in
September, said this month it will appoint a committee to
investigate the causes of the financial crisis, including what
role Denmark’s real estate market played. It sees the  budget
deficit  widening to 5.1 percent of gross domestic product next
year, more than the euro area average shortfall of 3.4 percent,
according to the European Commission’s Nov. 10 estimates.  “For sure we have an interest in lending out as much as we
can,” Kristiansen said. “On the other hand, we have an even
greater financial interest in long-term sustainability, so if
this measure could actually stabilize house prices, it would be
worth doing.”  Meeting Resistance  Still, Realkredit’s proposal is meeting resistance. The
mortgage industry is divided over what role it played in fanning
the housing bubble and what measures, if any, it should take to
avoid another.  Affordable mortgages have made homeownership possible for
about 50 percent more Danes than Germans, and adopting  Germany ’s
model could limit homeownership to older, wealthier people,
according to Ane Arnth Jensen, director of Association of Danish
Mortgage Banks.  “In theory, I agree but who knows when there’s a bubble,
and who’s going to set the price?” Jensen said in an interview.
“Who is smarter than the market?”  The association rejected calls by the central bank earlier
this year to discontinue interest-only loans, which Governor
Nils Bernstein said are destabilizing the market. It also
rejected a proposal by its rival, the Danish Mortgage Banks’
Federation, to reduce refinancing risks by eliminating the one-
year bonds that fund 20- and 30-year adjustable-rate loans. The
association cited consumer and investor demand. Refinancing
auctions this month have resulted in near-record low yields.  Policy Role  “It’s the fiscal policy that has to take care of the
overheating of the economy and stimulating the economy,” said
Soeren Holm, head of finance at Nykredit A/S,  Europe ’s biggest
issuer of mortgage-backed covered bonds and a member of the
association. “I don’t see at all how a mortgage lending value
can do anything about that.”  By the end of next year, average home values in Denmark
will have dropped 25 percent since peaking in 2007, according to
the government-backed Economic Council. Denmark’s $325 billion
economy probably will contract 0.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, Danske Bank, the country’s biggest lender, said earlier
this month.  In Germany, prices for owner-occupied housing have climbed
about 6.1 percent in the four years through Sept. 30, according
to the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks. Economic growth
will reach 2.9 percent this year before slowing to 0.8 percent
next year, the European Commission said Nov. 10.  Home Ownership  About 43 percent of Germans own their own homes, according
to the German association. That compares with at least 64
percent in Denmark, figures from the country’s statistics agency
show.  Adopting Germany’s mortgage lending value also would reduce
mortgage banks’ need to raise additional collateral, according
to Realkredit’s Kristiansen. “It is very expensive for us to
see house price come down 20 percent,” he said.  The lenders, which fund virtually all home loans in
Denmark, can issue covered bonds against 80 percent of a
property’s market value. If prices fall, lifting the loan-to-
value ratio above 80 percent, lenders must provide more
collateral to restore the ratio.  ‘Critical Periods’  In a declining market, selling junior covered bonds to
raise the collateral may be impossible, potentially creating
financial instability, the Danish association warned in its 2010
report. It recommended measures that would lift the collateral
requirement during “critical periods.”  In Germany, banks issue covered bonds against 60 percent of
mortgage lending value, according to the Pfandbrief association.
Covered bonds fund about one-fourth of mortgages, with savings
bank and credit cooperative loans funding most of the remainder.  Denmark’s central bank said it is awaiting the passage of a
European Commission proposal that would allow countries to set
tighter loan-to-value limits during periods of high lending
growth. The bank also recommended earlier this year that
lawmakers lift a cap on property taxes.  The commission’s proposal offers another way to “mitigate
future house bubbles,” central bank spokesman Karsten Biltoft
said in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg questions.  Danish mortgage banks issued 148 billion euros ($200
billion) in mortgage-backed covered bonds last year, almost
twice the amount sold in second-ranked  Sweden  and more than
three times that of Germany, according to the Brussels-based
 European Covered Bond Council .  “It’s important that we have a dialogue on where we should
go and what needs to be adapted,” Kristiansen said. House
prices could drop 2.5 percent next year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
