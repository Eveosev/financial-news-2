Naspers Ltd. (NPN) ,  Africa ’s largest media
company, said first-half profit fell 46 percent as development
spending almost doubled while it made fewer acquisitions.  Net income declined to 1.87 billion rand ($224 million) in
the six months through September, from 3.45 billion rand a year
earlier, Naspers said in a statement today. That missed the 2.36
billion rand average of three analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales rose 17 percent to 18.5 billion rand, boosted by
rising Internet income, the Cape Town-based company said.  The stock dropped 0.7 percent to 353.45 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg.  Naspers will invest in acquisitions instead of returning
money to shareholders, Steve Pacak, its finance director, said
at a  shareholders’ meeting  on Aug. 26. Naspers spent more than
$532 million on acquisitions last year. The company is focusing
on growing existing operations as rising prices for internet
companies make value harder to find, it said in June.  While revenue growth should be “fairly robust” during the
second half, the focus on organic expansion and developing new
technologies will affect profit growth, Naspers said.  “We continue to believe that this strategy is sound and
will stimulate long-term growth,” it said. “Our funding
structure remains sound” with net debt, excluding satellite
leases, of 6.8 billion rand.  Rising Development Costs  Development costs in the six months rose to 1.1 billion
rand from 631 million rand, it said.  Naspers said it concluded acquisitions of internet service
businesses during the period for a total of $162 million. Those
include a 68.2 percent interest in Vipindirim Electronic
Services Plc, or Markafoni, a Turkish e-commerce group. In
Italy, Naspers acquired a 70 percent stake in online shopping
and price comparison company 7 Pixel SRL, and it bought Ukraine
online classifieds company Slando Ltd.  The company’s revenue from its 35 percent stake in  Tencent (700) ,
 China ’s largest Internet service provider, rose 46 percent to
4.9 billion rand. The South African company’s stake in Russian
Internet group Mail.ru, which has a stake in Facebook Inc., also
helped boost earnings, Naspers said.  The pay television unit increased subscribers by 269,000 to
5.2 million in the period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
