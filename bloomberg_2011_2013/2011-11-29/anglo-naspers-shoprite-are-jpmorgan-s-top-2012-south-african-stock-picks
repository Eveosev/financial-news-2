Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Naspers Ltd. (NPN)  and
 Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  are among JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s top 2012
South African stock picks as the investment bank favors mining,
media and retail companies.  JPMorgan has an “overweight” recommendation on  South
African equities , which may rise 15 percent by the end of next
year, strategists including Deanne Gordon wrote in a note
yesterday. The recommendation means investors should hold more
of the shares than are represented in benchmark indexes. This
gain lags behind JPMorgan’s estimated 22 percent increase for
 emerging markets , according to the note.  The investment bank is “neutral” South African cash,
which may return 5.5 percent and “underweight” government
bonds, which may rise 2 percent in 2012, the strategists wrote.  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI) , a diversified mining group,
Harmony Gold Mining Co,  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , the
largest maker of generic medicines in the southern hemisphere,
 British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  and retailers Mr. Price Group Ltd.,
The  Spar Group Ltd. (SPP)  and Woolworths Holdings Ltd. are also among
JPMorgan’s top ten stock picks for 2012.  Stocks to avoid, according to JPMorgan, include  Standard
Bank Group Ltd. ,  Africa ’s biggest lender, Telkom  South Africa 
Ltd., Africa’s largest fixed-line phone company,  Massmart
Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , South Africa’s biggest food and general-goods
wholesaler, and Group Five Ltd., a construction company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
