Hong Kong  accounted for the three
areas with the highest retail rents in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  The Causeway Bay district tops the company’s survey with
annual rent of $2,001 per square foot at the end of the third
quarter, Cushman said in an e-mailed statement. The Central
business district is second at $1,624, it said.  Increased spending by cashed-up Chinese tourists and the
addition of new shopping venues have driven up prime street shop
rents in Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to  China  in
1997. Chinese tourists visiting Hong Kong jumped 18 percent to
4.1 million in August from a year earlier, the first time the
figure has surpassed the 4 million-mark, according to the city’s
tourism board.  The growth in tourist arrivals “will further attract
foreign brands to the market,” Cushman said in today’s
statement. It will enable “landlords to remain on the favorable
end of negotiations.”  The  Link Real Estate Investment Trust (823) , Hong Kong’s biggest
property trust with more than 180 malls and garages in the city,
said this month that total income for distribution to unit
holders in the six months ended Sept. 30 rose 21 percent from a
year earlier on the back of rising retail rental revenue.  The Tsim Sha Tsui district ranked third in the survey, with
annual rents of $1,463, Cushman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
