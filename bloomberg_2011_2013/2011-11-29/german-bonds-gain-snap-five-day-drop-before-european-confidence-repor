German bonds fell, pushing 30-year
yields above those on Treasuries for the first time since 2009,
on concern the nation will have to fund its weaker euro-region
peers as  Europe  grapples to contain a sovereign debt crisis.  Bunds dropped for a sixth day as stocks rose around the
world, reducing demand for safer assets. Spanish bonds gained
and  Italian securities  erased losses as two officials said
policy makers are reconsidering the role of the  European Central
Bank  in insulating the two countries from market turmoil.
 Belgian bonds  rose even as the nation paid the most in three
years to sell six-month bills.  “Bunds are suffering as the market speculates that  Germany 
is going to be on the hook to fund whatever solution the euro-
region finance ministers come up with” for the crisis, said
Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate
Markets in  London . “Risk assets appear to be well bid.”  Ten-year German yields rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.34 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time after
rising to 2.37 percent, the highest level since Aug. 9. The 2
percent bond due in January 2022 dropped 0.33, or 3.30 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,335) face amount, to 96.995.  Germany’s 30-year yield climbed five basis points to 2.94
percent after rising to 2.98 percent,  surpassing  the equivalent
U.S. rate for this first time since May 2009. The 30-year
Treasury yield has been an average 70 basis points above the
German rate over the past year.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  and the Standard & Poor’s 500
 Index (SXXP)  both gained 0.8 percent.  Brussels Meeting  Finance ministers meeting in Brussels today will discuss
channeling ECB loans to cash-strapped euro nations through the
 International Monetary Fund , aiming to bring the central bank
onto the front lines without violating its ban on direct lending
to governments, said the officials, who declined to be
identified because the talks were at an early stage.  Germany failed to get bids for 35 percent of the bunds it
offered for sale on Nov. 23. The retained amount was the highest
proportion of unsold 10-year debt since 1995, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, on concern Europe’s largest economy will
have to fund increasing bailouts.  Spanish bonds gained for a second day, with 10-year yields
falling 18 basis points to 6.39 percent. Ten-year Italian yields
were little changed at 7.24 percent, erasing an increase of as
much as 15 basis points.  Italian Auction  Italian bonds fell earlier as the nation sold 7.5 billion
euros of debt at yields above the 7 percent level that forced
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. The Rome-based
Treasury auctioned 2014 notes at 7.89 percent, 2020 debt at 7.28
percent and 2022 bonds at 7.56 percent.  “The problem is that Italy is issuing debt at just shy of
8 percent and if yields don’t come down in the medium term then
obviously things could get pretty difficult,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital  in
London. “Today’s auction itself was pretty good, it shows
there’s demand out there.”  Italy’s 10-year yield has climbed more than one percentage
point this month and about 2.5 percentage points this year amid
concern the nation’s debt load -- bigger than that of Greece,
 Spain , Ireland and Portugal combined -- is unsustainable.  The ECB failed to fully offset the extra liquidity created
by its bond purchases for the first time in seven months, a sign
of mounting tensions among euro-area banks. While the central
bank has failed to “sterilize” its bond program at least four
times before, this is the first time it has happened since the
ECB expanded the program to buy Italian and Spanish bonds.  ECB Buying  The ECB began buying Italian and Spanish debt on Aug. 8,
according to traders who saw the transactions, as it sought to
contain a surge in financing costs. After bond yields in the two
countries fell to around 5 percent that week, they climbed above
6.5 percent this month amid speculation the nations won’t be
able to repay their debts.  Belgium ’s  10-year yields  fell 28 basis points to 5.30
percent after declining 29 basis points yesterday. Two-year
rates dropped 71 basis points to 3.85 percent.  The debt agency in Brussels said it sold 502 million euros
of three-month bills at an average yield of 2.185 percent,
compared with 1.575 percent at the prior auction on Nov. 15.
Investors submitted bids for 5.61 times the amount on offer, up
from 1.45 times two weeks ago. It also sold 513 million euros of
six-month debt at 2.438 percent, versus 1.086 percent on Nov. 8.  Volatility on Belgian sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today followed by the Netherlands, according
to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  German  government bonds  have returned 6.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds lost 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
