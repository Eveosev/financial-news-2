U.S. stocks extended gains after a
gauge of American  consumer confidence  rose the most since 2003,
bolstering optimism in the world’s largest economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.6 percent to
1,200.03 at 10:01 a.m. in New York.  The Conference Board’s index of consumer sentiment
increased to 56 from a revised 40.9 reading in October, the
biggest monthly gain since April 2003, figures from the New
York-based private research group showed today. The gauge, at a
four-month high, exceeded the most-optimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The  S&P 500  climbed 2.9 percent yesterday, its biggest gain
in a month, after Thanksgiving-weekend retail sales climbed to a
record and speculation grew that European leaders will do more
to tame the debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
