A pair of diamonds each weighing
almost 36 carats and a set of Chinese scrolls led sales at a
 Christie’s International  auction in Hong Kong last night.  Cui Ruzhuo’s eight-scroll sequence of lotus flowers painted
this year in ink and color was the highest-selling lot, fetching
HK$123.9 million ($15.9 million), or more than twice its HK$60
million top estimate. The unmounted D-color diamonds, sold
separately for HK$64.5 million and HK$63.4 million to the same
telephone bidder, were the highlights of a daylong HK$644.6
million jewelry sale, where 241 of 310 lots found buyers.  For most works, the cautious atmosphere seen earlier this
week at wine and contemporary-art auctions again prevailed
during yesterday’s bidding.  “In Beijing a credit crunch is on, and prices are coming
to a more realistic level,” said Anthony Lin, a consultant on
Chinese art. “That crazy insane level of top prices element is
simmering down.”  The second-most-expensive work offered in the fine Chinese
modern paintings sale failed to sell. It was an ink-and-color
painting by 20th-century Chinese master  Zhang Daqian  with a
presale estimate of HK$20 million to HK$40 million.  Another of his works with the same low estimate only found
a buyer when bidding was reopened with a reduced reserve price.
The painting, “Verdant Mountains and Layered Peaks After
Rain,” sold for HK$21.9 million, including buyer’s premium.  Zhang Demand  The tepid bidding for Zhang’s works reflects a reversal in
sentiment since June, when one of his paintings fetched a record
$HK191 million at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  Hong Kong sale in which all 25 of
his works sold.  Christie’s six-day sale ends today with sales of Chinese
ceramics, jades and rhinoceros horns as well as watches. The
London-based auction house is seeking to raise a total for the
week of as much as HK$2.6 billion ($334 million). Christie’s
raised HK$2.19 billion before today’s sales, according to the
company’s website.  Today’s offerings include a 15th-century Ming dynasty blue-
and-white porcelain moonflask and a Qianlong-era white jade vase
and cover that both have high estimates of HK$35 million.  Buyers pay a commission on top of the hammer price that is
25 percent for the first HK$400,000, plus 20 percent up to HK$8
million, and 12 percent above that. The wine premium is 20
percent. Estimates reflect the price before the premium.  To contact the writer on the story:
