U.K. household spending rose in 2010
from a year earlier as Britain recovered from the worst
recession since World War II.  Average weekly expenditure per household rose to 473.60
pounds ($737.30) from 455 pounds in 2009, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. Total expenditure per
household, adjusted to 2010 prices, fell from 476 pounds in
2009.  Spending was highest on transport at 64.90 pounds per week,
an 11 percent increase from the previous year. More than half of
all transport spending was on running costs which rose by 14
percent or 4 pounds as petrol, diesel and other motor oils
increased by 2.40 pounds.  “The increase was manifested in those necessary items of
fuel, rent and food and non-alcoholic drinks,” said Giles
Horsfield, a statistician at the ONS. “This contrasts with
categories like recreation and culture where there was very
steady expenditure between the two years.”  The data are from the statistics offices’ Family Spending
survey, which questioned 5,260 U.K. households. Inflation-
adjusted data refer to the retail-price index, a cost of living
measure used in wage bargaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
