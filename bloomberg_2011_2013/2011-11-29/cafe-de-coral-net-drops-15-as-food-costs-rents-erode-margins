Cafe de Coral Holdings Ltd. (341) ,  Hong
Kong ’s largest listed restaurant chain, posted a 15 percent drop
in first-half profit as margins were eroded by rising food costs
and rents as well as higher wages.  Net income fell to HK$191 million ($25 million) in the six
months ended Sept. 30 from HK$224 million a year earlier,
according to a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange. Sales
climbed 10 percent to HK$2.9 billion.  Cafe de Coral opened 10 outlets under its name and the
Super Super Congee and Noodles brand during the period to take
advantage of rising demand for fast, inexpensive meals, it said.
The Hong Kong-based company said it also added four catering
contracts in the period and is “heading firmly towards the goal
of 200 outlets by 2014” in mainland  China .  About half of the chain’s 7,800 workers received a 19
percent salary increase as the Hong Kong government raised the
city’s minimum wage, according to the statement. Cafe de Coral
estimated its annual payroll will be about HK$120 million within
the year.  Cafe De Carol rose 1.3 percent to HK$18.28 at the 4 p.m.
close of trading in Hong Kong. It had gained as much as 2.55
percent in the morning session, before reporting earnings.  The stock has dropped 4.9 percent this year, compared with
a 21 percent slump in the benchmark  Hang Seng  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
