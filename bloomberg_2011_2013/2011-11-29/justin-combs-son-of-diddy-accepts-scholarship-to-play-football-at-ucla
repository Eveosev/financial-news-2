Justin Combs, son of music mogul
Sean “Diddy” Combs, accepted a scholarship to play football at
UCLA, according to a statement from the family.  “Playing Division I football was a lifelong dream of mine,
and through hard work I was able to achieve it,” Justin Combs
said in the statement.  The 5-foot-9, 170-pound defensive back played high school
football at Iona Prep in New Rochelle,  New York . Sean Combs
called his son’s signing with UCLA one of the proudest moments
of his life.  “This is everything a father could want for his son, for
him to excel at what he loves to do and is truly passionate
about,” he said in the statement.  UCLA fired football coach Rick Neuheisel yesterday, two
days after the Bruins lost to crosstown rival Southern
California 50-0. UCLA is 6-6 this season.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
