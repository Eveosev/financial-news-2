The Australian dollar will
probably rise above parity with its U.S. counterpart in the
first quarter of next year, prompting a third of large
domestic businesses to consider setting up offshore
operations,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  said, citing a
survey.  The so-called Aussie will peak at $1.07 to $1.09 by the
end of March, according to Commonwealth Bank’s Aussie Dollar
Barometer report, based on a poll of almost 900 local
businesses. The currency will trade at $1 in the first
quarter, economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict. It
has weakened 5.3 percent in November amid concern the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe will dent global economic
growth.  “If the global economy deteriorates further, the
Australian dollar may not reach the very high levels expected
by Australian businesses,”  Joseph Capurso , a currency
strategist at the nation’s largest lender in Sydney said in
the e-mailed report today. “The deteriorating global
economic outlook has pushed the Australian dollar down.”  The Aussie traded at 99.69 U.S. cents as of 5:00 p.m. in
Sydney yesterday compared with a closing level of $1.0530 on
Oct. 31. The currency rose as high as $1.1081 on July 27, the
most since it was freely floated in 1983.  Thirty percent of large businesses with sales of at
least A$500 million ($498 million) a year, and about 37
percent of exporters are considering establishing offshore
operations because of the strong currency, according to the
report.  Commonwealth Bank’s currency barometer is updated every
three months and is based on a survey conducted by market
research firm East & Partners.
