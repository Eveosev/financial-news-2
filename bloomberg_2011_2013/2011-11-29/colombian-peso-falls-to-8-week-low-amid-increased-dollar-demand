Colombia ’s peso fell to an eight-
week low as maturing currency futures led to increased demand
for dollars in the  spot market .  The peso dropped 1.2 percent to 1,972.40 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:57 a.m. Bogota time, from 1,949.77 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,972.70, its weakest level since Oct. 5.  “Maturing forwards are leaving people short, so they buy
the dollars in the spot market, pressuring it,” said Andres
Munoz, the head currency trader at financial services holding
company Corp. Financiera Colombiana, known as Corficolombiana,
in Bogota.  Colombia’s currency may fall to as low as 2,015 and end
this year at 1,985, amid higher risk aversion and increased
demand for dollars as foreign companies buy the greenback to
ship profits abroad, according to Munoz.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.65
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.209 centavo to 118.517 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
