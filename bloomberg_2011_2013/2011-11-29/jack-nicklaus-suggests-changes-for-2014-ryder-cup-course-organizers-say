Jack Nicklaus  has suggested changes
to the golf course at the Gleneagles Hotel in  Scotland , which
will host the 2014 Ryder Cup, organizers said.  Work on the 9th, 10th and 18th holes at the course in
Perthshire will increase the difficulty for players
participating in the 40th staging of the biennial golf
competition between the U.S. and  Europe . It will be held Sept.
26 to Sept. 28th in 2014, organizers said today in an e-mail.  Europe won the last event, 14 1/2-13 1/2, at Celtic Manor
Resort in Newport, Wales in October 2010. The U.S. can win back
the cup next year at the Medinah Country Club outside  Chicago .  The Gleneagles resort will increase the size of a pond on
the par-5 9th hole and the tee boxes will be relocated on the
par-3 10th, moving the approach angle to the green and bringing
a bunker on the left more into play, the organizers said. The
landing area on the par-5 18th will be leveled to remove a rise
to the hole.  Work is also being done to reduce water on the greens, the
organizers said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
