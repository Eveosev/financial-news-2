The euro dropped against most of its
major counterparts after Italy paid more than 7 percent in its
debt auctions and on speculation European leaders won’t agree on
how to stem the region’s debt crisis.  The shared currency erased gains versus the dollar after
the  European Central Bank  failed to offset the extra liquidity
created by its bond purchase program. Euro-area finance
ministers are meeting today to seek a resolution to debt
turmoil. Higher-yielding currencies, such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars, rose. Sweden’s krona rallied after gross
domestic product  expanded  more than analysts estimated.  “People are going to be looking at the euro group meeting
today, and I don’t think it’s much of a game-changer,” said
 Mark McCormick , a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co. in New York. “It’s a risk-on day, so the currencies that
have been sold off the hardest are likely to be the biggest
advancers.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3326 at 8:54 a.m. New
York time, after earlier gaining to as high as $1.3442. It
declined 0.2 percent to 103.64 yen. The dollar dropped 0.3
percent to 77.77 yen.  Australia ’s dollar rallied for a second day, gaining 0.9
percent to 99.95 U.S. cents, paring its drop this month to 5.1
percent.  Canada ’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0304 per
 U.S. dollar .  The ECB failed to fully offset the extra liquidity created
by its bond purchases for the first time in seven months, a sign
of mounting tensions among euro-area banks.  The central bank said 85 banks bid a total of 194.2 billion
euros ($259.4 billion) for seven-day term deposits. It had aimed
to drain 203.5 billion euros, the amount its bond purchases have
created since the program began in May last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
