Almost two out of three hedge-fund
managers predict  Greece  will drop the euro within two years and
four in 10 say Italy and Spain will default or restructure their
debts, a survey found.  About 65 percent said European Union members would issue
euro bonds to ease the region’s sovereign debt crisis, according
to the survey by Aksia LLC, a New York-based research and
advisory firm, which questioned 125 hedge funds managing about
$800 billion of assets, or more than one-third of hedge fund
assets worldwide.  Eight in 10 managers said the  Federal Reserve ’s so-called
operation twist, a plan to buy $400 billion in longer-term
maturities by the end of June 2012, would fail to affect
financial markets and 94 percent backed further monetary easing
by European authorities, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
