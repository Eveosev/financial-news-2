The Italian government should
introduce fiscal measures amounting to 11 billion euros ($14.7
billion), overhaul the pension system and ease labor laws, la
Repubblica daily said, citing a document signed by European
Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn .  The document will be presented to euro-area finance
ministers in Brussels today, according to the newspaper.  The increase in  Italy ’s bond yields in the short term has
“a limited impact on the budget,” even as the risk of a
default “can increase rapidly in the absence of adequate
responses,” Repubblica said, citing the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
