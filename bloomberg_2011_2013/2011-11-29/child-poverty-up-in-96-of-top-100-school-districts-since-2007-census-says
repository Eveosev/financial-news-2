The child poverty rate rose during
the recession in 1 of every 5 counties across the nation, the
U.S. Census Bureau  said  today.  The increase in poverty between 2007 and 2010 was
especially pronounced in the nation’s largest school systems,
where 96 of the top 100 districts reported growth in the number
of poor children, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Census Bureau tracks school district poverty rates for
the U.S. Department of Education, which uses the data to direct
federal funding to poor schools. The figures also are used to
determine the places where poor children’s test scores must be
reported separately under the No Child Left Behind Act, which
can affect school funding and personnel.  The government sets the poverty level at $22,113 for a
four-person household that includes two people under 18.  Lee County,  Florida , reported the greatest increase in poor
students during the recession. The proportion of poor children
in the district, whose population includes about 90,000
children, almost doubled to 25.3 percent.  The Detroit City School District, which was the poorest in
the nation in 2007, remained at the bottom in 2010. The bureau
reported 47.2 percent of the 139,300 children in the nation’s
ninth-largest district are poor, a 20 percent increase from
2007.  The nation’s largest school district --  New York City , with
an estimated 1.25 million children between the ages of 5 and 17
-- reported a rise in poverty to 29 percent in 2010, up from
26.6 percent in 2007.  School districts in Cherry Creek,  Colorado ; El Paso,  Texas ;
Mobile,  Alabama ; and Seattle reported decreases. The Cherry
Creek district in suburban Denver had 11 percent fewer poor
students in 2010, with a child poverty rate of 8.6 percent.  Almost one-quarter of the 13,619 districts in the nation
have 20,000 or more students. Those districts contain 81.6
percent of poor children, the Census Bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
