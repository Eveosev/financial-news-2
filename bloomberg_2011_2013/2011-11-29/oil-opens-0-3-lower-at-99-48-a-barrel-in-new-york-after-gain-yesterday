Oil fell from the highest price in
two weeks, paring a second monthly gain, as signs of rising U.S.
stockpiles countered optimism about the economy of the world’s
biggest crude consumer.  Futures slid as much as 0.8 percent after increasing for
the past three days. The industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  said inventories climbed by 3.44 million barrels last
week. Prices rose yesterday after U.S. consumer confidence
climbed the most in more than eight years and Iranian protesters
vandalized the British Embassy’s compound in Tehran, stoking
speculation that tension in the  Middle East  may escalate and
threaten crude supplies.  “We’ve got profit-taking today off the rally driven by the
attack on the U.K. embassy,” said  Victor Shum , a senior
principal at Purvin & Gertz Inc., a consultant in  Singapore .
“That provided support on top of the good economic data out of
the U.S. The API data poured some cold water on that bullish
news.”  Crude for January delivery slid as much as 83 cents to
$98.96 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile. It was at $99.14 at 3:57 p.m. in Singapore. The
contract yesterday advanced 1.6 percent to $99.79, the highest
close since Nov. 16. Prices are 6.4 percent higher this month,
after climbing 18 percent in October, and up 18 percent from a
year ago.  $100 Brent  Brent oil for January settlement was down 64 cents at
$110.18 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It closed yesterday up 1.7 percent at $110.82. The
European benchmark contract’s premium to New York’s West Texas
Intermediate was at $11.04, compared with yesterday’s close of
$11.14 and a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Brent may average $100 a barrel next year as Libyan supply
returns and new projects start,  Hussein Allidina , an analyst at
Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a report yesterday. Prices
may be “significantly weaker” in the first half of next year,
falling to as low as $85, the note said.  U.S. crude inventories rose to 339.2 million barrels as
imports surged 10 percent in the week to Nov. 25, the API report
showed. An Energy Department report today will probably show
 supplies  increased 50,000 barrels, according to the median of
response to a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles slipped 173,000 barrels to 209.4
million in the API report. Distillate fuels, including diesel
and heating oil, gained 1.35 million barrels to 139.5 million.
Oil-product imports increased 8.5 percent, the group said.  Motor-fuel supplies probably climbed 1.45 million barrels
in the Energy Department report, the Bloomberg survey showed.
Distillates may have declined 1.25 million, the respondents
said. The department is scheduled to release its inventory data
today at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporters on this story:
