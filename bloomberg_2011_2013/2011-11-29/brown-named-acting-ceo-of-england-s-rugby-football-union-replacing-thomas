Stephen Brown  will take over as
acting chief executive officer of  England ’s Rugby Football Union
from today, replacing Martyn Thomas.  Thomas said earlier this month that he will step down from
all his positions at the governing body on Dec. 16 when his
contract expires, including as acting CEO. He also holds
positions including the chairmanship of the organizing committee
for the 2015  Rugby World Cup  in England.  “Stephen has increasingly taken over the day to day
running of the RFU since I announced on November 2 that I would
not be renewing my contract,” Thomas said in an RFU statement
today. “He has demonstrated in the time that he has been at the
RFU that he is immensely capable and this has been underlined
once again in the last few weeks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
