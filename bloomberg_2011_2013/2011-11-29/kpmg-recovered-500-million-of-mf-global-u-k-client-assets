MF Global (MF) ’s U.K. administrators have
recovered about half of the estimated $1 billion of customer
funds frozen when the brokerage collapsed on Oct. 31.  The final recovery amount will depend on how much can be
taken back from the third-party financial firms which held money
for MF Global’s U.K. clients, said Richard Heis, a partner at
KPMG LLP.  KPMG, which was appointed to supervise the administration
of MF Global UK Ltd., said Nov. 27 that it hoped to return some
money to the broker’s clients by March.  MF Global Holdings Ltd., the New York-based holding
company, sought protection on Oct. 31 in the fifth-largest
financial company bankruptcy by assets. There may be more than
$1.2 billion missing from MF Global Inc.’s customer accounts in
the U.S., according to the court-appointed trustee in the U.S.,
James Giddens.  About $200 million of the missing customer funds may have
been found at JPMorgan Chase in the U.K., the New York Times
reported today.  While  KPMG  wouldn’t confirm the accuracy of the report, it
said it didn’t believe the $200 million reportedly found would
affect recoveries for U.K. clients.  “Based on the information available, the joint special
administrators are not aware of any threat to the segregated
money held on behalf of MF Global U.K. clients arising from the
matters set out in the New York Times report,” the firm said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
