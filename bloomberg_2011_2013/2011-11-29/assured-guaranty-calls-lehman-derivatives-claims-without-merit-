Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  said it will
fight a lawsuit by  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s U.K. unit, in
which Lehman claims it’s owed more than $1 billion from an
Assured subsidiary on derivative transactions.  Lehman Brothers International (Europe) sued AG Financial
Products Inc. yesterday in New York, saying the Assured unit
improperly calculated termination payments under derivative
deals.  “We believe the claims by Lehman Brothers International
(Europe) are without merit, and we will vigorously defend the
lawsuit,” Ashweeta Durani, a spokeswoman for Assured, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Lehman said in the complaint that “a proper calculation”
shows AG Financial Products owes it more than $1 billion. AG
Financial Products claimed it was owed $24.8 million from LBIE,
according to the filing.  Marshall Huebner, a lawyer for the Lehman unit, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The case is Lehman Brothers International ( Europe ) v. AG
Financial Products Inc., 653284-2011, New York State Supreme
Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
