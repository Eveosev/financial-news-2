Athens International Airport SA 
passenger traffic fell 5.3 percent in the first 10 months of the
year as the economic crisis curtailed Greek travel.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport dropped to 12.7 million from 13.4 million a year
earlier, according to a statement on the company’s website
today.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, will account for almost
16 percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs
in 2011, according to London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  Domestic passenger traffic declined 11 percent to 4.3
million and international traffic dropped 2 percent to 8.4
million in the first 10 months, the company said. The number of
domestic passengers fell 9.2 percent to 398,792 in October and
international traffic dropped 8 percent to 804,642.  Air traffic controllers and employees at the Hellenic  Civil
Aviation Authority  held their first 24-hour strike of the year
on Oct. 5 and a 12-hour work stop on Oct. 19, causing hundreds
of flights to be canceled. The strikes had a “serious impact”
on traffic levels in the month, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
