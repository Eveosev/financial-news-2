U.S. gasoline demand rose 3 percent
last week, boosted by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, according
to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers used 8.97 million gallons a day of gasoline in the
week ended Nov. 25, up from 8.71 million the week before,
according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report.  “The Thanksgiving Day holiday produced a typical week-to-
week spike in consumption,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and
director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the
report. “The sharp increase was still not enough to produce an
increase in year-over-year terms.”  Fuel use fell below year-earlier levels for the 13th
consecutive time last week, down 3.8 percent from 2010 levels.
Fuel demand over the previous four weeks was 4.1 percent below a
year earlier, the 36th consecutive decline in that measure.  Gasoline consumption in 2011 through Nov. 25 is down 1.4
percent from a year earlier, according to the second-biggest
payments network company.  The average pump price fell 6 cents to $3.34 a gallon.
Prices were 17 percent higher than a year earlier.  Gasoline demand peaked this year at 9.56 million barrels a
day in the week ended July 1 as motorists filled their tanks
before the July 4 holiday weekend. The lowest level of
consumption came in the week ended Feb. 11 when consumers bought
8.47 million barrels a day.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
