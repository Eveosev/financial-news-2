Former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said that he won’t run in Italy’s next elections and
praised the new leader of his People of Liberty party,  Angelino
Alfano .  Alfano is “transparent,” “smart” and “determined,” and has
the qualities to lead Italy’s center-right political bloc,
Berlusconi said during a book presentation in Rome today. He
said that his PDL party and the Northern League will run
together in the next elections both national and local.  Berlusconi said that his decision to support a technocratic
government led by Mario Monti was “necessary” and “wise.”
Going to elections then wasn’t an option because “it would
damage the country” and the PDL would have lost, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
