India ’s 10-year  bonds  rose for the
first time in three days before the nation auctions debt-
purchase quotas to foreign investors for the first time since
August.  The  Securities and Exchange Board of India  plans to
allocate tomorrow limits that will allow a total of $10 billion
of overseas investment in local-currency bonds. The government
this month raised the cap on  foreign holdings  of rupee-
denominated debt by 20 percent to $60 billion. European finance
ministers are meeting in Brussels today to discuss details on
how to boost the European Financial Stability Facility.  “We are expecting buying at the auction” of debt quotas,
said A.Y. Shedshale, Mumbai-based deputy general manager at Bank
of Maharashtra. “What the market is waiting for is to see if
the U.S. and  Europe  will announce more stimulus measures, which
could help Indian bonds.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.83
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  Global funds bolstered their ownership of Indian government
and corporate securities by $4.3 billion, raising  holdings  to a
record $22.4 billion on Nov. 14, exchange data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate  swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 3 basis points to 8.10 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
