Russia â€™s central bank has limited
the amount of retail deposits a local unit of Kazkommertsbank
may accept as the regulator seeks to keep foreign banks from
sending money abroad,  Kommersant  said, citing unidentified
bankers close to the unit, called Moskommertsbank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
