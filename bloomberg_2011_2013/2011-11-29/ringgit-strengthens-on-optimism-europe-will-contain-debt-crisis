the weakest level in eight weeks as optimism European leaders
will contain the region’s debt crisis boosted sentiment toward

30 percent, according to guidelines to be considered by finance
ministers this week. Foreign direct investment into Malaysia
rose 42 percent in first nine months of this year, Trade

 Europe ,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Trading on the
ringgit will continue to be volatile.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.8 percent from Nov. 25 to 3.1740
per dollar as of 4:03 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s financial markets were closed
