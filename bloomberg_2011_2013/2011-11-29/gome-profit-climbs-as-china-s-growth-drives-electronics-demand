Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings
Ltd. (493)  profit jumped 13 percent in the third quarter as consumers
in the world’s fastest-growing major economy spurred demand at
China’s second-largest electronics retailer.  Net income climbed to 538.8 million yuan ($84 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 477.6 million yuan a year
earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to 14.2 billion yuan. Third-
quarter figures were derived from earnings the Beijing-based
retailer reported today to  Hong Kong ’s stock exchange.  Gome is adding stores to narrow the gap with larger rival
 Suning Appliance Co. (002024)  in an electronics and appliances market
forecast to surge 70 percent to 2.14 trillion yuan by 2015 from
2010, according to London-based researcher Euromonitor
International. Gome also increased selling and distribution
costs 31 percent in the nine months ended Sept. 30 to tap rising
demand for home appliances and electronics.  China’s economy , the world’s second biggest, will expand
8.5 percent next year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development estimated in a report yesterday.  The retailer rose 0.5 percent to HK$2.01 at the close. The
stock has climbed 29 percent since Oct. 3, when it said it would
put a property venture with its jailed founder on hold.  Gome said today it has terminated the plan to form a
property joint venture with Beijing Eagle Real Estate Holdings
Ltd. and Beijing GOME Electrical Appliances Co., because of
“the recent volatility and uncertainty in the macroeconomic
environment.”  The retailer said Sept. 27 it planned a real-estate venture
with billionaire founder and controlling shareholder  Huang Guangyu , also known as Wong Kwong Yu. Huang is serving a 14-year
prison sentence for bribery and insider trading and owns about a
third of the company with his wife Lisa  Du Juan , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
