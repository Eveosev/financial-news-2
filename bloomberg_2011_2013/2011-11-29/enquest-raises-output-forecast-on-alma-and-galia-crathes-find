EnQuest Plc (ENQ) , a North Sea oil
company, promised production growth of 20 percent a year after
finding crude at its Crathes well and deciding to develop the
Alma and Galia fields. The shares gained.  Output will rise to more than 40,000 barrels a day by 2014
from as much as 24,000 barrels next year, the company said in a
statement in London today. The Crathes exploration well, which
the company operates with a 40 percent stake, encountered a 52-
foot column of light oil. Wintershall AG owns 50 percent of the
well and  Ithaca Energy Inc. (IAE)  has 10 percent.  EnQuest is bolstering output both by making new discoveries
and extracting more from older fields. The Alma and Galia
development, which will increase the company’s reserves by 29
million barrels of oil equivalent at a cost of $850 million,
includes the U.K.’s first oil field, which started production in
the 1970s.  “The Alma and Galia development shows the continuing
growth of EnQuest and the breadth and depth of its
capabilities,” Chief Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu said in a
statement. “With current technology field life can be extended
significantly. This type of opportunity fits the EnQuest model
of finding fresh opportunities in mature assets.”  EnQuest rose as much as 13 percent to 102.8 pence in
 London , the most since the company was spun off from Petrofac
Plc and Lundin Petroleum AB in April 2010. Shares traded at
100.4 pence as of 9:56 a.m. local time.  Funding, Acquisitions  The company can fund the Alma and Galia project from
existing cash and cash flows, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan
Swinney said in a telephone interview. The company has money to
pursue further acquisitions, he said.  EnQuest also said today that it will acquire a 40 percent
interest in  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) ’s Kildrummy field, which may
contain 40 million barrels of reserves.  The company’s stock has declined about 28 percent this
year. On Sept. 5 it trimmed 2011 production guidance to 23,000
to 24,500 barrels a day from a previous estimate of 26,500
barrels because of lower-than-expected output at two wells near
the Shetland Islands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
