Crude oil inventories rose 3.44
million barrels to 339.2 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  gained 1.35 million barrels to
139.5 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline
stockpiles  decreased 173,000 barrels to 209.4 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, fell 426,000
barrels to 32.3 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
50,000 barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories
probably rose 1.45 million barrels, the survey showed.
Distillates were expected to decline 1.25 million.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.46, or 1.5 percent,
to $99.67 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled at $99.79,
traded at $99.86 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
