The U.S. Northeast, including  New
York , may begin to have more seasonal temperatures starting next
week and progressing through the middle of the month, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers .  In his 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day forecasts, Rogers
said cooler-than-normal air will move across the U.S. South,
while parts of the upper Great Plains may be warmer than normal.
He said there is some dispute among computer forecast models.  “These significant differences continue to keep our long-
range forecast confidence in a very low state,” Rogers said in
a note to clients today from Bethesda, Maryland.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling.  Power plants  use about
30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to Energy
Department data.  Temperatures in the Northeast have been higher than normal
through the past week.  Yesterday, a new all-time high of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21
Celsius) was set in New York’s Central Park, breaking an old
mark from 1990 and 1896, according to the  National Weather
Service  in Upton, New York.  The high temperature in  Boston  yesterday was 67 degrees, 20
above normal, according to the weather service. It was 70 in
Philadelphia, 19 above normal; 69 in Baltimore, 18 above normal;
and 63 in Portland, Maine, 19 above normal.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Dec. 7 is
about 41 degrees, according to MDA EathSat Weather in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . In Boston it’s 38, in Philadelphia it’s
41, in Atlanta it’s 47, in Chicago it’s 30, in Seattle it’s 41
and in Burbank,  California , it’s 54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
