The European Union published rules
enabling the transfer of carbon-dioxide permits from a 2.6
billion-euro ($3.5 billion) reserve to the  European Investment
Bank , which will then sell the allowances.  EU permits fell as much as 4.9 percent after the measure
was posted today in the official journal. That allows the EU to
transfer as many as 300 million post-2012 allowances from the
so-called NER300 reserve even before a registry to track them
becomes fully operational. The European Commission, the EU
regulatory arm, said earlier this month it aims to deliver the
permits “swiftly” after the regulation enters into force the
day following its publication.  The 27-nation EU decided in 2008 to use proceeds from the
reserve for new entrants to the cap-and-trade program to
encourage renewable energy and carbon-capture technologies. The
Luxembourg-based EIB, which must start selling the allowances
within one month from the delivery, signaled in October that
sales may begin this year and could last beyond 2012. Every
permit carries the right to emit one metric ton of CO2.  Allowances for December fell as much as 30 cents to 7.60
euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange and traded
at 7.93 euros as of 7:37 a.m. in  London .  Permits for delivery in December 2013 fell 2.2 percent to
8.80 euros, valuing the reserve at 2.64 billion euros, compared
with as much as 5.9 billion in May. The contract lost 54 percent
over the past six months on oversupply concerns and speculation
the debt crisis in the region using the euro may worsen.  First to Market  Allowances from the reserve are equivalent to about 15
percent of the average annual quota in the current 2008 to 2012
trading period of the EU emissions-trading system. They will be
the first brought to market from the next phase of the European
carbon cap-and-trade program that begins in 2013.  The EU trading system, which imposes emission limits on
more than 11,000 power plants and manufacturers, started in 2005
and is now in the second phase running from 2008 to 2012.  Expected proceeds on sales from the reserve is for at least
eight carbon-capture projects and 34 renewable-energy systems
covering as much as half the construction and operating costs
that companies and national governments will also help finance.  Climate Targets  Clean-energy technologies will help the EU meet its climate
goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in 2020
compared with 1990 levels. The NER300 aid is on top of subsidies
approved in 2009, when  the bloc allocated one-fifth of a 5
billion-euro economic-stimulus packagefor carbon-capture
projects by utilities including Vattenfall AB,  Endesa SA (ELE)  and
 Enel SpA. (ENEL)  It earmarked 565 million euros for offshore wind power
initiatives.  The EIB has said sales of the first 200 million-permit
tranche of the reserve will commence with over-the-counter
transactions and then other channels, including ICE Futures
Europe and the  European Energy Exchange , as well as auctions.
They must be completed within 10 months from delivery, implying
a volume of 20 million allowances for delivery in December 2013
per month, according to the EIB.  The bank said last month it concluded talks on the legal
documentation for OTC sales with a “sufficiently large group of
counterparts” to start sales after the delivery has taken place.
It doesn’t intend to inform markets when first transactions have
been conducted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
