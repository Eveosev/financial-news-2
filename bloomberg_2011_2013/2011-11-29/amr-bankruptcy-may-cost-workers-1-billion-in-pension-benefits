Employees of  AMR Corp. (AMR) , the parent
of American Airlines that sought bankruptcy protection today,
may lose about $1 billion in pension benefits if the airline
terminates their plans, a U.S. agency said.  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., created to protect
private retirement benefits, may be unable to cover the loss
because Congress has limited the size of pensions it can pay,
Director Josh Gotbaum said today in a statement.  “Unfortunately, when the agency assumed airline plans in
the past, many people’s pensions were cut, in some cases
dramatically,” Gotbaum said in the statement. The PBGC will
encourage American to “fix its financial problems” and keep
its pensions intact, he said.  AMR filed for  bankruptcy protection  after failing to win
cost-cutting labor agreements and sitting out a round of mergers
that dropped it from the world’s largest airline to No. 3 in the
U.S. American becomes the final large U.S. full-fare airline to
seek court protection from creditors.  The airline based in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , has four
traditional pension plans covering almost 130,000 participants,
according to the statement. As of today, the plans combined had
about $8.3 billion in assets to cover about $18.5 billion in
benefits. In the event AMR ends the plans, the PBGC would be
responsible for paying $17 billion, according to the statement.  Marc Hopkins, a spokesman for the guaranty corporation,
said it wasn’t clear if the PBGC would take over American’s
pensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
