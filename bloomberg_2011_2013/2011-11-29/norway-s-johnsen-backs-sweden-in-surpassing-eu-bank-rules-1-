Norway ’s Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen supported Swedish calls to go beyond European Union
capital requirement to ensure “solid banks” across the region.  “I back the view from my Swedish colleague that the
regulations in the EU should be a minimum and that there should
be a possibility for individual countries to go further,” he
said today in an interview. “We’ve promoted work on a Nordic
level to see whether we should move concerted from the Nordic
side, for instance, to implement some of the Basel III
regulations earlier than the original timetable. We’re working
on that.”  Sweden’s central bank,  Finance Ministry  and bank regulator
said banks in the largest Nordic economy will be required to
hold common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 10 percent of
risk-weighted assets from 2013, with the ratio rising to 12
percent in 2015.  Sweden ’s Finance Minister Anders Borg has advocated tougher
regulatory standards for Swedish lenders since the beginning of
the year to ensure the country doesn’t suffer a rerun of its
1990s bank crisis. Norway’s financial regulator said Nov. 25
that the plan in neighboring Sweden was “ambitious.”  “There’s a need to having solid banks,” Johnsen said.
“In my view, solid banks and financial institutions are a
competitive advantage.”  He declined to be more specific when asked whether Norway
would go as high as Sweden in  capital ratios .  DNB ASA is Norway’s largest bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
