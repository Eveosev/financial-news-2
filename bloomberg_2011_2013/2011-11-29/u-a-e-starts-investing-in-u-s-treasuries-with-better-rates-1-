The  United Arab Emirates  is
investing in U.S. Treasuries again because of “reasonable”
rates as the Middle East’s second-largest economy reiterates its
policy of keeping the dirham pegged to the dollar.  “Now, we do invest in U.S. Treasuries because the
circumstances changed and we changed our decision,” the U.A.E.
central bank governor, Sultan Nasser al-Suwaidi, told reporters
in  Abu Dhabi  today. “The  interest rate  on these instruments was
very low, now it is reasonable.”  In July, the U.A.E central bank said it didn’t hold
Treasuries or other financial instruments issued by the U.S.
government due to their “very low” return.  Treasuries due in 10 years and more have returned almost 28
percent this year, the most among 144 bond indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies after accounting for changes in currency rates.  The U.A.E. and  Saudi Arabia  are among five members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council that keep their currencies pegged to
the dollar. Kuwait links its dinar to a currency basket.  “The fixed peg has served our economy, there are up and
downs, but these ups and downs will not change the situation,”
al-Suwaidi said in Abu Dhabi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
