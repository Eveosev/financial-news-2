Euro-area finance ministers agreed
today to extend the capacity of the European Financial Stability
Fund by “introducing sovereign bond practical risk
participation and a co-investment approach,” the EFSF said in
an e-mailed statement.  The EFSF has a current lending capacity of 440 billion
euros. Without knowing the exact amounts needed, EFSF should be
able to leverage its own resources of up to 250 billion euros,
the statement said.  The options are “designed to enlarge the capacity of the
EFSF so that the new instruments available to the EFSF can be
used efficiently,” the statement cites Klaus Regling, EFSF
chief executive officer, as saying.  Under the partial-risk protection, EFSF would provide a
partial-protection certificate to a newly issued bond of a
member state, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
