Edison SpA (EDN)  shareholder negotiations
with  Electricite de France SA (EDF)  could be delayed to the end of the
year,  Les Echos  said today, citing Giuliano Zuccoli, president
of A2A, a municipal shareholder in Edison.  EDF earlier this month extended its agreement with Edisonâ€™s
Italian stakeholders through Nov. 30 to give it time to conclude
an agreement to take control of Edison, Les Echos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
