Societe Generale (GLE)  SA plans to sell
more than 600 million euros ($799 million) of property loans to
reduce risk, the Financial Times reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The bank expects bids, mainly from private equity buyers,
for a portfolio of loans made on stores and offices in France
and  Germany , the newspaper said. The French bank could take a
loss of up to 50 percent on the original value of the loans,
according to the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
