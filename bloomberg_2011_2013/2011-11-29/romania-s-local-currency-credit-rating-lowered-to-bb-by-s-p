Romania ’s local-currency sovereign
debt rating was cut one notch to BB+ at  Standard & Poor’s , which
revised its methodology to narrow gaps between local- and
foreign-currency grades.  Romania’s foreign-currency grade of BB+, the highest non-
investment grade, was affirmed, S&P said today in a statement.
The outlook is stable, indicating the company is more likely to
leave the ratings unchanged than to raise them or lower them.  The cut in the local-currency rating is due to the “high
euroization” of the Romanian economy which “limits monetary
flexibility,” S&P said. The ratings are supported by a
narrowing fiscal deficit and the economy’s rebalancing, it said.  “The stable outlook reflects our opinion that Romania’s
government will continue to consolidate its public finances
largely in line with the targets it has specified,” S&P said.  The leu strengthened 0.1 percent to 4.356 per euro as of
7:48 p.m. in Bucharest.  The cut in the local-currency rating narrows the gap
between the two assessments because “we believe governments are
likely to have fewer incentives to differentiate between their
local- and foreign-currency debt in the event of a debt
restructuring, given the increasing globalization of markets,”
S&P said.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Romania Baa3 while Fitch
has the country at BBB-, the lowest investment grades at both
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
