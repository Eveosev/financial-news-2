China’s fall in  house prices  is
unlikely to turn into a rout because real demand remains strong,
Yu Yongding, a former central bank adviser, wrote in an Project
Syndicate opinion piece.  Even a significant fall in  home prices  won’t seriously
damage Chinese banks, because there are no subprime mortgages in
China, and a reduced focus on real estate development would be
good for the nation’s economy, he wrote. A hard landing in China
in 2012 is “unlikely” he wrote.  “Although a significant decline in real-estate investment
will have a very serious negative impact on China’s growth --
which can and should be prevented -- as long as the fall is not
too drastic, it is a welcome development,” Yu wrote.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
