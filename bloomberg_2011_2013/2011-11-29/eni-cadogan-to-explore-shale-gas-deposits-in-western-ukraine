Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Cadogan Petroleum Plc (CAD) 
agreed to explore and extract shale gas in western Ukraine, the
state Geology and Resources Service said.  The companies plan to spend about $55 million exploring for
shale gas in the Lviv basin from 2012 through 2015, the Geology
and Resource Service said in a  statement  on its website late
yesterday.  Eni bought stakes in Cadoganâ€™s shale licenses in eastern
Ukraine earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
