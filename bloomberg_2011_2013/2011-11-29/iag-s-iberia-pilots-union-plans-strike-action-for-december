The pilots’ union of Spanish airline
Iberia aims to strike in December to protest the company’s
strategic plans including the creation of a lower-cost unit to
boost margins for Spanish and European flights.  Sepla, as the union is known, will meet with the rest of
the crew unions next week to set dates for the strike, according
to a Sepla spokeswoman, who declined to be identified citing
policy. The company’s plan to create the lower-cost unit Iberia
Express doesn’t respect the current collective bargaining
agreement, she said.  Iberia, working to pare expenses after merging with British
Airways to create  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA ,
said Oct. 6 it plans to transfer planes to Iberia Express in a
bid to boost margins on flights in Spain and  Europe .  Consuelo Arias, a spokeswoman for Iberia in  Madrid , said the
airline met with pilots’ unions yesterday and has yet to be
notified of any planned strike.  The Iberia Express unit will start flying next year with
four Airbus SAS A320 jets from Iberia. The fleet will be built
up to 13 narrow-body planes by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
