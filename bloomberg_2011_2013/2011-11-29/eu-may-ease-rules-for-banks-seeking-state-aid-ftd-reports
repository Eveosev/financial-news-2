The European Commission plans to
ease restructuring requirements for banks that seek state aid
because of losses stemming from the sovereign debt crisis, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  European banks could be eligible for less stringent rules
if they can prove that capital needs are a direct result of
European sovereign debt losses and don’t involve “excessive”
risk, the FTD reported, citing a draft plan to be introduced
this week by EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
