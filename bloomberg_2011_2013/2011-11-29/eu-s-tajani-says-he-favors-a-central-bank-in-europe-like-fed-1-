European Union Industry Commissioner
Antonio Tajani said he favors a central bank in  Europe  modeled
on the U.S. Federal Reserve.  “My personal position is in favor of a European bank
similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve,” Tajani, who is also vice
president of the commission, said in Madrid today. “If there is
a reform of the treaty, we need a strong bank for a strong
currency, and a strong European policy.”  The  European Central Bank  and  Germany  are resisting
pressure to step up bond purchases and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development yesterday added to calls
for the Frankfurt-based bank to step up its response to the
crisis. As contagion threatens to reach the euro region’s core,
Italian 10-year yields rose to 7.37 percent today, while
investors demanded 6.57 percent to lend to  Spain .  Tajani, who met with Spanish Prime Minister-elect Mariano
Rajoy in Madrid, said the leader who won a landslide on Nov. 20
is studying proposals for an overhaul of labor rules. Tajani
said he liked Rajoy’s plans for the job market and deficit cuts,
without giving more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
