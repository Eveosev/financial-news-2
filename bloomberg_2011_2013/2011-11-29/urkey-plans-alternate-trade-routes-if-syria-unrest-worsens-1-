Turkey  is planning to shift its
trade routes to the  Middle East  if the unrest in  Syria  worsens
and embargoes go into effect, Minister of Transportation,
Maritime Affairs and Communication Binali Yildirim said.  Land transportation will be conducted via Iraq by opening
new crossing points with Turkey’s southern neighbor, Yildirim
said today in televised comments from Ankara. Turkey and  Egypt 
had been in talks to establish a shipping line to carry vehicles
before the Syrian crisis and work is ongoing, he said.  The Arab League adopted measures against Syria including a
travel ban on senior officials, a freeze on assets and dealings
with the central bank, and an embargo on financial transactions
and trade with President Bashar al-Assad’s government. The
bloc’s Nov. 27 decision followed U.S. and European sanctions,
and Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  said his government
will back the league’s measures.  “Our principle is that the sanctions that are enacted
should never cause suffering to the Syrian people,” Yildirim
said today in a  statement  posted on the governing Justice and
Development Party’s website. “We are doing all our planning in
this framework. We never prefer to hurt the people over there
and the trade between the two countries.”  The roll-on, roll-off shipping line to carry cargo from
Turkey’s Mersin port on the Mediterranean to Alexandria in Egypt
will “never be an alternative” to Syrian transit routes,
Yildirim said, adding that companies are working on the project
backed by both states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
