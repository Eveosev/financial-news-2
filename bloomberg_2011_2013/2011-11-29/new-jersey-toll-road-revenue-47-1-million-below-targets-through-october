Four snowstorms and a hurricane kept
drivers off the  New Jersey  Turnpike and Garden State Parkway
this year and led the toll highways to report revenue through
October fell $47.1 million below forecasts.  The  New Jersey  Turnpike Authority collected $943 million in
revenue in the first 10 months of 2011, about 5 percent less
than its target of $990 million. The October snowstorm that
blanketed much of the U.S. Northeast cost $1 million in New
Jersey toll revenue. Unemployment and high gasoline prices also
deterred motorists, the authority said in a report today.  “The situation is not dire, we have enough money to meet
all of our obligations,’ said Transportation Commissioner James Simpson, chairman of the Turnpike Authority’s board, at a
meeting in Woodbridge. ‘‘If this carries itself out for the next
four or five years it gets to be a lot of money.”  The 148-mile (238-kilometer)  New Jersey Turnpike  and 173-
mile Garden State Parkway are the main north-south routes
through New Jersey, the most densely populated U.S. state. Tolls
are set to rise in January by 53 percent on the Turnpike and 50
percent on the Parkway, under a plan approved in 2008.  Traffic through October was down 1.3 percent from the same
period of 2010 on the Turnpike, while the Parkway had a 1.9
percent drop in toll transactions, the report said.  New Jersey’s average price for regular gasoline is $3.20 a
gallon, up from $2.87 a year ago,  according  to the American
Automobile Association’s Fuel Gauge Report.  The Turnpike Authority has been able to trim expenses as a
weak construction market pushes down  capital costs  and it
reduces staff by 140 positions through attrition by next year,
said Veronique Hakim, executive director of the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
