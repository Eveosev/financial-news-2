The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity shipping costs, rose for a second day, as miners hired
capesize vessels from  Australia  to haul ore to  China , advancing
voyage costs to the highest level in over a month.  The index gained 1 percent to 1,828 points, according to
the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based assessor of freight rates of
more than 50 international maritime routes.  Voyage costs to ship ore on a capesize vessel from
Australia to China rose by the most since Nov. 10, advancing 6.7
percent to $11.78 per metric ton, according to the exchange.
Thatâ€™s the highest since Oct. 26, data show. Average rents were
3.9 percent higher at $27,206 a day.  Australian mining companies booking vessels to export ore
to China helped capesize rates strengthen, First Securities AS,
an Oslo-based investment bank, said in an e-mailed report today.  Rents for the three smaller vessel types tracked by the
gauge declined across all routes, according to the exchange.  Average hire costs for a panamax bulk carrier, the largest
that can transit the Panama Canal, fell 1.1 percent to $13,979 a
day, the lowest since Oct. 3, data show. Rents declined 17
percent since Oct. 17.  Supramax vessels that haul minerals and grains fell for a
fifth day, declining 0.9 percent to $14,284, the lowest in two
weeks. Handysize ships, the smallest, dipped below $9,000 a day
for the first time since April 2009. Average rents were 0.7
percent lower $8,962 a day, exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
