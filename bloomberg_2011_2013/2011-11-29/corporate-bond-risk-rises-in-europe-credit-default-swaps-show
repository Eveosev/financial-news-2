The cost of insuring sovereign bonds
fell, reversing an earlier advance, as European finance
ministers prepared to discuss efforts to tame the region’s debt
crisis.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 10 basis points to 365
at 5 p.m. in London, after rising near to the all-time high
closing price of 385 Nov. 25. An increase signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality ; a decline, the opposite.  Swaps on  Belgium  declined nine basis points to 369,  France 
fell 13 to 224 and  Germany  was three lower at 108, while Italy
declined five to 530 and  Spain  was down 14 at 452, CMA prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the subordinated debt of 25 banks and insurers was unchanged
at 575 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The gauge
had soared as much as 43 basis points to a record 618 after
Moody’s Investors Service said it may lower ratings to reflect
the potential withdrawal of government support.  Markit Group Ltd.’s index tracking swaps linked to senior
financial bonds fell two basis points to 331 after jumping as
much as 21 basis points.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell nine basis
points to 791.5, JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Europe
Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings declined
3.5 basis points to 195.75.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
