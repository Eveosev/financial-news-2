Vattenfall AB  said it will cooperate
with Hamburg on power distribution and district heating by
selling part of the utility’s grids to the northern German city
for 463.1 million euros ($618 million).  Hamburg plans to acquire 25.1 percent of the company’s
district heating and power grids in the city, which together are
valued at about 1.9 billion euros, Stockholm-based Vattenfall
said today in a statement.  The cooperation involves developing an energy concept for
Hamburg with efficient power plants,  energy storage  for surplus
wind power, electric mobility and smart grids, the utility said.
Total investments will amount to about 1.5 billion euros over
the next five years, Vattenfall said.  Tuomo Hatakka, head of Vattenfall’s German business, said
the deal meant a “positive contribution to the further
development of the German  energy industry  at a time of radical
policy change.”  The transaction is subject to approval by the Hamburg
parliament, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
