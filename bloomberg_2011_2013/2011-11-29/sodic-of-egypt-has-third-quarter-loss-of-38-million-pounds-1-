Six of October Development &
Investment Co. (OCDI) , an Egyptian luxury real-estate developer, said
it had a third-quarter net loss of 38 million Egyptian pounds
($6.33 million) due to an impairment on the golf course at its
Allegria residential project.  The company, which made the announcement in an e-mailed
statement, didnâ€™t give a comparative figure from a year earlier.
It had a net income of 56.8 million pounds in the third quarter
of 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  Six of October, also known as Sodic, had cancellations
valued at 290.3 million in the third quarter and net sales of
14.7 million pounds, it said. The company delivered 85 units
valued at 210 million pounds in the third quarter and is
lowering its delivery estimate to 250 units for 2011, it said.  Shares of Sodic rose 6.9 percent, the biggest increase
since July 13, to 11.65 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo,
valuing the company at 1.06 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
