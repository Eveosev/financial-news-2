Renewable Energy Corp. (REC) , a Norwegian
maker of solar components, will start shutting manufacturing
capacity because of slumping demand. The shares fell.  “The debt crisis in  Europe  and the turmoil in the  capital
markets  continue to have severe negative impact on demand in the
solar market,” the company said today in a statement, adding
that lower prices and reduced output would affect fourth-quarter
results.  Market prices for modules, wafers and polysilicon have
dropped about 10 percent, 30 percent and 35 percent respectively
since Oct. 1, REC said. Inventories are increasing for all its
products and unless solar demand improves, REC will make further
adjustments to production levels.  REC dropped as much as 10 percent to 3.60 kroner in Oslo
and traded at 3.61 at 9:51 a.m. local time.  The company said it will reduce output of multi-crystalline
wafers at its Heroeya plant in  Norway  starting on Dec. 1. REC
plans to temporary halt 60 percent of capacity through the first
quarter of next year, affecting about 200 employees.  “In this very challenging market environment the solar
industry is set for a phase of shake-out and consolidation over
the next 1-2 years,” Chief Executive Officer Ole Enger said.
“REC needs to adapt production to the prevailing market
conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
