The forint weakened after the
central bank raised the benchmark interest rate to the European
Union’s highest and said it may tighten further as a credit
rating downgrade to junk level hit Hungarian assets.  Hungary’s currency weakened 0.3 percent to 309.5 per euro
by 3:54 p.m. in Budapest, extending its decline in the second
half of 2011 to 14 percent, the worst performance worldwide.
Hungary’s benchmark 5-year bonds weakened, lifting the yield
seven basis points to 9.38 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank increased the two-week deposit rate
to 6.5 percent from 6 percent today. The forint dropped to its
weakest ever against the euro this month and government bond
yields soared over 9 percent for the first time in two years as
the country on Nov. 24 lost its investment grade at Moody’s
Investors Service after 15 years.  “If this afternoon’s 50 basis point hike in Hungarian
 interest rates  was intended to shore up the forint, the move has
flopped,”  Neil Shearing , London-based chief emerging markets
economist at  Capital Economics , wrote in a research report.  Fourteen of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey expected
policy makers to raise the rate to 6.5 percent, with five
predicting an increase to 6.25 percent, one to 7 percent and
five forecasting unchanged rates.  “Fifty basis points was probably seen as something of a
compromise in terms of taking more aggressive action in defense
of the forint,” Timothy Ash, a London-based economist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc, wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
