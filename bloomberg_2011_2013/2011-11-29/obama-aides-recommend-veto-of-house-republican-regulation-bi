President  Barack Obama  should veto
Republican-backed legislation that would require federal
agencies to take additional steps before issuing regulations,
the White House Office of Management and Budget said.  The measure being considered by the House would impose
“unprecedented procedural requirements” and invite “frivolous
litigation,” the budget office said today in a statement.
Senior advisers would recommend Obama veto the bill if it also
passes the Democrat-controlled Senate, according to the
statement.  The legislation, introduced by Representative  Lamar Smith ,
a Texas Republican, would require agencies to conduct cost-
benefit analyses on alternatives for proposed major rules, and
expands the scope of judicial review of rulemaking, according to
a summary on the  Library of Congress  website.  Republicans have said regulations proposed by the Obama
administration, including restrictions on pollution, will cost
jobs. The administration said it is committed to issuing rules
that are “smart and effective.”  The bill is H.R. 3010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
