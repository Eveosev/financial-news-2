The ruble advanced against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket for a third day as oil,
 Russia ’s chief export earner, rose in  New York .  The Russian currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 36.0029
against the basket at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow after climbing
0.1 percent yesterday. The ruble rose 0.3 percent to 41.7625 per
euro and was little changed at 31.2905 per dollar.  Crude futures jumped 1.4 percent to $99.61 a barrel in New
York after demand for Italy’s debt increased in a government
auction, a signal pressure on the country from  Europe ’s debt
crisis may be easing. The European Union is Russia’s largest
trading partner.  Russian companies are due to pay as much as 157 billion
rubles ($5 billion) in taxes this week, according to  Alfa Bank 
estimates in an e-mailed note Nov. 16. Exporters convert revenue
in other currencies into rubles to pay the government, boosting
the Russian currency.  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing it at 31.7385 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 31.8525 per dollar
yesterday. Russia’s dollar Eurobonds due 2020 fell, pushing the
yield up two basis points to 4.683 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
