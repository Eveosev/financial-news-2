Tanzania,  Africa ’s fourth-largest
tea producer, may boost output of the crop 9.4 percent in the
current season because of increased rainfall, the Tea Board of
Tanzania said.  Output in the 12 months through June may climb to 35,000
metric tons from 32,000 tons a year earlier, Director-General
Mathias Assenga said in a phone interview today from  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital.  “There are some good rains and we hope the crop will
recover from last season’s drought,” he said. Production last
season fell short of an initial target of 35,000 tons because of
a lack of rains, Assenga said.  Tanzania’s tea output ranks behind  Kenya , Malawi and Uganda
on the continent, according to the  United Nations ’ Food and
Agricultural Organization. Four-fifths of the leaves are sold to
buyers from the U.K., Germany, India and the United Arab
Emirates. About half of Tanzania’s tea exports are channeled
through the world’s biggest tea auction in the port city of
Mombasa in neighboring Kenya.  Agriculture generates more than 40 percent of Tanzania’s
gross domestic product, according to the CIA World Factbook. The
tea board is trying to encourage farmers to introduce the crop
to areas bordering Kenya and to use more fertilizers to boost
output, according to the board. Kenya is the world’s largest
exporter of black tea.  This season’s forecast is 3 percent lower than a March 11
estimate of 36,000 tons because of crop damage caused by adverse
weather, Assenga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
