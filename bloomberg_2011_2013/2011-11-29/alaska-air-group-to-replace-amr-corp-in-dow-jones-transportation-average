Alaska Air Group Inc. was picked to
replace  AMR Corp. (AMR)  in the Dow Jones Transportation Average after
the parent of American Airlines filed for bankruptcy.  AMR was part of the 117-year-old measure since 1982,
according to a statement from Dow Jones Indexes. The 20-stock
gauge is used by some traders and investors as a proxy for the
 U.S. economy . The changes will take effect before the open of
trading on Dec. 2.  Alaska has reported  10 straight quarters (ALK)  of net income, and
earnings doubled last year. Profit will increase 21 percent in
2011, according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Shares of the Seattle-based company have gained 15
percent this year, compared with a 7.6 percent drop in the  Dow
Jones Transportation Average. (TRAN)   AMR sank 84 percent today and has lost 97 percent this
year. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company posted losses in 14
out of the past 16 quarters. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
after failing to secure cost-cutting labor agreements and
sitting out a round of mergers that dropped it from the worldâ€™s
largest airline to No. 3 in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
