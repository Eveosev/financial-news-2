The European and Chinese patent
agencies signed an accord that will speed up translations of
patents in both languages in a bid to improve access to the
offices’ information for researchers, scientists and inventors.  The  European Patent Office  and the State Intellectual
Property Office of the People’s Republic of  China  agreed to
cooperate to give access to a free Chinese-English translation
service through the Internet by next year, according to a joint
e-mailed statement today.  “The agreement breaks new ground in the relationship
between both regions in that it will bring the wealth of
technology contained in patents to the fingertips of innovators
on both sides, removing language as a delimiting factor,” said
Benoit Battistelli, president of the Munich, Germany-based EPO.  With a growing technology market around the world, the
number of patent applications filed globally is growing annually
and reached about 1.8 million in 2010, according to the  World
Intellectual Property Organization . Many of these applications
originate from China and  Europe , or take effect in these
regions, the EPO said.  The  EPO  isn’t part of the European Union and has 38 member
countries. The EPO offers the closest thing currently available
to an EU-wide patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
