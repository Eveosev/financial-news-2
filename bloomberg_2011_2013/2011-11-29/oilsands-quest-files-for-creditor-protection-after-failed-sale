Oilsands Quest Inc. (BQI)  filed for
protection from creditors under Canadian law after an
unidentified buyer backed out of an agreement to acquire some of
its assets.  The court granted protection under Canada’s Companies’
Creditors Arrangement Act until Dec. 21 to allow the company to
reorganize its financial affairs while continuing operations,
Calgary-based Oilsands Quest said in a statement today.  The company said in July that it wouldn’t be able to
continue operating beyond January if it failed to find a
financial partner to develop a $1 billion oil-sands project in
Canada. The unnamed partner that had agreed to buy the company’s
Wallace Creek assets backed out of the deal yesterday, Oilsands
Quest said today.  Oilsands Quest’s properties in western  Canada  may produce
100,000 barrels of bitumen a day, the company said July 6. The
company had hired TD Securities Inc. to help find a partner to
fund the projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
