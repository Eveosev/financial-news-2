Rockets fired from southern Lebanon
struck northern  Israel  overnight, the first such incident since
October 2009, the Israeli army said.  The Sheikh Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a group linked to al-
Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the rocket fire, Lebanon’s
Daily Star  reported .  Israeli forces returned fire at the location where the
rockets were launched, the army said in an e-mailed statement.
No casualties were reported on either side, the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, or Unifil, said on its  website .  The Israeli military said it “regards the incident as
severe and holds the Lebanese government and army responsible
for preventing rocket fire from its territory.”  The rocket firing “does not serve the interest of
solidarity with the Palestinian people” and is a violation of
Lebanese laws and international obligations, Lebanese President
Michel Suleiman said today, according to the  Daily Star .  Unifil called on Israel and Lebanon “to act with
restraint” and said it was increasing its patrols in south
Lebanon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
