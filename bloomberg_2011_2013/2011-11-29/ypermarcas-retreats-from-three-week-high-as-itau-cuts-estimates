Hypermarcas SA , the maker of more
than 190 consumer products, fell the most in three weeks as
Banco Itau BBA cut its estimates for the company’s sales and
profits in 2011 and 2012.  Hypermarcas declined 6.7 percent to 7.95 reais at the close
of trading in  Sao Paulo , the steepest drop since Nov. 7. It was
the second-worst performer on the  MSCI Brazil/Consumer Staples
Index , which was little changed.  Itau cut its 2012 sales forecast for Hypermarcas to 3.81
billion reais ($2.07 billion), 16 percent below its previous
estimate. The company will post a net loss of 5 million reais in
2011, according to Itau, compared with a previous forecast for
net profit of 432 million reais.  “By any measure, 2011 was a lost year for Hypermarcas, due
to a combination of poor execution, terrible visibility and
strong competition in a slowing market,” Itau analysts Juliana Rozenbaum and Francine Martins wrote in a note to clients.
“There is still negative momentum on Hypermarcas based on the
expectations of weak 2011 fourth-quarter results.”  Sao Paulo-based Hypermarcas, which makes  consumer goods 
from diapers to deodorants, reported a third-quarter net loss of
190.5 million reais, compared with a net income of 78 million
reais a year earlier, according to a Nov. 7 statement.  Earlier this year, Hypermarcas reduced discounts and the
time clients including wholesalers and distributors have to pay
for the company’s products, which prompted clients to carry
smaller inventories of Hypermarcas’s products, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. analyst Isabela Bacchi said in a note to clients Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
