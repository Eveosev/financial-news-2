Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a fifth
day, reaching a record low against the dollar, as importers
bought dollars to bring in goods for sale at Christmas.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.6515 per dollar as of 11:46 a.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level would be the lowest since May 31 1994, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data.  “Demand for dollars is outstripping supply,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit of Barclays Plc,
said in a telephone interview today. “I expect the pressure to
continue for some time as we draw closer to the year-end
festivities.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
