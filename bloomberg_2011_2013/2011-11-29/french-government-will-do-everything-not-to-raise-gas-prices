French Budget Minister Valerie
Pecresse said the government “will do everything” so as not to
raise natural gas prices for households this winter.  “The priority of the government is to protect purchasing
power of consumers,” Pecresse said in parliament today. “We
want to review the formula to calculate” the rates.  She was speaking following a ruling by the country’s
highest court that the government must lift a cap on prices
charged by  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA to households.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
