Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD) , which gets its
revenue from mining royalties, may sign more deals with
companies seeking financing for project development as costs
increase.  “This is a very good environment for us,” Chief Executive
Officer Tony Jensen said in an interview today in Toronto. “It
is a deal-rich and opportunity-rich environment,” he said.  Mining project costs have increased in the past five years,
Jensen said. Companies are more likely to consider multiple
sources of finance, including royalties, to fund mine
development, he said. Volatility and weakness in equity markets
may make royalty financings more attractive than share offerings,
he said.  Royal Gold, which is based in Denver, wants an “absolute
minumum” of 70 percent of revenue from precious metals
royalties, Jensen said. The outlook for gold is “very
favorable”, he said, without providing a price forecast.  Gold, which has risen for 10 consecutive years, reached a
record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6 in  New York . The metal has
gained 21 percent this year, as investors seek a haven amid
 Europe ’s debt crisis and plunging equity markets.  Royal Gold owns royalties on assets owned by companies
including  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , Teck Resources Ltd. and Goldcorp
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
