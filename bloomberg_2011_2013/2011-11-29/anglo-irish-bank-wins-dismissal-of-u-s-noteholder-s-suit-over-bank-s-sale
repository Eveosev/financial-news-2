Anglo Irish Bank Corp. , the bank
nationalized by the Irish government in 2009, won dismissal of a
noteholder lawsuit that sought to block the sale of its U.S.
loan portfolio.  U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in  Manhattan  said in
an order yesterday that the claims were prohibited by the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  “Defendant is a ‘foreign state’ within the meaning of
the” Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Gardephe said.
“Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Ireland has waived
sovereign immunity for purposes of this action or that any
exception to sovereign immunity is applicable.”  Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued  Anglo
Irish Bank  in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree sought an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations.  Paul Smith, a lawyer for  Fir Tree , didn’t immediately
return a call to his office seeking comment on the ruling after
regular business hours yesterday.  The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
