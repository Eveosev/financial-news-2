Queensland,  Australia ’s biggest
state borrower, completed more than half of its 2011-2012
financing program before Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
escalated, Treasurer Andrew Fraser said.  Funding arm Queensland Treasury Corp.  estimated  in July it
needs to raise A$22 billion ($22 billion) in the 12 months to
June 30, 2012. Victoria, with the third-biggest pile of debt
outstanding among Australian states, has completed 66 percent of
its requirement and won’t need to access markets till March or
later, the agency said. The extra yield investors demand to hold
notes issued by regional authorities over federal debt widened
to the most in 2 1/2 years this month, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data show.  “The uncertainty in  Europe  means it’s a challenging time
for markets everywhere,” Fraser said yesterday in an e-mailed
response to questions. “QTC completed over half of its 2011-12
borrowing program before the overseas sovereign debt concerns
began to dominate  market sentiment .”  The extra yield Queensland’s 6.25 percent note maturing in
February 2020 offers over 10-year Australian  government bonds 
widened to 121.5 basis points on Nov. 24, the most since it was
issued in February 2010, and was at 114 today. The state has
A$72.6 billion in outstanding debt, Bloomberg data show.  The spread for Victoria’s 6 percent securities due June
2020 reached 83.6 basis points on Nov. 24, the most since
December 2009, and was at 75 basis points today.  European Crisis  The additional yield investors demand to hold debt issued
by Australia’s six states and two territories instead of
sovereign securities increased to 99 basis points on Nov. 24,
the most since March 2009, from 63 at the end of last month. The
spread was at 96 on Nov. 29, Merrill Lynch indexes show.  “We really don’t need to come back to market until about
March and we can probably avoid coming back even then if spreads
are still abnormally wide, given that we have an amount of
liquid assets in the portfolio,” Bill Whitford, managing
director of Treasury Corp. of Victoria in  Melbourne , said in an
interview today.  As of Nov. 25, Victoria has raised A$4.3 billion of the
approximately A$6.6 billion it requires, he said. The state has
A$27.1 billion in debt outstanding, Bloomberg data show.  Investors have shunned all but the safest government bonds
amid concern Europe’s debt woes are threatening the region’s
largest economies including  France  and  Italy .  European Bonds  Italy was forced yesterday to pay above the 7 percent
threshold that prompted  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland to seek
bailouts when it sold 7.5 billion euros ($10 billion) in bonds,
short of the maximum target for the auction.  Standard & Poor’s 
may give France a “negative outlook,” La Tribune reported,
citing “several sources.”  Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan in March 2009 offered to
guarantee state bonds to help regional governments raise funds
after a similar cover for securities issued by banks amid the
global credit crisis drove up borrowing costs for regional
authorities.  Victoria didn’t use the guarantee in 2009 and wouldn’t need
to use one now, Whitford said.  “The guarantee was implemented in 2009 after, and as a
consequence of, the federal government’s guarantee of the
wholesale funding of Australian banks,” Queensland Treasurer
Fraser said. “These are not circumstances that pertain to
current market volatility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
