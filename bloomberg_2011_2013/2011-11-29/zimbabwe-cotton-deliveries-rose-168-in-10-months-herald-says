Zimbabwe’s cotton farmers delivered
249.9 million kilograms (551 million pounds) of cotton to
merchants by Oct. 31, 168 percent more than at the same time
last year, the state-controlled  Herald  said on its website,
citing  Aico Africa Ltd. (AICO)  Managing Director David Machingaidze.  Cotton production in the southern African country may rise
further in the 2011-2012 farming season because Aico has
contracted 156,673 farmers to grow the crop, 30 percent more
than the previous season, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website. Farmers growing cotton for Aico will plant about
250,000 hectares (618,000 acres) of the crop, it said.  Aico is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton merchant and
ginner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
