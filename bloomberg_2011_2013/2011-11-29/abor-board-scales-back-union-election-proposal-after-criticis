The  National Labor Relations Board 
proposed scaling back its plans for speedier union elections
after business groups said the plan would hurt employers.  NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce, a Democrat, today
proposed that the board, which runs union elections and resolves
disputes between labor and management, act tomorrow on a portion
of the proposal made in June.  Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had
said the June NLRB proposal for faster elections would give
employers less time to make their case with workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
