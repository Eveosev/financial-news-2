MiaSole Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, today hired John Carrington as chief executive officer to replace Joseph Laia.  Carrington, who left  First Solar (FSLR)  Inc. more than two years
ago, said he plans to focus on increasing panel efficiency to 15
percent next year. MiaSole, based in  Santa Clara ,  California ,
currently sells panels that convert about 13 percent of sunlight
into electricity.  “I see a very credible road map to 15 percent and I think
we can get there in 2012,” Carrington said today in an
interview. “That’s more important than scaling up capacity at
this point.”  Carrington was executive vice president of global marketing
and business development at Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar,
the world’s largest thin-film company.  Thin-film solar panels are made with a highly automated
process that consumes about half as much energy as the more
common silicon panels made mostly in  Asia ,  according  to the U.S.
Energy Department. MiaSole coats stainless steel cells with a
layer of copper-indium-gallium-selenide, or CIGS, that’s
sandwiched between sheets of glass.  Thin-film panels tend to be less efficient than panels made
with polysilicon. The technology makes up about 15 percent of
the global market for solar power, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  Laia, who was hired as MiaSole’s CEO in 2007, will step
down, the company said without giving a reason for the change.
