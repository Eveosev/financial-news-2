Bahrain’s Interior Ministry plans to
announce measures to improve police skills following an
investigation that found that “excessive force” was used
against protesters in February and March.  Interior Minister Lieutenant-General Sheikh Rashid bin
Abdullah Al Khalifa said a team has been established to study
the commission’s report and implement its recommendations,
state-run Bahrain News Agency reported late yesterday.  The ministry is in the final stages of signing contracts
with a number of U.S. and U.K. experts to improve police
performance, BNA said.  The ministry is also seeking cooperation with international
human rights organizations “to benefit from their expertise in
developing police work in terms of arrest and detention
procedures, dealing with protesters and ensuring accountability
according to human rights principles,” BNA quoted the minister
as saying.  The  Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry  was set up by
the kingdom’s  Sunni Muslim  king, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to
look into allegations of human-rights abuses after his
government ended protests by mostly Shiite demonstrators. At
least 35 people were killed in the crackdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
