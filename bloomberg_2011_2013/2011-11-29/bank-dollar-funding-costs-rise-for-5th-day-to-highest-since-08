The cost for European banks to fund
in dollars rose to the highest levels in three years, according
to money-market indicators.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 158 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:31 a.m. in  London ,
from minus 149 yesterday. The measure is the most expensive on a
closing basis since October 2008.  The one-year basis swap was 106 basis points under Euribor,
from minus 104 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 93 basis
points, compared with 94 basis points yesterday. The difference
was 98 basis points on Nov. 3, the widest since March 2009.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 281 billion euros ($375 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 256 billion euros on Nov.
25. That compares with a year-to-date average of 79 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
