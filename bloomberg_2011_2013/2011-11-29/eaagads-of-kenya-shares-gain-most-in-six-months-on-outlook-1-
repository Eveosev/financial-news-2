Eaagads Ltd. (EGDL) , a Kenyan coffee
producer, jumped the most in more than six months after it said
earnings are expected to improve in the second half.  Shares in the Ruiru, Kenya-based company climbed 5 percent
to 37 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi.
That’s the biggest gain since May 9, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Eaagads announced earlier today that net income fell 26
percent to 26.3 million shillings ($294,447) in the six months
through September even as sales grew 5.9 percent to 68.4 million
shillings. The company didn’t repeat a revaluation of its
biological assets that resulted in a gain of 47.3 million
shillings a year earlier because of the shilling’s volatility on
domestic foreign-exchange markets this year.  “There is an outright biological gain that has not been
booked,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-
based investment company Rich Management, said in a phone
interview. “The reaction in the share price is confirmation that
investors have mentally calculated that the biological gain is
worth about 6 shillings to 7 shillings a share.”  Eaagads expects the  exchange rate  to stabilize and the
company to post “better results” in the second half of the
fiscal year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
