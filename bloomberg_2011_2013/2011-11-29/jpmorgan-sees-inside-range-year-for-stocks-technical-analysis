The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  will
probably be stuck in a 250-point range next year as Europe’s
debt crisis offsets optimism about U.S. earnings, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities will most likely
fluctuate between 1,100 and 1,350, forming an “inside-range
year” by staying roughly within the band seen this year, said
Michael Krauss, JPMorgan’s New York-based head of technical
research. He sees a 12 percent chance of an economic recession
that would push the S&P 500 as low as 800. The odds of the index
rising to 1,500 because of progress on the crisis or stimulus
from central banks are 8 percent, Krauss said.  “The markets now are like ships caught in the
treacherously stormy seas of headline risk,” Krauss wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. “It will be difficult for equities
to sustain back above the 1,300-1,350 trendlines, as long as the
European sovereign debt crisis and recession lurks in the
background. Similarly, it will be tough to move below strong
1,075-1,100 clustered support, as long as the U.S. avoids an
economic recession, earnings stay elevated, and investors remain
defensively positioned.”  The measure surged 2.9 percent to 1,192.55 yesterday,
ending a seven-day losing streak, after Thanksgiving retail
sales climbed to a record and speculation grew that European
leaders will intensify efforts to end the debt crisis.  Asset Purchases  Federal Reserve asset purchases meant to boost the economy
and better-than-expected earnings helped drive the  S&P 500  to a
34-month high of 1,363.61 at the end of April. The index sank to
1,099.23 last month as the European debt crisis, which began
more than two years ago in  Greece , spread to Italy and  Spain .  Krauss said in December that the index would likely peak at
about 1,350 in the middle of 2011 before dropping to 1,100. He
boosted his year-end projection to more than 1,400 in April,
then scrapped that target three months later.  The market’s trend and momentum now suggest higher odds of
more losses, Krauss said. The S&P 500 remains below its 200-day
average and that level has been falling since Aug. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index’s monthly stochastic and Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence line charts, which track the market’s
momentum, continue to show a sell signal that began in July.
Such signals tend to last seven to nine months, suggesting the
market may be under pressure during the first four months of
next year, Krauss said.  The index reached an intraday peak of 1,370.58 on May 2,
surging 106 percent from a 12-year low of 666.79 on March 6,
2009. It has since fallen 13 percent.  “Absent a resolution to the European debt crisis, and a
market-friendly outcome to the November 2012 presidential
election, we believe it will be extremely difficult to exceed
this May’s 1,371 S&P 500 peak during 2012,” he wrote. “If our
favored 1,100-1,350 range proves incorrect, it is technically
more likely that the downside support breaks, rather than the
upside barrier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
