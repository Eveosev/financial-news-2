Russia’s  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel  rose to the highest in more than a week after agreeing to
buy Adelaide, Australia-based  Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS) , an
acquisition analysts say will secure the steelmaker an exclusive
iron-ore supply.  Shares in MMK, as the company controlled by billionaire
Victor Rashnikov is known, climbed 1.9 percent to 13.48 rubles
on the Micex index in Moscow, the highest closing price since
Nov. 17.  MMK agreed to buy Flinders for about A$554 million ($555
million), according to a Nov. 25 statement released by
Regulatory News Service. The acquisition will give MMK ownership
of an iron ore deposit in  Western Australia ’s Pilbara region
with 917.3 million metric tons of ore, the filing said. The deal
still needs to be approved by 75 percent of Flinders’
shareholders in March and by Australian regulators, the company
said in a separate statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on
Nov. 25.  “The market is starting to realize the benefit of future
entry into Flinders Mines,” Oleg Petropavlovskiy, a metals and
mining analyst at Moscow’s Broker Credit Service, said by phone
today. “This will make Magnitogorsk one of the leaders by
profit in steel manufacturing not only in  Russia  but in the
world.”  MMK’s profitability has suffered because of a lack of
access to raw materials and the Flinders deal will give the
company entry to their own iron-ore deposit, Petropavlovskiy
said. Currently, MMK produces 30 percent of its own ore, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
