Gasoline in the Midwest strengthened
after supplies of the fuel increased on the Magellan Midstream
Partners LP pipeline system as blending components for winter
fuel raise inventories.  “The addition of butane does extend gasoline supplies,”
Bruce Heine, a Magellan spokesman, said in an e-mail. The
Magellan pipeline carries oil products from the  Gulf Coast  to
the region.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Midwest , or Group 3, weakened 1.75 cents to a discount of 6.75
cents versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4:32 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel
for prompt delivery rose 0.35 cent to $2.4716 a gallon.  Winter-grade gasoline has more butane and is less-expensive
to produce than summer grades.  The same fuel in  Chicago  widened 1 cent versus futures to a
discount of 9 cents a gallon.  Regular gasoline in  New York Harbor  gained 0.12 cent to a
premium of 3.5 cent versus futures.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed its discount to
futures by 0.3 cent to 5.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
