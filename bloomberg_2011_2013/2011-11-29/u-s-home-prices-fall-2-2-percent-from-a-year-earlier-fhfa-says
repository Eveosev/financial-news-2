U.S.  home prices  dropped 2.2 percent
in the 12 months through September as the housing market
struggled to emerge from a five-year bust, according to the
Federal Housing Finance Agency.  The slump was led by a 5.7 percent decrease in the region
that includes  California , the agency said today in a report from
 Washington . The second-largest decline was 4.9 percent in the
area that includes Nevada.  Falling home prices are sapping  confidence  in real estate
and causing potential homebuyers to put off purchases. The share
of people in October who said they plan to buy a home in the
next six months tumbled to 3.9 percent from 4.7 percent in
September, the lowest reading in almost a year, according to a
survey by the Conference Board in  New York .  Prices  in September rose 0.9 percent from the previous
month, according to the FHFA. That was better than economistsâ€™
forecast for a decrease of 0.1 percent, the average of 14
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  A separate report today showed that home prices in 20 U.S.
cities dropped 3.6 percent in September from a year earlier. The
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  was expected to fall 3 percent, according
to the median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
