Nordea Bank AB Chief Analyst Anders
Svendsen comments on the Hungarian central bank’s decision today
to raise the benchmark  interest rate  to 6.5 percent from 6
percent.  He made the comments in a research report.  “More hikes could be on the way unless the situation
improves.  ‘‘The central bank is not yet in panic mode, which means
that sustained forint weakness may lead to additional measured
rate hikes, not big time emergency rate hikes. The central bank
is buying time waiting for the IMF deal or improved risk
sentiment.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
