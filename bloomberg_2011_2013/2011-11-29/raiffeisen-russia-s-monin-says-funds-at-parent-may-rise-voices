Sergey Monin, chief executive of
Moscow-based ZAO Raiffeisenbank, comments on his bank providing
liquidity to its parent,  Austria ’s Raiffeisen AG, and government
plans to allow foreigners to trade Russian state bonds.  He spoke today in an interview at a Russian banking
conference in  London .  On Raiffeisen’s Russian unit’s lending to its parent:  “Our deposits with the parent company have increased. But
that’s pure liquidity management where we chose between the
ruble interest rate and deposits on the local market and the
 interest rates  implied by swap operations. It is more profitable
to place free liquidity through FX swaps and then deposit it to
the parent bank.  “It will increase in case the ruble appreciates further. In
this case the share of foreign currency deposits will grow.”  He said he’s unaware of any reprimand by  Russia ’s central
bank in reaction to these transactions.  On Russia opening its OFZ government  bond market  to foreigners:  “There is no major participation of foreign investors in
the bond market in general. The share of foreign investors is
minor. The opening of the OFZ market -- I don’t really see it
will significantly increase foreign investor demand. When the
ruble becomes a serious foreign-exchange investment, the OFZ may
become an instrument that foreign investors will use.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
