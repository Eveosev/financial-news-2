A management consultant on trial for
insider trading made about 500,000 pounds ($780,000) betting on
tips from a hedge-fund employee about companies including Julius
Baer Group Ltd. and  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , prosecutors said.  Rupinder Sidhu, who faces 23 counts of insider trading,
used Hotmail accounts and MSN Messenger to covertly communicate
with Anjam Ahmad, a trader at AKO Capital LLP, Michael Brompton,
a prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told a jury
in  London .  Ahmad told Sidhu, a childhood friend, when AKO was about to
buy or sell a stock so he could benefit from the effect on its
share price, Brompton said. This was “carried out on an
increasingly large scale and for increasingly large profits”
between June and August in 2009.  The 40-year-old, who also faces one count of  money
laundering , pleaded not guilty in April. The trial is expected
to last for three weeks.  Sidhu is accused of using spread-betting sites to speculate
on stocks including Julius Baer, Swatch, Reed Elsevier Plc and
Michael Page International Plc, making sums ranging from 1,600
pounds to 137,000 pounds, Brompton said  It is a “classic example of  insider trading ,” Brompton
told jurors this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
