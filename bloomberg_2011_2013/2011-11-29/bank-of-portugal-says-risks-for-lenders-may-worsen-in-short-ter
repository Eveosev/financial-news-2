The Bank of  Portugal  said risks for
Portuguese lenders may continue to increase in the short term as
economic conditions deteriorate.  “The worsening of the economic and financial conditions
was reflected in a deterioration of profitability in the
Portuguese banking system, as well as a greater materialization
of credit risk and market risk,” the Bank of Portugal said in a
report on financial stability.  “In the short term, this tendency of worsening of risks
should persist,” the report said. “However, in the framework
of the financial assistance program there are various
instruments that allow for the lessening of the impact of these
shocks on the Portuguese financial system, namely in terms of
possible additional capital needs.”  Portugal’s 78 billion-euro bailout plan earmarks as much as
12 billion euros to recapitalize banks if needed.  Under the program’s terms, Portuguese banks must have a
core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of
at least 9 percent by the end of this year. The ratio must stay
at 9 percent by the end of June after the value of government
bond holdings are written down to market prices, and must rise
to 10 percent by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
