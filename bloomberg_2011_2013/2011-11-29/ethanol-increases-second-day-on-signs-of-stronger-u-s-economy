Ethanol futures increased a second
day in  Chicago  after separate reports showed signs of a stronger
 U.S. economy  that could stoke fuel demand.  Futures advanced consecutive sessions for the first time
since Nov. 16 after the Conference Board’s index rose to 56 in
November, the biggest monthly gain since April 2003 and after
Johnson Redbook Research said U.S. sales at stores open at least
a year climbed 5.4 percent last week from a year earlier.  “Everything was higher,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “The front-month stuff is still kind of tight. It was
up, but not as much as everything else.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 0.7 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.485 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The futures have climbed 4.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slumped 7.5
cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.775 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive sank 6 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.925, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel decreased 4
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.95.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.58 to $99.79 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Nov. 16. Prices are up 9.2 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery gained 2.1 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.5391 a gallon on the exchange. The
January contract advanced 2.21 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.5398.  To contact the reporter on this story:
