HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to hire a
senior official from the U.K.’s  Financial Services Authority  who
worked on banking stress tests as head of capital management,
according to two people familiar with the situation.  Alan Cathcart is scheduled to start work at the lender at
the beginning of next year, said one of the people, who declined
to be identified because the appointment isn’t public.  The European Banking Authority will release as soon as next
week updated stress-test recommendations for banks to raise
additional capital in the wake of the euro-area debt crisis.
U.K. banks probably won’t have to raise more capital,  Andrew Bailey , head of banking supervision at the FSA said Nov. 24.  Cathcart, is at least the eighth senior official to leave
the regulator since the government said in 2010 it would abolish
the agency.  The FSA has restructured into two divisions to prepare for
a government-mandated handover of lender supervision to the  Bank
of England . The supervisor has split internally into a
prudential regulatory authority and a consumer protection
agency.  Spokesmen for the FSA and HSBC in  London  declined to
immediately comment. Cathcart didn’t immediately return a
voicemail at his office at the FSA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
