The cost to protect debt issued by
U.S. banks from Bank of America Corp. to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. jumped after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered their long-term
credit ratings as it revised criteria for the banking industry.  Credit-default swaps on Bank of America, which were little
changed before the announcement, increased 16.9 basis points to
478.8 and those on its Merrill Lynch & Co. unit climbed 24.1 to
524.9 as of 4:46 p.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA. Contracts on Goldman Sachs increased 8 to 403.6.  S&P lowered its ratings on the banks to A- from A as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis deepens, in a move that may be
costly for the banks. Bank of America said in a regulatory
filing this month that it may have to post $5.1 billion of
additional collateral and termination payments on its
trades were it to be downgraded one level by rating companies.  “The European sovereign and banking system stress no
longer has borders,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
“A stone splashing in the European pond causes big ripples in
the U.S. as well.”  Contracts on Citigroup Inc. increased 9.2 basis points to
306.8 basis points and swaps tied to Morgan Stanley’s debt added
6.2 basis points to 506.9, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Contracts linked to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. increased 3.8 basis points to 171.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
