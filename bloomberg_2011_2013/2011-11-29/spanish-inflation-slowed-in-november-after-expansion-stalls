Spanish inflation eased in November
after growth in the euro area’s fourth-largest economy  stalled 
in the third quarter and the highest  unemployment rate  in Europe
led consumers to rein in spending.  Consumer prices , based on European Union calculations, rose
2.9 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 3 percent in
October, the  National Statistics Institute  said today. Retail
sales fell 7 percent in October from a year ago, the most since
June, the Madrid-based institute said in a separate report.  Spain’s  economy  is struggling to recover from a three-year
slump as households spend less to pay off one of the largest
private-debt burdens in the euro region. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development cut its 2012 growth
forecast for Spain to 0.3 percent from 1.6 percent yesterday,
and said it sees unemployment peaking at 22.9 percent next year.  The  European Central Bank  cut  interest rates  on Nov. 3,
lowering the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent as its president,  Mario Draghi , said “a mild
recession” in the euro area loomed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
