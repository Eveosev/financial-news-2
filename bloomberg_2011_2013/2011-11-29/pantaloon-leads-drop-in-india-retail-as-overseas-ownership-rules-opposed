Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the
nation’s largest retailer, led a decline among store operators
as the government faces political opposition to its decision to
ease limits on  foreign investment  in the industry.  Pantaloon fell 12 percent, the most since Nov. 21, to
196.70 rupees at close of trading in Mumbai.  Shoppers Stop Ltd. (SHOP) 
declined 3.3 percent to 356.05 rupees,  Trent Ltd. (TRENT)  declined 4
percent to 985.80 rupees and  Vishal Retail Ltd. (VISH)  dropped 2
percent to 20.05 rupees.  India’s government approved a proposal last week to allow
foreign investors to own as much as 51 percent of stores selling
more than one brand, and raise the limit for overseas ownership
of single-brand stores to 100 percent from 51 percent.  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s largest retailer and rivals including
Carrefour SA and Tesco seek to step up their presence in India
to tap a market estimated by Business Monitor International to
double to $785 billion by 2015 from $396 billion this year.  The main federal opposition Bharatiya Janata Party,
communist parties and two allies of Manmohan Singh-led
government have said they oppose the decision. Debate in
parliament was suspended for a sixth successive day today as
lawmakers demanded the government reverse the policy.  India’s benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  declined 1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
