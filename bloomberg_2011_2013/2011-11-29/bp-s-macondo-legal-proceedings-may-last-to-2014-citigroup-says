BP Plc ’s legal proceedings over the
Macondo well that caused the worst U.S. oil spill may last into
2014, Citigroup Inc. said, citing the company’s lead lawyer.  Blame for the accident will likely be apportioned in late
2013, with punishment decided the following year. That’s later
than analyst Alastair Syme had expected and is “slightly more
favorable” for the company than an earlier decision, he said in
a research note published today.  BP has set aside about $40 billion for costs from the
disaster that spewed almost 5 million barrels of oil into the
 Gulf of Mexico  last year. Shares are down more than 30 percent
since the spill.  “There is still a risk that ultimate fines and penalties
could be above BP’s current financial provisioning,” Syme
wrote.  The company is counting on $5 billion in fines and $7
billion in compensation. If BP is found to be grossly negligent,
its costs could rise by another $10 billion, Syme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
