KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, declined for
a sixth day as investors factored in an expected increase in
full-year earnings.  Shares in  Kenya ’s biggest fuel retailer by market value
retreated 0.5 percent to 9.15 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in
the capital, Nairobi. Earlier the stock had gained as much as
3.3 percent to 9.5 shillings.  “They did not really say anything new, the market had
already priced in the earnings,” Eric Musau, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone
today.  “Management is pleased to state, with a high degree of
confidence, that KenolKobil’s full year is well on track to
achieve its projected strong results,” the Nairobi-based
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  In July the company reported an 83 percent surge in first-
half profit to 2.16 billion shillings ($24 million). Sales
climbed 38 percent to 83.3 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
