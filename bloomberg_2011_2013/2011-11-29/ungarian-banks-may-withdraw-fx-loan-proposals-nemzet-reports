Hungarian banks may withdraw a
series of proposals submitted to the government to ease the
burden of foreign-currency borrowers,  Magyar Nemzet  said, citing
unidentified persons.  The banks may withdraw the proposals because they claim the
cabinet has breached a promise not to impose unilateral measures
on banks, the newspaper added.  Banks consider a government decision allowing employers to
give tax-exempt financial assistance to employees wishing to
repay their foreign-currency mortgages at below market rates as
counter to an agreement that the cabinet will abstain from
unilateral initiatives, the newspaper said.  Lenders are also concerned by reports that the government
is working on a plan to help public workers apply for early
repayment of loans at a loss to banks, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
