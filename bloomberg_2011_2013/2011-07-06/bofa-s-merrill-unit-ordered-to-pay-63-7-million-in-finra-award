Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. bank, was ordered to pay $63.7 million over claims its
Merrill Lynch brokerage unit defrauded a California hedge fund
during the 2008 financial crisis.  Rosen Capital Management LLC, based in  Santa Monica , had
demanded more than $90 million in its May 2009 claim, according
to a July 5 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  award . Rosen
said two of its funds lost money in “unexpected margin calls”
and alleged that Merrill didn’t act in good faith. The
transactions weren’t identified in the ruling, and the three-
member arbitration panel didn’t explain its reasoning.  Bill Halldin , a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said the lender is considering additional
action, including asking a court to overturn the award.  “We strongly disagree with the arbitration panel’s award,
which is contrary to the facts presented,” he said in an
e-mailed statement. “At all times, we met the contractual
requirements of our relationship with this sophisticated hedge
fund, which sought to blame us for losses during a period of
extreme market volatility in October 2008.”  A phone call to Rosen Capital wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
