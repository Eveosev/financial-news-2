Russia  spent 120 million rubles ($4.3
million) to fight locusts this year and protect crops, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  The money was used to spray the insects on 760,000 hectares
(1.88 million acres) of land, the ministry  said  today on its
website. Some 8.6 million hectares were inspected and locusts
were found to have landed on 2.2 million hectares.  The ministry estimated the potential damage to be as much
as 50 billion rubles.  “Grains did not suffer in Russia,” Agriculture Minister
 Yelena Skrynnik  said on the department’s website.  Locust incidents rose significantly in Dagestan, Kalmykia,
Astrakhan, Saratov and other southern regions this year as a
result of last year’s drought and a relatively warm winter,
Interfax cited Skrynnik as saying in Kalmykia earlier today.
Locusts’ peak seasons occur once every 10 years, and the last
took place in 2001, Interfax cited Skrynnik as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
