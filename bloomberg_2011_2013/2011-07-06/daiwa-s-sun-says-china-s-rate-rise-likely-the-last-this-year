Mingchun Sun, the Hong Kong-based
head of  China  Research at Daiwa Capital Markets, comments on the
People’s Bank of China’s announcement today that it will raise
benchmark lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage
point effective tomorrow.  “It should be the last time China raises  interest rates 
this year. Inflation should have peaked in June and economic
growth is showing signs of a slowdown. China will observe the
effects of its recent tightening measures before taking any new
action.  “We expect China’s consumer prices to rise 6.3 percent to
6.4 percent in June. Increases in pork prices are a major driver.
I don’t think there will be much impact on the yuan.”  -- Editor: Andrew Janes  To contact the reporter on this story:
