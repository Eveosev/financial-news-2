Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
plans to reduce the amount of ethanol it mixes into gasoline
after falling sugar-cane production drove up the price of the
biofuel, said a government official familiar with the decision.  The amount of ethanol mixed into gasoline will be cut to 18
percent from 25 percent now amid concerns rising fuel costs
could drive up inflation, according to the official, who asked
not to be named because the decision hasnâ€™t been made public
yet. The Energy Ministry plans to announce the cut next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
