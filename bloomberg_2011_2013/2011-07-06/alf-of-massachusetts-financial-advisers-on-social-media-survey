Almost half of registered investment
advisers in Massachusetts use social media to talk with clients,
though the majority fail to keep records of those conversations,
a survey found.  Responses from 460 advisers registered with the state’s
securities division showed that 44 percent use at least one form
of social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, and that an
additional 10 percent plan to do so within the next 12 months,
Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin said in a
statement today.  “Social media are in common use today, and becoming more
prevalent,” Galvin, the state’s top securities regulator, said
in the statement. “It is natural that investment advisers, and
others in the securities industry, will employ them in dealing
with investors.”  Of the companies using social media, almost seven in 10
lack the record-keeping ability to retain the communications,
the survey found. Galvin said the state’s securities division
will develop a list of “best practices” and possible rule
changes to address the advisers’ “largely unregulated” usage.  The Pew Internet and American Life Project found in
November that 61 percent of adults have used a site such as
Facebook or LinkedIn, compared with 8 percent in 2005. LinkedIn
Corp., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. were the most popular
social media outlets with advisers, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
