Nintendo Co. pared gains in Osaka
trading after the company ruled out expanding into smartphone
games, damping speculation triggered by affiliate Pokemon Co.’s
development of software for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones and handsets
that run on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system.  Nintendo’s strategy to develop software only for its own
hardware “hasn’t changed and won’t change,” Yasuhiro Minagawa,
a spokesman for the Kyoto-based maker of the Wii game console
and DS portable player, said today by phone. Pokemon, 32 percent
owned by Nintendo, is independent, he said. Pokemon said July 1
its ‘Tap’ game will debut this summer.  Nintendo shares rose as much as 4.9 percent, the most since
March 16, before trimming gains after the company reiterated its
development policy. The world’s largest maker of video-game
players is facing competition from Apple and Google as their
operating systems allow companies to develop games for
smartphones.  “The share movement showed how much investors are hoping
for Nintendo to change its strategy,” said  Mitsuo Shimizu , an
analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Nintendo should
consider developing games for smartphones or players that can
also act as mobile phones, as it suits the lifestyles of many
people.”  Nintendo traded 1.2 percent higher at 15,610 yen at the 11
a.m. break on the Osaka Securities Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
