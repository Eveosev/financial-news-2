The lira slumped to a one-week low
and Turkish bonds snapped a three-day rally after Moody’s
Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s credit rating to junk.  The lira weakened 0.4 percent to 1.6340 at 5:14 p.m. in
Istanbul, dropping for a third day and bringing the loss so far
this week to 1.7 percent. The yield on the two-year benchmark
bond was 8.97 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s four basis points up from the 8.93 percent close of the
Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS index yesterday.  Moody’s slashed Portugal’s rating four levels to Ba2 from
Baa1 late yesterday. The decision came two months after Portugal
got a 78 billion-euro aid package ($112 billion).  “Portugal’s downgrade created uncertainty in the market
today,” Henza Tukel, a currency trader at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi
AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  Turkey ’s central bank said yesterday the need for monetary
tightening is lessening because growth will slow and the outlook
for inflation is “positive.” The bank has kept  interest rates 
at a record low of 6.25 percent since January.  “We saw a central bank far more dovish than we expected
and this is naturally making an impact,” Tukel said. “The
lira’s underperformance will continue for some time if there is
no change in the tone of the central bank.”  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  retreated for a second day,
dropping 1 percent to 63,240.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
