China  faces an “inevitable crisis”
if the government loosens monetary policy in the second half of
the year, according to  Andy Xie , an independent economist.  “The market consensus is that China will loosen in the
second half,” Xie, formerly Morgan Stanley’s chief Asia
economist in Hong Kong, said on Bloomberg Television today. Such
a move could boost inflation and investors should “duck for
cover” if that happens, he said.  The Shanghai Composite Index has rebounded 7.4 percent from
this year’s low on June 20 through yesterday amid speculation
the government will succeed in curbing inflation without adding
to four increases in  interest rates  since September. China
hasn’t raised its benchmark lending and deposit rates since
April 6, the longest pause since the current cycle of monetary
tightening began in October.  China’s equity markets may post gains of 20 percent or more
by the end of the year, Citigroup Inc. said in a report dated
yesterday, citing possible “policy accommodation,” valuations
and the outlook for earnings.  Consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier,
the most in 34 months.  --Allen Wan in Beijing and Rishaad Salamat in  Hong Kong . Editors:
