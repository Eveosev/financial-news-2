Zimbabwe ’s three main political
parties agreed to delay elections until next year and have set a
timetable for changes to media and police laws,  Newsday  said,
citing negotiators from the parties.  The media laws will be reformed within 90 days and the
Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act will be changed within 120
days of Aug. 1, the Harare-based newspaper said on its website
today.  Outstanding issues such as the staffing of the Zimbabwe
Electoral Commission and an end to military and police abuse
were not resolved and will be referred back to political party
leaders, said Newsday.  Yesterday’s agreement must be accepted by Prime Minister
 Morgan Tsvangirai , who heads the main Movement for Democratic
Change party, President  Robert Mugabe , leader of the Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front, and Welshman Ncube, who
controls a smaller wing of the MDC, Newsday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
