The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 5 p.m.  New York  time.  The Merval Index rose 0.9 percent to 3,461.75, its eighth
consecutive day of gains and its longest winning streak of the
year.  Banks advanced after a three-judge panel in New York
federal appeals court ruled yesterday that bondholders with
judgments against  Argentina  can’t seize $105 million of
Argentine central bank assets held at the  Federal Reserve Bank
of New York . The decision overturns an April 2010 ruling by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Griesa permitting the seizure.  Banco Macro SA (BMA)  , Argentina’s largest lender by
market value, climbed 2.1 percent to 16.75 pesos.  Banco
Hipotecario SA (BHIP)   rose 6.8 percent to 2.50 pesos.  Grupo
Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL)   added 2.4 percent to 6.05 pesos.  Electric companies climbed in response to a cold spell this
week that has led to increased electricity consumption for
heating, and rumors the government may allow a hike in
electricity rates, said Alberto Tarsia, a trader at Buenos
Aires-based Debursa Soc. De Bolsa SA.  Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte (EDN)  SA,
Argentina’s biggest power distributor, rose 2.7 percent to 2.28
pesos.  Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)   advanced 2.3 percent to 2.67
pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
