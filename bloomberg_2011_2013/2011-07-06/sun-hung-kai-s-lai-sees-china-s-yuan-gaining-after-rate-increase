Kenix Lai, foreign-exchange analyst
at Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong , comments on the
People’s Bank of China’s announcement today that it will raise
benchmark lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points effective
tomorrow.  “The interest-rate hike reflects the fact that China is
facing a lot of inflationary pressure. The yuan is going to
strengthen after the latest rate hike. Repo rates in China will
rise as well since liquidity is further tightened.”  “The market had expected China to raise  interest rates 
this week. Whether China will increase borrowing costs again or
not depends on whether inflation peaked in June.”  -- Editor: Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
