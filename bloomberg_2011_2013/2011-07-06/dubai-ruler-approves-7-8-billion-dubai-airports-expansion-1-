Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum approved a $7.8 billion expansion plan for the
Persian Gulf emirate’s airports as the facility seeks to become
the world’s busiest airfield.  Dubai International plans to boost capacity to
75 million travelers a year by 2012 and to 90 million by 2018,
from 60 million now, Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of
Dubai Airports, said today at a news conference. The airport was
the third-busiest for international traffic in the first
quarter, after  London Heathrow  and  Hong Kong , according to
 Airports Council International .  Dubai Airports operates Dubai International, which is home
to Emirates, the biggest international airline, and the Al-
Maktoum International Airport. Passengers handled by Dubai
International surged 15.4 percent in 2010 from a year earlier to
47.2 million helped by a rebound in tourist and business traffic
and Dubai’s growth as a hub for traffic between the U.S.,  Europe 
and  Asia .  The  cash flow  from Dubai Airports and Dubai Duty Free makes
paying for the expansion “very manageable,” Griffiths said.
Depending on the financing plan chosen, Dubai Airports may
consider becoming a standalone company, he told reporters in
Dubai. The airport operator is now funded by the government.  Dubai Airports forecast that international passenger
traffic will rise at an average annual rate of 7.2 percent this
decade to reach 98.5 million by 2020, according to a statement
distributed today. Cargo volumes are expected to gain 6.7
percent annually in the period.  New Concourses  The Dubai airport will complete building Concourse 3, meant
for the use of Emirates’ Airbus A380 planes, by the end of 2012
and will build a Concourse 4 next to the existing Terminal 1 by
2015, Griffiths said.  The aviation industry in Dubai contributed $22.1 billion or
28 percent of the emirate’s gross domestic product in 2010 and
will probably contribute 32 percent by 2020, according to
today’s presentation. Dubai Duty Free is the world’s largest
duty-free retailer with revenue of $1.27 billion in 2010.  Atlanta’s airport is the largest in the world by passenger
traffic, including domestic flights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
