Liverpool agreed to sign Blackpool
midfielder  Charlie Adam , the 18-time English soccer champion
said today on its website.  Adam, 25 will discuss contract terms and undergo a medical
examination in Liverpool. The Reds have been trying to get the
Scotsman since January when Blackpool rejected offers for its
captain.  “Liverpool Football Club today announced they have reached
agreement with Blackpool,” the  statement said . The purchase
price wasn’t disclosed. U.K. media has reported Liverpool
offering around 8 million pounds ($12.8 million) for Adam.  Adam would become Liverpool’s second signing of the
offseason after former Sunderland midfielder  Jordan Henderson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
