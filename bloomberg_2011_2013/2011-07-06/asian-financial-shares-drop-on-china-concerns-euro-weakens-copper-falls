Most Asian stocks declined, led by
Chinese banks, after an investor sold $3.63 billion worth of
shares in two lenders and amid concern credit quality in the
world’s second-largest economy will deteriorate. The euro fell
for a second day against the yen and copper led metals lower.  An index of financial shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
fell 0.3 percent as of 11:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , while an index of
Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  sank 1.3 percent. Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index futures slid less than 0.1 percent. The euro
fell 0.1 percent to 116.85 yen. Oil traded near a three-week
high in New York, while copper snapped a six-day rally in
 London .  The sale of stakes in  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and
 Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  by Temasek Holdings Pte come as a Moody’s
Investors Service said problem loans to local governments in
 China  may exceed official estimates. The ratings company
yesterday cut Portugal’s credit rating to below investment
grade. Data today may show German factory orders and the U.S.
services industry grew at a slower pace, as investors look ahead
to July 8 report that may show American payrolls climbed.  “Investors are underestimating the commitment of the
Chinese government to keep on tightening, which of course means
that some sectors of the market, such as the financials, are
vulnerable to issues like potential bad loans,” said Mikio Kumada, a global strategist at LGT Capital Management in
 Singapore . “It will stay with us for a while.”  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  slumped 4.8 percent after Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co. ruled out bidding for a 15 percent stake in
the chipmaker. Shares of Hyundai Heavy rose 6.5 percent.  China’s Banks  China Construction Bank dropped 3.4 percent in Hong Kong,
while Bank of China sank 4.2 percent. The Chinese banks were the
biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Financials Index, the only
industry group on the Asia-Pacific gauge to decline today.
Singapore’s Temasek raised HK$28.2 billion ($3.62 billion) from
the sale of shares in two of China’s three largest banks.  The nation’s seven-day repurchase rate, which measures
interbank funding availability, jumped 54 basis points to 7.42
percent, according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.1 percent yesterday, its first drop
in six days. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 3.13
percent, after falling six basis points yesterday.  U.S. Data  A report today may show the Institute of Supply
Management’s index for non-manufacturing businesses, which cover
about 90 percent of the economy, fell to 53.7 in June from 54.6,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Labor
Department data due July 8 may show payrolls climbed by 100,000
workers after a 54,000 increase in May, a separate survey
showed.  The euro traded at $1.4446 from $1.4429 yesterday, when it
touched $1.4397, the lowest level since June 29 after Moody’s
yesterday cut  Portugal ’s long-term ratings to Ba2, two levels
below investment grade. The reductions stem partly from “the
growing risk that Portugal will require a second round of
official financing before it can return to the private market,”
Moody’s said in a statement.  Greece ’s bondholders will meet with officials in Paris
today to discuss their role in a second rescue of the indebted
nation.  The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific corporate and sovereign
bonds against non-payment increased, with the Markit iTraxx
Australia index climbing one basis point to 110.5 basis points,
Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. That’s on track for the
second increase this week following five days of declines.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 0.5 basis point to 111, according
