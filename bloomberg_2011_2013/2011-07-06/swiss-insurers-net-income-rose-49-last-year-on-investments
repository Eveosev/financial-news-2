Swiss insurers, including  Zurich
Financial Services AG (ZURN)  and  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) , posted a 49
percent increase in profit last year after investment income
rose, according to the country’s market regulator.  Total net income climbed to 8.3 billion Swiss francs ($9.88
billion) from 5.57 billion francs in 2009, according to  data 
published today by the  Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
Authority . The report only includes data from life and general
insurers, not reinsurers.  “The higher net income is related to higher investment
income as well as improved technical results,” according to
Finma spokesman Tobias Lux.  Swiss premiums declined 0.3 percent to 83.7 billion francs
last year, the regulator known as Finma said. That compares with
an increase of 2.7 percent in global insurance premiums on
economic growth in Asia and  Brazil , according to Swiss Re, the
world’s second-biggest reinsurer.  Total income from investments rose 11 percent to 14.8
billion francs, Finma said. Life insurers invested on average 2
percent in equities while the figure for general insurers was
about 3 percent, the regulator said.  The average Swiss Solvency Test ratio among the country’s
insurers improved to 192 percent from 184 percent in 2009, Finma
said. To pass the solvency test, insurers need a ratio of above
100 percent.  The test was introduced in January and requires insurers to
provide a mark-to-market valuation of assets and liabilities
that for the first time takes into account their investment
portfolios.  To contact the reporter on this story:
