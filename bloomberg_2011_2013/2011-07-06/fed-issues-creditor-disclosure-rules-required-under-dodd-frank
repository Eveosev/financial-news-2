U.S. regulators have adopted rules
requiring lenders to inform consumers about credit scores to
calculate rates on loans or in the rejection of a loan
application.  The  Federal Reserve  and the Federal Trade Commission today
issued the rules, which implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank
law passed last year. The law overhauls the nationâ€™s financial
rules and aims to better protect consumers from abusive lending
and other practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
