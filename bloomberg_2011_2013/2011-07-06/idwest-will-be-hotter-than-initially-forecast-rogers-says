The Midwest will be hotter than
originally forecast from July 11 to July 20 because a cooling
that was supposed to take hold will be weaker than expected,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  While rain will still take some of the edge off the heat,
the outlook in the 6- to 10-day forecast is for hotter-than-
normal weather, with some of the highest temperatures in Kansas
and Oklahoma, Rogers said in a note to clients today.  “The East Coast still sees sufficient variability to
prevent as much heat there compared to the Midwest and Plains,”
said Rogers from his office in Bethesda, Maryland.  Natural gas futures rose yesterday for the fifth time in
seven days after the  National Weather Service  said temperatures
will be above normal from July 10 to July 14 in the Northeast
and Midwest.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of U.S. natural
gas supplies, and traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.  For the 11- to 15-day forecast, the greatest concentration
of heat shifts to the Rocky Mountains, Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
