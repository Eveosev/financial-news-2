Former employees at  Zimbabwe ’s
central bank who were fired in January may take legal action
after the bank failed to pay their full severance packages, the
 Daily News  said, citing Webster Ngundu, chairman of the
Retrenchees Association.  The employees were told they would receive half of their
severance packages in January and the other half by June, Ngundu
told the Harare-based newspaper. The second payment has yet to
be made, the Daily News reported.  Zimbabwe’s central bank, which has debts of more than $1
billion stemming from a decade of recession, fired three
quarters of its 1,400 workers to curb costs, said the Daily
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
