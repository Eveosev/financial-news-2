Sports Direct International Plc (SPD) , the
retailer controlled by Newcastle United Football Club owner Mike Ashley, rose to the highest in more than four years in London
trading after buying an 80 percent stake in USC and Cruise
Clothing from billionaire entrepreneur Tom Hunter.  The shares jumped 8.4 pence, or 3.5 percent to 250.9 pence,
the highest since April 2007, extending its gain this year to 57
percent and lifting the company’s market value to 1.45 billion
pounds ($2.32 billion).  Sports Direct paid 7 million pounds for the stakes in the
two fashion retailers, it said in a statement today. Hunter will
keep a 20 percent stake, the statement said.  Hunter’s closely held  West Coast Capital  bought USC from
Bridgepoint Capital for 45 million pounds in 2004, according to
the Scotsman newspaper. Hunter, who sold his Sports Division
business for 290 million pounds in 1998, bought Cruise out of
administration on Dec. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
