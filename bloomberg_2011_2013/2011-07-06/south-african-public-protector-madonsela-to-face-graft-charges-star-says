South African police plan to arrest
the nation’s  Public Protector  on charges of fraud and
corruption, the  Star  reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  A company owned by the current ombudsman, Thuli Madonsela,
benefited from contracts worth 1.8 million rand ($270,000) by
the South African Law Reform Commission, of which she was a
member at the time, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  Madonsela’s company was never paid more than 500,000 rand
for work performed for the commission, which was aware that she
owned the entity, she was cited in the Star as saying. Kgalalelo
Masibi, her spokeswoman, said Madonsela would comment at a media
briefing at midday today, when phoned by Bloomberg News. She
declined to comment further.  Police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo declined to confirm or deny
an investigation into Madonsela when contacted by Bloomberg News
on his mobile phone today. “We don’t confirm investigations
against anybody until they are supposed to appear in court,” he
said.  The Public Protector, who is tasked in the constitution
with investigating improper conduct by public officials, in a
February probe found that Police Commissioner Bheki Cele broke
government procurement rules when he authorized payment for a
500 million-rand lease for new police headquarters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
