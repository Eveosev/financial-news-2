Zillow Inc., an online real-estate
information service, is seeking to raise as much as $48.5
million in its initial public offering.  The Seattle-based company is offering 3.46 million shares
for $12 to $14 each, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The IPO will price on July
19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Zillow announced its IPO in April, joining a flood of
filings to go public. In the three months through June,
companies registered for initial offerings at the fastest pace
since 2007, according to Bloomberg data. Zillow plans a
placement of about $5.5 million of shares with two private
investors alongside the public offering, the prospectus showed.  The Zillow website lets home buyers, sellers, renters and
managers list and search for properties, home-price estimates
and other information. Sales more than doubled to $11.3 million
in the three months through March 31, while the net loss in the
same period narrowed to $826,000 from $2.8 million, according to
the filing.  At the offering’s midpoint price of $13 and assuming
completion of the private placement, Zillow would be valued at
$351.8 million, according to data disclosed in today’s filing.  All of the shares in the IPO are being offered by Zillow,
and the company is selling the private-placement shares to
Technology Crossover Ventures and PAR Investment Partners,
according to the  SEC filing .  Technology Crossover Ventures owns 30 percent of Zillow’s
Class A common stock, and PAR owns 11 percent, the filing shows.
Benchmark Capital owns 19 percent.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  is leading Zillow’s offering. The shares
will list on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol Z.  To contact the reporter on this story:
