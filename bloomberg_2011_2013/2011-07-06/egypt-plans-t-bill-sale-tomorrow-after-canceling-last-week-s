Egypt  plans to raise 6 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1 billion) from a treasury-bill auction
tomorrow after canceling a sale for similar-maturity notes last
week.  The North African country’s central bank will seek bids for
2.5 billion pounds in six-month securities and 3.5 billion
pounds in one-year notes. It called-off a sale of the notes on
June 30 because bidders demanded yields that were too high, two
government officials with knowledge of the decision said at the
time.  The yield on the nation’s one-year bills has gained 254
basis points, or 2.54 percentage points, to 12.982 percent since
the start of a revolt on Jan. 25 that ousted President  Hosni
Mubarak  the following month. The central bank has failed to meet
its fund-raising target for the notes in the last 11 auctions,
according to Bloomberg data.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
in April 2020 was little changed at 5.67 percent at 3:59 p.m. in
Cairo. The pound strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 5.9555
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
