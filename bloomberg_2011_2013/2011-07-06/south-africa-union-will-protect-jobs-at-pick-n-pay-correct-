(Corrects spelling of spokesman’s surname in first
paragraph.)  The South African Commercial,
Catering and Allied Workers’ Union will do everything it can to
protect workers at  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) , the nation’s second-
biggest grocer, which may fire about 8.6 percent of its
workforce, Secretariat Coordinator Lucas Ramatlhodi said.  The union is surprised by the company’s announcement that
it’s considering eliminating 3,137 of 36,563 positions while
talks are ongoing, he said by phone from Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
