Taiwan ’s government bonds rose for a
second day on optimism the  central bank  will succeed in taming
the fastest inflation in 16 months. The Taiwan dollar weakened.  The  consumer price index  climbed 1.93 percent in June from
a year earlier, the most since February 2010, the statistics
bureau reported yesterday. That was below the 2.1 percent annual
increase forecast by the government. The Central Bank of  China 
(Taiwan) lifted its benchmark interest rate by 12.5 basis points
to 1.875 percent on June 30.  “Inflation did accelerate but it looks like it’s still
under control,” said Samson Tu, who helps manage $1.6 billion
of fixed-income securities at Uni-President Assets Management
Corp. in Taipei.  The yield on the 2 percent government bonds due July 2016
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.153
percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The rate will fall to 1.12 percent by the end
of this week, according to Tu. It rose four basis points last
week following the rate decision.  “Yields will continue to go down, partly as a correction
after the big jump last week caused by the interest-rate
increase,” Tu said.  The  Taiwan dollar  declined 0.2 percent to NT$28.851 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.656 on July 4, the strongest level
since June 3.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.37 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
