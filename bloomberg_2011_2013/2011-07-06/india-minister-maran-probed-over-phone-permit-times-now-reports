Former Indian Telecommunications
Minister Dayanidhi Maran, now in charge of the textiles ministry,
is being probed by federal investigators over the allocation of
a mobile-phone license, Times Now television reported.  Maran delayed granting a permit to Aircel Cellular Ltd. in
2006 and forced its promoter to sell his stake in the company to
 Malaysia ’s Maxis Group, the news channel said, citing a report
of the Central Bureau of Investigation submitted today to the
 Supreme Court .  Maran was not immediately available for comment when calls
were made to his office and residence in New Delhi. He earlier
denied any wrongdoing and said he’ll prove his innocence.  Maxis Communications Bhd. Chief Executive Officer Sandip
Das wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Maran preceded Andimuthu Raja as telecommunications
minister. Raja is on trial in New Delhi charged with conspiring
with telecom companies in a 2008 sale of phone permits that the
country’s auditor says may have been awarded at “unbelievably
low” prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
