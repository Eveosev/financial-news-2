OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI) , a maker
of image sensors for camera phones, declined in U.S. trading
after FBR Capital Markets said the company may have missed a
deadline to supply an iPhone component to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   The shares of Santa Clara, California-based OmniVision lost
$1.26, or 3.6 percent, to $33.41 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. OmniVision has gained 13 percent this year.  Chief Executive Officer Shaw Hong is counting on surging
demand for smartphones with multiple cameras to boost sales of
his imaging technology, he said in a May 26 conference call with
investors. OmniVision may lose market share to rival  Sony Corp. (6758) 
if the company missed a deadline to provide iPhone equipment to
Apple, said Craig Berger, an analyst with FBR in  New York .  “Many believed that OmniVision would capture as much as a
90 percent share of iPhone production, which may turn out not to
be the case,” Berger said in a note to clients today.  Brian Dunn, a spokesman for OmniVision, didn’t return calls
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
