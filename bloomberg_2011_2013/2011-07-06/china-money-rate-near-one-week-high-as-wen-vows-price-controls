China ’s money-market rate traded near
the highest level in more than a week after Premier  Wen Jiabao 
vowed to stabilize prices, spurring concern the central bank
will tighten the availability of cash.  Government data on July 15 will show consumer prices
climbed 6.2 percent last month from a year earlier after having
increased 5.5 percent in May, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Inflationary pressures
will be under control after a price-control policy is
implemented, Wen said on July 3, according to a  statement  on the
state council’s website.  “Traders are afraid that the central bank may adopt more
tightening measures, even though they can’t predict what
measures the authorities will choose,” said Peng Hao, a bond
analyst at Fudian Bank Co. in Kunming, capital of the southern
Yunnan province.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose 62 basis points to 7.50 percent as of
9:36 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
the same level yesterday, the highest since June 24.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed one basis point to 3.85 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
