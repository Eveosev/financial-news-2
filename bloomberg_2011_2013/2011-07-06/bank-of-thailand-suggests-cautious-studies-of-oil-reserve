Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul comments on the possibility of using foreign
reserves to establish a strategic oil reserve.  A national strategic petroleum stockpile is needed to
protect the country from global oil price fluctuations, the
Bangkok Post reported today, citing Pailin Chuchottarworn, the
incoming president of  PTT Pcl (PTT) , the country’s biggest energy
company.  “Oil is a valuable asset but has a high volatility,”
Prasarn said.  “The central bank needs cautious studies on the issue, and
has to see if the bank can make such an investment under its
regulations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
