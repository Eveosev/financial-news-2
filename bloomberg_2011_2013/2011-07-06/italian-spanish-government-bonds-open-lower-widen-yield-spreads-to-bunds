Italian and Spanish government bonds
fell for a third-straight day, increasing the additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark 10-
year German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Italian securities advanced three
basis points to 5.03 percent as of 7:38 a.m. in  London , pushing
the difference in yield, or spread, to similar-maturity German
debt four basis points wider to 203 basis points. Spanish 10-
year yields rose four basis points to 5.52 percent and increased
the spread to bunds to 252 basis points.  The rate on Irish 10-year bonds was eight basis points
higher at 11.62 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
