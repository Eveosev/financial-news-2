Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
ordered an investigation into possible failures in state arms
procurement, threatening to fire “panic-mongers” or officials
who derailed contracts.  “If this is the situation, we need reprimands of all
government officials responsible, regardless of their rank,”
Medvedev said today at his residence near Moscow. “If not, we
must attend to those who are sowing panic. You remember that in
wartime panic-mongers were shot. I’ll allow you to fire them.”  Medvedev called for a report within three days.  Yury Solomonov, who developed the Bulava intercontinental
ballistic missile, criticized the  Defense Ministry  for bungling
contracts for arms development and re-equipping the military in
an interview published in the Kommersant newspaper today.  Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said 108 billion rubles
($3.9 billion) of contracts weren’t signed this year after
prices soared, RIA Novosti reported today from Sochi, southern
 Russia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
