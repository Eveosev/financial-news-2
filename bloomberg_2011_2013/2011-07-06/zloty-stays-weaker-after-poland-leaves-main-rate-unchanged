The Polish zloty stayed weaker
against the euro after the central bank left the main interest
rate unchanged, as expected.  The zloty was down 0.2 percent at 3.9554 per euro as of
1:27 p.m. in Warsaw. The Narodowy Bank Polski kept the seven-day
interest rate unchanged at 4.5 percent today, matching the
expectations of all 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
