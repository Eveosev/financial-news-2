The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose for a third day,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 11 basis points to 240.5 at 8:30 a.m. in
London. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit
quality .  Swaps on  Portugal  soared 67 basis points to 838, the
highest level in more than a week, according to CMA. Contracts
on  Greece  climbed 38 basis points to 1,962, Ireland jumped 25 to
760 and  Spain  rose 11 to 288, while Italy increased 11 to 209
and Belgium was 8 higher at 159.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 13
basis points to 409, the highest in a week, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3.25 basis points to 109.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 8 basis points to 168 and the
subordinated index climbed 12 to 298.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
