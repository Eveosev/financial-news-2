Kenya placed its security agencies on
high alert on suspicion that an aide to the former commander of
Somaliaâ€™s al-Shabaab terror group travelled to the country for
medical treatment, the  Daily Nation  reported.  Bilal El Berjawi, a British national of Lebanese descent,
may have suffered head injuries in a U.S. air attack at the
weekend, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, without citing
anyone. Kenyan police rank Berjawi as second to Fazul Abdullah,
the al-Shabaab commander who was killed last month, it said.  Nine senior al-Shabaab operatives may have been killed or
injured in the U.S. bombardment on July 3, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
