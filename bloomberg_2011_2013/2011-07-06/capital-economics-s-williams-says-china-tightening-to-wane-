Mark Williams , a London-based
economist with Capital Economics Ltd., comments on the People’s
Bank of  China ’s decision to raise benchmark deposit and lending
rates by 25 basis points from tomorrow.  “We suspect that appetite for further tightening will
nonetheless wane in response to evidence that the economy is
slowing. Inflation probably rose above 6 percent in June but is
now widely expected to decline in the second half of the year.”  “We expect no more rate moves but continue to expect two
further 50 basis point increases in the required reserve ratio,
reflecting the PBOC’s continued efforts to mop up currency
inflows and its reliance primarily on quantitative measures to
control credit growth.”  --Zheng Lifei. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
