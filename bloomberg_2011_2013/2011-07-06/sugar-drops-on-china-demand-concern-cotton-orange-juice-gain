Sugar fell for the first time in
three sessions after  China  raised  interest rates , signaling
slower economic growth and reduced imports. Cotton and orange-
juice futures gained.  The People’s Bank of China said today it will boost the
one-year lending rate to 6.56 percent from 6.31 percent
tomorrow. China, the world’s largest sugar consumer after India,
has raised borrowing costs three times this year to curb
inflation in the world’s fastest-growing economy. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell for the third session
in four.  “The Chinese rate hike is a mild negative for commodities
across the board,” said Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country
Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul , Minnesota.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.22 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 27.38 cents a pound at 10:29 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , after touching 27 cents, the lowest since July
1. Before today, prices jumped 35 percent since touching a
seven-month low of 20.4 cents on May 6.  Cotton futures for December delivery gained 0.98 cent, or
0.8 percent, to $1.165 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price
slipped to $1.1475, the lowest since Nov. 30.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery advanced 2.7
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.893 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
