Ashish Chaturmohta, vice president of
derivatives and technical analysis at IIFL Private Wealth
Management Ltd. in Mumbai., comments on the outlook for Indian
equities. He spoke today in a phone interview.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange fell
0.3 percent to 5,615.30 at 1:40 p.m. local time. The gauge
rallied about 5 percent in the two-week period ended July 3.  On market outlook:  “Investors see no point in being aggressive ahead of the
corporate earnings season. Some investors are seeing the recent
rally as an opportunity to exit rather than go long at these
levels. There is a significant short build up in the Nifty
futures. If there is more negative news from the domestic front
and  Greece , Nifty may slide below its support of 5,400.”  “We expect Nifty to trade range bound in the near term.
There is an increase in open interest in the 5,700 call and the
5,500 put options, signaling that Nifty is likely to trade in
this range. ”  On volatility:  “Implied volatility for options contracts is higher in
puts than in calls, indicating put writers are cautious to take
fresh bets. Everyone is waiting to find out who books profit
first.”  On stock technicals:  “Apollo Tyres Ltd., Tata Chemicals Ltd., Voltas Ltd are
looking positive on the charts. Reliance Industries Ltd. and JSW
Steel Ltd. are looking weak.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
