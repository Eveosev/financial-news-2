Croatia , which last week concluded
talks to join the European Union in 2013, remains at risk of a
credit-rating downgrade because of its debt and “poor”
economic growth prospects,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “Although EU accession will provide significant benefits
to Croatia, the country’s weak debt dynamics, high external
indebtedness and poor economic growth prospects mean that risks
to creditworthiness remain on the downside,” the rating company
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Fitch rates Croatia BBB-, its lowest investment grade and
the same level as Hungary, Romania and  Latvia . It has a negative
outlook on the country, signaling it’s more inclined to lower
its rating than raise it or leave it unchanged.  Croatia, a Balkan nation of 4.5 million people, is
struggling to recover from a two-year recession after foreign
investment declined. The economy may expand 1.5 percent in 2011,
the first growth since 2008, the government has said.  State debt will swell to 47.4 percent of gross domestic
product this year from 41.2 percent in 2010, according the
 International Monetary Fund . It will reach 50 percent of GDP in
2012, the fund predicts.  Croatia plans to join the EU in July 2013. Membership,
which requires ratification by parliament and all 27 member
states, would offer access to almost 700 million euros ($1
billion) of European infrastructure and farm aid in 2013 and
bigger subsidies later.  To contact the reporters on this story:
