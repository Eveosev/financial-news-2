South Africa ’s economic recovery is
not yet sustainable and, as with other emerging markets, is
still “highly dependent” on expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, Deputy Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said.  While the economy has recovered from recession in 2009,
employment remains below pre-crisis levels, Nene said today in
an e-mailed copy of a speech in Durban, South Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
