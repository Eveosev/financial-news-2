Lu Ting,  China  economist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in  Hong Kong , comments on the People’s
Bank of China’s announcement today that it will raise benchmark
lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points effective tomorrow.  The one-year lending rate will rise to 6.56 percent and the
one-year deposit rate will increase to 3.5 percent.  On the reason for the increase:  “Interest rates need to go up because deposit rates are
still too low compared with inflation. Even after this increase,
the benchmark rate is still below the rate of inflation.  On the impact on the economy:  “This will have a small impact on growth but it will help
to anchor people’s inflation expectations as there is great
concern about rising food prices such as pork.”  --Nerys Avery. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg news staff for this story:
