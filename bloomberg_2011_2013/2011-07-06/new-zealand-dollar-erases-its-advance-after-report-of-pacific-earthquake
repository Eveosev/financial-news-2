The New Zealand dollar erased its
gain versus the greenback after a U.S. Geological Survey
statement indicated that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck 132
miles off of the Kermadec Islands. The New Zealand dollar was
little changed at 82.49 U.S. cents after earlier advancing 0.6
percent to 83.02 cents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
