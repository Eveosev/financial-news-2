Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, the
European Union’s biggest coking-coal producer, gained on its
first day of trading on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange , following
Poland’s largest initial public offering this year.  Shares in the company known as JSW increased as much as 3.6
percent to 140.9 zloty and traded 2.9 percent higher at 139.9
zloty at 9:06 a.m. in Warsaw, compared with the 136 zloty price
in last month’s IPO of 39.5 million shares, a 33 percent stake.  After the IPO, part of a government plan to gain cash for
financing the  budget deficit  and curbing debt, the  Treasury
Ministry  has raised 77 percent of the 15 billion zloty ($5.5
billion) it aims to get from asset sales this year.  JSW is the fourth coal producer listed in Warsaw and the
largest by market value, topping New World Resources Plc of the
 Czech Republic , Poland’s  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)  and
Ukraine’s Sadovaya Group SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
