Chile ’s peso climbed for a second day
as pessimism about the European debt crisis waned a day after
Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s credit rating to junk.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 463.95 per dollar from
464.56 yesterday, recovering from losses earlier in the day when
it was down as much as 0.4 percent.  “The whole market got worried initially about Portugal and
now people are thinking maybe it will be possible to decouple
from the minor European countries, though it’s still early for
that,” Dirk Heller, head of Latin America local markets
strategy for Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said in a phone
interview.  The Chilean government’s announcement yesterday to create a
$4 billion education fund may continue to strengthen the peso as
some of the financing would come from copper profits and
offshore savings held in U.S. dollars, said  Cesar Perez , a
managing director at Celfin Capital SA in Santiago.  “When you actually move those proceeds back into Chile,
you’re going to move the  exchange rate ,” he said.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 466.26 pesos per
dollar for $50 million today, as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
