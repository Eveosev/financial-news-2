Spot gasoline in California weakened
against futures for a third day, while  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  shut a unit
at the Wilmington refinery south of  Los Angeles .  The discount for prompt-delivery, California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles widened 1 cent to 9.75 cents
a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange as of 2 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in  San Francisco  weakened 0.38 cent to a
discount of 12.63 cents a gallon versus Nymex futures.  The premium for California-blend, low-sulfur diesel in Los
Angeles shrank 1.6 cents to 6.9 cents a gallon versus Nymex
heating oil futures. The premium for the same fuel in San
Francisco strengthened 0.75 cent to 9.25 cents.  Tesoro shut a unit in Wilmington after a fuel gas leak,
said Mike Marcy, a company spokesman in Martinez,  California .  The San Antonio-based company is scheduled to begin
maintenance on a unit at the plant tomorrow, Marcy said.
Neither the shut unit nor the planned work is expected to affect
refinery operations, he said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon, was
unchanged at a discount of 4.5 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
