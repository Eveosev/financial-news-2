Fibra Uno Administracion SA,  Mexico ’s
only real estate investment trust, plans to spend as much as 11
billion pesos ($945.7 million) to buy seven more properties by
the end of 2012, Chief Financial Officer Javier Elizalde Velez
said.  Fibra Uno will purchase as many as three of the properties
by the end of this year, Elizalde Valdez said in a telephone
interview yesterday from Mexico City.  Fibra Uno closed the acquisition of a property in Toluca,
state of Mexico, for 260 million pesos this month, bringing its
portfolio to 17 properties in central and southern Mexico,
according to a statement dated July 1.  “The idea is to acquire properties that are finishing
construction and are close to generating income,” Elizalde
Velez said.  Fibra Uno started trading in March as the country’s first
of two initial public offerings this year. The shares have
climbed 3.3 percent since the IPO. They fell 0.7 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
