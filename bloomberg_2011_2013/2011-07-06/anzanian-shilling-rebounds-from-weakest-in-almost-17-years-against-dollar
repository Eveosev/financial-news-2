Tanzania’s shilling rebounded from
the weakest level in almost 17 years against the dollar.  The currency of  Africa ’s third-biggest gold producer
appreciated for a second day, gaining as much as 1.1 percent to
1,598 per dollar and traded 0.7 percent stronger at 1,604 by
10:46 a.m. in Dar es Salaam. Yesterday, the currency reached
1,632.9 per dollar, the lowest since at least October 1994,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
