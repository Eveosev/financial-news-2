Cyprusâ€™s government got a 60 million-
euro ($86 million) loan from a Russian bank, securing almost
half of its financing needs for the rest of 2011,  Stockwatch 
reported today, citing finance minister Charilaos Stavrakis.  The Russian bank issued the loan to Cyprus, which needs a
total of 150 million euros to cover its financing for the rest
of the year, Stavrakis said, according to Stockwatch.  Overall financing needs for next year are 2.4 billion
euros, which includes 1.7 billion euros of debt that needs to be
refinanced, the web-based newspaper reported. Domestic
organizations own about 61 percent of debt maturing in 2012,
Stockwatch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
