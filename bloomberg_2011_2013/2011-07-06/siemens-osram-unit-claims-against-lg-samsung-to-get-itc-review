Patent-infringement complaints filed
by  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s Osram unit against  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  and
Samsung Electronics Co. over light-emitting diode technology
will be reviewed by a U.S. trade agency.  The U.S. International Trade Commission today said it had
begun two investigations of complaints filed by Osram.  One  is
against both companies and the  other  against LG alone, according
to notices posted on the Washington-based agency’s website.  The patents involve technology used in LED displays for
light-conversion and electrical and thermal connections in
backlighting for TV sets and monitors, Munich-based Osram has
said. LEDs, which require less energy than traditional lighting,
are increasingly used in electronics, home lighting and
automobiles.  The ITC typically completes its investigations in about 15
to 18 months and has the power to block imports of products
found to infringe U.S. patents. In addition to LG and Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung, the complaints also name LG Innotek
Co., which is part-owned by Seoul-based LG.  The LG case is In the Matter of Certain Light-Emitting
Diodes and Products containing the Same, 337-784, and the case
against both companies is In the Matter of Certain Light-
Emitting Diodes, 337-785, both U.S. International Trade
