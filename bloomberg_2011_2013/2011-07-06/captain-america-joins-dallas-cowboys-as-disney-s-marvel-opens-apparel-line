Captain America is going into
business with America’s Team.  Marvel Entertainment LLC , a unit of  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , and
the Dallas Cowboys are developing a co-branded apparel line
featuring Captain America, Spider-Man,  Iron Man  and other
characters wearing Cowboys’ team colors and logos, the Cowboys
and Marvel said in a joint news release.  “We are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to
energize our fans, and what better way than to combine our brand
with some of the all-time great superheroes that everyone has
grown up with,” Jerry Jones Jr., chief sales and marketing
office for the Cowboys, said in a statement.  While the characters will be clad in the Cowboys’ colors
and logo, there are no plans to portray individual Dallas
players as superheroes, Brett Daniels, a spokesman for the team,
said in an e-mail.  Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  Captain America, one of more than 8,000 characters in
Disney’s library, is featured in a film that will be released
later this month. The Cowboys picked up the nickname “America’s
Team” during the 1970s, when they won two of their five Super
Bowl titles.  Earlier this year, Marvel offered similar apparel lines
with the  National Basketball Association ’s Los Angeles Lakers,
 New York  Knicks and Boston Celtics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
