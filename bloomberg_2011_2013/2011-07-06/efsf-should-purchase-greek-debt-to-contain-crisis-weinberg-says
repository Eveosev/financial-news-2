Euro-area leaders should use the
European Financial Stability Facility to buy Greek sovereign
debt to prevent the crisis from infecting the banking system,
according to  Carl Weinberg  of High Frequency Economics.  “The situation would be contained, the losses will be
contained, and we won’t run the risk of some uncontrollable
event that gets propagated through credit-default swaps,” said
Weinberg, founder of High Frequency in Valhalla, New York, in an
interview with  Kathleen Hays  on “The Hays Advantage” on
Bloomberg Radio.  The EFSF is overseen by euro-area nations and is designed
to support Europe’s monetary union. European Central Bank chiefs
have committed to ensure any Greek debt restructuring won’t be
deemed a  credit event  enabling buyers of credit-default swap
insurance contracts to seek compensation from swaps sellers.  Germany is reviving proposals for a swap involving a
voluntary exchange of debt against bonds with a longer maturity.
Greek banks are willing to roll over their  government bonds  as
part of a European Union rescue, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told Bloomberg Television yesterday.  “Greece will restructure, there’s no doubt about that,”
Weinberg said. “The idea is to establish a buyer of last
resort.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
