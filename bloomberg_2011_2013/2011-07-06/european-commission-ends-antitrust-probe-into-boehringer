European Union regulators dropped an
antitrust probe over Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s patents for
lung-disease drugs, as they reported fewer “problematic” pay-
to-delay deals between drugmakers.  The closely held German drugmaker agreed to remove
“blocking positions” that Spanish rival  Almirall SA (ALM)  complained
prevented sales of its treatments for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, the Brussels-based European Commission  said 
today in a statement.  Separately, the EU’s antitrust agency said pharmaceutical
companies last year struck only three “problematic” patent-
settlement deals that may be used to delay the sale of generic
versions of medicines.  Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generic producers might harm consumers. The EU in
January ordered several pharmaceutical firms, including  Bayer
AG (BAYN) , to submit details of patent-settlement deals from last year.  Boehringer, based in Ingelheim,  Germany , didn’t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment on today’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
