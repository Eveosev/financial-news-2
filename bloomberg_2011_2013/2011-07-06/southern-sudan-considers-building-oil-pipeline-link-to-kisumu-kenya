Southern Sudan  is discussing with oil
companies the possibility of building a link to an existing
pipeline to Kisumu, Kenya to export its crude, the region’s
minister of road and transport, Anthony Lino Makana, said today.  “To put in a pipeline is not a hard thing for us,” Makana
told reporters in Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan, which
will become the world’s newest independent nation on July 9.  Southern Sudan will assume control of about 75 percent of
Sudan’s current oil production of 490,000 barrels a day when it
secedes from Sudan. Most of Sudan’s crude is pumped by China
National Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and
India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  Negotiators from the Sudanese government and the Southern
Sudan administration agreed in May that the south will pay the
north for the use of pipelines and facilities at  Port Sudan  on
the  Red Sea  to export its crude. They have not yet reached
accord on the level of the fees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
