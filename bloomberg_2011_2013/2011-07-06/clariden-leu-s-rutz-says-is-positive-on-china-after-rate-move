Thomas Rutz, head of emerging markets
and currency at Clariden Leu AG, which manages $1.3 billion in
developing-market assets, comments on  China ’s decision to
increase  interest rates . He responded to questions via e-mail
from Zurich.  China raised benchmark interest rates for the third time
this year after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since
July 2008.  The one-year deposit rate will rise to 3.5 percent from
3.25 percent from tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on
its website today. The one-year lending rate will increase to
6.56 percent from 6.31 percent.  “So far the tightening has not been dramatic. It was more
a normalization process. Once the market calms down, as Chinese
officials have already stated in the press, they will stop it.
We are extremely positive on China. I am personally still very
positive on the yuan and still believe we can match my ambitious
target of 6.2 to 6 by year end.  ‘‘Inflation will probably not get out of control and we
generally believe that emerging market inflation indicators will
come lower in the third and fourth quarters. Some countries
within emerging space have already showed lower readings on the
three-month to three-month comparison.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
