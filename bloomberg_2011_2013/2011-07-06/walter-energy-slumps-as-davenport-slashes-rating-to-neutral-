Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a Southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, dropped after Davenport
& Co. reduced its rating to “neutral” from “buy.”  Walter dropped $4.44, or 3.7 percent, to $116.99 at 10:19
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 91 percent in the past year.  Davenport lowered the company’s rating, citing the
expectation for cheaper metallurgical coal prices later this
year, geological problems with some of its mines and the
resignation of Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder last week.  “Our downgrade is based on three factors: our view of the
commodity price, ongoing production issues and lack of stability
at the CEO position,” J. Christopher Haberlin, an analyst at
Davenport, wrote in a report today.  He said Calder’s departure effective July 31 may lead to
Walter being acquired through a hostile takeover from a global
steelmaker, an auction process by its board or active investors
encouraging its sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
