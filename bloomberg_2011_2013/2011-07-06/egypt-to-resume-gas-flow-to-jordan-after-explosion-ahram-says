Natural-gas supplies from  Egypt  to
Jordan will resume by the end of the week, following an
explosion at a pipeline in the Sinai peninsula that halted the
flow, the Cairo-based newspaper  al-Ahram  reported, citing
Egyptian Oil Minister Abdalla Ghorab.  The regionâ€™s governor blamed terrorists for the July 4
blast, which also cut supplies to  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
