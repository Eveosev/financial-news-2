Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, will pull a planned advertisement for
its Halifax unit in the News of the World as allegations mount
that the newspaper tapped the voicemails of murder victims and
their families and paid police officers for stories.  “In recognizing and responding to consumer reaction,
Halifax has canceled an advertisement in this Sunday’s News of
the World,” the London-based bank said in a statement today.
“This was a tactical decision in the short term whilst we
carefully consider our longer-term position and its
implications.” The decision was reported earlier by Sky News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
