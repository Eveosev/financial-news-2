Enernoc Inc. (ENOC) , a U.S. electricity
demand-reduction service, bought the largest provider of such
services in  Australia  and  New Zealand  for A$27.9 million ($29.9
million) in cash and stock.  The acquisition of Energy Response Pty will reduce earnings
this year and next, and boost profits starting in 2013, Boston-
based Enernoc said today in a statement. The purchase more than
doubles Enernoc’s portfolio in western Australia to 240
megawatts from 100 megawatts and lets the company expand into
eastern Australia and New Zealand.  Enernoc rose 41 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $16.22 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has declined 32 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
