Middle East crude for sale to Asia
rose against their benchmarks as producers reduced their
official prices, prompting expectations by refiners that demand
may increase as costs decline.  Abu Dhabi ’s Murban for August loading climbed 25 cents to a
discount of 8 cents a barrel below its official selling price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Land remained at
a discount of 41 cents, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest crude exporter,
cut official selling prices for August shipments of light crudes
to customers in Asia and raised prices for medium and heavy
grades. The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , reduced
the formula price for Arab Super Light crude the most, by $1 a
barrel to $3.85 above the benchmark, the company said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement.  Aramco reduced the price for Arab Extra Light shipped to
 Asia  by 50 cents a barrel to $2.95 above the average of the Oman
and Dubai grades, the Gulf benchmarks used by traders in Asia.
It lowered the Arab Light price by 10 cents to a premium of
$1.35 above the Oman-Dubai average.  Abu Dhabi National reduced the June official selling price
of its flagship Murban grade by 1.3 percent to $112.15 a barrel,
it said yesterday in an e-mail to refiners. That leaves the
grade at a premium of $4.38 to benchmark Dubai, less than last
month’s $5.22 difference.  Oman futures for September delivery fell 7 cents to $107.60
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:02 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,485 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.14 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $1.15, or 1.1
percent, to $106.78 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September rose 1.1 percent to $106.52. Murban
climbed 1.3 percent to $110.82.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, widened 5
cents to $5.85 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September fell 2 cents to $5.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
