Joy Global Inc. (JOYG) , the maker of mining
equipment used to extract coal and copper, may buy additional
business units after purchasing LeTourneau Technologies Inc.
last month, an analyst said.  Joy Global  bought LeTourneau from Rowan Companies Inc. for
$1.1 billion in cash in June to add large-capacity wheel loaders
for surface mines, jack-up rigs and other equipment for oil and
natural-gas drilling.  The LeTourneau purchase could add 50 cents a share for Joy
Global in the next fiscal year, and the company may repay most
of the $500 million  term loan  used to fund the deal by the end
of December 2012, Robert F. McCarthy, a Chicago-based analyst
for Robert W. Baird & Co. who has an “outperform” rating on
the shares and doesn’t own any, said in a note to clients today.  “Joy’s free cash flow through calendar year 2012 appears
ample enough to effectively retire acquisition-related debt,
facilitating a potentially rapid resumption of acquisition
activity,” McCarthy said. “Management is still interested in
further expanding its mining product lines, particularly into
hydraulic mining shovels and into underground hard-rock
mining.”  The company, based in  Milwaukee , plans to fill other gaps
in its product portfolio by developing technology in-house or
buying producers of equipment including hard-rock machinery,
Chief Executive Officer Mike Sutherlin said in a conference call
with analysts on June 2.  Joy Global rose 2 cents to $96.72 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The share have risen 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
