Britain’s private banks have 17
percent of clients’ cash in hedge funds, private equity,
commodities and real estate, up from 7 percent at the end of
2009, the Financial Times reported, citing a study by Scorpio
Partnership, a firm of wealth-management consultants.  This indicates that wealth managers are overcoming the
aversion to so-called alternative assets that resulted from the
financial crisis and are ready to contemplate more risk, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
