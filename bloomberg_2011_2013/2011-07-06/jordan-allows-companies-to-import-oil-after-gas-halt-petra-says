Jordan’s government allowed
manufacturers to import heavy fuels after natural gas shipments
from  Egypt  were disrupted, the official  Petra  news agency said.  Industries can import the fuels, which may include fuel oil
and diesel, after obtaining permission from the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources, according to the agency. The move,
adopted in a Cabinet decision yesterday, is meant to increase
the kingdom’s strategic storage and help industries decrease
production costs and boost output, it said.  The move came two days after gas supplies to Jordan and
 Israel  were disrupted for the third time in five months due to
sabotage attack on the pipeline network in Egypt’s Sinai region.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports almost all of its energy needs and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
