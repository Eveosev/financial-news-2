The Philippine peso led gains among
Asian currencies on speculation global funds will pump more
funds into the region to profit from rising interest rates and
the world’s fastest economic growth.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index was within 0.1
percent of a 14-year high after  China , India,  South Korea ,
 Indonesia ,  Taiwan , Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines all
raised borrowing costs this year to tame inflation, widening the
gap with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s near-zero benchmark rate.
Reports yesterday showed that consumer-price gains quickened in
Taiwan and the Philippines, bolstering the case for further
monetary tightening.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 42.90 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close in Manila, touching a two-month high of 42.825
earlier, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. South Korea’s won rose
0.3 percent to 1,063.45, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The prospect of rate increases is definitely supportive
for regional currencies,” said Kenichiro Ikezawa, a fund
manager at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “Compared with
other emerging markets,  Asia  looks to be the most attractive
because of its economic fundamentals.”  Developing economies in Asia will expand 8.4 percent in
2011, outpacing growth of 2.5 percent in the U.S. and 2 percent
in the euro region, according to International Monetary Fund
estimates released last month. Global funds bought $503 million
more Korean and Thai shares than they sold yesterday, exchange
data show.  Yield Gap  Benchmark interest rates of 7.5 percent in India and 6.75
percent in Indonesia compare with a maximum 0.25 percent in the
U.S. and  Japan . Malaysia’s central bank will boost its policy
rate tomorrow by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 percent,
according to 10 of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Five
forecast no change.  Malaysia ’s consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in May from a
year earlier, the most since March 2009, a government report
showed last month. Prices in the Philippines increased 5.2
percent in June and those in Taiwan climbed 1.9 percent.  The Philippine peso appreciated for a seventh day, its
longest winning streak since January, after Fitch Ratings
forecast the economy will expand as much as 6 percent this year
and next. Growth was 4.9 percent in the first quarter, the
weakest pace since the final three months of 2009.  “The Fitch comments are validating the improved macro
fundamental story that’s been making the rounds the past few
weeks,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
 Singapore .  Elsewhere, the Thai baht, the Singapore dollar and  India ’s
rupee were all little changed at 30.49 per dollar, S$1.2279 and
44.4363, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Indonesia’s rupiah and Malaysia’s ringgit slid 0.1 percent to
8,541 and 3.0090, respectively. Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.2
percent to 28.851 and China’s yuan was little changed at 6.4670.  To contact the reporter on this story:
