(Corrects to say HSBC to lower rate in third paragraph.)  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to raise the
interest rate for mortgages linked to the  Hong Kong  interbank
offered rate on July 7.  The lender will increase the Hibor-linked mortgage rate to
1.8 percentage point to 2.3 percentage points over Hibor, from
1.5 percentage point to 2 percentage points over Hibor, HSBC
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The prime-linked mortgage rate will be lowered to prime
rate minus 2.7 percentage points, it said. That compares with
prime rate minus 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage point
earlier, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
