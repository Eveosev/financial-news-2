Darío Leonardo Conca, the Argentine
named best soccer player in Brazil for two consecutive years,
joined  China ’s Guangzhou Evergrande for a record $10 million,
the club said.  The 28-year-old midfielder signed a 3 1/2-year contract
after the team owned by developer  Evergrande Real Estate Group
Ltd. (3333)  agreed to pay Brazilian champion Fluminense the Chinese
record fee. The team didn’t disclose salary details.  Conca, who’s never played outside of  South America , will be
paid $7 million a year, making him the 56th best-paid player in
the sport, Chinese newspaper Titan Sports reported today.  “The first arrival of a world-class player will help to
improve the overall image of Chinese football, to attract more
top players and to bring a high-level competitive performance to
the fans,” Evergrande said in the statement.  Soccer in China has been marred by corruption scandals,
match-fixing, and violence on and off the pitch in recent years
and disaffected fans turned away from the game. Soccer rivals
basketball for viewers in the world’s most-populous country.  In 2009, Vice President Xi Jinping said during a visit to
 Germany  that he hoped soccer would continue to develop in China,
prompting renewed government interest in the sport.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
