Euro-region economic growth may have
weakened in the second quarter as global demand faltered, three
European economic research institutes said.  Gross domestic product in the 17-member euro area probably
rose 0.3 percent in the three months through June and may
increase 0.4 percent in both the third and fourth quarters, the
Munich-based Ifo institute, Insee in Paris and  Rome â€™s Istat said
in a joint statement sent by e-mail today. Growth in the region
will average 2 percent in 2011, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
