Ecuadorean inflation accelerated the
most in 16 months in June on higher clothing and shoe costs.  Consumer prices last month rose 4.28 percent from a year
earlier and 0.04 percent from May, the National Statistics and
Census Institute said today in a report on its website. Producer
prices rose 0.24 percent in June and 5 percent from a year
earlier.  Government spending  and increased credit for new homes is
boosting demand for labor and consumer goods in the Andean
country, central bank President  Diego Borja  said July 4.  Consumer prices rose the fastest in Guayaquil, the nation’s
largest city, jumping 0.61 percent from the previous month,
while prices fell 0.07 percent in the nation’s capital,  Quito ,
the statistics agency said. Ecuador, the smallest member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes
domestic fuel and natural gas prices, helping offset this year’s
5.5 percent increase in the price of U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude oil.  According to the  Finance Ministry ’s 2011 budget, Ecuador
will have inflation of 3.69 percent this year. Ecuador’s
Economic Policy Ministry said July 1 it raised its 2011 economic
growth forecast to 5.24 percent and said inflation is expected
to quicken to 4.13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
