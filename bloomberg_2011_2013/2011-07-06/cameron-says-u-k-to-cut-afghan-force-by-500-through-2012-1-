U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said Britain will withdraw 500 troops from  Afghanistan  by the
end of 2012, reducing the number of soldiers to 9,000.  “We are entering a new phase in which the Afghan forces
will do more of the fighting and patrolling and our forces the
mentoring and training,” Cameron told lawmakers in the House of
Commons in London today. “These reductions reflect the progress
that is being made in building up the  Afghan National Security
Forces  -- indeed it is worth noting that for every U.S. soldier
who leaves as the surge is removed, two Afghans will take their
place.”  Cameron, who returned yesterday from a trip to Afghanistan,
has pledged to have all U.K. combat troops out by 2015. His
decision followed President  Barack Obama ’s announcement June 22
to withdraw 33,000 U.S. soldiers by the end of next year. Afghan
forces are due to assume the lead in securing the country by the
end of 2014, Cameron said.  Britain is in Afghanistan to defend the security of the
U.K. by helping the Afghan army and police take control, not to
build a “perfect democracy,” Cameron said. Human Rights will
“take their place” behind that priority, he said.  “Having taken such a huge share of the burden and having
performed so magnificently for a decade now, the country needs
to know that there is an end point to the level of our current
commitment and to our combat operations,” Cameron told
lawmakers. “This decision is not only right for Britain, it is
right for Afghanistan too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
