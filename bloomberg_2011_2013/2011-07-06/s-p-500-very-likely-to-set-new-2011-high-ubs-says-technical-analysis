The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
“very likely” to set a new high for the year as the rally in
U.S. stocks continues into late July or early August, according
to technical analysts at  UBS AG. (UBSN)   “Stay long the U.S. market!” Michael Riesner and Marc Muller in Zurich wrote in a note dated yesterday. “We think it
is very likely to see a break of the 1,370 early May reaction
high,” they wrote, citing “the very good market breadth, the
favorable setup in key sectors and the impulsive structure of
the rally.”  The  S&P 500  has surged 5.5 percent since June 24 as  Greece 
took action to avoid a default, Nike Inc.’s earnings topped
analyst estimates and U.S. manufacturing growth rebounded. All
but 17 stocks in the benchmark gauge advanced on July 1 as the
measure completed the biggest weekly gain in almost two years.
Indexes of transport and consumer discretionary shares climbed
to records, the analysts wrote.  If the S&P 500 breaks the May 2 intraday high of 1,370, the
next resistance area would be at 1,400 to 1,420, the analysts
wrote. That’s more than 4 percent higher than yesterday’s
closing level of 1,337.88.  The analysts said they still expect stocks to decline in
the first half of 2012 because the  U.S. presidential election 
may help the dollar and hurt riskier assets. A rally this month
or early next month is an opportunity to sell shares, UBS said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
