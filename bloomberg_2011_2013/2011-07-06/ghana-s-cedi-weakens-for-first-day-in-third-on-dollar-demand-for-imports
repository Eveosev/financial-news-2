Ghana ’s cedi weakened for the first
time in three days against the dollar as traders bought the U.S.
currency to import confectionery, food and clothing.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.5175 per dollar by 12:07 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to Bloomberg data.  “The cedi might close weaker, considering the demand
waiting for execution on the market,” Biggles Amponsah, a
currency trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said in a
telephone interview today. Demand is coming “from those who buy
and sell  consumer goods .”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
