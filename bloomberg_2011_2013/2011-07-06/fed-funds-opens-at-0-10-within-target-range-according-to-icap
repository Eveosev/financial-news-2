Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.10 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.05 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.10 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an
e-mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.08 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
January 2014 to June 2015. The purchases are part of the Fed’s
policy to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets
on its balance sheet to cap borrowing costs.  The central bank plans to purchase from $2.5 billion to
$3.5 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
