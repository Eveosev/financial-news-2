The U.S. nuclear-power industry is
considering a $1 billion plan that would create regional centers
to store equipment for delivery to reactors within 24 hours of
an emergency.  The centers would be stocked with portable pumps and
generators, radiation-monitoring equipment, anti-contamination
clothing, spare batteries and flashlights, Adrian Heymer,
director of strategic programs at the  Nuclear Energy Institute ,
a Washington-based industry group, said today in an interview.
The plan, which may also store equipment and station personnel
at  power plants , might cost the industry an average of $8
million to $10 million for each of the 104 commercial U.S.
reactors over the next 10 years, Heymer said.  The U.S. nuclear industry is developing plans as the
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission  prepares to release on July 19 a
review of reactor safety after  Japan ’s March disaster. A 9-
magnitude earthquake and a tsunami knocked out back-up power,
triggered explosions and led to radiation leaks at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, about 135 miles
(217 kilometers) north of Tokyo, in the worst nuclear disaster
since Chernobyl in 1986.  Regional centers, on-site equipment and a “pre-arranged
response plan” to deploy manufacturers and engineers quickly
would provide support for reactors “should we have such an
event here in the U.S. or even overseas,” Heymer said.  “Those are some of the things that we’re looking at that
we are probably going to put in place” in an emergency
exercise, he said.  Industry  Task Force   The  Institute of Nuclear Power Operations , the  Electric
Power Research Institute  and the Nuclear Energy Institute are
part of a task force formed in June to consider safety measures
at U.S. nuclear plants after the Japan disaster. The regional
centers are one option being considered, Heymer said.  “I think there would be a number of areas in the country
where the companies would share” regional centers, he said.
 Exelon Corp. (EXC)  of Chicago, owner of the largest number of U.S.
reactors, may choose to share a facility with Xcel Energy of
Minneapolis, American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio, or
other power companies with reactors in the Midwest, Heymer said.  ‘Bad Press’  The industry is “just responding to a lot of recent bad
press,”  Tyson Slocum , energy program director at  Public
Citizen , a Washington-based consumer advocacy group, said in an
interview.  Representative  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat, has
faulted U.S. oversight of reactor safety. Senators  Barbara Boxer 
and  Dianne Feinstein , both California Democrats, have called on
the NRC to examine nuclear power plants located in areas of
seismic activity. In June, rising waters of the Missouri River
in Nebraska  threatened  to breach flood walls protecting two
nuclear plants.  The industry plan is a “good initiative, we just have to
be sure that it’s well-executed,” Slocum said. Any emergency-
response plan will need to be accompanied by drills to prepare
workers who are the first to respond, according to Slocum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
