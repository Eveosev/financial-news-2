Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , an
Egyptian luxury-property developer, dropped the most in a week
as the public prosecutor plans to appeal the chairman’s
acquittal and  Al Mal  reported the government may repossess land.  The shares slumped 2.8 percent, the most since June 29, to
2.44 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That gave
the company a market value of 2.56 billion pounds ($430
million). The benchmark EGX30 Index dropped 2.2 percent.  The nation’s public prosecutor plans to contest a court
ruling yesterday that acquitted Yasseen Mansour of charges of
making illegal profits and facilitating profiteering for others,
according to a faxed statement yesterday.  The housing ministry may take back 210 feddans (882,000
square-meters) of a 310-feddan plot sold to  Palm Hills  because
the land hasn’t been developed,  Al Mal  reported today, citing a
ministry official it didn’t identify. Palm Hills said it didn’t
receive a notice from the government on the land withdrawal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
