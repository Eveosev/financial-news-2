The Australian dollar rose, ending
two days of declines against the U.S. currency, before a

nation added the most jobs in three months. The so-called Aussie
was at $1.0721 at 12:34 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0693 yesterday in
 New York .  New Zealand â€™s dollar bought 82.93 U.S. cents from
82.51 cents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
