Corn farmers in  Brazil , the world’s
third-largest producer, will harvest more of the crop than
previously forecast because of better yields and an increase in
the planted area.  Brazil will produce 57.1 million metric tons this year,
more than a June 8 estimate of 56.7 million tons, the
 Agriculture Ministry ’s  Conab  crop-forecasting agency said in an
e-mailed statement today. Last year, farmers produced 56 million
tons of the commodity.  The area planted with corn crops rose to 13.6 million
hectares (33.6 million acres) from 13.4 million hectares in the
previous estimate. It’s still not possible to assess potential
damage to the crop caused by a late June frost in some areas,
Conab said.  Soybean farmers in Brazil, the world’s second-largest
producer after the U.S., will harvest a record 75.04 million
tons of the oilseed this year, little changed from the previous
forecast of 74.99 million tons, Conab said. Brazil produced 68.7
million tons of soybeans last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
