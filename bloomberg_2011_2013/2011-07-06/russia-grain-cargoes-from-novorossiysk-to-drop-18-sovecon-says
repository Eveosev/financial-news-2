Grain exports handled by  Russia ’s
southern Black Sea port of Novorossiysk will decline 18 percent
this month from a year earlier to more than 600,000 metric tons,
SovEcon  said .  The port handled 739,000 tons of grain last July, the
Moscow-based researcher said today on its website. Shipments
were 493,000 tons in the same period in 2009.  The Egyptian government dropped Russia from its list of
approved source countries after the government in Moscow barred
all cereal exports last August as drought seared fields. The ban
expired July 1. Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat importer, will
wait until Russia starts harvesting its crop in August before
deciding whether to resume shipments, Nomani Nomani, vice
chairman of  Egypt ’s state wheat buyer, said last month.  The largest shippers this month will be International Grain
Co., a Russian unit of Glencore International AG, and state
trader United Grain Co., which are expected to export 172,000
tons and 150,000 tons respectively, SovEcon said, citing data
from shipping agent TransAgent.  The companies will ship grain from the last harvest,
SovEcon said. Eight vessels are scheduled to load grain in the
port this month, heading mostly for  Sudan  and to fulfill
commercial contracts in Egypt, the port said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
