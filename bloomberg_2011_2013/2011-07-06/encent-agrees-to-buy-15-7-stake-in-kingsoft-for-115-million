Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s
biggest Internet company, agreed to buy a 15.7 percent stake in
Kingsoft Corp. for HK$892 million ($115 million) to expand in
computer-security services.  Tencent will buy 111.5 million shares from Kingsoft Chief
Executive Officer Kau Pak Kwan and 66.9 million shares from non-
Executive Director Cheung Shuen Lung, Kingsoft said in a filing
yesterday. The deal is scheduled to be completed today, it said.  The purchase builds on Tencent’s leadership in China’s
online-games and instant-messaging markets as the Shenzhen-based
company boosts spending on services including computer security
and electronic commerce. Kingsoft and Tencent together account
for more than 20 percent of the local market for security
software, second only to Qihoo 360 Technology Co., according to
Morgan Stanley.  “Online security has become more important in  China ,”
Morgan Stanley analysts including Richard Ji wrote in a report
yesterday. The Kingsoft deal is “positive” for Tencent,
according to the report.  Shares Climb  Kingsoft rose 9 percent to HK$5.45 at the 4 p.m. close in
 Hong Kong  trading, the highest closing price since May 2010,
after being halted yesterday pending the announcement. The
shares earlier surged as much as 19 percent.  Tencent rose 0.1 percent to HK$214.80 and has gained 27
percent this year, trailing Chinese Internet stocks including
Baidu Inc. and Sina Corp.  The company will double to 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion)
the size of a fund it set up this year to invest in technology
developers, Chief Executive Officer Ma Huateng said last month.
The company purchased a 16 percent stake in  Elong Inc. (LONG)  in May to
expand in online travel, after buying control of U.S.-based Riot
Games Inc. in February.  Tencent will target growth in  Internet security , e-
commerce,  search engines  and social media this year, Ma said in
March.  Kingsoft, based in Beijing, offers products including
office software, Internet security and online games, and has
research centers in cities including Beijing, Zhuhai, and
Chengdu, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
