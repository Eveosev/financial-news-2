Gasoil barge premiums declined after
rising yesterday to the highest since February 2010. BP Plc sold
two barges of  jet fuel  to Vitol Group.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $998 to $1,010 a metric ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board and Platts pricing window, which ends at
4:30 p.m. London time. That’s the highest in three weeks and
compares with transactions at $992 to $1,002 yesterday.  Vitol, BP, Morgan Stanley, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Trafigura Beheer BV bought the motor fuel. Vendors included
Chevron Corp., Gunvor International BV and Statoil ASA, while
Trafigura and Shell also sold earlier in the session. The trades
are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished automotive fuel, and are typically for lots of 1,000
tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , narrowed for
the second day to $7.18 a barrel from $7.33 the previous
session, according to London-based broker PVM Oil Associates
Ltd. Brent for August delivery was 0.5 percent lower at $113.08
a barrel on the ICE exchange as of 5:12 p.m. London time.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent narrowed to $6.59 a barrel from
$7.02 yesterday, according to PVM data. That’s the smallest gap
since May 31, when the spread was $5.98.  Middle Distillates  Jet-fuel barges traded at $1,024 a ton, according to the
Platts survey. That’s within yesterday’s range of $1,018 to
$1,027 a ton. BP sold two consignments to Vitol.  An ultra-low-sulfur diesel barge traded at $31 a ton more
than July gasoil futures on  London ’s ICE exchange, little
changed from yesterday. Statoil sold to BP.  Gasoil for July declined 0.2 percent to $926.75 a ton on
London’s ICE exchange. The August contract was 0.2 percent lower
at $930.25. The fuel’s crack versus Brent was $11.77 at 4:30
p.m. London time versus $11.96 yesterday, ICE data showed.  Barges of heating fuel declined, trading at parity to July
gasoil and at a 50-cent discount, the survey showed. Shell sold
to Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Glencore International Plc. The
product yesterday rose to a $1 premium against the ICE contract,
the highest since February 2010, according to data from Platts.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $624 to $626.50 a
ton, higher than $621.50 to $624 yesterday, the Platts survey
showed. The low-sulfur grade changed hands at $681.50 to $682.50
a ton. That compares with $682 to $682.50 the previous session.  Refinery News  OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, will keep
its Odessa refinery in Ukraine shut until it can gain crude oil
supplies at the price it seeks, Dmitry Dolgov, a company
spokesman, said by telephone from Moscow today.  Lukoil brought forward planned maintenance at the 56,000-
barrel-a-day refinery to October from the first quarter of 2011
because of weak market conditions. The plant has yet to reopen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
