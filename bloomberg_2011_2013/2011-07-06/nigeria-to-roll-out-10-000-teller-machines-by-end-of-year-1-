Nigeria  plans to roll out 40,000
point-of-sale terminals and 10,000 automatic teller machines by
the end of the year as part of plans to reduce the cost of
banking, the central bank said.  The West African nation’s banking industry will raise the
number of ATMs to 75,000 by December 2015, the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  said in a statement on its website today.  The bank is pushing to reduce the financial system’s
reliance on cash withdrawals at banks as it tries to cut costs
in the industry. From June 1, 2012, cash withdrawals above
150,000 naira for individuals and 1 million naira for companies
will attract a charge, the central bank said.  The cost of so-called cash management to  Nigeria ’s
financial system will rise to 192 billion naira next year from
114.5 billion naira in 2009 because of its reliance on cash
withdrawals, the bank estimated. Much of that expense is passed
on to customers as bank charges and higher lending rates, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
