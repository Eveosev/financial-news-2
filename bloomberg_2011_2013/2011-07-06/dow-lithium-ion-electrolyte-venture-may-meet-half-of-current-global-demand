Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, said it formed a joint venture that will produce
enough electrolytes used in  lithium-ion batteries  to meet about
half of current demand.  Advanced Electrolyte Technologies, a 50-50 venture with
Japanâ€™s Ube Industries Ltd., will next year open a factory in
Midland, Michigan, where Dow is based, the companies said today
in a statement. The plant will produce 5,000 tons to 10,000 tons
a year of formulated electrolytes, the conductive material in
advanced batteries, for a global market estimated at 15,000 to
20,000 tons, said  Gregory Baldwin , a Dow spokesman.  Lithium-ion battery demand will triple by 2020 to $74
billion on rising demand from electric-vehicle makers and
utilities, Baldwin said. The market for electrolytes will expand
to $1.2 billion in that period, he said. The venture may build
plants of a similar size in Europe and  China  in the next five
years, Baldwin said.  Dow already makes materials for battery separators, anodes
and cathodes. Its Dow Kokam venture in Midland broke ground on a
lithium-ion battery plant last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
