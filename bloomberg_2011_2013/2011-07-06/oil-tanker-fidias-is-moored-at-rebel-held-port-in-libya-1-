Fidias, an oil products tanker, is
moored at the rebel-held port of Benghazi in eastern  Libya , a
sign that enemies of  Muammar Qaddafi  seeking to end his four-
decade rule are still getting fuel deliveries by sea.  The vessel, which has a transportation capacity of 51,277
deadweight tons, arrived late yesterday, according to AISLive
Ltd. ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rebels received four gasoline cargoes and four diesel
deliveries by sea in May while Qaddafi-held ports got none,
according to Bloomberg surveys of fuel traders and shipbrokers.  A typical gasoline load holds enough fuel to fill about
650,000 cars while a single diesel shipment could fill all
Qaddafiâ€™s tanks 18 times over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
