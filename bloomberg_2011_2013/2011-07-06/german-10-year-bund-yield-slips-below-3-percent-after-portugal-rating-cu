Portugal ’s bonds plunged after
Moody’s Investors Service cut its  credit rating , sending yields
to records and leading losses across Europe’s most indebted
nations on concern the region’s debt crisis is spreading.  Irish securities slumped, Spanish bonds fell for a third
straight day and the 10-year Italian yield soared to the highest
since November 2008 as Germany revived its proposal for a Greek
bond swap involving private investors. German two-year notes
rose the most in almost two weeks as demand rose at a sale of
3.38 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of the securities. Portugal
may not be able to fund itself from financial markets without
more international support, Moody’s said.  “Portugal is under considerable pressure as it leads
another peripheral leg down,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International.
“Underpinning this move is arguably not so much the Moody’s
downgrade, but the comments accompanying this action,
specifically the note that a further bailout and some form of
private-sector support are increasingly likely.”  The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds rose 205 basis points
to a record 13.07 percent as of 4:52 p.m. in London after
touching a record 13.09 percent. The 3.85 percent securities
maturing in April 2021 fell 7.63, or 76.30 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 50.695. The additional yield investors demand to
hold the bonds instead of benchmark German bunds reached a
record 1,014 basis points.  Two-year Portuguese yields surged 380 basis points to 16.75
percent. The nation’s borrowing costs increased at an auction of
848 million euros of three-month bills today, rising to an
average 4.926 percent from 4.863 percent at a sale on June 15.  Index Removal Threat  The cost of insuring against default on Portuguese
sovereign debt surged 165 basis points to a record 936 basis
points, according to CMA prices for credit-default swaps.  Moody’s cut the long-term government bond rating for
Portugal to Ba2, or junk, from Baa1, and said the outlook is
negative. Discussions to involve private investors in a new
rescue plan for  Greece  make it more likely that the European
Union will require the same pre-conditions in the case of
Portugal, Moody’s said in a statement.  Portugal’s government bonds will be excluded from Markit
iBoxx Euro Area Benchmark indexes at the end of the month, the
company said today on its website.  Greek 10-year yields jumped 272 basis points last June as
the nation’s debt was ousted from indexes run by Citigroup Inc.,
Barclays Plc and the Markit iBoxx Euro Sovereign Index.  Ireland may also face an “imminent” downgrade, NCB
Stockbrokers wrote in a report today. The two-year Irish yield
surged 242 basis points to 15.30 percent.  Greek Rollover Plan  A new proposal on investor participation in a Greek aid
plan was to be discussed in Paris today, the Financial Times
said, citing two people involved in the talks.  Germany  planned
to revive a proposal for a bond swap to lengthen Greek bond
maturities, while the head of the biggest group of international
financial companies recommended buybacks of outstanding Greek
securities. The competing ideas underscore how investors and
government officials are struggling to devise a role for
creditors in a bailout of Greece without triggering a default.  The yield on 10-year Italian securities advanced 12 basis
points to 5.12 percent, pushing the difference in yield, or
spread, to similar-maturity German debt 21 basis points wider to
219 basis points. Spanish 10-year yields rose 12 basis points to
5.61 percent, increasing the spread over bunds to 269 basis
points.  The yield on Greek two-year bonds increased 153 basis
points to 28.44 percent.  CDS Index  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 21 basis points to 250. An increase signals
deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  “The downgrade creates bad sentiment generally,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital  in
London. “There are signs it’s infecting people across the
market. The flight-to-quality bid is pretty strong.”  Ten-year bund yields fell seven basis points to 2.93
percent. Two-year German note yields also slid, falling six
basis points, to 1.58 percent. Demand at today’s sale of two-
year notes was 2.3 times the amount sold, the highest so-called
bid-to-cover ratio since June 2010.  It was a “stellar” auction,  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income analyst at WestLB AG in  London , said by e-mail. “The
safe-haven bid is in full swing.”  The front German bund futures contract rose 0.7 percent to
126.48. German securities extended their advance as  China  raised
benchmark  interest rates  for the third time this year.  German bonds returned 0.1 percent this year, compared with
2.6 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 2.1 percent for U.K. gilts,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds handed
investors a loss of 15 percent, while Portuguese securities lost
19 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
