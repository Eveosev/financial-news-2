OAO  Protek (PRTK)  climbed the most in almost
two months after the Russian pharmaceuticals company said it
acquired OOO AnviLab in a deal worth $60 million that gives it
access to more than 40 new trademarks and 13 patents.  The shares traded up 6.6 percent at 37.17 rubles by 2:19
p.m. in Moscow, their strongest intraday advance since May 11.  The deal may have “a positive impact” on Protek’s share
price as it spurs sales and lifts margins, Tatiana Bobrovskaya,
an equity analyst at Metropol IFC, said in an e-mailed report
today.  AnviLab holds the rights to brands including Antigrippin-
maximum, Gepaguard and Influnet, according to a  statement  today
on Protek’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
