Bolivia  will maintain its inflation
target of 6 percent for 2011, Finance Minister Luis Arce said
today in a press conference.  In February,  Bolivia’s central bank  said it will target
inflation of about 6 percent for this year and economic growth
of 5 percent.  “The  International Monetary Fund  has given its perspective
on inflation that will occur in Bolivia and they talk of 7.9
percent, which is close to our target,” Arce told reporters,
citing a  report  by the lender dated June 2.  Global food and fuel prices have dropped over past months,
helping make the 6 percent target reachable, Arce said.  Bolivia has struggled with rising food prices over the past
year that sparked protests around the country. In December,
consumer prices rose 1.76 percent from November, the biggest
monthly increase since May 2008, on a government plan to end gas
subsidies. The government later reinstated the subsidies.  Inflation has  slowed  in recent months, with prices rising
0.14 percent in June from May and 11.28 percent from a year
earlier. Prices have climbed 4.27 percent so far this year.  Inflation in 2010 of 7.18 percent exceeded central bank
forecasts that prices would rise 3 percent to 5 percent,
compared with a 0.26 percent increase in 2009.  Bolivia has revalued its currency several times over the
past eight months from a selling price of 7.07 bolivianos per
dollar in November to 6.98 as of July 6.
