The customs union joining Russia,
Belarus and  Kazakhstan  fixed the import  duty  on raw sugar at
$140 a metric ton for August.  The duty is based on the average price for the sweetener of
26.07 cents a pound in June in  New York  trading, the Customs
Union Commission  said  on its website today. The unionâ€™s three
members tax raw-sugar imports based on monthly prices in New
York, with a one-month lag before changes take effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
