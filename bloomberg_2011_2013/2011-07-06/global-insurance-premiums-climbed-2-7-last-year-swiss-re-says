Global insurance premium growth
should continue this year after rising 2.7 percent in 2010 as
economies rebounded, according to Swiss Re, the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer.  Premiums increased to $4.34 trillion last year, the Zurich-
based reinsurer said today in its latest  Sigma study . Global
life premiums rose 3.2 percent to $2.52 trillion, driven by
growth in Asia and  Brazil , while non-life premiums grew by 2.1
percent to $1.82 trillion.  Life and non-life insurance premiums contracted in real
terms in 2008 and 2009 for the first time since 1980, according
to the world’s second-biggest reinsurer. The recovery in the
global economy that began in 2009 is supporting the rebound in
premiums, Swiss Re said.  “The dominating picture is that the industry is on the way
back to the long-term growth trend,” said Daniel Staib, a
senior economist at the reinsurer and one of the authors of the
study. Life premiums will continue to rise and “in non-life,
the trend is toward higher premium growth in 2011.”  General insurance prices may increase as capital reserves
decline and rising interest rates reduce the value of bond
portfolios, Swiss Re said.  Swiss Re expects insurers’ combined ratios -- spending on
claims and costs as a percentage of premiums -- to continue to
deteriorate this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
