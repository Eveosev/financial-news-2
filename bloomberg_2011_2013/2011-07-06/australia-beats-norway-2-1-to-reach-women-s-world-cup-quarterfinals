Australia  beat Norway 2-1 to reach
the quarterfinals of soccer’s Women’s  World Cup  in Germany.  Elise Thorsnes gave Norway the lead in the Group D game in
Leverkusen. Kyah Simon followed by scoring twice for Australia.  Australia advances along with group winner Brazil, which
stayed perfect with a third straight win, 3-0 over Equatorial
Guinea in Frankfurt. The African team and 1995 champion Norway
exit the competition.  Norway needed to beat Australia to take the last berth and
extend its record of having advanced from the group stage at
every edition of the tournament. Australia required only a draw
to advance.  Erika opened the scoring for Brazil and Cristiane got two
goals, the final one from a penalty kick.  Brazil  finished with nine points, Australia six, Norway
three and Equatorial Guinea none.  Germany, seeking a third straight World Cup, France,
England, Japan, the U.S. and Sweden have also reached the
quarterfinals.  Later today, the U.S. and Sweden meet in Wolfsburg to
decide who wins Group C. Both have six points in two games.
 North Korea  and Colombia, who play in Bochum, have no points and
won’t advance.  The top two teams from each group of four reach the
quarterfinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
