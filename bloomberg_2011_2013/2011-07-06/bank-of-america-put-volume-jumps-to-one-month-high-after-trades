Put trading on  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
the largest  U.S. bank  by assets, jumped to a one-month high
after block trades of August contracts with a strike price 6.9
percent below today’s close.  Investors bought about 70,000 August $10 puts, including a
block of 40,000, according to a report from strategists at
Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP. That block trade was the
second-biggest of the day, followed by a 38,000-contract
transaction involving August $10 puts, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Bank of America fell 2.4 percent to $10.74 at 4
p.m. in  New York , extending its 2011 loss to 19 percent.  “This investor is likely protecting long stock due to
increased concern about downside ahead of August expiration,”
the Susquehanna strategists wrote in today’s note.  Almost 281,000 puts to sell the shares of the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based lender changed hands, 2.2 times the four-
week average and 1.6 times the number of calls to buy. August
$10 puts were the most-active contracts and accounted for 36
percent of all put volume.  Puts give the right to sell 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Investors use
options to guard against fluctuations in the price of securities
they own, speculate on share-price moves or bet that volatility,
or stock swings, will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
