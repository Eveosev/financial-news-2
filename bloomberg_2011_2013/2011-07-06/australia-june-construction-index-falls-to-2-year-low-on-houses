Australia ’s building industry shrank
in June for a 13th straight month as consumer caution and
concern about higher borrowing costs weighed on house
construction, a private survey showed.  The construction performance index dropped 3.8 points to
35.8 last month, the lowest level since March 2009, according to
a survey by the Australian Industry Group and the Housing
Industry Association released in Sydney today. A reading below
50 indicates the industry is contracting.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens held the
benchmark interest rate at 4.75 percent this week, after
boosting it seven times from October 2009 to November. A report
last month showed Australia’s household savings rate rose to
11.5 percent in the first quarter, the highest level since 2009
as consumers exhibit greater restraint.  Residential construction is still suffering from “consumer
caution and ongoing fears of further interest-rate rises,” said
Peter Burn, director of public policy at the Australian Industry
Group. “The commercial construction sub-sector marked a full
year of contraction in June with private-sector demand failing
to offset the fall in public sector projects related to the
unwinding of stimulus measures.”  The government has been scaling back fiscal stimulus
measures, and Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in May it will end 23
years of spending growth to help return to a  budget surplus .  A gauge of housing plunged 5.7 points to 34.1 last month
and new orders slid 6.3 points to 32.2, the report showed.
Engineering work dropped 3.1 points to 39.2 while commercial
work fell 1.7 points to 33.5, it showed. The measure of
apartment building surged 7.9 points to 33.2 in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
