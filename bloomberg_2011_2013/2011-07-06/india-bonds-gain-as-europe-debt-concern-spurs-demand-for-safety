India’s 10-year bonds rose a second
day on speculation investors will favor the safety of fixed-
income assets after Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s
credit rating to below investment grade.  Yields had risen to a three-week high earlier before an
auction of 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) of notes due in
2017, 2022 and 2027 on July 8. Bonds gained also because the
levels were probably good for long-term buyers, said Paresh
Nayar, the Mumbai-based head of money market and currency at
FirstRand Ltd.  “There is a general tendency of flight to safety during
any crisis,” he said. “That attitude is probably driving
demand for bonds here as well.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.33 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai. It earlier touched 8.37 percent, the
highest level since June 15.  Most stocks on  India ’s benchmark index dropped for the
second day. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or
Sensex, fell 0.1 percent to 18,726.97 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell five basis points to 8.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
