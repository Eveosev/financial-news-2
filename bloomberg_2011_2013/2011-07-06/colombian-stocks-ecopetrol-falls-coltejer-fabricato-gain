The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:23 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.5 percent to 13,942.74, while the
Colcap Index dropped 1.6 percent to 1,688.38.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
fell 2.1 percent, the most since June 15, to 3,775 pesos. Oil
fell from a three-week high after China’s central bank raised
interest rates and Moody’s Investors Service downgraded
Portugal’s credit rating, heightening concern that slower growth
will crimp fuel consumption.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
rose 1.4 percent to 70.5 pesos, a five-year high. Investors are
betting that planned trade talks could fuel a recovery in
exports to Venezuela, said  Rupert Stebbings , the Colombia
director for Celfin Capital. Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
temporarily broke off diplomatic ties and put troops along the
shared border in 2009. Fabricato rose as much as 5 percent
earlier.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , a Colombian clothing maker and
exporter that sends nearly a quarter of its exports to
Venezuela, advanced 3.5 percent to 1.19 pesos, the highest level
in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
