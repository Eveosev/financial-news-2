Diamond production in  Sierra Leone 
fell 33 percent to 28,110 carats in April from a month earlier,
the country’s central bank said in its monthly economic review.  The amount includes 13,080 carats of industrial-grade
diamonds and 15,030 carats of gems, according to the statement
that was handed to reporters at the Bank of Sierra Leone in
Freetown, the capital, today.  Sierra Leone was West Africa’s second-biggest diamond
producer after  Guinea  in 2009, according to the most recent data
available from the  Kimberley Process Certification Scheme  that
was set up to stop the trade in so-called “ conflict diamonds ”
from countries including Sierra Leone.  Gold output declined 18 percent to 440 ounces, the bank
said. Production of rutile declined to 5,030 metric tons in
April from 5,060 in March while ilmenite output dropped 10
percent to 910 tons. Rutile and ilmenite are titanium-bearing
minerals. Output of bauxite, an ore used in aluminum, rose to
141,640 tons in April from 140,640 a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
