CLS Bank, the New York-based operator
of the largest currency-trading settlement system, said it
handled more than $5 trillion a day for the first time in June.  CLS settled $5.12 trillion a day of foreign-exchange trades
in June, a 21 percent increase on June last year, it said today
in an e-mailed statement. The previous record was $4.8 trillion
a day in March 2011.  The bank settled an average 818,152 trading instructions
per day last month, down 3 percent from May, and less than the
899,565 trades settled in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
