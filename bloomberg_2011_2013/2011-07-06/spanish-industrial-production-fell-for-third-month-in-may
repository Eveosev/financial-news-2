Spanish industrial production fell
for the third month in May as the economy struggled to emerge
from a three-year slump.  Output at factories, refineries and mines fell 0.4 percent
from a year earlier, adjusting for the number of working days,
the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today in an e-
mailed statement. Production fell a revised 1.5 percent in
April, the sharpest contraction in six months.  Spain’s government forecasts the economy will grow 1.3
percent this year, led by exports as austerity measures aimed at
reining in the  budget deficit  weaken domestic consumption. The
government has cut public wages, frozen pensions and axed
benefits to reduce the euro region’s third-largest budget gap by
half in two years.  The industrial production data add to evidence the economy
is struggling to exit the worst recession in six decades. The
purchasing managers’ index for services fell in June to 50.2,
just above the point that indicates expansion, from 50.9 in May,
Markit Economics said yesterday.  The company forecast “meager GDP growth” for  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
