Palm oil , little changed, may advance
after a recent slump in prices widened the discount to soybean
oil making it a cheaper option and as yesterday’s jump in crude
oil lifted the appeal of vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock.  The September-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.4
percent to 3,051 ringgit ($1,015) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and traded at 3,043 ringgit at 4:21 p.m.
Futures earlier today touched the lowest level in more than
eight months and have declined 20 percent this year.  “Oil moving up may be making it more attractive from the
biofuel side of things,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment
Bank Bhd., said today.  Crude for August delivery lost 0.4 percent after gaining as
much as 0.9 percent. The contract jumped 2 percent yesterday.  Soybean oil  imports by  India , the world’s second-largest
cooking oil user, may decline 40 percent to 1 million tons this
year as buyers turn to cheaper palm oil, Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer of Sunvin Group, said yesterday. Palm oil
imports may increase 3.4 percent to 6.6 million tons in the year
ending Oct. 31, he told Bloomberg in an interview.  “That is underlying support and demand now, from the India
side, because they are quite price sensitive,” Ng said. “So as
the discount widens, there will be incentive to switch out of
soy oil to palm, although their preferred choice is still soy
but if it’s cheaper they might consider switching.”  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil widened to $230.78 a
ton, from $225.16 on July 4, according to Bloomberg data.  November-delivery soybeans dropped 0.3 percent to $13.14 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
delivery in December climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 56.49
cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
dropped 0.2 percent to close at 8,828 yuan ($1,365) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month closed little changed
at 10,038 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
