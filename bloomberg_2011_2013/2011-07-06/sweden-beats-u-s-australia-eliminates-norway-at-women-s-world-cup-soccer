Sweden  handed the U.S. its first
group-stage defeat in six editions of the Women’s  World Cup  to
set up a quarterfinal against Australia, which beat Norway to
reach the last eight.  Goals by Lisa Dahlkvist and Nilla Fischer in Wolfsburg,
Germany last night lifted Sweden to the 2-1 win and atop Group C
with the maximum nine points. The U.S., which fell to its first
loss in 18 group games at the four-yearly soccer championship,
finished in second place with six.  Sweden will play Australia in Augsburg on July 10 for a
place in the semifinals. The U.S., the 1991 and 1999 champion,
faces a quarterfinal matchup against Brazil in Dresden on the
same day.  Australia  earlier eliminated 1995 winner Norway with a 2-1
win to claim the last quarterfinal berth, while Brazil beat
Equatorial Guinea 3-0 to top Group D with nine points.  Kyah Simon scored in the 57th and 87th minutes in
Leverkusen as Australia came back from 1-0 down against Norway
to reach the last eight for the second straight World Cup. The
Scandinavian team needed to win to extend its record of having
advanced from the group stage at every edition.  Two-time defending champion and host Germany, the pre-
tournament favorite, faces  Japan , and England meets France in
the other quarterfinals on July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
