What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after China raised interest
rates for the third time this year to slow inflation, and weekly
U.S. crop conditions improved, said  Jim Gerlach , the president
of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Wheat futures may open 9 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on bets that favorable weather will improve crops
in the northern U.S. Great Plains and Canada, Gerlach said. A
rally by the dollar was expected to reduce investment demand for
commodities, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 9 cents to 11 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago after inventories rose in  China , Gerlach said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a
pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down $2 to $3 for
2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
