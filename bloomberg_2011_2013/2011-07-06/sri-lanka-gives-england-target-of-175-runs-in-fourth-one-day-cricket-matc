Kumar Sangakkaraâ€™s 75 runs pushed  Sri
Lanka  to 174 all out in the fourth one-day international cricket
match against England at Trent Bridge in Nottingham.  The 33-year-old combined with Angelo Mathews (39) for 72
runs to settle the visitors after captain  Tillakaratne Dilshan 
and Dinesh Chandimal were out without scoring. Sangakkara was
caught by Eoin Morgan off Jade Dernbach to close the innings.  Jimmy Anderson and Dernbach each took three wickets, while
Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad each had two in the day-night
match.  England won the toss and elected to field in the 50-over
game. Sri Lanka is leading the five-match ODI series, 2-1, and
would clinch it with a victory today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
