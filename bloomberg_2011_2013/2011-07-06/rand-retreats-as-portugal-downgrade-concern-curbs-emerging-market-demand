The rand weakened for a second day
against the dollar on speculation  Portugal  may need to follow
 Greece  in seeking a second financial bailout and as a Chinese
interest-rate increase and slower American service-industry
growth dimmed the global economic outlook.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy declined as much
as 0.8 percent to 6.7819 per dollar and traded 0.6 percent
weaker at 6.7703 as of 4:24 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand
strengthened for a fifth day against the euro, gaining 0.7
percent to 9.6743.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal’s credit rating to
junk yesterday, pushing up the extra yield investors demand to
hold the country’s 10-year bonds over German bunds by 148 basis
points, or 1.48 percentage point, to a euro-era record. China
increased lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points effective
tomorrow. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s index of
non-manufacturing industries was lower than analysts projected.  “The scales, have tilted back towards a weaker rather than
stronger rand” as “the markets will now start to shift more
towards a risk-off environment,” Tradition Analytics
researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote
in a research note.  Government 13.5 percent notes due 2015 gained 7 cents to
121.286 rand, driving the yield down by three basis points to
7.460 percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 advanced for
a third day, gaining 34 cents to 89.391 rand, pushing the yield
down five basis points to 8.363 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
