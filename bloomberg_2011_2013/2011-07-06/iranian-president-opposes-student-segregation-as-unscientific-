Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
opposed an initiative aimed at segregating male and female
university students, calling it “unscientific.”  “We’re hearing that some of the classes at universities
are being segregated with no regards for its consequences,” the
president wrote in a letter addressed to  Iran ’s science and
health ministers. “It is essential that this shallow move comes
to a halt immediately,” he was quoted as saying in the
document, which was published on his  website .  In the Islamic republic, women are required by the
government to cover their hair and bodies in line with Islamic
values. Women and men are separated in buses, mosques and as
early as primary school. Due to a shortage of facilities, many
university students attend classes together.  In recent weeks some officials have called for a separation
of the sexes, citing the need to prevent “Western-style
mingling” between young women and men. If new facilities are
provided, classes for boys and girls may be held apart, Science
Minister Kamran Daneshjou said earlier this week, according to
local media.  “This is not called segregation, it is Islam,” Daneshjou
said, according to a report published today in  Shargh , a Tehran-
based newspaper. The “Islamisation of universities is part of
the policies of the Science Ministry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
