Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp.,
the largest U.S. provider of  mortgage insurance , was sued by the
 Justice Department  for allegedly refusing to provide insurance
for loans to women on paid maternity leave.  The insurer violated the U.S. Fair Housing Act by
discriminating based on sex and familial status, David Hickton,
the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, said in a complaint filed today
in federal court. The lawsuit seeks a court order to stop MGIC
from further discrimination and unspecified damages.  “It defies belief that, in 2011, any institution would
discriminate against a mother for legally and properly taking
leave after the birth of a child,” Hickton said in a statement.  Underwriters at MGIC refused to provide insurance for a
mortgage for a mother of three, who was seeking to refinance a
home she jointly owns with her husband in Wexford,  Pennsylvania ,
until she returned to work full time, according to the
complaint.  The woman, Carly Neals, filed a complaint with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. After an
investigation, HUD found that there was reasonable cause to
believe illegal discrimination had occurred, according to the
complaint.  Katie Monfre, a spokeswoman for MGIC in  Milwaukee , didn’t
immediately return a call after regular business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp., 05-
MC-02025, U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania
(Pittsburgh.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
