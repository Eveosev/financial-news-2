North Korean rice prices have
quadrupled this year amid concern the regime is facing further
economic isolation, according to a South Korean research report.  Rice prices jumped to as much as 2,200 North Korean won per
kilogram during the first six months of the year from about 500
won at the end of 2010, South Korea’s state-run  Korea
Development Institute  said today in an e-mailed statement. The
difference was mostly caused by a slump in the domestic
currency, which is a factor the government considers in setting
the price, the report said.  North Korea ’s won is not freely traded though the  U.S.
dollar  is the de facto currency used in many markets.  South Korea in May last year cut off most trade with North
Korea, accusing Kim Jong Il’s regime of torpedoing one of its
warships in March that killed 46 sailors. The U.S. is assessing
whether to provide food assistance to North Korea, which is also
under United Nations sanctions for its nuclear tests.  The North Korean currency has weakened “sharply” since
the regime shelled  South Korea ’s Yeonpyeong island in November
amid concerns worsening relations will lead to further shortages
of goods, the report said. North Korea has also increased coal
exports to  China  to make up for the shortfall in trade with
South Korea, causing energy shortages, it said.  While the regime lifted its ban on street markets that was
placed at the end of 2009, high prices and goods shortages are
preventing them from helping meet North Koreans’ needs, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
