Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest refiner,
fell for a third day after Croatia requested legal assistance
from Hungary for an investigation into Mol’s Croatian
subsidiary.  The shares dropped 1.2 percent to close at 19,900 forint in
Budapest, helping lead the benchmark BUX index 1.2 percent
lower.  The Croatian prosecutor’s office submitted a legal aid
request to Hungary regarding an unspecified investigation at INA
Industrija Nafte d.d., the Hungarian Chief Prosecutor’s office
said today. Mol hasn’t received legal notification from either
the Hungarian or Croatian authorities, spokeswoman Andrea Panczel told Bloomberg by phone.  Mol shares tumbled 3.6 percent yesterday to their lowest
this year after  Nepszabadsag  reported that Croatia had requested
the extradition of Mol Chairman Zsolt Hernadi.  Croatia ’s
Prosecutor General denied the report.  Croatia’s request doesn’t contain a demand for extradition,
the Hungarian prosecutor’s office said.  Croatia is probing an alleged bribery case in which Hernadi
is said to have paid 10 million euros ($14 million) to former
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader in exchange for management
rights in INA, the Croatian newspaper Vecerni List said last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
