Oil fell from a three-week high after
 China ’s central bank raised  interest rates  and Moody’s Investors
Service downgraded Portugal’s credit rating, heightening concern
that slower growth will crimp fuel consumption.  Crude tumbled as much as 1 percent in New York as the
People’s Bank of China said benchmark deposit and lending rates
will rise 25 basis points tomorrow. The euro weakened against
the dollar after Moody’s cut Portugal’s rating to junk status,
curbing the appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.  “We came in today after the Chinese raised their interest
rates, because people are thinking this is going to slow the
growth over there and hinder demand,” said Chris Dillman, an
analyst at Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut. “Moody’s
downgrade put pressure on the euro and boosted the dollar.”  Crude for August delivery fell 73 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$96.16 a barrel at 10:20 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have increased 34 percent in the past year.  Brent crude  for August settlement on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange dropped $1.27, or 1.1 percent, to $112.34 a
barrel. The European benchmark was at a premium of $16.18 to
U.S. futures. The spread reached a record $22.29 on June 15.  China raised benchmark interest rates for the third time
this year after inflation accelerated to the quickest pace since
2008. The one-year lending rate will increase to 6.56 percent
from 6.31 percent tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on
its website today. The one-year deposit rate rises to 3.5
percent from 3.25 percent.  “Tightening monetary policy in China is already impacting
growth,” said  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at
 Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)  “This is a declaration of policy, that
inflation is more important than growth. It will have an impact
on oil demand.”  Portuguese Downgrade  Moody’s slashed Portugal four levels late yesterday to Ba2
from Baa1 with a negative outlook. The decision came two months
after Portugal got a 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) aid package
and hours before today’s sale of 1 billion euros of treasury
bills. The euro weakened against 14 of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The euro slipped by 0.9 percent to $1.4293 at 10:20 a.m. in
New York. It touched $1.4291, the lowest level since June 27.  “Right now the market’s reacting to rising concerns about
 Portugal ’s credit rating,  risk aversion  and the strengthening
dollar,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  ISM Report  Prices also came under pressure as the Institute for Supply
Management’s U.S. index of non-manufacturing businesses
decreased to 53.3 in June from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading
above 50 signals expansion. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil-
consuming country.  The measure was projected to drop to 53.7, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates from 71
economists surveyed ranged from 51.2 to 56. The Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s index averaged 56.1 in the five years to December
2007, when the last recession began.  A U.S. Energy Department report tomorrow may show that
crude stockpiles dropped for a fifth week in the longest decline
since January. U.S. crude inventories shrank 2.5 million
barrels, or 0.7 percent, to 357 million in the week ended July
1, according to the median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. All respondents expect a drop.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
report weekly supply and demand data today. Both reports are a
day late this week because of the Fourth of July holiday.  Oil’s rally in  New York  may stall around $98 a barrel as
prices approach technical resistance, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Front-month futures are below the 61.8 percent
one-year Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart. A failure to
breach resistance usually means prices will change direction.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 168,647
contracts as of 10:13 a.m. in New York. Volume totaled 520,283
contracts yesterday, 24 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
