London  was judged the most exciting
city in  Europe , and the most expensive, in a survey carried out
by  TripAdvisor , a travel-review website.  The U.K. capital also topped the list of cities easy to get
around, in the website’s fourth annual European Cities survey,
in which 3,523 travelers were questioned.  Birmingham, Britain’s second city, is the most boring and
the least romantic place, Athens the dirtiest, Stockholm the
safest and Paris the most overrated, with the rudest cab
drivers, according to the survey, published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
