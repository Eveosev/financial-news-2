BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  and  OneSteel
Ltd. (OST)  climbed in Sydney trading on speculation the government may
offer loans to coal-fired power plants when it announces a
carbon tax program this weekend.  BlueScope rose 6.1 percent to A$1.385 at the 4:10 p.m.
close, its steepest gain since March 14, while OneSteel jumped
6.2 percent to A$2.05, the stock’s biggest advance since Aug.
24, 2009.  Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s government is set to
announce on July 10 its plan to charge companies for  carbon
emissions  that will take effect next year, setting out its
policy for an emissions trading program in the world’s biggest
coal exporter. The government may charge a carbon price of $20
to $25 a ton and offer emergency loans to coal-fired  power
plants  to ease their tax burden, the  Australian  newspaper
reported today, without citing anyone.  The compensation plan may benefit the steelmakers, which
burn coal to generate more than 80 percent of its electricity.
BlueScope spokesman Michael Reay and OneSteel spokesman Steve
Ashe declined to comment when contacted via e-mails today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
