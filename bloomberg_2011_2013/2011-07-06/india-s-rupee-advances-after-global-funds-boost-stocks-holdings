India’s rupee depreciated a second
day on speculation oil refiners bought dollars taking advantage
of the local currency’s rise to a two-month high.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners, rose to a one-week high as
 China ’s central bank raised benchmark deposit and lending rates
by 25 basis points, effective tomorrow.  Oil prices  in New York
trading fell 0.5 percent to $96.43 per barrel as of 9:11 a.m.
India imports almost 80 percent of its oil.  “Oil demand is a perpetual feature and the rupee strength
also spurred some dollar buying by importers,” said Vikas Babu,
a foreign-currency trader at  Andhra Bank . “Strong dollar is
also depressing the local currency.”  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 44.4885 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 44.335 earlier today and on July 4, the
strongest level since May 3.  Foreign investors bought $460 million more Indian stocks
than they sold on July 5, taking net purchases this year to $1.6
billion, according to exchange data. The currency appreciated
0.8 percent last month.  “Inflows into equities recently is a major factor
supporting the rupee,” said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
executive vice-president at IndusInd Bank Ltd.  India ’s $1.3 trillion economy expanded 7.8 percent in the
first quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, compared with 8.3
percent in the previous three months, government data showed.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.99 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.91
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
