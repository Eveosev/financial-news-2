NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , a Kenyan lender, ended
unchanged in Nairobi trading, erasing earlier gains, as concern
global growth will slow prompted investors to sell riskier
assets.  The stock closed at 43.25 shillings at 3 p.m. in the
capital after climbing as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The
Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index slipped 0.2 percent as
more than two shares fell for every one that gained.  Emerging-market stocks declined for a second day after
Moody’s Investors Service’s downgrade of  Portugal  revived
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage global growth and
 China  announced its third interest-rate increase this year.  NIC Bank rallied earlier after the lender said it revised
its base lending rate to 16 percent, according to a statement
published in the Daily Nation newspaper today. The rate was
increased from 14.5 percent, Philip Wahome, a communications
manager at the company, said in a mobile-phone text message
response to questions today.  “The market is very bearish,” Renaldo D’Souza, an analyst
with Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
