Croatia  will pursue as much as 16
billion kuna ($3 billion) in unpaid taxes by letting businesses
pay outstanding bills in installments, part of efforts to trim
the Balkan nation’s budget deficit.  “We hope to collect about 80 percent of the total
amount,” Josip Lozancic, head of the  Tax Office , told reporters
in Zagreb today. Businesses would pay their arrears, mainly for
value-added and employee taxes, in 30 installments, incurring an
annual interest rate of 8.3 percent, he added.  Croatia has been in recession since 2009 as foreign
investment declined. The economy contracted 0.8 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, after shrinking 1.2 percent
in 2010. Prime Minister  Jadranka Kosor  has pledged to reduce
this year’s budget deficit to less than the government’s 4.2
percent forecast through spending cuts.  Overdue taxes represent about 13 percent of Croatia’s 2011
budget, which envisages expenditure of 122.3 billion kuna and
revenue of 107.4 billion kuna.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
