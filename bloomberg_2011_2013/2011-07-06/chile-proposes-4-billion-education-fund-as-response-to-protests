Chile ’s government plans to create a
$4 billion education fund, partly financed from copper revenue,
to improve access to education, President Sebastian Pinera said.  Pinera plans to increase scholarships and grants as part of
a series of measures unveiled in a televised address to the
nation last night.  The announcement follows demonstrations by tens of
thousands of students in Santiago last week, pushing for
increased funding for higher education and changes to university
entrance requirements, according a statement on the University
of Chile student federation website.  “This great mission of improving Chile’s education
requires an enormous financial effort,” said Pinera, flanked by
Education Minister Joaquin Lavin. “As a result we’re proposing
the creation of a $4 billion education fund.”  The fund would “complement fiscal budget resources and
would be made up from resources of the public treasury, the
economic and social stabilization fund, copper profits and other
means,” he said. Chile is the world’s biggest copper producer.  Pinera said a move to a state-only education system would
be a mistake.  The student unrest raises questions about the strength of
Pinera’s leadership and put pressure on the president to
increase funding, Risa Grais-Targow, Latin America associate at
Eurasia Group, said.  “Pinera is really in a tough position right now,” she
said in a telephone interview before yesterday’s speech. “To
the extent that he’s politically weaker, he doesn’t have much
room to strong arm anything.”  Pinera’s approval rating has declined from a high of 63
percent in October, when the government rescued 33 trapped
miners in the country’s north, to 36 percent in May, according
to Santiago-based pollster Adimark GfK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
