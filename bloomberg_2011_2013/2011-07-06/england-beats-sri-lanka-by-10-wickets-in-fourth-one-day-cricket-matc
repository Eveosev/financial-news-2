England  defeated Sri Lanka by 10
wickets in their fourth one-day cricket international match to
tie the series with one meeting remaining.  England reached 171-0 in response to the visitors 174 all
out and won using Duckworth/Lewis formula for rain-shortened
matches. Alastair Cook was on 95 runs and  Craig Kieswetter 
reached 72 when England took the victory.  Kumar Sangakkaraâ€™s 75 runs lead Sri Lanka in the match at
Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The 33-year-old combined with Angelo
Mathews (39) for 72 runs to settle the visitors after captain
Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal were out without
scoring. Sangakkara was caught by Eoin Morgan off Jade Dernbach
to close the innings.  Jimmy Anderson and Dernbach each took three wickets, while
 Tim Bresnan  and Stuart Broad each had two in the day-night
match.  England won the toss and elected to field in the 50-over
game. Sri Lanka had been leading the five-match ODI series, 2-1,
and would have clinched it with a victory today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
