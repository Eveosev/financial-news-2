China ’s Bohai coal prices along six
northern ports fell for the first time since March after
stockpiles and imports of the fuel increased.  Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Price Index, or BSPI, fell 0.12
percent to 842 yuan ($130) a metric ton today compared with a
week earlier, according to the Qinhuangdao Seaborne Coal Market
 website . The weekly gauge tracks power-station coal prices at
six major Chinese ports.  Coal stockpiles at the nation’s major power plants rose to
more than 64.6 million tons in mid-June, or close to 18 days of
use, after utilities built inventories for summer, according to
 China Coal Transport and Distribution Association . Prices at
Qinhuangdao, another benchmark power-station coal at the
nation’s largest port for the fuel, remained unchanged on July 4
after reaching the highest in more than two years in June.  Bohai coal prices may fail to increase in summer because of
rising imports and high inventories, the Beijing-based coal
association said in a statement on its website yesterday.
Chinese coastal coal prices may decline, it said.  Imports of the fuel from countries including Indonesia and
 Australia  climbed to a four-month high of 13.6 million tons in
May after higher domestic prices made overseas supplies more
attractive, according to Chinese customs data.  Hydropower generation has been increasing since mid-June,
reducing demand for coal, the coal association said. Daily coal-
use at coastal  power plants  also declined, it said, without
giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
