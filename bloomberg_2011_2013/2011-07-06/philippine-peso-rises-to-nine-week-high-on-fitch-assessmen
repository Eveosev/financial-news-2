The Philippine peso climbed to a
nine-week high after  Fitch Ratings  forecast the economy will
expand as much as 6 percent this year and next.  The currency rose for a seventh day, its longest winning
streak since January, after Fitch said today its outlook on
Philippine banks is stable, “underpinned by an improving
domestic economy and relatively low asset quality risk.” Growth
was 4.9 percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since the
final three months of 2009.  “The Fitch comments are validating the improved macro
fundamental story that’s been making the rounds the past few
weeks,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
 Singapore . “For the peso going forward, it’s certainly
positive.”  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 42.90 per dollar as of
the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
touched 42.825 earlier, the highest level since May 3.  Benchmark five-year bonds gained, pushing yields to the
lowest level since January. The rate on the 7 percent notes due
January 2016 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 4.71 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The government started a debt swap yesterday, offering at
least 100 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) of 10.5- and 20-year
bonds in exchange for shorter-dated notes.  To contact the reporter for this story:
