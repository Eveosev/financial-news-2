Corn output in  Brazil , the world’s
third-largest producer, was cut by about 3.7 percent after a
frost damaged crops in Parana state.  Parana, the biggest corn grower in Brazil, will produce
11.2 million metric tons this year, down from a June 20 estimate
of 13.4 million tons, the state’s agriculture secretariat said.
Brazil is expected to reap a total 57.1 million tons this year,
the nation’s  Agriculture Ministry  said today.  “The damage is irreversible,” Methodio Groxko, an analyst
at Parana’s agriculture secretariat, said today in a telephone
interview from Curitiba. “It affected plants that were at
different stages of development.”  About 190,000 tons of wheat was also damaged by the frost
on June 27 and June 28, he said. Parana will produce 2.613
million tons of the grain, down from a previous estimate of
2.803 million tons, he said.  The U.S. and China are the world’s largest corn producers.
The winter corn harvest began this month, while the wheat
harvest in Brazil starts next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
