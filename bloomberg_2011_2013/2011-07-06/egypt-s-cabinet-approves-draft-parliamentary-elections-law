Egypt ’s Cabinet approved a draft law
under which half of the seats in the parliamentary elections
scheduled for September would be contested through slates of
candidates and the rest by individual candidates.  According to the draft, parliament would have 500 seats and
candidates of different parties may run on one slate, allowing
alliances to be struck, a faxed Cabinet statement said.  The draft law still needs to be approved by the military
council which has been running the country since President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down on Feb. 11 after mass protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
