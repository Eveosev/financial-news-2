President  Barack Obama , in a change
of longstanding government policy, will begin sending condolence
letters to the families of U.S. soldiers who commit suicide in a
war zone.  “This issue is emotional, painful and complicated, but
these Americans served our nation bravely,” Obama said in a
statement issued by the White House. “They didn’t die because
they were weak.”  Obama said he consulted the military, including the defense
secretary, before changing course. Plans for a White House
review were announced in late 2009 and began in 2010, spokesman
Tommy Vietor said in an e-mail.  CBS News  reported the change yesterday.  American Legion National Commander Jimmie Foster said
suicidal thoughts are a symptom of post-traumatic stress, which
he called “one of the signature wounds of the war on terror.”
Soldiers’ deaths “shouldn’t be marginalized in any way,”
Foster said in a statement.  John Madigan, senior director of public policy at the
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said Obama’s policy
change sends “a strong message that America will not tolerate a
culture in our armed forces that discriminates against those
with a mental illness or furthers stigma.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
