The pound weakened against all 16 of
its major peers tracked by Bloomberg before a report forecast to
show U.K. house prices stagnated in June.  The cost of a home in Britain was little changed from May
when it increased 0.1 percent, Halifax, the mortgage unit of
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, will say, according to the median
estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices
charged by retailers rose 2.9 percent from a year ago after
advancing 2.3 percent in May, the British Retail Consortium said
in a separate report today.  The pound weakened 0.3 percent to 90.12 pence per euro as
of 7:49 a.m. in  London . Sterling was little changed at $1.6027
and dropped 0.5 percent to 129.61 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
