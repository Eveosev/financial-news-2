Treasuries declined and the spread
between 30-year bonds and two-year notes approached a record on
speculation inflation will quicken as the economy improves.  The difference in yield expanded to 3.96 percentage points,
the widest in five months, and nearing the 4.02 percentage point
level on Feb. 1 that was the most in Bloomberg data going back
to 1977. The spread between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, was 2.35 percentage points, versus the 10-
year average of 2.11 points.  “I expect yields to keep rising at a moderate pace,” said
Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc., a unit of Japan’s third-largest publicly traded bank by
assets. “The  U.S. economy  is on a recovery track.”  The 10-year yield rose three basis points to 3.15 percent
as of 7:01 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.125 percent note due May 2021 fell 7/32, or $2.19
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 26/32. The yield, which has
climbed from this year’s low of 2.84 percent on June 27, is
still below the decade-long average of 4.07 percent.  Two-year notes, which are anchored by the  Federal Reserve ’s
target for overnight bank lending because of their short
maturity, yielded 0.44 percent, compared with 4.40 percent for
30-year bonds. The central bank has kept its target in a range
of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008.  Rate Forecast  Ten-year rates will advance to 3.62 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest
weightings. Shimazu predicts 3.8 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of 19 raw materials
rallied 1.5 percent yesterday, the most in a week, adding to
inflation concerns.  U.S. employers hired 100,000 workers last month, after
adding 54,000 in May, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the Labor Department report July 8. The
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, the analysts predicted.  Japan’s 10-year bonds yielded 1.17 percent, matching a two-
month high. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said today that a
“considerable” amount of  government bonds  will need to be
issued to fund rebuilding from the March earthquake and tsunami.  Fed Buying  The Fed is scheduled to buy $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of
Treasuries due from January 2014 to June 2015 today, according
to its  website . The Fed completed its planned $600 billion of
debt purchases. It’s now reinvesting the principal payments from
its debt holdings as part of its efforts to cap borrowing costs.  Ten-year notes may draw demand after their yields climbed
to 3.22 percent on June 1, the most in six weeks, said Tsutomu Komiya, who helps oversee the equivalent of $114.5 billion as an
investor in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s second-biggest brokerage by market value.  Yields climbed past their 200-day moving average, now 3.15
percent, at the end of June. They retreated to below the barrier,
which Komiya identified as a resistance level, this week.  “Some people think this level is attractive,” Komiya said.
His own view is that bond yields are poised to climb this year,
he said.  Bill Rates  Treasuries rose yesterday, pushing rates on three-month
bills below zero for the first time since 2008, after Moody’s
Investors Service cut Portugal’s bond rating to junk status and
a report showed deteriorating credit prospects for  China ’s banks.  Moody’s reduced Portugal’s long-term ratings to Ba2, two
levels below investment grade. The reductions stem partly from
“the growing risk that  Portugal  will require a second round of
official financing before it can return to the private market,”
Moody’s said in a statement.  The nation joined Ireland and  Greece  in turning to the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a bailout
after their budget deficits ballooned.  Moody’s also said yesterday that Chinese bank loans to
local governments are about 3.5 trillion yuan ($541.1 billion)
more than the national audit office’s estimate, and the
industry’s credit outlook may decline.  Three-month Treasury bill rates tumbled to negative 0.0051
percent in their first decline below zero since December 2008.  The Fed said June 22 that it expects the recovery to pick
up after ebbing in the second quarter. An industry report today
will show  service industries  in the U.S. expanded at a slower
pace in June, according to Bloomberg surveys.  Growth in the world’s largest economy will quicken to 3.2
percent in the July-to-September period, the fastest pace since
the first three months of last year, another survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
