Qu Hongbin, chief  China  economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong , comments on the People’s Bank of
China’s announcement today that it will raise benchmark lending
and deposit rates by 25 basis points effective tomorrow.  The one-year lending rate will rise to 6.56 percent and the
one-year deposit rate will increase to 3.5 percent.  Qu said he doesn’t expect another interest-rate adjustment
this year although the central bank will continue to raise
banks’ reserve requirements.  On the reason for the increase:  “The increase is due to the high rate of inflation we
expect in June. It also indicates that the government’s
tightening policies won’t be relaxed in the short term.”  Qu forecasts inflation in June accelerated to 6.4 percent
from a year earlier. Consumer prices climbed 5.5 percent in May.  On the outlook for  China’s economy :  “ There’s no need to worry about a  hard landing . China’s
economic growth is moderating but it isn’t slowing sharply.”  --Victoria Ruan. Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
