The dollar fell versus the euro and
yen on concern the U.S. jobless rate will remain at a level that
deters the  Federal Reserve  from raising interest rates.  The greenback fell to $1.4457 per euro as of 11:29 a.m. in
 Tokyo  from $1.4429 in  New York  yesterday. It weakened to 80.85
yen from 81.07 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
