Oilsands Quest Inc. (BQI)  fell the most in
almost six months after it said it may not be able to continue
operating beyond January 2012 if it fails to find a financial
partner to develop a $1 billion oil-sands project in Canada.  Oilsands Quest fell 6 cents, or 17 percent, to 29 cents at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was
the largest decline since Jan. 13.  Oilsands Quest plans to fund its operations by selling
rights to buy shares to existing holders, while remaining
“open” to joint venture offers and partnerships for its
bitumen extraction project, the Calgary-based company said today
in a statement.  “We haven’t received any firm proposals,” Chief Executive
Officer Garth Wong said today on a conference call for
investors. “Many of the parties wanted to see a higher level of
development and a correspondingly lower level of risk before
they were prepared to make a firm offer.”  Oilsands Quest must prove that its Axe Lake and Wallace
Creek fields can economically produce bitumen, a tar-like
substance that can be refined into oil, using existing
technology, Wong said. Potential investors want a pilot project
at Axe Lake and more drilling at Wallace Creek, he said.  The company said its properties in western  Canada  may
produce 100,000 barrels of bitumen a day. The company hired TD
Securities Inc. to help find a partner to fund the projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
