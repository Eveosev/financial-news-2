South Africa ’s use of antitrust
processes in  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s purchase of a stake in
 Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  “strained” its credibility as an
investment destination, Massmart Chairman Mark Lamberti said.   South Africa’s trade, economic development and agriculture
ministries made a joint bid to the Competition Tribunal to force
the world’s largest retailer to restrict imports if it buys a
controlling stake in Johannesburg-based Massmart, concerned
about job losses. The country’s Commercial, Catering and Allied
Workers Union also “chose to engage on issues that had nothing
to do with the transaction or the interests of Massmart
workers,” Lamberti wrote in an opinion piece in Business Day
newspaper today.  “Regrettably, these interventions strained South Africa’s
credibility as a destination for foreign direct investment,” he
wrote. “In the end, wisdom and independence of the Competition
Tribunal prevailed and the dissenting parties achieved nothing
more than was offered to them by Grant Pattison,” Massmart’s
chief executive officer, Lamberti wrote.  The competition authority on June 1 allowing Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart to proceed with its 16.5 billion-rand
($2.45 billion) purchase on condition no jobs are cut for two
years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
