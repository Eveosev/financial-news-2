BP Plc (BP/) , the operator of the Macondo
well that caused the worst U.S. oil spill in history last year,
had its outlook raised by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services on
higher  oil prices .  BP has received cash for as much as half of the planned $30
billion in asset sales needed to shore up its balance sheet, S&P
said today in a statement. Its average realized oil price rose
31 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. S&P revised
its credit outlook for BP to stable from negative.  “BP is better positioned to fund its uncertain Gulf of
Mexico-related commitments than we previously anticipated,” S&P
said. “The outlook revision reflects our view of reduced
downside risk to BP’s credit quality.”  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  has accelerated
divestitures and may get government approval on an exploration
deal with  India ’s Reliance Industries Inc. next week, a person
with knowledge of the matter said. The producer provisioned $41
billion for the spill and shares are have recovered 5 percent
since touching this year’s low last month.  BP’s refining business is becoming more profitable and the
company is expanding its resources globally, S&P said. The
company’s cash flow over the next 12 months will cover its needs
by a factor of 1.3, and BP will be able to maintain access to
bank lending and capital markets, S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
