The  U.S. Treasury  Department received
$12.7 billion in proceeds from its wind-down of its portfolio of
agency-guaranteed, mortgage-backed securities, according to a
department release today.  “These MBS purchases helped stabilize the financial
markets and preserve access to mortgage credit during a period
of unprecedented market stress,”  Mary Miller , the Treasury
Department’s assistant secretary for financial markets, said in
a statement.  “The MBS market has improved considerably since Treasury
purchased these securities,” the statement added. “Based on
current market conditions, Treasury expects to make a profit for
taxpayers on this investment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
