Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) , South Korea’s
second-biggest steelmaker, plans to spend 94.4 billion won ($89
million) by the end of this year to expand assembly capacity of
construction equipment parts as demand rises in  China  and Japan.  Output of track shoe assemblies, the continuous belts that
fit over the cogged wheels of excavators, will increase 50
percent to 130,000 pairs a year after the investment, Hyundai
Steel  said  in an e-mailed statement.  Global demand for excavators may rise 11 percent a year
until 2015 as economies in China,  India  and  Brazil  expand and
reconstruction demand increases in Japan, according to the
statement. Hyundai Steel accounts for 30 percent of the world’s
market for track shoe assemblies.  Hyundai Steel started operating its first two blast-
furnaces last year, expanding annual capacity to 20 million
metric tons and boosting automotive-steel output. The company,
which previously made steel in electric-arc furnaces, started
building a third blast furnace in April.  Shares of Hyundai Steel rose 1.5 percent to 136,500 won as
of 1:22 p.m. in Seoul trading, headed for the highest close
since May 6. The benchmark Kospi stock index gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
