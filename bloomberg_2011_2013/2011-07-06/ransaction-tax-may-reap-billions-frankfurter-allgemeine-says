A European Union financial
transaction tax may reap more than 50 billion euros ($72.3
billion) per year if it included  currency trading , EU Taxation
Commissioner Algirdas Semeta told  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung .  A “well designed” levy could be imposed without prompting
financial services companies to leave, Semeta said. The EU aims
to set a “good example” and push for the introduction of
financial transaction taxes globally, he said.  The commission’s final proposal in the second half may
diverge from an earlier study, in which it suggested tax rates
of 0.1 percent on trades in shares and bonds and a rate of 0.01
percent on trades in derivatives, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
