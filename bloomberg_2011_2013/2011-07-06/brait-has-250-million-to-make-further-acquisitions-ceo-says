Brait SA (BAT) ,  South Africa ’s largest
private equity company, said it will use 1.7 billion rand ($250
million) of cash left over from a capital increase to make
acquisitions.  “We will use the money to do new deals,” Chief Executive
Officer John Gnodde said in a telephone interview today. He
declined to give further details.  The company said last month it raised 6.4 billion rand in a
rights offer to help transform the private equity firm into a
longer-term investment holding company. Brait said it has used
80 percent of the funds raised, mainly for the acquisition of
additional stakes in  Pepkor  Ltd. and  Premier Foods Ltd .  Pepkor is a South African clothing retailer that has more
than 2,800 stores while Premier Foods produces Iwisa maize meal
and Blue Ribbon bread.  The capital increase raised 500 million rand more than the
company had planned, Brait said in a statement on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
