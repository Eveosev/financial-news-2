Indonesia’s rupiah fell for a second
day as concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen damped demand
for emerging-market assets.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  declined for a second day after
Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s credit rating to below
investment grade on concern it will follow Greece in seeking a
second international bailout. The currency erased earlier gains
on speculation the central bank stepped in to curb appreciation
that may hurt exporters. The rupiah has strengthened 5.1 percent
this year.  “Overnight we had some negative news from Portugal,” said
Nick Verdi, a foreign-exchange strategist at  Barclays Capital  in
 Singapore . The rupiah is at a level “the central bank is
comfortable with” and that would “limit gains,” he said.  The currency dropped 0.1 percent to 8,545 per dollar as of
4:26 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It rose 0.1 percent to 8,528 earlier.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose for a sixth day. The yield on
the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 7.42 percent, according to prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
