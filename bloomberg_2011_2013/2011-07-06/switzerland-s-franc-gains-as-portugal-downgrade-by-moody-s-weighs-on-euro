The Swiss franc rose against the euro
after Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s credit rating to
junk, stoking demand for the safest assets.  Switzerland’s currency gained against all but three of 16
major peers tracked by Bloomberg. The Swiss government said
today that the currency was in a “phase of overvaluation,” and
the central bank may act if a “worsening of the situation”
threatens the nation’s growth. Portugal’s downgrade prompted a
selloff in bonds from Europe’s most indebted countries.  The downgrade “is a nasty reminder that the euro is not in
the clear yet,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a strategist at UBS
Securities LLC in  London . The franc’s gains are “mostly driven
by the euro,” he said.  The franc appreciated 0.9 percent to 1.2027 per euro as of
5 p.m. in London. It was little changed against the dollar at
83.96 centimes.  The franc has risen 10 per cent against the euro in the past
year as the sovereign-debt crisis in the 17-nation currency bloc
worsened.  The  Swiss National Bank  may engage in bond purchases, known
as quantitative easing, to counter those gains, according to
Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
