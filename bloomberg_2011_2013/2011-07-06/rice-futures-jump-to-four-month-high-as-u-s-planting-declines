Rice futures rose to a four-month
high on mounting concern that output is dropping in the U.S.,
the world’s third-largest exporter.  Farmers in the U.S. planted 2.676 million acres this year,
down 26 percent from 2010, as they shifted to other crops and
floods damaged fields, according to a June 30 government  report .
Plantings of long-grain rice plunged by 34 percent to 1.865
million acres. Prices are up 9.2 percent since the report.  “It was a surprise how many acres they cut in the long-
grain side of the market,” said Dennis DeLaughter, owner of
ProgressiveFutures.com, a risk-analysis company based in Edna,
 Texas . “It was quite a dramatic change, plus we have a quality
problem with the stock we have left.”  Rice futures for September delivery rose 36 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $15.65 per 100 pounds at 11:02 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the grain surged by the exchange’s 50-
cent limit to $15.79, the highest since Feb. 14.  Mississippi River flooding in May damaged rice fields even
as farmers already were shifting some of their land to more
profitable crops, DeLaughter said.  Arkansas , the largest U.S.
grower, had 600,000 acres under water one month after flooding
began.  “Things are going to be tight, but we’re not going into
the $20 range unless something else happens in the world,”
DeLaughter said.  Thailand  is the world’s largest exporter, followed by
 Vietnam .  To contact the reporter on this story:
