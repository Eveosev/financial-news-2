Ugandan traders in the capital,
Kampala, began a two-day strike after a series of meetings with
the government failed to avert a protest over the rising cost of
doing business, the Kampala City Traders Association said.  The traders are deciding whether to attend talks called by
the government today to resolve the standoff, Mubarak Ntale, a
spokesman for the association, said in a phone interview today
from the city.  “The strike is on because nothing positive came out of the
meeting with the government,” he said.  Uganda ’s police force said yesterday it would deploy in at
least three of the East African nation’s cities during the
strike. In April and May, the authorities used teargas and
rubber bullets to disperse opposition supporters protesting over
the rising cost of living.  Uganda’s inflation rate fell to 15.8 percent in June after
reaching a 17-year high of 16 percent in May, while the shilling
fell to an 18-year low last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
