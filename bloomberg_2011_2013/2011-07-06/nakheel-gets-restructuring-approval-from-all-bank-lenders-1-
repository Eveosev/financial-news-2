Nakheel PJSC, the builder of man-made
islands off Dubai’s coast, said the company got the approval
of all its bank creditors to restructure debt.  Nakheel “received acceptance from 100 percent of the banks
and the required majority of its trade creditors giving their
consent to the Nakheel restructuring plan,” it said today in an
e-mailed statement.   Nakheel also signed agreements on its operational and
financial separation from Dubai World, it said. The legal
separation will happen upon completion of Nakheel’s
restructuring, the real-estate company said.  The company is restructuring $10.5 billion of debt after
the global credit crisis caused property demand in Dubai to
evaporate.  Home prices  slid by more than 60 percent from their
peak in mid-2008, forcing developers to cancel and delay
projects.  “Nakheel is now on course to formally complete its
restructuring which shall culminate with the issuance of the
sukuk to its trade creditors allowing Nakheel to focus on its
core business of a real estate developer delivering desirable
communities in Dubai,” the company said.  The developer said June 19 it had so far paid 5 billion
dirhams ($1.36 billion) in cash to trade creditors. Nakheel
plans to offer 4.8 billion dirhams in Islamic bonds, or sukuks,
to contractors by the end of June,  Al Ittihad  reported in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
