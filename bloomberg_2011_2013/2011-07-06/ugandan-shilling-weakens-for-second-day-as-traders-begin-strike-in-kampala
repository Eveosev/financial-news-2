Uganda ’s shilling weakened for a
second day as traders in the capital, Kampala, began a strike
over the rising cost of living.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
fell 1.6 percent to 2,590 per dollar, bringing the loss for the
continent’s worst-performing currency this year to 11 percent.  The Kampala City Traders Association said today it began a
two-day strike over the increasing cost of doing business after
meetings with the government aimed at ending the protest failed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
