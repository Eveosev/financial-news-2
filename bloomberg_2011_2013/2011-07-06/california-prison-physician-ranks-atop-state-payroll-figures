A physician working for  California ’s
overcrowded prison system was paid more than any other state
employee in 2010, according to payroll figures released today.  The surgeon, whose salary last year was $235,740, collected
a total of $777,423, according to corrected data released by
Controller John Chiang. Names were omitted from the list.
Figures released yesterday erroneously showed a prison
psychiatrist topped the list at $838,706. A Chiang spokesman,
Jacob Roper, cited a data entry error for the mistake.  The $777,423 included a settlement of back pay owed to the
doctor, said Nancy Kincaid, spokeswoman for the court-appointed
office that oversees California’s prison medical system. Details
of the settlement were confidential, she said.  Nine of the 10 highest-paid state employees earned more
than $500,000 in the 2010 calendar year, amounts that include
bonuses, settlements, or retirement payouts of unused vacation
time or sick days, the figures show. In contrast, Governor  Jerry Brown ’s salary is $173,987. Six of the top 10 on the list
released today were prison doctors, psychiatrists, or dentists.  “Governor Brown is concerned about high salaries and
payouts, which are driven by a number of things, including court
mandates, accrued vacation time and the last administration’s
furlough program,” a spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ashford, said in a
statement yesterday. “We are looking closely at why some
individuals receive such extraordinary sums.”  The nation’s largest correctional system operates at 75
percent above its rated capacity, with 163,000 inmates,
according to the  Corrections Department . The U.S. Supreme Court
in May upheld an order to ease overcrowding by removing 37,000
inmates. The state is developing a plan to reduce the population
without having to release dangerous felons.  Prison Health-Care  A federal judge in 2005 took over California’s prison
health-care system following lawsuits that said 34 convicts died
because of inadequate care. Kincaid said retiring physicians are
often able to cash-out unused leave and time-off for having to
work overtime because of staff shortages and forced furloughs.  “This is not just their annual salary but the lump-sum
cash-out that reflects decades on the job, many of them working
in institutions that are in remote locations where it’s very
difficult to recruit and fill vacancies, meaning that they
didn’t get to take vacation time and leave time,” Kincaid said
in an interview today. “That’s accumulated over the years and
after 25 or 30 years on the job, they have cashed out at
retirement.”  “Administering psychiatric care and administering dental
care, when done properly, is crucial,” a corrections spokesman,
Paul Verke, said in an interview.  A chief risk officer for the State Compensation Insurance
Fund, which provides workers’ compensation insurance to
California companies, with a maximum salary of $288,000, was
paid a total of $561,072. The total would include any bonus,
settlements or retirement payouts of unused vacation time or
sick days.  Calpers Chief  Joe Dear , the chief investment officer at the  California
Public Employees’ Retirement System , ranked sixth with a gross
pay of $548,142, the controller’s data shows. His base pay in
2010 was $450,000, according to  Brad Pacheco , spokesman for the
fund. Calpers, the largest U.S. pension, had assets of $232.2
billion as of June 27.  The 10th-highest-paid was Alan Trounson, the president of
the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, a $3 billion
bond-financed stem-cell research organization, who earned
$482,234. His annual maximum salary was shown as $529,092.  California faced a $19 billion  budget deficit  in the fiscal
year that ended June 30 and another $9 billion shortfall in this
fiscal year. Brown signed a budget June 30 that erased the
current gap with spending cuts and by forecasting more revenue
than originally projected because of economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
