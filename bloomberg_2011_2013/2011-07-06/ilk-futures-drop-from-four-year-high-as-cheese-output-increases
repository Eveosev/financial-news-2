Milk futures fell from a four-year
high on concern that the rally is encouraging increased output
of dairy products, including cheese.  Wholesale cheddar-cheese prices that rallied as much as 59
percent this year fell 0.6 percent today, the biggest decline in
eight weeks. Cheese shipments surged to 175.4 million pounds
(79,561 metric tons) in the first four months of 2011, up 68
percent from a year earlier, according to a  report  last month
from the U.S. Dairy Export Council.  “The cheese price has really been tugging on the near-term
futures,” said Dave Kurzawski, a risk-management consultant at
INTL FCStone Inc. “You’ve got some weakness starting to show on
the spot-cheese market.”  Class III milk futures for July delivery fell 8 cents, or
0.4 percent, to close at $20.60 per 100 pounds at 1:20 p.m. on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after touching $20.86, the
highest price for a most-active contract since July 11, 2007.
Class III milk is used to make cheese.  Whole milk at the U.S. supermarkets averaged $3.653 a
gallon (3.8 liters) in May, the highest since December 2008,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Milk output reached
a record 17.27 billion pounds (7.8 billion kilograms) during
that month, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Milk futures have surged 41 percent in the past year.  “The whole year has been marked by really good demand for
dairy products,” Kurzawski said. “The real impetus has been
from export demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
