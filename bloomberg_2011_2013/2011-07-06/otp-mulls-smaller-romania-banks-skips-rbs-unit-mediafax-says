OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, may consider buying two “smaller” banks in Romania
after dropping plans to purchase  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) ’s local unit, news service Mediafax reported today, citing
the lender’s Deputy Chief Executive OfficerAntal Pongracz.  OTP deemed the asking price for RBS’s Romanian unit too
high,  Mediafax  said citing Pongracz. Pongracz said a price of
between 100 million euros ($143 million) and 150 million euros
would have been “fair,” while declining to give the British
bank’s asking price for its Romanian unit, according to the
Bucharest-based news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
