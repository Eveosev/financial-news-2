Old Mutual Plc (OML) ’s Investment Group
Alternative Investments unit said it raised 9 billion rand
($1.33 billion) for its Housing Impact Fund for  South Africa .  The unit, known as OMIGSA, said the fund is one of the
largest of its kind ever in South Africa and that it will be
managed by Christine Glover, head of OMIGSA’s Development Impact
Funds. It will finance the construction of homes for low-income
households and provide families and students with loans or
rental accommodations, bridging a gap between government-funded
housing and those with means to buy their own home, the unit of
South Africa’s largest insurer said today in a statement.  “Although much remains to be done to further improve
general living conditions around the country, we believe we have
established a successful model for housing investment in
underdeveloped areas,” said Rojie Kisten, OMIGSA’s head of
capital raising, in the e-mailed statement.  The nation’s Public Investment Corp., the investor of
government employees’ pension funds and the country’s single
largest investor, together with electricity provider Eskom, Old
Mutual Life Assurance Co. and the  Development Bank  of Southern
Africa are among the institutions that invested the money,
according to the statement.  The fund and its partners have several dozen projects
under way involving the construction or development of
about 70,000 affordable housing units, with the goal of building
about 120,000, OMIGSA said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
