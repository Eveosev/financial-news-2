Dubai inflation accelerated in June,
led by increases in food and transportation costs.  The inflation rate rose to 0.8 percent, the Dubai
Statistics Center said in an e-mailed statement today. Food
prices increased 6.7 percent while transportation costs rose 6.6
percent, the report said. In the month, prices increased 0.5
percent.  “Across the GCC, food prices are the major inflationary
driver, with the exception of Saudi Arabia which is also seeing
strong housing inflation,”  Monica Malik , Dubai-based chief
economist at EFG-Hermes U.A.E. Ltd, said in a telephone
interview. “We expect to see government measures to limit food
price rises increasing in the run-up to the holy month of
Ramadan, when prices normally strengthen across the region.”  Record global food prices are likely to be sustained this
year because of high crude oil costs and smaller crops, the
United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization said in March.
Crude prices rose 15 percent last year and are up 6 percent this
year.  The month long Islamic holiday of Ramadan, when Muslims
fast from sunrise to sunset, begins in early August.  The Gulf Cooperation Council comprises Kuwait,  Saudi
Arabia , the  United Arab Emirates , Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
