Ethanol futures rose for a third day
in  Chicago  as gasoline gained, sparking optimism that refiners
will use more of the fuel to pocket the spread between the two.  The grain-based additive rose 1 percent as gasoline
advanced on speculation that U.S. employers added jobs last
month. The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supplies
and meet federal mandates. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit
for each gallon of ethanol mixed with gasoline in addition to
the price difference between the two fuels.  “That’s definitely helping,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at Linn Group in Chicago. “You’re seeing good demand from the
blender.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.7 cents to
settle at $2.761 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
contract expired today. Prices have gained 16 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
and on the West Coast at $2.785 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.775, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$2.735 a gallon.  Based on today’s prices, ethanol traded at a 23.66-cent
discount to gasoline.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 2.02 cents to settle at
$2.9976 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have risen six of the past seven days, gaining 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
