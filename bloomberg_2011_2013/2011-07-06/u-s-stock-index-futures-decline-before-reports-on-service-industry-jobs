     July 6 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose, posting their sixth
advance in seven days, as gains in transportation and consumer-
staple companies overshadowed a slowdown in service-industry
growth and China’s interest-rate increase.  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  climbed 0.8 percent to lead gains in
shipping companies, while  Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)  rallied 1.7
percent to help lead an advance in companies that sell consumer
necessities. DuPont Co.,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
increased at least 1.3 percent, pacing gains among companies
most-dependent on economic growth.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  slumped at least 1.1 percent as financial
stocks retreated.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent to
1,339.22 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The intraday move in the  S&P 500 
between its high and low was 0.7 percent, following a move of
only 0.5 percent yesterday. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
climbed 56.15 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,626.02. Volume on
U.S. exchanges totaled almost 6.1 billion at 4:53 p.m., 15
percent less than the three-month average through yesterday.  “We’re beginning to put the short-term economic issues
behind us,” said Robert Schaeffer, a  money manager  at Becker
Capital Management Inc. in  Portland ,  Oregon , which oversees
about $2.5 billion. “We’re likely to get better economic data
over the next months and that will rally the stock market on an
intermediate basis even if the long-term problems such as too
much debt remain unsolved.”  Last Week’s Rally  U.S. stocks yesterday snapped a five-day rally in which the
S&P 500 climbed 5.6 percent, the biggest weekly advance since
July 2009. Last week’s gain helped the S&P 500 erase about 75
percent of the decline suffered since reaching its high for the
year on April 29. Through June 24, U.S. equities had fallen for
seven of the previous eight weeks on concern the European debt
crisis would spread and the  U.S. economy  slow. The index is up
6.5 percent for the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Transportation shares helped erase morning losses. Union
Pacific gained 0.8 percent to $106.59, while the Dow Jones
Transportation Average of 20 stocks, a proxy for economic
growth, rose 1.2 percent.  Arkansas Best Corp. (ABFS)  jumped 11 percent to $26.90. The
trucking company said in a company release it will increase its
rates by 6.9 percent.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  rose 1 percent
to $74.50.  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  advanced 1.3 percent to $96.78.  The recent rally has marked a partial shift that had
favored companies and industries less sensitive to economic
growth. Since the S&P 500 slipped to its low for the year on
March 16, drugmakers, phone companies, utilities and household-
products producers have gained the most, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest advances in last week’s rally
were among so-called cyclical stocks, including energy
companies, computer makers, automakers and industrials.  Cyclical Index  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index added 0.1 percent today.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, rose 1.5 percent to $110.08, the most in the Dow.
DuPont, the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, climbed 1.4
percent to $55.20, while Intel increased 1.4 percent to $22.75.  Equities fell earlier after the ISM services index
decreased to 53.3 in June from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading
above 50 signals expansion. The measure was projected to drop to
53.7, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. The slower pace is a sign the economy cooled at the end
of the first half of 2011.  Other data showed employers in the U.S. announced 5.3
percent more job cuts in June than a year earlier, according to
figures from Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The
report comes two days before the Labor Department’s monthly
payrolls report.  Earnings Season  The second-quarter earnings season starts next week when
Alcoa Inc. reports on July 11, the first Dow company to release
results. Earnings are forecast to grow by 13 percent, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Stock-index futures retreated after  China ’s central bank
said it will raise its benchmark deposit and lending rates by 25
basis points tomorrow. This is the third time this year China
has raised rates as it tries to cool the world’s fastest-growing
economy after inflation accelerated to the quickest pace since
2008.  “China is perceived as the economic engine of the world
right now,” said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG
Defensive Beta Fund and president of Suffern, New York-based
Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which manages about $500
million. “Them slowing down by raising  interest rates  at a time
when we have an overhang of high unemployment and low growth in
the U.S., as well as the sovereign debt issues in  Europe , causes
investors to get concerned about what the impact will be on our
markets and economies.”  Financials Slump  Shares of financial companies fell 0.6 percent as a group
today, the second-most among 10 industries in the S&P 500. Bank
of America, the largest U.S. lender, declined 2.4 percent to
$10.74. JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
retreated 1.2 percent to $40.56.  Costco Wholesale, the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain,
advanced 1.7 percent to $82.64 as an index of consumer staples
stocks rallied 0.6 percent, the most among 10 industries in the
S&P 500.  General Motors Co. (GM)  advanced 1.1 percent to $31.19 after
Morgan Stanley upgraded U.S. carmakers to “attractive” from
“in line.” The brokerage named GM as its top pick among
automakers.  News Corp. (NWSA)  fell 3.2 percent to $17.94. The company’s News
of the World, the tabloid accused of hacking into a murder
victim’s voicemail, is losing advertisers including GM’s
Vauxhall brand and Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
