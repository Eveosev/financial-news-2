OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s largest
producer of the metal, rose the most in two months as gold
climbed and UralSib Financial Corp. recommended investors buy
the shares before a reverse takeover by KazakhGold Group Ltd.
this month.  The stock gained 4.4 percent to 1,764.10 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest increase on a closing basis
since April 29.  Dmitry Smolin, an equity analyst at UralSib Financial
Corp., said the buyback offer price implies a “13 percent
upside” for investors in Polyus Gold.  “We recommend investors buy Polyus Gold’s shares now and
then sell them to the company during the buyback offer to
minorities, which will take place shortly after completion of
the deal,” Smolin said in a report e-mailed today. The deal is
expected to be completed on July 19.  Polyus Gold and KazakhGold announced on June 17 their
proposed combination, which would result in KazakhGold acquiring
“all or substantially all” of Polyus’s shares. Gold prices
increased as much as 0.6 percent in  London  today.  The reverse takeover will result in KazakhGold acquiring
94.8 percent of Polyus Gold’s share capital, according to the
note. Under Russian law, KazakhGold will own more than 75
percent of Polyus Gold and will be obliged to make an offer to
the remaining minorities of Polyus Gold, Uralsib said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
