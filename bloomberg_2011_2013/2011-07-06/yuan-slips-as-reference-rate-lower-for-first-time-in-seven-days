Yuan forwards declined for a second
day after the central bank lowered the daily fixing by the most
in seven weeks.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the  reference rate  0.10
percent weaker at 6.4715, the first reduction since June 27. The
currency isn’t allowed to trade more than 0.5 percent on either
side of the fixing. The yuan is still trading near a 17-year
high after the central bank warned this week that China still
faces “large” inflationary pressures.  Fluctuations in the reference rate are to “encourage two-
way trading instead of one-way bets,” said Ho Woei Chen, a
Singapore-based economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “In the
short term, people are still looking at the PBOC letting the
currency appreciate to address some of the inflationary
impact.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.17 percent to
6.3910 per dollar as of 4:43 p.m. in  Hong Kong , a 1.1 percent
premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yuan was little changed at 6.4670 per dollar at the
close, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency touched 6.4599 on July 4, the strongest level since the
country unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.08
percent to 6.4645.  Consumer prices climbed 5.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most in 34 months, official data show. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said last month the government would have difficulties
meeting its annual 4 percent inflation target although the
overall level of prices is “controllable” and is expected to
drop steadily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
