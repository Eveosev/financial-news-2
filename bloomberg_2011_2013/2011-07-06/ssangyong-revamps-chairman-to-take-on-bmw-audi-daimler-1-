Ssangyong Motor Co. (003620) , the South Korean
unit of  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , starts selling its revamped
Chairman sedan tomorrow as it aims to lure buyers from rivals
including Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s 7-series.  The new Chairman W model was unveiled at a press briefing
in Seoul today. Ssangyong will start exporting cars to India
“soon,” Lee Yoo Il, chief executive officer of the Indian
automaker’s subsidiary, told reporters.  The new model sells for between 57 million won ($53,500)
and 107 million won, and will compete with Daimler AG’s
Mercedes-Benz S class models, Audi AG’s A8 and BMW 7-series
sedans, according to a statement by the company. Ssangyong
intends to spend more than 240 billion won on product
development and brand building this year,  Pawan Goenka , head of
Mumbai-based Mahindra’s auto division, said in March.  The reworked model’s new features include auto-leveling
headlamps and so-called 4-tronic all-wheel drive system.  Ssangyong sales have surged 66 percent overseas and 46
percent in South Korea for the first five months of this year,
according to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.  The Pyeongtaek, South Korea-based company maintained its
export target of 50,000 sport-utility vehicles a year to  China 
by 2013, Choi said.  Sales will probably jump 50 percent to 120,000 units this
year, from 80,215 units in 2010, said Choi, reiterating an
earlier forecast.  Mahindra, India’s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles
and tractors, completed its purchase of a 70 percent stake in
Ssangyong earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
