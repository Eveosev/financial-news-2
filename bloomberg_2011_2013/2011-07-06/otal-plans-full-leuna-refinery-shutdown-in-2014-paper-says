Total SA (FP)  plans to halt its Leuna
refinery in  Germany  in 2014 for a full shutdown, Mitteldeutsche
Zeitung  reported  on its website, without saying where it got the
information.  The Leuna plant, southwest of Berlin, can process 227,000
barrels a day, according to Bloomberg data. Refineries in
Germany close roughly every five years for a mandatory safety
inspection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
