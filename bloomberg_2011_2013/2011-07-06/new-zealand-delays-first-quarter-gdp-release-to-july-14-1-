New Zealand ’s statistics office
delayed the release of its first-quarter gross domestic product
report for a second time because “quality assurance work” is
taking longer than expected.  The report, previously set to be issued at 10:45 a.m.
tomorrow in Wellington, will be released July 14, the agency
said today, citing a need for more time to analyze data covering
a period that included a Feb. 22 earthquake in Christchurch. The
original release date was June 23.  “The quality assurance work for the March quarter has
taken longer than expected and we have now decided that another
week is required to ensure the quality of the results,”
 Statistics New Zealand  said.  The central bank forecast the economy expanded 0.3 percent
in the first quarter, matching the median of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The quake killed more than 180
people and wrecked buildings in the nation’s second-biggest
city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
