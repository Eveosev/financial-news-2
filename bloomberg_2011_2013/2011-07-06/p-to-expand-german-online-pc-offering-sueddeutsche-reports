Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  plans to expand
its online offering of personal computers in  Germany  and be a
“more aggressive player,”  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported,
citing  Todd Bradley , the head of the unit that includes PCs.  Corporate customers are driving sales in the country, while
consumers are more hesitant than the  Palo Alto , California-based
company would like, the Munich-based newspaper cited Bradley as
saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
