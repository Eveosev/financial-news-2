OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
potash producer by output, climbed for a second day before its
weighting in MSCI’s Russia Index is increased at the close of
trading today.  The shares added 3 percent to 264.70 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow after jumping 5.9 percent yesterday.  The decision to increase Uralkali’s weighting comes after
the company acquired its competitor OAO Silvinit, MSCI Inc. said
in a statement e-mailed on July 4.  “Uralkali will move from tenth to seventh-largest stock in
the MSCI Russia Index,”  Ovanes Oganisian , a strategist at
 Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed report today. “The
change, we believe, will stimulate additional buying of Uralkali
shares to the value of around $1 billion from index-benchmarking
funds, including around $100 million from index-tracking
funds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
