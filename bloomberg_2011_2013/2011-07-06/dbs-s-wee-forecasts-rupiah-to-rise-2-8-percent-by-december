Philip Wee , a senior currency
economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, comments on
the outlook for the Indonesian rupiah in a telephone interview
today. DBS predicts the currency will strengthen 1.5 percent to
8,400 per dollar by third quarter and 2.8 percent to 8,300 by
year-end.  “Indonesia’s higher budget deficit of 2 percent of GDP for
2011 on higher  oil prices  was, unsurprisingly, taken in stride
by the market. They have better growth prospects, lower debt and
high foreign reserves which can support in the strengthening of
the rupiah.  ‘‘Indonesia’s ratings upgrades, versus downgrades in the
weak EU peripheral nations, underscore the difference between
emerging countries with strong international liquidity positions
as opposed to fiscal deficit or public debt problems in the
advanced economies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
