President  Barack Obama , responding to
questions submitted over Twitter Inc.’s service, said he wishes
he had done more in the early part of his term to explain to
Americans the depth of the recession.  “People may not have been prepared for how long this was
going to take,” Obama said, in response to a query about
whether he had made mistakes. Recovery in the housing industry
has been “the most stubborn,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
