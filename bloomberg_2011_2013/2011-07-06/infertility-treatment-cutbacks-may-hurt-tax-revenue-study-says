Cutting subsidies for infertility
treatment may end up costing governments money in the long run,
according to a study of Danish policy.  Denmark , which began requiring co-payments for the therapy
this year, will see a 30 percent to 50 percent reduction in
babies born using the technology, according to the study
released today at the annual meeting of the  European Society of
Human Reproduction and Embryology  in  Stockholm . About 1,567
children were born in public clinics using assisted reproductive
technology in 2009, the researchers said.  Denmark’s policy will cost the government as much as 123
million euros in  tax revenue  in 2059, the researchers said. The
country will save as much as 111 million euros ($160 million) in
2034, the study found. Children conceived with medical help
represent 4 percent to 5 percent of the workforce in some
countries, and may ease budget pressures brought on by aging
populations and low birth rates, the researchers said.  “What seems like a cost now is actually an investment,”
said lead researcher  Mark Connolly , a health economist and guest
lecturer at the  University of Groningen  in the Netherlands, by
phone. “By removing it, you may win in the short term but you
lose in the long term.”  Denmark began requiring people seeking fertility treatments
to help pay for the procedure on Jan. 1 after parliament  passed
legislation  to save about 200 million kroner ($39 million) this
year. The number of procedures has  almost doubled  over 10 years,
to 37,283 in 2010, according to industry organization Dansk
Fertilitetsselskab.  Researchers subtracted the cost of fertility treatment,
estimated at 11,097 euros, and other government-provided
services such as health care and education, from the amount of
taxes a child would pay. They found a 25-year-old would
represent a loss to the government of 155,700 euros, while a 50-
year-old would have contributed 154,360 euros.  Fifty-year-olds born to women over 40, for whom treatment
costs more, would represent a gain of 139,600 euros, the study
found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
