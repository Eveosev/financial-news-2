Latvia may need fewer budget cuts
than previously estimated to meet its 2012 deficit target as the
economy recovers from a two-year recession, Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis said.  “According to the latest updates, which have been
confirmed by the central bank and  Finance Ministry , the size of
the consolidation will be between 100 million lati ($203.1
million) and 110 million lati,” Dombrovskis said today in an
 interview  with Latvian Independent Television.  The European Commission and  International Monetary Fund ,
which loaned Latvia 7.5 billion euros ($10.8 billion) in 2008,
had said the Baltic nation may need to trim as much as 180
million lati from next year’s budget to reduce the deficit to
2.5 percent of gross domestic product from 7.7 percent in 2010.
Latvia’s economy grew 3.5 percent from a year earlier in the
first quarter, having exited recession in mid-2010.  In addition to spending cuts, the 2012 budget may include
some small increases in the real-estate tax, Dombrovskis said.
Latvia implemented spending reductions and tax increases equal
to 16 percent of gross domestic product after its 2008 bailout.  Dombrovskis, who was re-elected in October, may face fresh
elections in September if voters back a July 23 referendum to 
dissolve parliament.  President Valdis Zatlers called the referendum in May after
lawmakers failed to lift the immunity of a member targeted by an
anti-corruption probe.  “I will vote in favor,” Dombrovskis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
