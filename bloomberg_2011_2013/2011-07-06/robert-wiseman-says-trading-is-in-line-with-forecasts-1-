Robert Wiseman Dairies Plc (RWD) , a
Scottish provider of fresh milk, said trading in the 13 weeks to
July 2 was in line with management forecasts.  The company expects to benefit from an increase in business
with Co-Operative Group Ltd. from next month, it said in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service today. Wiseman said it
will supply all of the Co-Op’s own-brand milk requirements.  The Glasgow-based company said that, while it’s experienced
pressure on margins and higher input costs in the past 12
months, its cash flows and finances are strong.  Diesel costs are volatile and are about 15 percent higher
than in the comparable period last year, while the cost of resin
used in making plastic bottles has risen 18 percent, Wiseman
said. The company expects to increase its farm-gate milk price
in the autumn, as it needs to ensure supplies during the winter.  Wiseman shares have fallen 5.6 percent in the year to date,
leaving the company with a market value of 228.9 million pounds
($366 million). The shares closed at 4:35 p.m. up 2.5 percent,
at 323.5 pence, in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
