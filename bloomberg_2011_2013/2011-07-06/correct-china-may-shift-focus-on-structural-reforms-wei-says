Wei Yao, economist of Societe
Generale Asia Ltd., comments on the People’s Bank of  China ’s
decision to raise benchmark lending and deposit rates by 25
basis points from tomorrow.  The interest rate increase “sends a signal that macro-
level liquidity conditions may remain tight or prudent, while
micro-level adjustments will take place to address specific
difficulties of certain sectors. Given recent soft data, we
think this interest rate hike will be the only big monetary
policy move for some time. China’s policy makers are likely to
shift their focus on” structural reforms, including consumption,
SMEs, and local government debt.  “The dampening impact of this rate hike on the real
economy will be limited as market interest rates are already
much higher than benchmark rates. On the other hand, it may help
deposit growth and support money creation through the banking
system, instead of via unregulated shadow banking system.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
