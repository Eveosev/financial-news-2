Employers in the U.S. announced more
job cuts in June than a year earlier, the first increase since
February and a sign the labor market is struggling to improve.  Planned firings rose 5.3 percent to 41,432 last month from
June 2010, according to figures released today by Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Job-cut announcements were led
by government agencies.  The figures are consistent with others indicating weaker
demand in the first half of 2011 has prompted some companies to
trim their workforces. Employers in June probably boosted
payrolls at a pace that failed to reduce the jobless rate,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before a report in two
days.  “The employment picture remains a bit cloudy,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray &
Christmas, said in a statement. “Hiring is coming in spurts and
is not quite robust enough to make a significant dent in
unemployment.”  Announced job reductions in the first half of 2011 were
down 17 percent from the same period in 2010. Compared with May,
job-cut announcements climbed 12 percent. Because the figures
aren’t adjusted for seasonal effects, economists prefer to focus
on year-over-year changes rather than monthly numbers.  Government and non-profit agencies led the firings with
10,176 announcements in June. Government job cuts in the first
six months of 2011 totaled 77,591, down from 99,676 firings at
the same time in 2010.  Cuts in Connecticut  Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy announced a plan last
week to cut about 6,500 jobs after workers rejected a proposal
to close the state’s $1.6 billion budget gap that would include
some union pay and benefit concessions. Union leaders have until
Aug. 31 under the proposal to revive the concession deal and
avoid job cuts.  Today’s report showed  California  led all states with 3,090
announced job cuts in June, followed by Texas with 2,945.  Hiring plans picked up in June, the report showed.
Employers announced plans to add 15,498 workers, up from 11,732
in the same month last year.  Payrolls climbed by 100,000 workers in June, after a 54,000
increase that was the smallest in eight months, a Labor
Department report is expected to show on July 8, according to
the median forecast of a Bloomberg News survey. Economists
predict the  unemployment rate  will remain at 9.1 percent in
June.  Cuts at Gannett  The slow economic recovery is part of the reason Gannett
Co. is eliminating about 700 jobs in its community-newspaper
unit, Bob Dickey president of Gannett’s U.S. community
publishing division said in a memo. Bethesda, Maryland-based
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  also announced that it will fire about
1,500 employees from its aeronautics business unit.  The aerospace and defense industry has announced 20,857
planned firings so far in 2011, compared with 6,121 in the same
period a year ago, according to today’s report.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose job are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
