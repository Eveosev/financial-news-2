RBC Capital Markets  said  Portugal ’s
government bonds will probably be removed from a Markit iBoxx
sovereign debt index after Moody’s Investors Service cut the
nation’s credit rating to below investment grade.  The average rating between Moody’s,  Standard & Poor’s , and
 Fitch Ratings  will “drop to sub-investment grade in the
definition used by iBoxx, and Portuguese government bonds will
consequently drop out of the iBoxx Euro Area Sovereign Index
after the month-end index adjustment,” Norbert Aul, a European
rates strategist in London, wrote in a note received yesterday.  Because the move will add to the “negative” market
environment, RBC ended recommendations to buy Spanish two-year
notes against similar-maturity German debt and to sell September
bund futures, Aul wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
