Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for the
first day in three as demand for dollars by companies dropped
after the currency retreated to 89 per dollar yesterday.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.2 percent to 89.60 and was trading 0.1 percent
lower at 89.70 per dollar by 12:52 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital,
from yesterday’s close of 89.80.  “The shilling has recouped lost ground as businesses ease
their dollar-accumulation drive, providing the local unit with
relief,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
