Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA) , a producer of
coal in  South Africa , surged the most almost eight months after
saying it will resume mining at its Vele project after getting
environmental approval for the venture, located near a United
Nations World Heritage site.  The stock advanced 1.20 rand, or 15 percent, to 9.29 rand
as of 9:03 a.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest intraday increase
since Nov. 12.  The company, based in Perth,  Australia  is required to meet
specific conditions at Vele because of the “uniqueness of the
area,” it said in a statement today, without giving further
details. The project is about 17 miles (27 kilometers) from the
Mapungubwe Hill ruins, once one of southern  Africa ’s biggest
settlements.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
