An investigation into match-fixing in
Turkey’s national soccer league casts uncertainty over the
country’s 500 million-euro ($720 million) annual “soccer
economy,”  Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  Companies including mobile-phone operator Avea Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS, landline operator  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) ,
sweets producer  Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS (ULKER)  and broadcaster Digiturk
are awaiting results of the probe before making decisions on
their investments and sponsorships in the league, the Istanbul-
based newspaper reported, citing company officials.  The income of Istanbul’s big three clubs --
Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas -- totaled more than 600
million liras ($370 million) last year, Hurriyet said. Digiturk
pays $420 million a year to broadcast league matches, Hurriyet
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
