Thermax Ltd. (TMX) , a power-equipment maker
backed by  India ’s third-richest woman, introduced a solar air
conditioner to target a market for smaller and more efficient
cooling appliances.  The cooling system, installed at a government building in
Gurgaon in northern Haryana state, takes up 30 percent less
space and is 20 percent more efficient than similar solar air
conditioners currently available, Thermax said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “India will consume 35 percent of its entire electricity
generated only for cooling and air conditioning,” Thermax Chief
Executive Officer M.S. Unnikrishnan said in the statement. Solar
energy use in such applications is promising because cooling
needs are greatest in daylight hours, it said.  Thermax’s system can service industrial and commercial
buildings needing as much as 3 megawatts of capacity and can
switch to natural gas when sunlight isn’t available, it said. It
uses solar parabolic concentrators to run absorption chillers
that work on heat instead of electricity, it said.  Thermax, based in Pune, makes conventional turbines and
equipment for water treatment plants and air pollution control.
