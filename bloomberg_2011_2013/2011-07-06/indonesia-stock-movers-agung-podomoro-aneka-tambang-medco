Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  dropped 15.17 points, or 0.4
percent, to 3,908.96, declining for a second day.  Banks: PT Bank Rakyat  Indonesia  (BBRI IJ), the nation’s
largest bank by revenue, fell 1.5 percent to 6,600 rupiah, the
second-biggest drag on the composite index, after gaining 8.1
percent in the two weeks ended July 1. PT Bank Negara Indonesia
(BBNI IJ), the third-largest state-owned lender which rose 7.6
percent over the same two-week period, retreated 1.9 percent to
3,800 rupiah.  The shares fell on speculation their rally was excessive,
according to Nico Omer Jonckheere, vice president for research
and analysis at PT Valbury Asia Securities in Jakarta. “Banks
have had a good rally during the last two or three weeks,” said
Jonckheere. “If people take some profit that’s normal.”  PT Agung Podomoro Land (APLN IJ), a property developer,
rose 3 percent to 340 rupiah, closing at its highest since June
22. Agung Podomoro plans to sell 800 billion rupiah ($94
million) of bonds this year as alternative funding for capital
expenditure,  Bisnis Indonesia  reported, without saying where it
got the information. President Director Trihatma Kusuma Haliman
couldn’t be reached when called at his office.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM IJ), Indonesia’s second-biggest
nickel mining company, added 1.2 percent to 2,150 rupiah, the
highest close since June 6. Nickel futures advanced for a third
straight day, rising as much as 1.2 percent to $23,580 a metric
ton today in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
