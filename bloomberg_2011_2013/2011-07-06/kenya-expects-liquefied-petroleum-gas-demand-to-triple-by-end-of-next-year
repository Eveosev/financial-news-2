Kenya , East Africa’s biggest economy,
expects consumption of liquefied petroleum gas to triple by the
end of next year, said Commissioner for Petroleum Energy Martin
Heya.  Annual consumption is forecast to jump to 300,000 metric
tons from 100,000 tons because of the construction of a “very
big import and storage facility” in Mombasa by Africa Gas & Oil
Co., Heya said in an interview today in Nairobi, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
