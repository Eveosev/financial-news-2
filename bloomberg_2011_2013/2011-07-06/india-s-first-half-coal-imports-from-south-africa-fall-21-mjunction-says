India ’s imports of coal from South
Africa fell 21 percent in the first half of 2011 from a year
earlier while Chinese purchases rose 18 percent, according to
India Coal Market Watch, published by Kolkata-based online
trading company mjunction Services Ltd.  Purchases by India shrank to 7.55 million metric tons
through June, with imports last month almost unchanged from a
year earlier at 1.2 million tons, according to the report e-
mailed to mjunction clients and obtained by Bloomberg.  China ’s
imports increased to 3.14 million tons in January to June.  South Africa supplied 27.42 million tons of the fuel
globally in the first six months of the year, according to the
note. Exports in June were 19 percent higher compared with a
year earlier at 4.78 million tons.  Coal prices at  South Africa ’s  Richards Bay , which the
operator says is the world’s single largest coal-export
terminal, fell 0.5 percent to $117.06 a ton in the week ended
July 1, data from Petersfield, U.K.-based researcher IHS
McCloskey showed. China and India accounted for about 39 percent
of exports of the fuel from South Africa in the first half,
according to mjunction.  Asia  imported 17.7 million tons of coal from South Africa
in the first half, up 1.7 percent from a year earlier, according
to the note. Shipments in June totaled 2.6 million tons.
