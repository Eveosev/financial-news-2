Asia gasoil processing profit
rebounded, while  fuel oil  loss fell as demand for power-
generation fuels rose in  China . Oil-product swaps gained after
crude oil traded near a three-week high in  New York .  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, rose $1.06, or 6.2 percent, to $18.09 a
barrel at 10:33 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and refined-products
broker. Yesterday, the spread dropped to $17.03 a barrel, the
lowest in more than a week.  July swaps for gasoil rose $2.10, or 1.7 percent, to
$125.68 a barrel, retracing yesterday’s losses, PVM data showed.
Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, was unchanged at
$1 a barrel.  Crude for August delivery was at $97.41 a barrel, up 52
cents, or 0.5 percent, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 11:46 a.m. Singapore time.  China’s power generation hit a record of 14.3 billion
kilowatt-hours on July 4 because of a heat wave, State Grid
Corp. of China, the nation’s dominant power distributor, said in
a statement on the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission website today.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed by 19 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $7.85 a metric ton, PVM data showed. The spread
was at $8.04 a ton yesterday, the biggest discount since June
15. High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps rose $8, or 1.3 percent, to
$648.30 a ton.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade increased by 25 cents to $10 a ton. The wider spread
signals that power-station grade fuel oil prices rose faster
than shipping-fuel grades.  Light Distillates  July swaps for naphtha rose $9, or 1 percent, to $954 a
ton, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, rose to
$97.53 a ton from $80.21 at the end of Asian trading yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  LG Chem Ltd. was running a naphtha cracker at Daesan,  South
Korea , at full rates after shutting the unit partially yesterday
to change parts, ICIS reported, citing a company spokesman it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
