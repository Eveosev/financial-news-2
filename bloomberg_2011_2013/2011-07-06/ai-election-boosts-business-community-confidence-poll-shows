Thailand ’s business community is less
concerned about political unrest in the country following the
July 3 election, which saw the opposition Pheu Thai party win a
majority in parliament, according to a poll.  The poll conducted by the University of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce showed that 51 percent of respondents described
Thailand’s political stability as “medium” after the election,
compared with 58 percent who rated stability “low” before the
poll. The university surveyed 820 people on July 4 and July 5,
Thanavath Phonvichai, an economist at the university, said at a
media briefing in Bangkok today.  Pheu Thai, backed by exiled former premier  Thaksin
Shinawatra , won 265 seats in the 500-strong Parliament, beating
Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva ’s Democrat party, which won 159
seats. Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin’s youngest sister, will
become the nation’s first female prime minister, and named a
five-party coalition to broaden her mandate.  “The private sector still thinks that politics is a key
negative factor for businesses,” Thanavath said. About 65.3
percent of people surveyed said their business would be affected
by any further political instability.  A period of political stability may allow Thailand’s
economy to expand 4 percent to 5 percent this year, compared
with 3.5 percent to 4 percent predicted earlier, Thanavath said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
