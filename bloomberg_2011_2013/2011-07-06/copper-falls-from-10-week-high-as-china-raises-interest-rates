Copper fell from a 10-week high after
 China , the world’s leading metal consumer, raised  interest rates 
for the third time this year to curb inflation, spurring concern
that demand for raw materials will ebb.  The one-year lending rate will increase a quarter-point to
6.56 percent tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said. Copper
dropped 3.7 percent in the six months ended June 30 as Chinese
imports slumped. The metal also fell after a report that  service
industries  in the U.S. expanded at a slower pace in June. The
country is the second-biggest user.  “The Chinese rate increase is putting downward pressure on
the market,” said Phil Streible, a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .  Copper futures for September delivery declined 1.25 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to close at $4.335 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Yesterday, the price reached $4.354, the
highest for a most-active contract since April 27.  “We might still see some summer weakness in base metals,
because there is a seasonal slowdown in demand,” said Christin Tuxen, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $19, or 0.2 percent, to $9,521 a metric ton
($4.32 a pound).  Aluminum and zinc also fell in London. Tin and nickel rose.
