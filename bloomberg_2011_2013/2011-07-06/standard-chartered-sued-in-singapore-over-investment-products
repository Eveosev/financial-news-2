Standard Chartered  Bank Plc was sued
by Thai businessman Chatchai Yenbamroong in  Singapore  for $2
million, claiming the bank gave him negligent and fraudulent
investment information.  Yenbamroong invested the money in a U.S. dollar callable
note which the London-based bank had falsely misrepresented as a
principal-protected conservative investment, the Thai
businessman said in his lawsuit filed with the Singapore High
Court on June 29. The case is scheduled to have its first closed
hearing on Aug. 10.  The businessman was induced by his Standard Chartered
banker to sign a blank account opening form, according to the
claim. The bank didn’t provide him with terms and conditions or
ask him for an investor profile before he opened the account in
2009, said Yenbamroong.  Standard Chartered, which hasn’t filed its defense, denied
liability on June 10 through its lawyers at Allen & Gledhill LLP
according to the lawsuit. Ally Lim, a Singapore-based
spokeswoman at Standard Chartered, declined to comment as did
Niru Pillai, the lawyer acting for Yenbamroong.  Standard Chartered, which gets most of its income from
 Asia , “recklessly disregarded the reasonable standards expected
of them as bankers,” according to Yenbamroong’s court filing.
Yenbamroong is the executive director of Northern Gulf Oil, a
Thailand-based company which was awarded oil concessions in the
Gulf of  Thailand  in 2007, according to the lawsuit.  The case is Chatchai Yenbamroong v Standard Chartered Bank
S456/2011 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
