U.K. stocks retreated, snapping an
eight-day rally for the benchmark FTSE 100 Index, as banks and
oil and gas companies dropped.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  slid 2.1 percent,  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  fell 1.2 percent and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  sank 1.3
percent after Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal’s credit
rating to below investment grade.  The FTSE 100 lost 0.5 percent to 5,996.28 at 8:41 a.m. in
London, halting its longest winning streak in almost two years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
