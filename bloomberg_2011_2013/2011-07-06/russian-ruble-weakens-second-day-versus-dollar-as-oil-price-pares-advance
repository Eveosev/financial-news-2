The ruble slid to its lowest level in
a week versus the dollar as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
declined after China’s central bank raised rates.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 28.0065 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest since June 28.
The ruble was 0.6 percent stronger at 40.09 per euro, leaving it
steady at 33.4441 versus the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Crude tumbled as much as 1 percent in  New York  as the
People’s Bank of China said benchmark deposit and lending rates
will rise 25 basis points tomorrow. The euro weakened against
the dollar after Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal’s rating
to junk status, curbing the appeal of dollar-denominated
commodities.  Russian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond up three basis points to 6.886 percent. Non-
deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations of
currency movements and allow companies to hedge against them,
show the ruble at 28.2607 per dollar in three months, compared
with 28.1225 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
