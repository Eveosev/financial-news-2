(Corrects spelling of  World Bank  representative in third
paragraph.)  The World Bank approved a $150
million loan to Ethiopia to improve urban governance,
infrastructure and public services, the lender said in an e-
mailed  statement  today.  The so-called Ethiopia Urban Local Government Development
Project has already provided grants for infrastructure to 19
cities, while another 18 have received “capacity building
support,” the Washington-based bank said.  The project “will have important lessons for other
countries across the region tackling the challenge of managing
their ever growing cities and towns,” said Greg Toulmin, the
acting country director for the World Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
