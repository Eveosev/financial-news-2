DG FastChannel Inc. (DGIT) , the network
operator that links advertisers with radio and television
stations, is seeking $640 million in loans to support its
acquisition of  MediaMind Technologies Inc. (MDMD) , according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are hosting
a lender meeting tomorrow in New York at 1:30 p.m. to discuss
the transaction, which includes a $490 million, seven-year term
loan and a five-year revolving credit line of as much as $150
million, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the deal is private.  Irving, Texas-based DG FastChannel is buying New York-based
MediaMind in a transaction with an equity value of $517 million
and an enterprise value of $414 million, according to a June 16
statement.  The deal will be funded by the committed debt financing and
available cash, the companies said.  In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
