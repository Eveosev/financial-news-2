Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  rose for a 13th day
in Santiago trading, a record winning streak, on speculation
that Latin America’s largest carrier by market value will
receive approval on its takeover of Brazil’s  Tam SA. (TAMM4)   Lan climbed 2.7 percent to 14,276 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time. Lan was Chile’s most active stock today in value, with
12.3 billion pesos ($27 million) changing hands. Tam gained 2.4
percent to 37.35 reais in  Sao Paulo , its fourth day of gains.  “It’s all speculation on a positive ruling,” Pablo Solis,
who helps manage about $5 billion for BCI Asset Management in
Santiago, said today.  Chile’s antitrust tribunal, known as TDLC, is studying the
merger proposal at the request of a consumer defense
association. The plan remains to announce a ruling before the
end of July, TDLC secretary Alejandro Domic said today in an e-
mailed response to questions.  Lan said July 1 that German regulators had approved the
tie-up. The deal was first announced in August.  Tam’s Mauricio Amaro, who will be chairman of the combined
company, said May 26 he’s “confident, but not sure” of
regulatory clearance. The transaction is also subject to
approval from  Brazil ’s antitrust agency, known as Cade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
