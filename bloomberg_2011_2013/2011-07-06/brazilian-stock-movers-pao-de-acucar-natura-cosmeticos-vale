The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 0.8 percent to 62,565.46.  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR4
BS) slid 1.8 percent to 69.40 reais, the lowest since June 27, a
day before a plan to merge the retailer with Carrefour SA’s
Brazilian unit became public. Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Charles Naouri said the proposed merger
is strategically flawed,  Valor Economico  reported, citing an
interview with Naouri.  Tam SA (TAMM4)  (TAMM4 BS) gained 2.4 percent to 37.35 reais as Lan
Airlines SA advanced in Santiago trading. Speculation mounted
that  Chile ’s antitrust tribunal will approve Lan’s $4.1 billion
takeover of Tam, according to Pablo Solis, an analyst at BCI
Asset Management in Santiago.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BS) slid 0.2 percent to 23.51
reais after earlier dropping as much as 1.1 percent.  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company followed crude prices lower. Oil
fell after  China ’s central bank raised  interest rates  and
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded  Portugal ’s credit rating,
heightening concern economic growth will slow and crimp fuel
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
