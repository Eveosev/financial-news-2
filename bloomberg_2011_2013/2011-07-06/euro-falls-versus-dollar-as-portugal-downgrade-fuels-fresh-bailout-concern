The euro declined to a one-week low
against the dollar a day after Portugal became the second nation
in the currency region after  Greece  to receive a junk  credit
rating  from Moody’s Investors Service.  The  New Zealand  dollar gained versus the greenback after
the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled a tsunami warning
for the South Pacific nation after an earthquake. The Swiss
franc, yen and dollar rose against most of their major
counterparts as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and China’s
decision to increase interest rates spurred demand for a refuge.  “The markets did not digest the downgrade of Portugal to
junk status all too well,” said  Jessica Hoversen , an analyst at
the futures broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. in New York. “Now
you have two major European economies regarded as junk by
Moody’s. There are contagion fears.”  The euro dropped 0.8 percent to $1.4319 at 5 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.4429 yesterday, after touching $1.4286, the lowest
level since June 28. The euro slid 1 percent to 115.86 yen, from
116.97, after sliding as low as 115.55. The U.S. currency fell
0.2 percent to 80.91 yen, from 81.07.  The  New Zealand dollar  erased gains earlier today after the
 U.S. Geological Survey  reported a magnitude 7.8 earthquake 132
miles off the Kermadec Islands region and a tsunami warning went
into effect for the islands,  Tonga  and New Zealand.  The currency rose 0.2 percent to 82.70 U.S. cents after
falling as much as 0.2 percent. The Australian dollar was little
changed at $1.0701.  Stronger Franc  The Swiss franc appreciated 0.9 percent to 1.2021 against
the euro and advanced 0.2 percent to 83.92 centimes versus the
dollar. The currency benefits from Switzerland’s role as a
stable, neutral financial center.  Sweden’s krona declined 1 percent to 6.3555 versus the
dollar, Norway’s krone slid 0.8 percent to 5.4156 and  Canada ’s
currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 96.53 cents.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
decreased 0.4 percent. Crude oil for August delivery dropped as
much as 1 percent before trading at $96.99 a barrel in New York.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent.  The krona may rally toward its strongest level since 1992
as appetite for higher-yielding assets revives, according to
 MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and  interest-rates 
technical strategy at Bank of America Corp. in New York.  ‘Very Supportive’  “The resumption of risk assets in general is going to be
very supportive of the Swedish krona,” Curry said in a
telephone interview. “The corrective bounce into the June highs
has run its course and a larger downtrend is resuming,” said
Curry, referring to the dollar versus the krona.  The Swedish currency climbed in April 2008 to 5.8218 versus
the dollar, the strongest in 15 years, according to Bloomberg
data. The krona may appreciate to 5.8210, according to Curry.  The dollar remained lower against the yen today after the
Institute for Supply Management in Tempe, Arizona, reported that
its non-manufacturing Index dropped to 53.3 last month from 54.6
in May. The median forecast of 71 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a reduction to 53.7. Readings greater than 50
signal expansion.  The Philippine peso climbed to its strongest level since
May 3 after  Fitch Ratings  forecast the nation’s economy would
expand as much as 6 percent this year and next. The peso
appreciated 0.4 percent to 42.900 per dollar after touching a
two-month high of 42.825, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Moody’s on  Portugal   The euro fell after Moody’s lowered Portugal’s long-term
government bond ratings yesterday to Ba2 from Baa1. The
reductions stem partly from “the growing risk that Portugal
will require a second round of official financing before it can
return to the private market,” Moody’s said in a statement.  Greece received the lowest sovereign credit rating in the
world from S&P on June 13, when the company lowered it to CCC,
eight levels below investment grade. S&P rates Portugal at BBB-,
the lowest investment grade.  The Portuguese 10-year government bond yield jumped today
to a record 12.55 percent, while Irish, Italian, Spanish and
Greek yields also surged on bets more ratings cuts may follow.  “The European situation is really weighing on sentiment,”
said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency research at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. “It’s not only Portugal, but
it’s Italy and  Spain . We had a pretty big rally at the end of
last week, so we’re giving back some of those gains now,”
Nordvig said, referring to the euro.  ECB Outlook  The  European Central Bank  will increase its main
refinancing rate to 1.50 percent tomorrow from 1.25 percent,
according to all 55 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Swaps
traders are betting the ECB will raise its target rate by 76
basis points over the next 12 months.  China  is raising benchmark interest rates for the third
time this year after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace
since July 2008. The one-year deposit rate will rise to 3.5
percent, the People’s Bank of China said on its website today.
The move may fuel concern that monetary tightening will trigger
a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
