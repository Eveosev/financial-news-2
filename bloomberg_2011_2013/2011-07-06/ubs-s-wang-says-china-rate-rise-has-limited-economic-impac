Wang Tao , an economist with UBS AG in
Beijing, comments on the People’s Bank of  China ’s decision to
raise benchmark lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points
from tomorrow.  “The impact on the economy is very limited as China’s main
monetary instrument is credit growth targets, which have been
unchanged since the end of 2010.”  “For companies, rate hikes raise their borrowing costs.
For the stock market, the rate hike may have been priced in and
considered the end of tightening.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
