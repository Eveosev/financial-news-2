The Australian dollar rose for a
second day after a report showed employers added more jobs in
June than economists forecast, easing concern that the nation’s
economy is losing momentum.  The Aussie climbed against 14 of its 16 major counterparts
as the employment gains ended a two-month decline and traders
pared bets on an interest-rate cut by the  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia  this year. New Zealand’s currency reached a 14-month
high against the yen as increases in  oil prices  and U.S. stocks
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  “There’s overall a fairly tight labor market and it keeps
the policy direction of the RBA still pointing toward hikes,”
said Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in Sydney. “The currency’s been extremely resilient
to global factors and is bouncing because the data shows the
economy is fairly well balanced.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.7 percent to $1.0772 at 10:57
a.m. in  New York  from $1.0701 yesterday, when it reached
$1.0655, the least since June 29. The currency gained 1.1
percent to 87.50 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to 83.05 U.S. cents
from 82.70 cents yesterday. It gained 0.8 percent to 67.47 yen
from 66.92 yesterday, after reaching the most since May 10.  The number of people employed in Australia rose by 23,400,
led by a jump in full-time jobs, the statistics bureau said
today. That was higher than the median estimate for a 15,000
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The jobless
rate held at 4.9 percent. Employment dropped by a revised 500 in
May following a 28,300 decline in the previous month.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
climbed 1.6 percent to 345.8, the highest level since June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
