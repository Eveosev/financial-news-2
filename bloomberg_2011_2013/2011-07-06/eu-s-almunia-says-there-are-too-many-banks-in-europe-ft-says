European Union Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said there are too many banks in
 Europe  and there should be more consolidation in the industry,
while the bloc’s fragmented market, without an integrated
payment system, makes competing with banks from the U.S. or
China difficult, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  “I would not have any problem with observing a process of
reducing the number of players at the European Union level,”
Almunia said, according to the newspaper. “We have a lot -- too
many,” he said, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
