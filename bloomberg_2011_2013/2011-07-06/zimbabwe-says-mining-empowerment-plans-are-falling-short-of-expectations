Plans by mining companies in Zimbabwe
to sell majority stakes to locals “fall short” of government
expectations,  Saviour Kasukuwere , indigenisation and economic
empowerment minister, told state-owned television.  “What we are now doing as government is basically to
invoke the law and ensure that we, as government, take over
those assets,” the minister said.  The Zimbabwean government won’t discuss “so-called
empowerment credits” with miners that have invested in social
projects like schools and hospitals, said Kasukuwere, who is a
member of President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front.  Under a new law, foreign-owned miners must cede or sell 51
percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans or government-
approved agencies. The law, known as the Indigenization and
Empowerment Act, doesn’t allow white Zimbabweans or foreigners
to own businesses with assets over $1 million.  About 173 mining companies, many of them closely held,
submitted their plans to the southern African nation’s
government explaining how they will dilute their foreign or
white shareholdings.  Zimbabwe has the world’s second-largest reserves of
platinum and ferrochrome after  South Africa . The empowerment law
affects companies including  Anglo-American Plc (AAL) , Riot Tinto Plc,
 RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ)  and Impala Platinum Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
