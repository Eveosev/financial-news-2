Sytrol,  Syria â€™s state-run oil
company, raised the official selling price of its Souedie crude
for loading in July by $2.65 a barrel to a three-month high, a
company official said.  Souedie crude, also known as Syrian Heavy, will be priced
at $10.60 a barrel less than the Dated Brent benchmark, the
narrowest since April, the official said today, declining to be
identified because of company policy. The discount was at $13.25
for June cargoes.  Sytrol will cut daily exports of the crude for loading in
July from its Mediterranean port Tartous by 37 percent to 87,058
barrels, according to a shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg
News on June 28.  Souedie has a density of 24.1 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 3.9 percent,
according to Energy Intelligence Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
