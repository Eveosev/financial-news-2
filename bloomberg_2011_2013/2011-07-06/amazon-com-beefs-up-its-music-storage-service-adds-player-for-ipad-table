Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, increased the amount of space available to
users of its music-storage service and introduced an application
that plays songs on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  For $20 a year, customers of Cloud Drive now can get
unlimited space for their downloaded music files, the Seattle-
based company said today in a statement. Purchases made through
Amazon’s online store are stored for free.  Amazon’s new Cloud Player for the iPad is similar to
software that the company offers for  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
devices. The program lets users play back music that they’ve
stored on the Web. The upgrade follows the unveiling of Cloud
Player in March, when Amazon joined the ranks of music-streaming
services.  Amazon, Google and Apple are racing to offer entertainment
via cloud computing, which delivers streaming media over the
Internet rather than requiring users to keep it on their hard
drives. Apple introduced its iCloud service in June, letting
users share files across different Internet-linked devices.  Record companies  also have struck licensing deals with
existing music-streaming sites, such as Spotify Ltd., Rdio Inc.
and Music Unlimited. After years of piracy and declining
compact-disc sales, the  music industry  is counting on cloud
services to help them rebound.  Amazon rose $1 to $214.19 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has climbed 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
