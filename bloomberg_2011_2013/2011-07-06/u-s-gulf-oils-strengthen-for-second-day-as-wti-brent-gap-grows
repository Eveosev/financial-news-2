Gulf crude oil grades strengthened as
the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened for
the second straight day.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 60 cents to $13.75 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 4:17 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
strengthened 60 cents to $13.85 over the benchmark.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart widened 25
cents to $16.97 a barrel. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  “This is a reflection of the turnaround today in the
Brent-WTI spread. Earlier this morning, it was under pressure
and we’re seeing differentials recover,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend rose 15 cents to $8.40 a barrel, while Poseidon gained 20
cents to $8.20 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $6.75 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to
$1.20.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed to $21 a
barrel from $22.15 yesterday, and Syncrude’s premium gained 5
cents to $8.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
