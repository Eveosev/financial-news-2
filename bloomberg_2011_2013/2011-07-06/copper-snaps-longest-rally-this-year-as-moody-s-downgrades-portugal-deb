Copper dropped for the first time in
seven days, snapping its longest winning run this year, as
concern about  Europe ’s fiscal crisis resurfaced after Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded  Portugal ’s debt.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange lost as
much as 0.5 percent to $9,493 a metric ton before trading at
$9,514.5 a ton by 5:10 p.m. Singapore time. The metal touched a
10-week high yesterday on speculation  China  is near the end of a
monetary tightening cycle. Zinc and lead also declined before a
report this week that economists say may show the U.S.
unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent even as payrolls climbed.  “Europe’s debt crisis is a long-term problem which will
weigh on investor sentiment as and when there’re new
developments that show the situation is not good,” Mo Zhe, a
trader at First Capital Futures Co., said from Beijing. “The
next cue will come from the ECB meeting and U.S. payrolls.”  Moody’s cut Portugal’s credit rating yesterday to below
investment grade on concern it will need to follow  Greece  in
seeking a second international bailout. European finance
ministers will meet July 11 to discuss the Greek rescue plan.  The  European Central Bank  will probably increase its main
refinancing rate to 1.50 percent from 1.25 percent on July 7,
according to all 55 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
next day, a report will probably show U.S. payrolls climbed by
100,000 workers in June after a 54,000 increase in the previous
month, while the jobless rate was unchanged.  Shanghai, New York  Copper for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 0.9 percent to 70,990 yuan ($10,976)
a ton and aluminum gained as much as 1 percent to 17,465 yuan,
the highest price since Feb. 22, 2010.  “During the current slow demand season, Chinese prices are
led by international prices rather than the demand and supply
situation,” said Mo.  Aluminum in  London  lost 0.4 percent to $2,565 a ton, after
rising 2.6 percent yesterday, the most since March 17. Tin
gained as much as 2.5 percent to $27,000 a ton, the highest
price since June 3. Zinc dropped 0.3 percent to $2,403 a ton,
lead declined 0.1 percent to $2,697 a ton, while nickel climbed
0.4 percent to $23,383 a ton.  “While the complex remains prone to macro bear sentiment
in the near term, we expect the macro and physical environment
to improve,” Deutsche Bank AG analyst Xiao Fu wrote in the
bank’s quarterly report yesterday. A recovery of industrial
activity and an acceleration of the public housing program in
China will provide support in the second half, Xiao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
