BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s Chairman Michel Pebereau said a plan put forward by French banks last month to
roll over Greek sovereign debt needs changes after Standard &
Poor’s said the proposal may trigger a default rating on  Greece .  “There is a need to try to find a solution that avoids a
default, because we have been asked by the authorities for a
plan that does not lead to a default,” Pebereau said in an
interview on BFM radio today. “Different solutions have been
put on the table.”  About 20 banks and insurers met with the Institute of
International Finance in Paris to examine proposals to roll over
maturing bonds into new Greek securities.  Standard & Poor’s 
roiled markets on July 4 when it said the French plan, which
includes a proposal to roll over 70 percent of bonds maturing by
mid-2014 into new 30-year Greek securities backed by AAA-rated
collateral, would likely trigger a default rating.  Asked about the risks of contagion from Greece to  Portugal 
and other countries sharing the euro, Pebereau said that the
Greek case is “different” from Portugal and Ireland.  “Investors on the markets may fear that what’s happening
to Greece repeats on Portugal,” Pebereau said. “There are no
reasons that it will be so.”  BNP Paribas,  Europe ’s largest bank by assets, held 5
billion euros ($7.2 billion) of Greek government debt at the end
of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
