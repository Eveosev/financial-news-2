Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its 20-year  India 
market forecast 15 percent, at least the second increase in a
row, as rising wages stoke air travel in Asia’s third-biggest
economy.  The country’s carriers will need 1,320 planes, worth $150
billion, in the period, the Chicago-based planemaker said in a
 statement  late yesterday on its website. The company predicted
demand for 1,150 planes in a 20-year forecast last year.  Indian air passenger traffic may expand 8.1 percent a year
over “the long term” because of the nation’s economic growth,
Boeing said. Budget carriers IndiGo and Go Airlines (India) Ltd.
last month signed orders for 252 Airbus SAS planes because of
rising demand.  Indian airlines boosted passenger numbers 18 percent in the
first five months of the year to 24.5 million, according to the
Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The regulator doesn’t
provide data for international travel.  Boeing expects 33,500 global orders for passenger and
freighter planes through 2030, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
