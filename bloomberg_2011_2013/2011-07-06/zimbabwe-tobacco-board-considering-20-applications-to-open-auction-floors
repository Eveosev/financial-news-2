Zimbabwe is considering at least 20
applications from companies wanting to start tobacco sales in
the country as existing auction houses battle to cope with
rising supplies from farmers.  “We are reviewing the applications,” said Andrew Matibiri, chief executive officer of the Tobacco Industry and
Marketing Board, which oversees the industry, by phone today
from the capital, Harare. Zimbabwe currently has three auction
floors, he said.  The southern African nation is trying to boost tobacco
output, still below peak levels of about 236 million kilograms
(520 million pounds) achieved in 2000, before President  Robert Mugabe ’sZimbabwe African National Union-Front party sponsored
often-violent seizures of most white-owned farms.  Production slipped to as low as 58.6 million kilograms in
2009, reflecting the political and economic crisis that peaked
during 2008. Output of the leaf may rise to about 170 million
kilograms this season as more farmers grow the crop and as the
nation’s “economic environment” improves, Matibiri said in an
interview on Feb. 16.  “We have sold 120.9 million kilograms so far and judging
by these figures it looks like we will end the season at around
145 million kilograms,” he said today. The quality of the leaf
so far this season has “been really good.”  Zimbabwe has earned $331 million from tobacco sales so far
this season, up from about $276 million at the same point last
year, Matibiri said.  Zimbabwe is the world’s sixth-largest exporter of the flue-
cured variety of the leaf, which is also known as Virginia
tobacco. It lags behind  Brazil ,  India , the U.S., Argentina and
Tanzania, according to the website of Universal Corp., the
world’s biggest tobacco-leaf merchant.
