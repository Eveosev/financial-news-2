Armen Gilliam, who played 13 National
Basketball Association seasons and in college for the University
of  Nevada , Las Vegas, died last night at the age of 47.  Gilliam collapsed while playing basketball at a gym in
Bridgeville, Pennsylvania, and was transported to St. Clair
Hospital in Pittsburgh before being pronounced dead, the
Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office said.  An autopsy had yet to be completed.  Gilliam was the second overall pick in the 1987 NBA draft,
behind David Robinson, by the Phoenix Suns. He also played for
the Charlotte Hornets,  Philadelphia 76ers , New Jersey Nets,
 Milwaukee Bucks  and Utah Jazz, finishing his career with 12,700
points and 6,401 rebounds.  “Armen was a true professional who carried himself with
class and dignity both on and off the court,” the Nets said in
a statement posted on their  website .  Gilliam had his No. 35 jersey retired by UNLV
in 2007. He was a member of the Runnin’ Rebels squad that
reached the Final Four in 1987, finishing with a 37-2 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
