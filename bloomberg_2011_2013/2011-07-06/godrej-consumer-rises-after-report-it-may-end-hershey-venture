(Corrects to say company may purchase stake in first
paragraph.)  Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. (GCPL)  rose to
its highest level in more than nine months in Mumbai trading
after the Economic Times  reported  the Indian maker of household
products may buy  Hershey Co. (HSY) ’s stake in a local joint venture.  Shares of Godrej Consumer gained as much as 3.4 percent to
the highest level since Sept. 20. They advanced 2.2 percent to
447.5 rupees at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai, and were the best
performing stock on the Bombay Stock Exchange Fast Moving
Consumer Goods Index.  Godrej Consumer will buy Hershey’s 51 percent stake in the
joint venture with the Godrej Group for an undisclosed amount,
the newspaper reported today, without saying where it got the
information. Hershey said in a statement April 3, 2007, that it
agreed to form a joint venture with Godrej Beverages and Foods
Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products,
snacks and beverages in the South Asian country.  Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Consumer, declined to
comment on what he called “market speculation,” according to
an e-mailed statement. Kirk Saville, a spokesman for the Hershey,
Pennsylvania-based chocolate and candy maker, wasn’t available
immediately when contacted in his office before business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
