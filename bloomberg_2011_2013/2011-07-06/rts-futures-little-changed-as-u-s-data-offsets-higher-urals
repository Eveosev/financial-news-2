Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures
closed little changed as a slower-than-forecast expansion of
 service industries  in the U.S. blunted the effect of an increase
in the price of Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend of oil.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September gained less than 0.1 percent yesterday. Contracts on
OAO Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer, gained 0.3
percent and agreements on OAO Lukoil, the second-largest,
climbed 0.4 percent. Agreements on OAO Gazprom, the world’s
largest gas producer, rose 0.3 percent.  A lower-than-forecast reading of the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s index of non-manufacturing businesses raised
concerns economic growth in the world’s biggest economy cooled
at the end on the first half of 2011. Slower economic growth
reduces demand for fuel, including oil, and commodities.  “Local fundamentals are still sound,” Evgeny Gavrilenkov
and Anton Strouchenevski, economists at Troika Dialog, said in
an e-mailed report yesterday. “The euro has appreciated against
the dollar year-on-year and the oil price has increased. Russia
has benefited from this.”  The price of Urals crude gained 0.4 percent to $112.57 a
barrel yesterday. It has averaged $108.11 so far this year. Oil
and gas account for about 17 percent of the country’s GDP.  Russia also exports natural gas and metals, including gold,
steel, nickel, copper. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 raw materials fell 0.4 percent yesterday.  Vectors Index  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 0.5 percent yesterday, ending a six-
day winning streak, the longest since November.  Russia’s 30-stock, ruble-denominated  Micex index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.3
percent to 1,705.41 yesterday. Lukoil dropped 0.8 percent while
Gazprom lost 0.9 percent. VTB Group, the country’s second-
largest lender, declined 2.5 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index fell 0.7 percent to 1,939.01 yesterday.  In Moscow, Lukoil dropped 0.8 percent while Gazprom lost
