Singapore is working toward signing
a United Nations treaty to prevent human trafficking, the
 Straits Times  reported, citing an unnamed Ministry of Home
Affairs spokesman.  It could have an impact on the way in which foreigners,
usually young women who ply the sex trade, are dealt with by the
authorities, the report said. Instead of being treated as
immigration offenders and deported, they could be treated as
victims and allowed to remain in shelters while their cases are
investigated, it said.  Singapore is among a few countries yet to sign the Protocol
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, which
has been ratified or signed by about 150 parties, the newspaper
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
