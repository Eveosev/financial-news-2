Maxim Lapierre scored early in the
third period to give the  Vancouver  Canucks a 1-0 win against the
 Boston Bruins  in the  National Hockey League ’s Stanley Cup Final
and a 3-2 advantage in games in the best-of-seven series.  Vancouver can capture its first NHL championship with a win
when the series moves to Boston for Game 6 on June 13. If the
Bruins win that game at home, the series would move back to
Vancouver for a decisive Game 7 on June 15.  After two scoreless periods, Lapierre fired a 10-foot wrist
shot past goalie Tim Thomas with 15 minutes, 25 seconds left in
the game at Rogers Arena in Vancouver. Roberto Luongo had 31
saves while Thomas had 24.  Luongo posted his fourth shutout of the playoffs and second
of the Stanley Cup finals after giving up 12 goals in less than
four periods during two blowout losses in  Boston .  “There was something about him before the game,” said
Vancouver defenseman Kevin Bieksa, who set up the only goal.
“He just seemed so comfortable, so confident. He was vocal, and
usually he’s not a vocal guy. We thought it would be something
special.”  The Canucks lost on their previous trips to the series in
1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been beaten five times in the
Stanley Cup Final, most recently in 1990, since they collected
the last of their five NHL titles in 1972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
