German chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
the country’s economic growth this year will probably exceed the
official government forecast.  Growth in  Europe ’s largest economy will “likely be above 3
percent,” Merkel said in the weekly  video  posted on her
website, reiterating comments from May 25. The government’s
official forecast is for expansion of 2.6 percent.  Germany’s economy will probably grow 3.6 percent this year,
the same rate as in 2010, and 1.6 percent in 2012, the Kiel-
based Institute for the World Economy said on June 9. The
Bundesbank a day later raised its forecasts to 3.1 percent for
this year and 1.8 percent for 2012.  Germany is one of the countries racing to find a plan to
stem  Greece ’s debt crisis.  “We cannot accept an uncontrolled bankruptcy of a
country,” Merkel said, without specifying which country she was
referring to. Such an event could endanger the recovery of
Germany’s economy, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
