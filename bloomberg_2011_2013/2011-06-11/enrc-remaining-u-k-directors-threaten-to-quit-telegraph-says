Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.’s
remaining U.K. directors said they will resign this weekend
unless the company’s board makes structural changes, the  Daily
Telegraph  reported, citing people close to the situation.  Sir Paul Judge and Mehmet Dalman spoke with company
executives yesterday and will have talks with ENRC’s biggest
institutional investors over the weekend, the paper reported.
They have made it clear that they can’t work with the company in
its current structure, the Telegraph said.  ENRC slumped to a 23-month low in London trading yesterday
after shareholders ousted two independent board members and
management began a corporate-governance review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
