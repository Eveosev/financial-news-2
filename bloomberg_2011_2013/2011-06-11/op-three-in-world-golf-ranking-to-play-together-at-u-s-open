Luke Donald,  Lee Westwood  and Martin
Kaymer, the top three in the Official World Golf Ranking, will
play together in the opening two rounds of the  U.S. Open .  Top-ranked Donald, No. 2 Westwood and No. 3 Kaymer will tee
off at Congressional Country Club outside Washington at 8:06
a.m. local time on June 16 and at 1:46 p.m. the following day.
Kaymer is the lone major winner among the three, taking last
year’s U.S. PGA Championship.  Defending champion Graeme McDowell is grouped with British
Open winner Louis Oosthuizen and U.S. Amateur winner Peter
Uihlein. Masters champ Charl Schwartzel will play with Trevor
Immelman and Zach Johnson, who’ve also won the year’s first
major tournament.  Tiger Woods , the winner of 14 major championships,
announced four days ago he was skipping the tournament as he
recovers from knee and ankle injuries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
