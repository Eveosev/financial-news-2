Amnesty International  urged  Saudi
Arabia  to halt the use of the death penalty after a
“significant increase” in the number of executions this year.  At least 27 people have been executed in the kingdom this
year, the same number as for all of 2010, Amnesty said in a
statement on its website yesterday. Fifteen people were executed
in May alone, the London-based rights group said.  Saudi Arabia, a G-20 member, is an absolute monarchy that
adheres to a strict version of Islam. Homosexuality is illegal
and the kingdom’s courts often sentence people to death by
public beheading for crimes such as rape, murder and drug
trafficking.  “The Saudi Arabian authorities must halt this disturbing
pattern,” Philip Luther, Amnesty’s deputy director for the
 Middle East  and North Africa, said in the statement. “ Amnesty
International  is aware of over 100 prisoners, many of whom are
foreign nationals, currently on death row.”  The number of executions had been declining, dropping to at
least 69 people in 2009 from about 102 people the year before
and 158 people in 2007, according to Amnesty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
