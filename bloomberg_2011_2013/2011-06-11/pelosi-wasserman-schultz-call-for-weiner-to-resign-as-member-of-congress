Three Democratic lawmakers including
House Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi  called for New York
Representative Anthony Weiner to step down as a member of
Congress.  The 46-year-old married Democratic lawmaker has admitted
sending inappropriate photos and messages to women he met
online. His “inappropriate behavior has become an
insurmountable distraction to the House and our work,”
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve
Israel said in a statement.  “The behavior he has exhibited is indefensible,”
Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman
Schultz said in her statement urging Weiner’s resignation.
“This sordid affair has become an unacceptable distraction.”  Pelosi’s statement urged Weiner to seek help “without the
pressures of being a member of Congress.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
