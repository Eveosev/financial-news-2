BBC  News plans to reduce its news
staff of 8,000 in a bid to save as much as 89 million pounds
($144 million) a year,  the Guardian  reported, citing an official
with knowledge of the plan.  The director of BBC News, Helen Boaden, has briefed senior
members of the organization about the plan, which envisages
making the savings by 2016, the paper said. The cuts to the news
organizationâ€™s 500 million pound budget will be made primarily
by eliminating reporting jobs, the Guardian reported.  The BBC will also merge its World Service unit with the
main News division as part of the drive to reduce costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
