Two F-15 fighter jets intercepted a
small civilian aircraft near the U.S. presidential retreat at
Camp David,  Maryland , today and escorted the plane out of the
area, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a
statement.  The F-15s intercepted the Beechcraft Bonanza, a single-
engine aircraft, about 11 miles from Camp David, at about 3:25
p.m. New York time. The airplane, which was out of radio
contact, landed without incident in Hagerstown, Maryland, Norad
said.  Norad is a binational U.S. and Canadian command responsible
for the air defense of  North America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
