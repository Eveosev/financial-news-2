A journalist for Mumbai’s  Mid Day 
newspaper who had investigated organized crime in the city was
shot dead today, an official in the  police  department said in a
telephone interview.  Jyotirmoy Dey was killed when four men on two motorcycles
fired at him in the city’s Powai area, said the official, who
declined to give his name because he is not authorized to speak
to the press. The incident took place at about 3:30 p.m.  Dey, known among his colleagues as “J. Dey,” was the
editor in charge of investigations at the newspaper, said Vinod Menon, chief reporter at Mid Day, who declined to comment
further while the police are investigating the incident. Dey
sustained “five bullet wounds,” according to a  statement  on
the Mid Day web site.  Dey is the author of two  books  about crime in Mumbai:
“Zero Dial: The Dangerous World of Informers” and “Khallas:
An A to Z Guide to the Underworld,” a  dictionary  of the code-
language used by the city’s organized crime gangs.  “The newsroom is in a complete state of shock,” Sachin
Kalbaug, group editor of Mid Day, said in an interview with NDTV
24x7 television channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
