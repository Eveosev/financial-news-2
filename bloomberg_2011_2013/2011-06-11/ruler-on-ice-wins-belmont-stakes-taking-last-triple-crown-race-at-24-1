Ruler On Ice won the 143rd Belmont
Stakes to complete a sweep by longshots of the three legs of
thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown.  Ruler on Ice, leaving the gate yesterday at 24-1 odds, paid
$51.50 on a $2 bet to win the Belmont by 3/4ths of a length at
Belmont Park in Elmont,  New York .  Animal Kingdom  paid $43.80
when the 3-year-old colt won the Kentucky Derby, while Preakness
Stakes champion Shackleford returned $27.20.  Ruler On Ice stalked Shackleford, who shot out of the 12th
gate and into the lead to set the pace over a 1 1/2-mile sloppy
track. After moving to the front near the finish line, he held
off Stay Thirsty on the inside to win in a time of 2 minutes,
30.88 seconds.  “With a half mile to go, I felt like I had a lot of horse
under me,” said jockey Jose Valdivia. “A couple of yards from
the finish line, I thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to win the
Belmont Stakes.’”  Ruler On Ice returned $26 to holders of $2 place bets and
$13.60 to show. Stay Thirsty paid $19.40 and $10.80 and
Brilliant Speed returned $7.90.  Ruler On Ice, who acted up when he left the paddock and
entered the track area as a recording of  Frank Sinatra ’s “New
York, New York” played, was still feisty as he headed for the
winner’s circle.  “He’s just a little nutty,” said trainer Kelly Breen.
“If I knew what it was, I’d give it to all my horses.”  Front Four  Breen said he told Valdivia horses that historically run
among the front four places in the Belmont usually go on to win
the race.  “I want you to be up close,” Breen told the jockey.  Ruler On Ice, the second gelding to capture the Belmont,
was the only one of the 12 contenders to previously win on a
sloppy track when he broke his maiden as a 2-year-old at
Delaware Park.  Kentucky Derby  winner Animal Kingdom, the 5-2 favorite
yesterday, was pinched as he left the gate and jockey John Velazquez lost his irons. He finished sixth, 9 1/4 lengths back.  “It’s a miracle the horse didn’t fall,” trainer Graham
Motion said.  Shackleford faded to fifth, 7 1/4 lengths behind Ruler On
Ice.  “The horse broke good. He just couldn’t finish up,” said
Shackleford’s jockey Jesus Castanon. “It was just a little too
far for him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
