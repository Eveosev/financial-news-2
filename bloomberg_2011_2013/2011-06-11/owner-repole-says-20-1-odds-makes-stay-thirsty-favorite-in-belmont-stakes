Mike Repole figures having Stay
Thirsty as a 20-1 longshot in the 143rd Belmont Stakes gives him
an advantage considering the returns on the winners of the first
two legs of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown.  Animal Kingdom paid $43.80 on a $2 bet when the 3-year-old
colt won the Kentucky Derby, while Preakness Stakes champion
Shackleford returned $27.20.  Monzon, owned by  Under Armour Inc. (UA)  founder Kevin Plank, and
Isn’t He Perfect garnered the longest odds of 30-1 in the early
morning line for  today’s race  at Belmont Park in Elmont,  New
York . Stay Thirsty and Ruler On Ice are 20-1, with Santiva,
Brilliant Speed and Prime Cut at 15-1.  “In this race, I wouldn’t want to be the favorite,”
Repole said after the televised post draw. “I’ll take my 20-1
odds and consider him the favorite.”  During the last century, the combined payouts for the
winners of the Triple Crown races were as low as 60 cents to $1
when Count Fleet swept the series for the 1943 Triple Crown, and
as high as a $95.85 return on a $1 bet in 1913, when Donerail,
Buskin and Prince Eugene shared the titles. In 2002, the
cumulative return was $93.55 when Sarava won the Belmont to
deprive War Emblem of the Triple Crown.  Animal Kingdom , the runner-up in the Preakness, was
installed as the 2-1 favorite in the Belmont. Nehro, the second-
place finisher in the Derby, was made 4-1, followed by
Shackleford at 9-2.  ‘Home Track’  “This is an impossible race to handicap,” Repole, who
decided to skip the Preakness with Stay Thirsty after the colt’s
12th-place finish in the Derby, said in a telephone interview.
“Stay Thirsty has a home-track advantage.”  The Belmont, at 1 1/2 miles, is the longest race of the
Triple Crown series, which started five weeks ago. Twelve horses
are vying for the $600,000 winner’s purse.  “I’m going to bet on him, not only because I own the horse
but this year unprecedented things have happened in every single
race, so why bet on one of the favorites?” Repole said.  Repole, who co-founded Glaceau Vitaminwater sports drink
before it was sold to Coca-Cola Co. for $4.1 billion in 2007,
bought Stay Thirsty last year for $500,000. The colt is the
stablemate of Uncle Mo, the 2-year-old Juvenile of the Year and
favorite in the  Kentucky Derby  before trainer Todd Pletcher and
Repole decided to scratch him because of illness.  Stay Thirsty is the great-grandson of 1977 Triple Crown
winner Seattle Slew and 1953 Preakness and Belmont champion
Northern Dancer, and the son of 2006 Preakness winner
Bernardini. He will sport silks in the orange and blue colors of
Repole’s favorite baseball team, the  New York Mets .  “If there is one race for a kid from Queens, New York,
that’s the Belmont Stakes,” Repole said. “This is about
enjoying the moment, having fun.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
