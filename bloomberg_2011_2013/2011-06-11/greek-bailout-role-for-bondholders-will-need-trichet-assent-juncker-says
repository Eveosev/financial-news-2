A bailout for Greece must include
“voluntary” investor participation and meet the approval of
central bankers, Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker said, seeking
to narrow a dispute over the second Greek rescue in two years.  “There must be a participation of private creditors,”
Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said in an interview on Radio Berlin-Brandenburg today. “It
must be voluntary.”  Luxembourg’s prime minister is trying to bridge the gap
between German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who has
called for Greek bondholders to extend the maturities of their
debt by seven years, and European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet, who says imposing losses on creditors would be
akin to a default. European officials are racing to find a plan
to stem Greece’s debt crisis by June 24 while sharing the cost
of a new rescue with bondholders.  “We cannot push through private investor participation
without, or against, the ECB,” Juncker said. “A default would
mean the ECB would have to end its accompanying programs. A
default would mean we have reached the end of the line.”  Schaeuble, in a June 6 letter to Trichet and fellow euro
finance ministers, called the seven-year extension to give
 Greece  more time to cut its debt and budget deficit.  Governments aim to reach an agreement on a new aid package
by a European Union summit on June 23-24. The IMF has threatened
to withhold its share of what remains of Greece’s original 110
billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout until governments guarantee
that the country’s financing needs for the next 12 months are
covered. The IMF was due to turn over 3.3 billion euros this
month.  Default Warning  “We cannot accept an uncontrolled bankruptcy of a
country,” German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today in her
weekly video message. Such an event may endanger the recovery of
 Germany ’s economy, she said.  European governments and the IMF would lend as much as an
extra 45 billion euros to Greece under a new bailout plan that
also includes roughly 30 billion euros in asset-sale proceeds
and about 30 billion euros in rollovers by creditors, two people
with direct knowledge of the talks said earlier this week.  While a debt rollover has been gaining support among EU
officials, credit analysts at Moody’s Investors Service,
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have indicated that pressure
on private investors to participate would prompt a default
rating on Greek debt, a view echoed by European Central Bank
Governing Council member Nout Wellink today.  “The desire to involve private investors is
understandable,” Wellink said on Dutch broadcaster Radio 1.
“We do note that fulfilling that desire by a non-voluntary
contribution would lead to a default situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
