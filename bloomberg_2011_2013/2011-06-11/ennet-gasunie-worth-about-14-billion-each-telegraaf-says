Nederlandse Gasunie NV and TenneT
Holding BV are valued at about 10 billion euros ($14 billion)
and 9.5 billion euros respectively,  De Telegraaf  reported,
citing an average estimate of unidentified investment bankers.  The Dutch government yesterday said it is open to selling a
minority stake in the countryâ€™s natural-gas and power grid
operators to help fund investments in their networks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
