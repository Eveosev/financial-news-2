A bailout for Greece including
investor participation may hurt confidence in the financial
markets,  Welt am Sonntag  said, citing an interview with
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing .  While banks outside of Greece could bear a restructuring of
the country’s debt, participation of creditors is “a question
of trust,” as investors had been told they need not join any
efforts before 2013, the newspaper cites Blessing as saying.  Not standing by this agreement would “not exactly help
build trust in the markets,” Blessing said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
