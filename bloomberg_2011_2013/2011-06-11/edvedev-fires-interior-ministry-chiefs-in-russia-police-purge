Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
fired Alexei Anichin, a deputy interior minister allegedly
linked to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.  Medvedev also fired Yevgeny Shkolov, another deputy
interior minister, and replaced Vladislav Piotrovsky head of St.
Petersburg police, the Kremlin said on its  website  today.  The Russian leader has dismissed dozens of generals from
the ministry this year as part of his campaign against
corruption. New legislation governing police, including a more
stringent code of conduct, came into force March 1.  Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer advising Hermitage Capital
Management Ltd., died after almost a year in pre-trial
detention. During that period he said he was abused and denied
medical treatment to force him to drop fraud allegations against
Russian officials.  The European Parliament on Dec. 16 urged the European Union
to consider a visa ban on 60 Russian officials including
Anichin, allegedly linked to Magnitsky’s death in a Moscow
prison in November 2009. Anchin was also the head of the
Interior Ministry’s investigative committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
