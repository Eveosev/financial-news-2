Poland  will sue the European
Commission over regulations to allocate free carbon-dioxide
permits to companies, daily  Rzeczpospolita  reported, citing
Economy Minister Waldemar Pawlak.  Poland will argue the commission exceeded its remit and
doesn’t account of the fuel needs of a number of EU companies,
leading in some cases to a significant increase in costs from
2013, the newspaper said.  The EU’s emissions trading system is the lynchpin of the
bloc’s efforts to cut the  greenhouse gases  blamed for  climate
change . Poland generates about 95 percent of its energy from
coal, which emits about twice as much carbon dioxide as natural
gas.  The commission’s rules are “harmful for Polish
entrepreneurs,” Pawlak told the newspaper. “Polish
businesspeople can’t be treated worse on the basis of some
arbitrary decision by the European Commission.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
