existing loans to the debt-plagued country, Belgian Finance
Minister  Didier Reynders  said in an interview with  De Morgen .  The investors are “kindly requested to extend existing
loans,” De Morgen quoted Reynders as saying. “Gentle
pressure” may be exerted on the investors if necessary, he
said, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
