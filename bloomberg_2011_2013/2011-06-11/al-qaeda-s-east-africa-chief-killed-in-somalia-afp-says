Somali forces killed the suspected
leader of Al-Qaeda in East Africa, who may have helped
orchestrate the 1998 embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es-
Salaam,  Agence France-Presse  said, citing security officials.  Fazul Abdullah Mohammad and one other man were killed when
the pickup in which they were traveling failed to stop at a
checkpoint after straying into a government-controlled district
of Mogadishu, Somali army commander Abdikarim Yusuf said,
according to AFP.  The incident happened on the night of June 7-8, Somali
security sources told AFP. DNA tests subsequently confirmed the
suspect’s identity, the  news agency  reported.  Al-Shabaab, a regional grouping affiliated to Al-Qaeda,
acknowledged Mohammad’s death, AFP said, citing a leader of the
organization who asked not to be named. Mohammad was traveling
with a South African passport, $40,000 in cash and several
mobile phones, AFP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
