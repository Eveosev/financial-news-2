Royal Philips Electronics NV is
moving the production of higher-priced shavers to the
Netherlands from  China  to save transportation costs,  De
Telegraaf  reported, citing a company spokesman.  Itâ€™s more efficient to assemble the appliances in Drachten,
the Netherlands, for sales to European consumers, the newspaper
reported. The Dutch factory already produces more complex parts
of the shavers,  De Telegraaf  said.  Production of the cheapest shavers will remain in China,
according to the Telegraaf.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
