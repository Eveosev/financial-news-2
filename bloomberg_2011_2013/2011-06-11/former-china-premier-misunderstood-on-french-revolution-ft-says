Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai
was misquoted when he allegedly commented that it was “too
early to say” what the impact of the 1789 French Revolution
would be, the Financial Times said, citing Chas Freeman,
President  Richard Nixon ’s interpreter at the time.  The remark, made at a U.S.-China summit in 1972, was
referring to the 1968 Paris riots and not the storming of the
Bastille almost two centuries earlier, Freeman said, according
to the London-based newspaper.  The misunderstood comment has become widely cited as an
example of China’s long-term view of history, the Financial
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
