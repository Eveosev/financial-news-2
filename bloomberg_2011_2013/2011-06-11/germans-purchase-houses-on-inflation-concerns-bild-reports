Home sales are booming in  Germany  
as concerns about inflation prompt people to lock in low 
interest rates for mortgages,  Bild  newspaper said, citing 
comments from real estate group Immobilienverband 
Deutschland  IVD .  The number of transactions and the total sales volume will
rise by 20 percent to 30 percent this year, and in some large
cities by as much as 50 percent, the newspaper cites the IVD as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
