Carmakers including Honda Motor Co.
and Toyota Motor Corp. oppose  California ’s plan to raise targets
for zero-emission vehicle sales, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing the Association of Global Automakers.  State regulators may propose that electric cars and others
not fueled by petroleum make up 5.5 percent of the market, or
81,300 vehicles, by 2018, and 14 percent by 2025, the  newspaper
said .  The rule would apply to automakers that sell at least
20,000 vehicles a year in the state, the WSJ said. Large
manufacturers that do not meet the targets would be fined about
$5,000 per car under the quota, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
