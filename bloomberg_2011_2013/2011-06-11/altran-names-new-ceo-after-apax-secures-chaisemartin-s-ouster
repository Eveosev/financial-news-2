Altran Technologies SA (ALT)  ousted Chief
Executive Officer Yves de Chaisemartin and named Philippe Salle
to replace him after Apax Partners LLP won two more seats on the
company’s board.  Salle was appointed to the post after shareholders approved
his nomination to the board at their annual meeting, the
technology consulting company said yesterday in a  statement  on
its Web site.  Altran’s new CEO will “focus on accelerating its growth
and increasing its performance,” according to the company
statement. Salle, 46, formerly held positions with Vedior  France 
and Geoservices Group, where he served as chairman and managing
director until March.  Chaisemartin had acknowledged efforts by Apax to remove him
and said in a June 7 interview with  Les Echos  he was “willing
to help” the fund sell its 19.2 percent Altran stake by 2013,
pledging to raise the operating margin to 10 percent within two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
