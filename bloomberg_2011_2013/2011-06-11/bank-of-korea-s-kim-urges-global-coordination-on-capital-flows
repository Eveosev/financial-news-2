Bank of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo urged more global coordination in tackling sudden changes in
capital flows because different policy responses by countries
may give market players opportunities for “regulatory
arbitrage.”  Kim also said in a speech to be delivered today at a
seminar in Jeju island, south of  Seoul , that the Bank of  Korea 
should expand its role into ensuring financial stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
