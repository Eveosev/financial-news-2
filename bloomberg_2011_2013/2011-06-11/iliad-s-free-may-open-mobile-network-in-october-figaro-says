Iliad SA (ILD)  may open  France ’s fourth
mobile-phone network as soon as October, Le Figaro said, citing
a report by Oddo Securities.  The broadband provider’s Free unit, which won a mobile
license from the French government in 2009 and had been
scheduled to open the service next year, may bring the start
date forward to catch the Christmas sales surge, the French
daily said today.  Free declined to comment on its plans for the service, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
