Canada ’s dollar depreciated against
its U.S. counterpart, matching the longest losing streak since
December 2007, on speculation a slowing recovery for the
nation’s biggest trade partner curtailed demand.  The currency, also called the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained versus 13 of its 16 most-
traded peers this week after a government report yesterday
showed Canada’s jobless rate unexpectedly fell in May to the
lowest level since January 2009. Crude oil, Canada’s largest
source of export revenue, and stocks declined. The  Bank of
Canada  is scheduled to sell C$3.5 billion ($3.6 billion) of two-
year debt June 15.  “We’ve been held back by what’s been going on in the
United States,” said  David Watt , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “If
you look at the labor market statistics and a number of domestic
statistics, Canada has been in a different world from the U.S.”  The Canadian dollar rose 0.2 percent to 97.99 cents per
 U.S. dollar , from 97.78 cents June 3. The currency also declined
for the six straight weeks ending Dec. 14, 2007. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0205.  Canada’s unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent last month
from 7.6 percent in April, a Statistics Canada report showed
yesterday in Ottawa. Employers added 22,300 jobs last month
after an increase of 58,300 in April. The median forecast of 27
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 20,000.  Jobs Outlook  The loonie fell against the greenback on June 3 after U.S.
Labor Department figures showed payrolls increased by 54,000
jobs in May after the addition of 232,000 in the previous month.
The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 9.1 percent.  “It looks like the U.S. is hitting a soft patch, and
everybody’s worried that might turn into something more,” said
 David Love , a trader of interest-rate derivatives at Le Groupe
Jitney Inc. in  Montreal . “Those numbers by themselves are not
enough to change the underlining trend that’s been happening
over the past couple of weeks,” he said referring to
yesterday’s Canadian jobless data.  The loonie advanced on June 7 against the U.S. dollar after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central
bank should maintain record monetary stimulus to boost a
“frustratingly slow” economic recovery. Canada’s dollar
dropped the next day after the Fed said the economy slowed in
four of 12 regions of the U.S.  U.S. trade deficit  unexpectedly narrowed in April, Commerce
Department figures showed on June 9 in  Washington . The gap
shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the lowest since December,
compared with an estimated $48.8 billion gap, according to the
median forecast a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Trade Patterns  The release overshadowed a  Statistics Canada  report the
same day that said the nation’s trade deficit was C$924 million
($945 million) in April, the widest in six months. Economists
forecast a C$600 million surplus, the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 24 economists.  Government bonds  fell, pushing yields up on the 10-year
note by two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3
percent. The 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021 fell
15 cents to C$102.10.  Canada’s government on June 8 sold C$1.4 billion ($1.4
billion) of 30-year debt, drawing an average yield of 3.515
percent. The government received bids of C$3.3 billion for the
3.5 percent securities maturing in December 2045.  The Canadian dollar this week rose against the euro to
C$1.4059. On June 8, it touched its lowest level against the
shared currency since March 2010 after European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials agreed last week to pay
the next installment to debt-strapped  Greece  under last year’s
110 billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout.  Trichet Signals  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
yesterday signaled a slowing pace of interest-rate increases
this year. The ECB said inflation next year will accelerate
between 1.1 percent and 2.3 percent, compared with an earlier
forecast of 1 percent to 2.4 percent.  “The euro continues to falter as the sovereign debt
worries remain at the forefront,” said  Dean Popplewell , an
analyst at the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. in
Toronto. “With that, individuals’ and investors’ risk tolerance
certainly depreciates.”  Oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell 0.9 percent to $99.29 a
barrel. Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Secretary
General Abdalla el-Badri on June 8 said in Vienna there was no
consensus on the group’s production limits, which have remained
unchanged since 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled for a sixth
consecutive week, falling 2.2 percent this week. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  extended its longest weekly slump in more
than eight years.  “Canada’s ties with the  United States  are extremely
strong,” Oanda’s Popplewell said. “Anything that’s positive
for the U.S. tends to be positive for Canada. But at the moment,
Canada is performing well across the crosses. Canada has been
standing alone when it comes to fundamentals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
