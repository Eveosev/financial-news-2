Canada  should reduce the number of
federal income tax brackets, the  Globe & Mail  reported Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  as saying in a speech.  A “flatter” tax system would encourage entrepreneurship,
Flaherty said at the Conservative Party of Canada’s policy
convention in Ottawa yesterday, according to the newspaper.  Canada has four federal  tax levels , ranging from 15 percent
for the first C$41,544 ($42,396) of taxable income to 29 percent
for taxable income above C$128,800.  To contact the reporter on this story:
