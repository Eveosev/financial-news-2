Lisle Austin of Barbados said he’s
won a court injunction in the Bahamas that will allow him to
resume duties as acting president of Concacaf after being
suspended by the soccer organization.  Austin said in a statement a  High Court  in the Bahamas
issued the injunction yesterday after he was banned by Concacaf,
which runs soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean,
for allegedly violating rules.  Austin took over as president last month when Jack Warner
of Trinidad was provisionally removed by world governing body
FIFA over allegations of bribery. He was then suspended June 2
by the Concacaf executive committe after he fired General
Secretary Chuck Blazer, who made the intial bribery allegation
against Warner.  A call to the Office of the Judiciary in the Bahamas from
Bloomberg News today went unanswered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
