Warren Buffett’s annual charity
lunch auction raised a record $2.63 million on the final day of
the weeklong contest after the bidder who’d already won offered
more cash to set the mark.  The revised winning bid for a steakhouse meal with the 80-
year-old billionaire beat by $100 the record set last year by an
unidentified donor.  This year’s contest  is the 12th benefiting
 San Francisco ’s Glide charity. The victorious bidder, who had
won yesterday’s auction earlier with a pledge of $2.35 million,
wasn’t immediately identified, said Denise Lamott, a Glide
spokeswoman.  “This money will go to those who are in deep distress,”
Rev. Cecil Williams, Glide’s founder, said at an event hosted by
the charity last night in San Francisco. “Thank you to Warren
Buffett and to the bidders.” The auction is held on EBay Inc.’s
website.  Buffett attracts tens of thousands of admirers to Omaha,
 Nebraska , each year for meetings of his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
There, shareholders line up for hours to get a seat in a
basketball arena where Buffett fields questions on finance,
public policy and life. The winner of the auction gets to meet
Buffett at New York’s Smith & Wollensky steakhouse and has free
rein to steer the table talk.  “I’d love to be a bidder, but if I did, my kids would be
going to  community college ,” said David Rolfe, who attended the
Berkshire meeting in April as chief investment officer of
Wedgewood Partners Inc. The firm oversees $1 billion.  Past winners have said they were motivated to bid by
Buffett’s stature and the charitable cause that their funds
support. Greenlight Capital Inc.’s David Einhorn, who won the
2003 auction with a $250,100 bid, said at the time he wanted to
“learn from the master.” Guy Spier of Aquamarine Funds LLC has
said he has used his recognition as winner in 2007 to open doors
to new business contacts.  Millions for Glide  Glide, a favorite charity of Buffett’s late first wife, has
garnered almost $11 million since the first auction in 2000 went
for $25,000. Courtenay Wolfe of  Canada ’s Salida Capital led a
group that paid $1.68 million to win in 2008. Last year’s winner
has remained anonymous.  The winner can bring as many as seven friends to the lunch.  Buffett rose to prominence through five decades of
investing success. He accumulated the world’s third-largest
personal fortune by picking stocks and making takeovers for
Omaha-based Berkshire. Buffett has said that 99 percent of his
wealth will go to philanthropy within 10 years of his death.  Glide says it serves almost 1 million meals annually to the
homeless and poor. Susan Buffett, who was married to Buffett
until her death in 2004, volunteered at the charity.  “You really want to make your charitable dollar go as far
as it can,” Buffett said in an interview last year. “When you
get a proven quantity like Glide, and you get the people running
it who you watch do it for 40 years and do it magnificently,
they are the ones, in my view, to support.”  Glide Lunch With  Warren Buffett  Results:  Year  Winner                                        Winning Bid
