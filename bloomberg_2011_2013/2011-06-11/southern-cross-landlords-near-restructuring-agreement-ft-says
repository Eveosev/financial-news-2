Southern Cross Healthcare Group Plc,
the U.K.’s largest care home operator, is close to a
restructuring agreement to help it avert financial collapse, the
Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources.  Possible measures include rent reductions, tax deferrals
and giving landlords equity stakes in company subsidiaries, the
FT said.  Representatives of all 80 of the company’s landlords will
meet Monday to complete a restructuring plan to present to the
government and Southern Cross Wednesday, the newspaper said.
Eight of the larger landlords held a third emergency meeting
Friday to seek a solution, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
