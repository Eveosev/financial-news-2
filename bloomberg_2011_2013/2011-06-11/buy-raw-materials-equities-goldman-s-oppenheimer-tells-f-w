Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  recommends
buying raw materials stocks as commodities including oil, zinc
and copper rally,  Finanz und Wirtschaft  reported, citing  Peter Oppenheimer , chief global equity strategist at the bank.  Many of the raw materials stocks are undervalued in
comparison with Goldman’s forecasts for commodity prices,
Oppenheimer said.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index benchmark may advance about 10
percent over the next six months and 15 percent over 12 months,
according to Goldman’s predictions reported by F&W.  For Related News and Information:
