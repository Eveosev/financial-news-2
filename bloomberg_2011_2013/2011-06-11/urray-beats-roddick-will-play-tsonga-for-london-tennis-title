Andy Murray  beat Andy Roddick 6-3,
6-1 to reach the final of tennis’s Aegon Championships in
London.  Murray, the No. 2 seed, needed just 59 minutes to defeat
the third-seeded American, a four-time winner of the Wimbledon
warm-up at the Queen’s Club. He’ll play No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
tomorrow after the Frenchman prevented an all-British final by
beating unseeded James Ward 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).  Murray, the 2009 Queen’s champion, is seeking his first
title of the season. Tsonga, who yesterday defeated top-ranked
 Rafael Nadal  of Spain, last won an ATP World Tour tournament in
2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
