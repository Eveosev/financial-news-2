Airbus SAS wants Germany to have
veto power over decisions at European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Co. NV rather than a stake in the company,  Welt am Sonntag 
said in a preview of tomorrow’s edition, citing Airbus Chief
Executive Officer Thomas Enders.  The exit of  Daimler AG (DAI) , which is considering selling part
of its EADS stake, shouldn’t mean another government becomes a
shareholder, the release cited Enders as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
