Britvic Plc (BVIC) , the maker of Robinsons’
fruit drinks, said first-half profit fell 25 percent on
restructuring costs at its Irish business.  Net income fell to 15.8 million pounds ($26 million) in the
28 weeks ended April 17 from 21.1 million pounds a year earlier,
the Chelmsford, England-based company said today in a Regulatory
News Service statement.  Britvic said it booked a one-time impairment charge of 7.5
million pounds for its Irish business. The drinks maker, which
had a full-year loss last year as it wrote down the value of its
Irish business, said restructuring at the unit has been
completed.  Revenue climbed 25 percent to 633.1 million pounds, boosted
by earnings from a French acquisition last year. Revenue in
 Great Britain  rose 4 percent, driven by a 6.8 percent second-
quarter gain.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share fell to 9 pence from
9.7 pence a year earlier in the 28-week period ended April 11.  “Market conditions remain challenging in Ireland, but the
business has performed in line with our expectations,” Chief
Executive Officer Paul Moody said in today’s statement.
“Trading in the first few weeks of the third quarter provides
the board with further confidence in the outlook for the balance
of the year.”  Britvic shares rose 6.9 percent, or 1.6 percent, to close
at 432.9 pence as of 4:30 p.m. in  London , giving the company a
market value of 1 billion pounds.  The company proposed an 8.5 percent increase in its interim
dividend to 5.1 pence. Group debt climbed to 556 million pounds
from 442.4 million pounds a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
