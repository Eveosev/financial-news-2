Pension Corp. LLP , the U.K. insurer
of pension plans founded by Edmund Truell, is in talks to raise
400 million pounds ($657 million) of fresh capital from  Reinet
Investments SCA. (REIN)   The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval,
may involve a “reorganization” of the insurer’s capital
structure, Guernsey, Channel Islands-based Pension Corp. said
today in an e-mailed statement. Other investors in the insurer
include JC Flowers & Co., Coller Capital Ltd., and Lloyds
Banking Group Plc.  “This investment would augment our existing capital
resources, enabling PIC to maintain a market leading position in
what we believe is a rapidly growing market for pension
insurance and risk transfer,” Chairman Mark Weinberg said in
the statement.  Pension Insurance Corp. is the firm’s insurance division
and manages about 4 billion pounds of assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
