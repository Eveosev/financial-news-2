New Zealand ’s dollar rose to the
strongest level since March 2008 versus its U.S. counterpart,
approaching a record high, on speculation China will buy the
South Pacific nation’s assets to diversify the world’s largest
holdings of foreign reserves.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, gained the most this week
in two months as Finance Minister Bill English’s office said
China Investment Corp. is interested in buying his nation’s
bonds. The Australian dollar rose for a second week versus the
greenback on prospects that slowing growth in the U.S. will
preserve Australia’s yield advantage.  “In early Asia, everyone got very short on the New Zealand
dollar,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . “That’s why the rally in the kiwi
has actually been a lot more extreme than what it would have
been after English’s comments. The next likely target will be 83
cents.” A short is a bet a currency will decline.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed 0.9 percent to 81.91 U.S.
cents at 11:53 a.m. in  New York , from 81.15 cents yesterday. It
touched 81.98 cents, the strongest level since March 17, 2008.
The currency’s record high since exchange-rate controls ended in
1985 is 82.14 cents, reached Feb. 27, 2008.  The kiwi strengthened 2.7 percent this week versus the
greenback, the most since the week ended March 25. It gained 0.2
percent today and 1.7 percent this week to 66.12 yen.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0713, from
$1.0645, and touched $1.0719, the strongest since May 11. It
strengthened 0.5 percent against the greenback this week. The
Aussie slipped 0.1 percent to 86.47 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.7 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent.  Broadening Focus  Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia also are interested in
buying New Zealand debt as Asian governments seek to reduce
their reliance on U.S. dollar assets when investing their
reserves, English was cited as saying by the Marlborough
Express. His comments were accurately reported by the newspaper,
Craig Howie, a spokesman for the minister, said by phone from
Wellington.  China ’s sovereign investor may have set aside 1.5 percent
of its foreign-exchange reserves, the equivalent of NZ$6 billion
($4.8 billion), to invest in New Zealand companies,  government
bonds  and other assets, interest.co.nz said yesterday.  Australia’s dollar advanced against the greenback for a
second day on signs the  Federal Reserve  will trail its South
Pacific counterpart in tightening monetary policy, boosting the
allure of assets in the nation with higher  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
