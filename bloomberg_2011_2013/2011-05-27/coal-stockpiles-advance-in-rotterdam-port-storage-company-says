The Port of Rotterdam’s largest coal-
storage company said stockpiles of the fuel rose, partly because
low water levels on the River Rhine hampered shipments.  Inventories at facilities operated by Europees Massagoed-
Overslagbedrijf BV, or Emo, will increase to 3 million metric
tons by the start of next month, the company said in an e-mailed
response to questions. That’s up from 2.1 million tons at the
beginning of April.  Rotterdam  is  Europe ’s busiest port, handling coal imports
for utilities in  Germany  including EON AG. Emo, based in
Maasvlakte, Netherlands, said it increased rail deliveries into
Germany because of the Rhine disruption.  Stocks at the port are also rising because of imports from
countries including Colombia, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
