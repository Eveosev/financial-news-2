Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) , an insurer
with operations in five African countries, fell the most since
November 2006 after shareholders yesterday approved an increase
in share capital.  The stock tumbled 25.73 shillings, or 12 percent, to 183
shillings as of 2:40 p.m. in Nairobi, the lowest level since
April 1.  “The increase will bring it down for a short while because
it causes some investors to cut down on their shares due to
dilution,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan
Capital Ltd. said by phone today.  A shareholders’ meeting yesterday approved increasing the
authorized share capital to 350 million shillings ($4.1 million)
from 247.5 million shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
