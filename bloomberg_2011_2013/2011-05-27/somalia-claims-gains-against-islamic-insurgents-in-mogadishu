Somali government troops backed by
 African Union  forces have made gains against Islamic insurgents
in Mogadishu and now control 13 out of 16 districts in the
capital, Information Minister Abdulkareem Jama said.  “We have information that increasingly al-Shabaab are
taking their assets -- men and equipment -- out of Mogadishu,”
Jama told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital of neighboring
 Kenya . “Significant progress has been made.”  Somalia’s government held 40 percent of the city in
October, Wafula Wamunyinyi, deputy special representative to the
African Union Commission for Somalia, said that month.  Islamic insurgents have fled several key positions,
including sections of the Bakara market, once a militia
stronghold, in a government-led offensive that began this month,
Nathan Mugisha, commander of Somalia’s Africa Union mission,
said on May 23. The fighting claimed the lives of 22 militants
and two AU soldiers, he said.  Somalia’s government has been battling Islamist insurgents,
including al-Shabaab, since 2007. The rebels control most of
southern and central Somalia. The U.S. accuses al-Shabaab of
having links to al-Qaeda, which has said it aims to establish a
caliphate, or Islamic government, in the Horn of Africa country.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of the former dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, in
1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
