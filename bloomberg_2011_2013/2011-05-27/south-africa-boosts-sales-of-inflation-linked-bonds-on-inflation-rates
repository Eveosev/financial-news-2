South Africa  sold 605 million rand
($87 million) of inflation-linked bonds, more than planned, as
investors bet the central bank won’t raise interest rates this
year to arrest price increases in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 245 million rand ($53
million) of 2.75 percent inflation-linked bonds maturing in 2022
at an average yield of 2.52 percent, one basis point lower than
at the previous auction of the debt on May 20, according to the
central bank’s data on Bloomberg.  Price increases in South Africa are driven mostly by
“cost-push” factors such as international food and oil prices,
which are beyond the effect of local monetary policy, Deputy
Governor  Daniel Mminele  said in a speech in Johannesburg today.
The bank would raise  interest rates  if these costs spread to
other prices, he said.  “Interest in the weekly inflation-linked auction is
expected to continue,” Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by
Theuns de Wet said in a research note e-mailed to clients before
the auction today. “The data continue to test our base-line
view of a September rate hike.”  The central bank forecast this month that inflation will
breach the 3 percent to 6 percent target in the first quarter of
2012, peaking at 6.3 percent.  It also placed 360 million rand of 3.45 percent notes due
2033 at an average yield of 2.54 percent, one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point lower than at the previous auction. It
didn’t allocate any 2.6 percent bonds due 2028. The bank had
invited bids for 600 million rand of linkers, as the securities
are known.  The 10-year breakeven rate, or yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and standard notes of similar maturity,
is 5.78 percent. If the breakeven rate is below average
inflation, linkers return more than fixed-interest bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
