Chaoda Modern Agriculture (Holdings)
Ltd. bought 10.7 million of its shares today and the chairman
bought 1 million, the company said in a statement to the  Hong
Kong  stock exchange.  The Chinese fruit and vegetable producer bought the shares
at prices from HK$3.64 to HK$3.79 each, according to the filing.
Chairman Kwok Ho bought stock at an average price of HK$3.706,
the company said in the same statement.  The transactions follow the purchase of 2.2 million shares
by the company and 1 million by Kwok yesterday as the stock
plunged as much as 25 percent after a Next Magazine report
alleged Chaoda overstated the size of its farmland.  Chaoda rose 4.7 percent in Hong Kong trading today to close
at HK$3.79. The company yesterday said the Next report is “not
factually accurate” and reserved the right to take legal action
against the magazine.  Chaoda had 3.34 billion shares outstanding on May 6,
according to Bloomberg data. Shareholders approved a general
mandate for the board of directors in November to buy back
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
