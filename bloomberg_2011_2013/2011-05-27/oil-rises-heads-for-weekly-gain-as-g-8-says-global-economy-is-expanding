Oil rose, capping a 0.5 percent
weekly increase in  New York , after leaders of the Group of Eight
said the global economy is strengthening, and as the dollar
dropped to a one-week low against the euro.  Oil climbed 0.4 percent after the G-8 said the recovery
“is becoming more self-sustained,” in a statement following a
two-day summit in Deauville,  France . Stocks and commodities
advanced. A report that U.S. consumer spending gained less than
forecast in April sent the dollar lower, boosting commodities’
appeal as an alternative investment.  “They definitely seem to be more confident in the
recovery, and I think that’s giving us a psychological boost,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago . “This is the most optimistic they’ve sounded for some
time.”  Crude for July delivery rose 36 cents to settle at $100.59
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
increased 35 percent in the past year.  The G-8 leaders said that the strengthening economy will
pave the way to cuts in the debt built up during the recession
that followed the 2008 financial crisis.  Purchases in the U.S. rose 0.4 percent last month as food
and fuel prices increased, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The gain followed a revised 0.5 percent
advance the prior month and compared with the 0.5 percent median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Dollar Drops  The dollar fell 1 percent to $1.4291 against the euro at
3:23 p.m. in New York. It touched $1.4309 earlier, the lowest
level since May 20.  “The dollar selloff is pushing commodities higher,” said
Andrew Johnston, a London-based commodities trader at One
Financial Markets.  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities increased 0.6 percent
to 698.72 as natural gas, aluminum and copper surged 2 percent
or more. Nineteen of the commodities advanced.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,331.10 in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
increased 38.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,441.58.  Oil prices  also rose amid unrest in the Middle East and as
gasoline prices surged because of power outages at  Texas City ,
Texas, refineries owned by BP Plc, Valero Energy Corp. and
Marathon Oil Corp.  Syrian security forces fired on anti-government protesters
in the cities of Deir Al-Zour, Homs and Zabadani, near the
border with Lebanon, while “violently” dispersing a rally in
the Rukn al-Din neighborhood of Damascus, said Mahmoud Merhi,
head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights.  Mideast Unrest  Yemen’s Republican Guards clashed with the country’s Nihm
tribe, killing 15 members as they tried to prevent an army
regiment from reaching the capital, Sana’a, according to the
opposition website al-Sahwa.  “You’ve got all kinds of unrest in  Syria , you’ve got Yemen
starting to break down,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis .
With Nymex floor trading closed until May 31 for the U.S.
Memorial Day holiday, “who in their right mind would take home
a short?” O’Grady said. Shorts are bets that prices will drop.  Gasoline futures rose for a sixth day in New York after the
blackout, the second since April 25. BP said its refinery was
operating normally and Valero and Marathon were restarting their
plants today.  Gasoline for June delivery increased 4.37 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.092 a gallon on the Nymex.  OPEC Quotas  OPEC is likely to increase production quotas to 27 million
to 27.5 million barrels a day when it meets June 8 in Vienna to
“assuage” pressure on consumer nations to release emergency
stockpiles, JPMorgan said in a report today.  The  International Energy Agency , the Paris-based adviser to
28 nations, has indicated it may tap supplies as unrest in Libya
disrupts exports.  Crude may rise next week after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley increased their price projections, a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Fourteen of 36 analysts, or 39 percent,
forecast oil will climb through June 3. Twelve respondents, or
33 percent, predicted prices will decline and 10 estimated
little change.  Brent Outlook  Goldman, which correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper last month before a price slump, boosted its 12-month
prediction for  Brent crude  to $130 a barrel from $107, analysts
led by  Jeffrey Currie  said May 24 in a report. Morgan Stanley
raised its estimate by 20 percent to an average $120 this year
and by 24 percent to $130 in 2012.  Brent oil for July settlement slipped 2 cents to $115.03 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 375,232
contracts as of 3:23 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 678,008
contracts yesterday, 0.6 percent higher than the three-month
average and the most since May 18. Open interest was 1.51
million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
