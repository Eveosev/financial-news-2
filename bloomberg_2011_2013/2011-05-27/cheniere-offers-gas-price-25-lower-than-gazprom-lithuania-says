Lithuanian Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said the price offered by the U.S.’s  Cheniere Energy
Inc. (LNG)  for gas supplies would be at least 25 percent lower than
the country pays  Russia ’s  Gazprom OAO. (GAZP)   Cheniere, the Houston-based liquefied natural-gas terminal
owner, is also considering an investment of as much as 20
percent in  Lithuania ’s LNG terminal in Klaipeda, Sekmokas said
in a press conference in Vilnius today.  Klaipedos Nafta AB, which operates Lithuania’s oil terminal
on the Baltic Sea, is negotiating possible gas supplies from
Cheniere to help the country diversify from sole supplier
Gazprom. The government is also in talks over gas imports from
Norway and Qatar, Sekmokas said.  Klaipedos, which is 71 percent-owned by the state, wants to
build the country’s first LNG terminal with a capacity of as
much as 2.2 million tons. The terminal may cost 200 million
euros ($284.8 million) and is expected to be online in 2014,
Sekmokas said.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said in the same press
conference today the government is beginning the construction of
the terminal on its own and may invite private investors in
later stages of the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
