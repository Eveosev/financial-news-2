Gasoline rose for a sixth consecutive
day in New York after three  Texas City ,  Texas , refineries lost
power because of a blackout and a weaker dollar increased the
investment appeal of commodities.  Futures gained as refineries owned by BP Plc,  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  lost power for the second time
since April 25. The dollar fell 1 percent versus the euro as of
3:14 p.m. in New York. BP said its refinery has returned to
normal operations and Valero and Marathon are starting units.  “The biggest news is the weakness in the dollar, and then
the news that there was another blackout in Texas City probably
spiked both products and crude,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 4.37 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to settle at $3.092 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The Nymex futures contract covers reformulated
gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, delivered to the New York Harbor
region.  June’s premium to the July contract widened to 6.07 cents
from 4.09 cents yesterday. The June contract expires May 31.  Prices climbed 5.3 percent this week, the first weekly gain
since April 29, when prices reached the 2011 peak of $3.4648.
Gasoline has since lost 11 percent.  Gasoline outperformed crude oil and heating oil as pump
prices fell and  consumer confidence  rose before the Memorial Day
three-day holiday weekend. The May 30 holiday is the traditional
kickoff of the summer driving season.  Memorial Day  “Consumer sentiment was good and we’re right ahead of
Memorial Day weekend and nobody wants to be short RBOB,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New
York and a trader at the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 0.4 cent yesterday to
$3.809 a gallon, the lowest price since April 12, AAA said on
its website.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment increased to a three-month high of 74.3 from
69.8 in April. Economists forecast a reading of 72.4, the same
as the preliminary figure issued earlier this month, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Heating oil for June delivery rose 0.76 cent to settle at
$2.9905 a gallon on the exchange. Prices advanced 2.5 percent
this week.  Crude oil for July delivery added 36 cents to settle at
$100.59 a barrel on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
