Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said a consensus has almost been reached on selecting the head
of the  International Monetary Fund  and a candidate from BRICS
countries may contend for the post of the new chief’s deputy.  “There is a shortlist of candidates that could lay claim
to this position, the French candidacy, the Mexican candidacy,”
Medvedev said at a press conference today after a Group of Eight
summit in Deauville, France. “But on the whole consensus has
practically been reached on this issue.”  French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  is vying to
become France’s fifth IMF chief and maintain Europe’s hold on
the position. While developing nations have called for an end to
Europe’s 65-year hold on the post, they have failed to unite
behind one nominee. Mexican central bank Governor Agustin Carstens is among Lagarde’s rivals for the job.  Appointing a candidate to the post of deputy head from one
of the so-called BRICS nations “would make the decision-making
process at the IMF more legitimate, more balanced, and better
reflect the weight of major economic players,” Medvedev said,
referring to Brazil, Russia, India, China and  South Africa .  Russia supports Grigori Marchenko, the chairman of the
Kazakh central bank, to head the fund, though it will “study”
other nominees for the post, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said
yesterday.  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said today that
Lagarde’s candidacy is “very strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
