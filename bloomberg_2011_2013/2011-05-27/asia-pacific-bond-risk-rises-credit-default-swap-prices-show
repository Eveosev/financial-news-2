The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
111.5 basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 2 basis points
to 111.5 basis points as of 8:42 a.m. in Singapore, according to
Barclays Plc.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 123.5
basis points as of 9:40 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup
Inc. prices.  Credit-default swaps protect bond investors against
default, and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
