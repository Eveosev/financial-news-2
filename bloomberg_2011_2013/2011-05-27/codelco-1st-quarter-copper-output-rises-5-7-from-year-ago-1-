Codelco, the world’s largest copper
company, reported a 5.7 percent increase in first-quarter
production as output from its Radomiro Tomic mine helped offset
a drop at Chuquicamata in northern  Chile ’s Atacama Desert.  Copper output climbed to 425,000 metric tons in the first
three months of the year from 402,000 tons a year earlier,
according to a statement posted in the state-owned company’s
website. Excluding its share of production from its stake in the
El Abra mine, output rose to 414,000 tons from 383,000 tons.  Santiago-based Codelco is spending $17.5 billion over five
years to revamp its aging mines where production has fallen five
times in six years.  The company “should be close” to its 2011 production
target of 1.75 million tons, Chief Executive Officer  Diego
Hernandez  said April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
