Money-supply  growth, which the
 European Central Bank  uses as a gauge of future inflation,
weakened in April as the region grappled with a debt crisis.  M3 money supply rose 2 percent from a year earlier, after
increasing 2.3 percent in the previous month, the Frankfurt-
based central bank said today. Loans to the private sector rose
2.6 percent from a year earlier.  The euro-region economy may struggle to gather strength as
governments step up spending cuts to lower budget gaps and
investors grow increasingly concerned that  Greece  may have to
restructure its debt. ECB Executive Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said yesterday that the financial environment
remains “fragile,” calling some euro-region banks’ reliance on
ECB liquidity measures “not sustainable.”  “There is a strong and growing divergence between core and
periphery countries,” said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in Paris. “Interest rates are still very
very low in real terms.”  M3 is the broadest gauge of money supply and includes cash
in circulation, some forms of savings and money-market holdings.
In the three months through April, M3 increased 2.1 percent from
a year earlier. The annual rate of M1 money-supply growth slowed
to 1.7 percent in April from 3 percent in March.  Euro-region inflation accelerated to 2.8 percent in April,
breaching the ECB’s 2 percent limit for a fifth month. The
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg will release
this month’s consumer-price data on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
