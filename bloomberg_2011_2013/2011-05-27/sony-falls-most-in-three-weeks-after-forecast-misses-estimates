Sony Corp. (6758)  declined to its lowest in
almost two years after Japanâ€™s largest exporter of consumer
electronics forecast lower profit than analysts estimated.  Sony dropped 3.2 percent to close at 2,167 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the lowest closing price since July 13, 2009.
The stock was the biggest percentage-loser on the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average, which slid 0.4 percent today.  Net income will probably be 80 billion yen ($978 million)
in the year to March 2012, the Tokyo-based maker of Cyber-shot
cameras and Bravia televisions said yesterday. That missed the
115.9 billion yen average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Morgan Stanley MUFJ Securities Co. lowered its target price
for the stock 13 percent to 2,700 yen and reduced estimates for
earnings this fiscal year.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  also cut their price
estimates for the stock, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
