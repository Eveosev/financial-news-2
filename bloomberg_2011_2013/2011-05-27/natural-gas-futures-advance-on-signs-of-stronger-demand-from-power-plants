Natural gas futures climbed to the
highest price in more than three weeks on forecasts of above-
normal temperatures that may boost demand from  power plants .  Gas advanced 3.6 percent after forecasters including MDA
EarthSat Weather in Rockville,  Maryland , predicted hotter-than-
normal weather in the central and eastern U.S. through June 10.
Temperatures may be up to 14 degrees above normal in parts of
the southern central U.S., according to MDA.  “The return to hot weather is giving us a little bit of a
psychological boost,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Yesterday we had a very
bearish storage injection, and the warm weather was the only
thing that kept the market from cracking altogether.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 15.8 cents to $4.518 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement price for a contract closest to
expiration since May 4 and the biggest percentage gain since
April 28.  Gas prices are trading near the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement level after reaching a 14-week high of $4.729 per
million British thermal units on May 2. Some technical traders
view this move as a signal that prices will climb.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or climb by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low.  Gas traders were buying back previously sold contracts
before the Memorial Day weekend in the U.S., Pax Saunders, an
analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a note to
clients today.  Pre-Weekend Trading  Contract volume rose during the day “as traders picked up
the short covering to square those books ahead of the long
weekend,” Saunders said. Gas futures volume in electronic
trading on the Nymex was 258,731 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with
the three-month average of 307,000.  Volume was 271,680 yesterday. Open interest was 909,997
contracts. The three-month average open interest is 943,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  Warm weather can increase demand for air conditioning,
sparking demand for gas from power generators. The high
temperature in  Dallas  on June 4 may be 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37
Celsius), 10 above normal, according  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in New York may be 80 degrees, 4
above normal.  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 7 percent above normal
from June 2 through June 6, said  David Salmon , a meteorologist
with Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Gas Rigs  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by 15 this week to 881, according to data from Baker Hughes
Inc. Gas rigs climbed for the first time in three weeks and are
down 11 percent from the 2010 high of 992.  Gas stockpiles rose 105 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 20 to 2.024 trillion cubic feet, the department
reported yesterday. The five-year average storage change for the
week is an increase of 95 billion cubic feet, department data
showed.  Supplies were 1.3 percent below the five-year average last
week, narrower than a deficit of 1.8 percent the previous week.
Storage levels were 10 percent below the level a year earlier
compared with 11 percent a week earlier.  “We certainly could see storage refill to the 3,800 bcf
level in 2011 (and maybe set a record), but, at this point, we
do not expect gas in storage to reach peak capacity of 4,050”
billion, analysts including  Cameron Horwitz  at Canaccord Genuity
in Houston said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
