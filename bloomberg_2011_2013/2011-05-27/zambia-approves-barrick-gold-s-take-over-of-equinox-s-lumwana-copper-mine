Zambia approved  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s
purchase of the Lumwana copper mine as part of a C$7.3 billion
($7.5 billion) takeover of  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , the southern
African nation’s antitrust body said.  Barrick, the world’s largest producer of the metal, must
let the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings
keep its 2.2 percent stake in Equinox as a condition of the
approval for the deal, the Zambian Competition Commission said
in an e-mailed statement today. It must also honor Lumwana’s
existing agreements with a local smelter and suppliers, while
limiting job losses, the commission said.  “The Board granted final conditional authorization on the
premise that the acquisition did not raise any competition
concerns because  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  had no known presence in
Zambia and, therefore, unlikely to lead to a situation that
could substantially lessen competition in the mining sector,”
it said.  Zambia, the largest African copper producer, will increase
output to 2 million metric tons a year by 2015 as prices more
than doubled since 2009, Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane 
said in April. The nation produced 819,159 tons last year, up 17
percent, according to the Bank of Zambia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
