Milk production in New Zealand and
 Australia , the world’s two biggest dairy exporters, may increase
next season because of favorable weather conditions, according
to  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)   Output in New Zealand, the largest shipper, may climb as
much as 5 percent in the 2011-2012 season, the bank said in an
e-mailed report, citing Doug Steel, economist at  Bank of New
Zealand Ltd.  Production in Australia may rise 2.2 percent to 9.3
billion liters, according to the report.  Wet conditions in most regions of Australia and lower feed
costs will likely boost production in the season starting July
1, Dairy Australia said this month. Fonterra Cooperative Group
Ltd., which processes about 95 percent of New Zealand’s milk,
said last week output in the season ending May 31 may rise 4
percent to a record.  “La Nina conditions are forecast to weaken through winter
and overall conditions are likely to be favorable, bringing a
further improvement in production per cow,” Steel said in the
report, referring to  New Zealand . Production in Australia may
rise after rain in late 2010 and early 2011 increased water
allocations and dam storage levels, according to the report.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology this week  forecast  a 55
percent to 70 percent chance of a wetter-than-normal June-to-
August in eastern Australia. Milk production in Australia in the
2013-2014 season may be between 9.2 billion and 9.5 billion
liters, according to  Dairy Australia .  New Zealand’s milk season will run from June 1 to May 31,
2012. Australia’s season will run from July 1 to June 30.  To contact the reporter for this story:
