Botswana’s government fired 1,951
workers in “essential services” who had continued a pay strike
after being warned to return to work, said Mokgweetsi Masisi,
minister for presidential affairs and public administration.  About 67 percent of employees were at work during the six-
week strike, with an average of 25,000 workers away, Masisi said
in an e-mailed statement today from Gaborone, the capital. Labor
unions want a 12 percent wage increase for state workers while
the government has offered 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
