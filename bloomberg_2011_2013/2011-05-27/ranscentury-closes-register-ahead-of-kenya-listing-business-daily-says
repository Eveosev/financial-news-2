TransCentury Ltd., a Kenyan investor
in infrastructure projects, will close its shareholders register
on June 3 to prepare for a listing on the  Nairobi Stock
Exchange , Business Daily reported.  Closure of the register will allow for the transfer of
shares to an electronic registry, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing Dyer & Blair Investment Bank Ltd., the transaction
adviser.  TransCentury announced in March it plans to list in the
first half of this year, without providing a specific date. The
listing will be by introduction, meaning it wonâ€™t sell new
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
