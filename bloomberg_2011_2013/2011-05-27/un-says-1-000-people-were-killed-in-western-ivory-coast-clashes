At least 1,012 people were killed in
western  Ivory Coast  in five months of post-election violence,
the United Nations operation in the country said.  The “communal violence and clashes” broke out between
security forces loyal to former President  Laurent Gbagbo , backed
by militias and mercenaries, and the Republican Forces that
supported President-elect  Alassane Ouattara . They were aided by
dozos, a group of traditional hunters in the area, according to
the UN’s investigation into the fighting.  At least 505 people were killed in the town of Duekoue, the
UN said. Gbagbo, who ruled the world’s top cocoa producer for a
decade, refused to step down after losing a November vote to
Ouattara. He was captured in Abidjan, the commercial capital, on
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
