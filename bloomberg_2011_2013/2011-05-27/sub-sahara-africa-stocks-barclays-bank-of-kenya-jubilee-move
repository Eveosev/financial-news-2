shillings. The company’s shareholders approved a four-for-one
share split at its annual general meeting in Nairobi.  Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC)  , a Nairobi-based insurer
with operations in five African countries, plunged 16.7
shillings, or 8 percent, to 192 shillings, the biggest drop
since April 6, after shareholders yesterday approved an increase
in share capital to 350 million shillings ($4.1 million) from
247.5 million shillings.  “The increase will bring it down for a short while because
it causes some investors to cut down on their shares due to
dilution,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan
Capital Ltd. said by phone today. The share also started trading
without the right to a dividend today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
