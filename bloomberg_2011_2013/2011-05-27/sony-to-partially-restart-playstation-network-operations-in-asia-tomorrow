Sony Corp. (6758)  will resume some of its
PlayStation Network and Qriocity entertainment services in Asia
tomorrow, more than a month after the biggest online data breach
in U.S. history led to the suspension of operations.  Online gaming and chat are among services that will restart
in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand
from tomorrow, while services in  South Korea  and  Hong Kong  will
remain suspended until further notice, the company said in a
statement today.  The Tokyo-based maker of the PlayStation 3 game consoles
began resuming services outside Asia May 15. The company earlier
this week estimated the attack that may have resulted in the
theft of data on more than 100 million accounts will cost about
14 billion yen ($173 million) this fiscal year.  Sony has adopted advanced security technologies and added
software to monitor intruders and vulnerabilities, the company
said. It also enhanced its network infrastructure to detect
unusual activity patterns that may signal an attack, it said.  Sony plans to fully restore the network, including
purchases of games and video content globally, by the end of
May, Makiko Noda, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
