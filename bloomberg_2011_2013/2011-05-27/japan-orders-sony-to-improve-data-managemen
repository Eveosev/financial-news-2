Sony Corp. (6758)  was told by the Japanese
government to improve management of personal data after the
electronics maker’s networks were attacked by hackers who stole
customer information.  The government ordered Sony to carry out preventive
measures against data breaches, the Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry said in a statement today. Sony was also instructed
to ease customer concerns over misuse of their credit cards and
share more information among affiliates, according to the
 statement .  The Tokyo-based maker of PlayStation 3 game consoles will
resume its online entertainment services in  Japan , Taiwan,
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand tomorrow, while
services in  South Korea  and  Hong Kong  will remain suspended
until further notice, Sony said today. Sony plans to fully
restore the network, including purchases of games and video
content, globally by the end of this month.  The government had three discussions with Sony since April
26, when the electronics maker reported some customer data may
have been stolen, according to the statement. Sony has responded
to the government’s request to provide details of the data leak,
the company’s plan to enhance security management and to protect
customer information, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
