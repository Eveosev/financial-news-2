Croatian gas pipeline operator
 Plinacro d.d . welcomed Russia’s offer to resuscitate a plan to
build a liquefied natural gas terminal on the island of Krk,
said Plinacro chief Jerko Jelic Balta.  Russia’s Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko told  Oil & Gas
Eurasia Magazine  on May 24 that Russia is interested in building
a gas terminal on the Adriatic island.  Croatia  and state-owned Plinacro are looking at options
after Adria LNG, with partners  E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  OMV AG (OMV) , Geoplin d.d. and
 Total SA (FP) , backed out of an earlier plan because of lower demand
for gas in Europe.  Croatia  in April said it’s gauging interest
for long-term gas supply in the region before deciding whether
to build a land-based terminal or install a floating LNG
terminal served by vessels.  “We are very pleased that such a respectable player has
shown interest in building an LNG terminal in Croatia,” Jelic
Balta said yesterday, according to company spokeswoman Neda
Erdeljac.  Shmatko met in Zagreb with Croatia’s deputy premier for
investment, Domagoj Ivan Milosevic, on May 20. Milosevic would
not disclose the details of the meeting, when contacted by
Bloomberg. During the visit, Shmatko also signed a cooperation
agreement with  Jadranski Naftovod d.d. (JNAFRA) , a state-owned oil
pipeline operator.  Shmatko said the LNG terminal on Krk would make it possible
to establish a new gas center in the south of Europe, according
to Oil & Gas Eurasia Magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
