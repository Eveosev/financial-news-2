Peru’s sol headed for a fourth
straight weekly gain after rising support for Congresswoman
Keiko Fujimori fueled bets she will win the country’s
presidential runoff and spur foreign investment.  The sol has strengthened 0.3 percent this week to 2.7490
per  U.S. dollar  at 10:40 a.m. New York time, from 2.7580 on May
20. The currency was little changed today.  The sol rose to a three-year high on May 25 as opinion
polls showed Fujimori extended her lead over ex-military rebel
Ollanta Humala. Fujimori had 46.9 percent support in a May 22
poll by Datum Internacional published yesterday, and Humala had
41.8 percent. Humala, who topped the field in the first round of
balloting last month, has pledged to renegotiate contracts with
foreign companies and revise a free trade agreement with the
U.S. if he wins the June 5 vote.  “An Humala victory now seems a lot less likely,” said
Dirk Willer, head of Latin American local markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
