The euro is as strong as the deutsche
mark was and  Germany  as an export nation is one of the main
beneficiaries of  Europe â€™s common currency, said Heinrich Haasis,
president of the German association of savings banks.  Countries should focus on cutting deficits to overcome the
crisis and people should stop speculating about a possible
haircut on Greek sovereign debt, Haasis said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
