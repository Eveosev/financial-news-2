The  World Bank  approved two loans for
a combined $143 million to  Senegal  for budget support and to
boost education in the West African nation, the Washington-based
institution said.  A 40-year concessional $42 million loan will be used to
improve public finances, roads and the health system and another
$101 million loan was to help expand the countryâ€™s universities,
it said in e-mailed statements today.  Students in Senegal have staged regular strikes to protest
late payments of scholarships and overcrowding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
