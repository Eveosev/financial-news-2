Lithuania  has agreed to four deals to
sell its spare emissions permits for the first time.  The government plans to sign agreements with buyers this
week and next, Laura Dzelzyte, an adviser to the Lithuanian
enviroment minister, said in an interview from Vilnius. She
declined to identify the buyers or the size of the sale.  The transcations would be Lithuania’s first sales of  United
Nations  overseen Assigned Amount Units, known as AAUs.
Lithuania, which has a 50 million surplus allowances through
2012 of greenhouse gas emission allowances granted under the
Kyoto Protocol, wants to use the proceeds for subsidies, loans
and investments in climate-change projects.  AAUs are assigned to developed and emerging nations that
have greenhouse-gas emission targets under the 1997  Kyoto
Protocol . The treaty allows countries with surplus AAUs to sell
them to nations that have exceeded their quota.  Irena Degutiene, Lithuania’s parliamentary chairwoman, said
on May 5 that the country plans to sell carbon permits to
Luxembourg in a deal valued at 50 million litai ($21 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
