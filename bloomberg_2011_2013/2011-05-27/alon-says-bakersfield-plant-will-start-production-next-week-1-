Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  expects to start
production next week at its Bakersfield, California, plant,
according to Joseph Israel, a company executive.  “Executing start-up procedures per plan,” Israel, based
at company headquarters in  Dallas , said in an e-mail today.  A hydrogen sulfide leak was discovered during startup May
24. The company evacuated all contractors from the units, Gordon
Leaman, the refinery general manager, said at the time.  Alon said in March that it expected to start the
hydrocracker at the refinery by mid-2011. The company plans to
process vacuum gasoil produced by its other California
refineries. The plant has been closed since before Alon bought
it from Flying J Inc. last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
