Ukrainian winter-wheat yields are set
to rise 11 percent after plants survived winter in good
condition, the country’s  Hydrometeorology Center  said.  The average yield will probably increase to 3 metric tons a
hectare (2.5 acres) from 2.7 tons in 2010, Tetiana Adamenko,
head of the agricultural department at the Kiev-based center,
said today by phone. The winter-grain crop will reach 23.5
million tons this year including wheat, barley and rye, the
center estimates.  The total grain harvest, including winter and spring crops,
will probably reach 43 million to 44 million tons, depending
mostly on weather in June, Adamenko said.  Winter grains are in satisfactory condition for now with
sufficient soil moisture, according to Adamenko. Spring grains
will benefit from rains next month, she said, adding that no
rainfall is expected before June 5-6. June is typically
Ukraine’s wettest summer month, according to the meteorologist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
