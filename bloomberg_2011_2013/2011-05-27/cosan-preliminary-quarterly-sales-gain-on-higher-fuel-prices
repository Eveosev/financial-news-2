Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which
jointly controls the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , said preliminary quarterly sales
increased 4.9 percent on higher fuel prices.  Revenue rose to 4.61 billion reais ($2.88 billion) in the
fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31, from 4.39 billion
reais in the year-ago period,  Barra Bonita , Brazil-based Cosan
said yesterday in a statement released after regular trading
hours. Cosan is scheduled to report full earnings June 6.  Cosan reported “weaker-than-expected numbers,” Fernando Ferreira and Isabella Simonato, analysts at Bank of America,
wrote in a note to clients. Net revenue was 10 percent below
their estimate, they said.  The company’s ethanol and fuel sales at its service
stations, which account for almost two-thirds of revenue,
increased 12 percent to 2.91 billion reais in the period. Total
domestic sales of ethanol and gasoline climbed 6.1 percent last
quarter, according to the Brazilian oil regulator’s  website .  Sugar sales fell 19 percent to 985.1 million reais after a
drought in  Brazil  pared output of the tropical plant. Brazil is
the world’s largest sugar-cane grower.  Shell and Cosan last year agreed to combine ethanol-making
and fuel-distribution assets in Brazil. Shell said it would
contribute about $1.6 billion of cash and assets including 2,740
service stations, while Cosan provides 23 cane-crushing mills,
1,730 gas stations and other assets.  Cosan fell 0.8 percent to 23.65 reais in Sao Paulo trading
at 11:43 a.m. New York time. The stock has dropped 14 percent
this year, more than the 7.2 percent decline for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
