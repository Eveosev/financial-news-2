China ’s money-market rate declined
the most in more than a week as maturing bills and  repurchase
agreements  will add funds to the banking system next month.  The seven-day repurchase rate retreated from its highest
level in three months as Citigroup Inc. and  Societe Generale  SA
forecast in reports this week that 550 billion yuan ($84.7
billion) to 600 billion yuan will come due in June. The People’s
Bank of China pumped 126 billion yuan back into the economy in
the last two weeks, Wee-Khoon Chong, the Hong Kong-based fixed-
income strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a research
report today.  “The central bank has been quite conscious on the tight
squeeze on liquidity so they have been a net returner of
liquidity in the system by rolling over a lot less of their
bills and repos,” said Chia Woon Khien, the Singapore-based
head of currency and interest-rate strategy for  Asia  excluding
 Japan  at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The seven-day repo rate slid 64 basis points to 4.37
percent as of 10:21 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It
touched 5.50 percent on May 25, the highest level since Feb. 23.
The rate increased 31 basis points in the past five days.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.49 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell six basis points this
week.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 slipped two basis points to 3.63 percent and was down three
basis points for the week, according to the Interbank Funding
Center.  --Lilian Karunungan. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
