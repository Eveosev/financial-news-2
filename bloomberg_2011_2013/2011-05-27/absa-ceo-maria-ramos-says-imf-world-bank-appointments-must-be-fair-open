Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Maria Ramos said  International Monetary Fund  and World
Bank appointments must go to the best qualified people, not to
certain countries, in response to a question posed by reporters
on  Trevor Manuel ’s candidacy.  “It does not make sense to reserve the job for  Europe  or a
certain country,” Ramos said. The process of appointment must
be fair and open in today’s world, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
