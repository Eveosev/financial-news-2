Milling wheat for November delivery
may climb in Paris today after closing above 250 euros ($356) a
metric ton, which may prompt buying by sellers of  call options 
on the future, farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole  said.  The November wheat contract rose 8 euros, or 3.3 percent,
to 252.75 euros on NYSE Liffe in the French capital yesterday,
the highest close since the future started trading in March 2010
and the first above 250 euros a ton.  “This closure is not trivial,” Bourges, France-based
Offre et Demande said in a note on its website. “We could see
an acceleration of price gains due to coverage by sellers of
calls to protect their position.”  There are 9,358 outstanding calls, according to Bloomberg
data, on November-delivery milling wheat with a strike price of
250 euros, meaning buyers of those calls can exercise the right
to buy the underlying future at that price. That may prompt
sellers of the call to buy the underlying security so they can
meet their obligations.  Wheat is climbing amid concern that drought will hurt crops
in  France ,  Germany  and the U.K., the biggest growers in the
European Union. The EU wheat harvest may slide 3.5 percent this
year because of the adverse weather, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts and traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
