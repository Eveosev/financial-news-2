U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
refineries returned to service from outages.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 35 cents to $16.10
over WTI at 4:12 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened
20 cents to $15.55 a barrel.  “One of the things we’re seeing is really the return of
refineries from both scheduled and unscheduled outages,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Refinery utilization increased by 3.1 percentage points to
86.3 percent of capacity in the week ended May 20, the Energy
Department said in a May 25 report.  The gain “happened throughout the Midwest as well as the
 Gulf Coast ,” Lipow said.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained 20 cents to $9.70 a barrel, and Poseidon’s premium
rose 15 cents to $9.60 over WTI.  Thunder Horse’s premium rose 50 cents to $14.25 a barrel
over WTI, and Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $1 to
$9.25.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount shrank 25 cents to $2.25 a
barrel. The grade has been tracking more closely to its
historical average discount over WTI because it’s delivered in
Midland, Texas, close to Cushing,  Oklahoma .  The premium for Syncrude, a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from  tar sands  in Alberta, was unchanged at $10 a
barrel.  The discount for Western Canada Select shrank 25 cents to
$17.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
