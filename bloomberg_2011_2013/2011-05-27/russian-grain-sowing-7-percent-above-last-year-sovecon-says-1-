Russian farmers sowed wheat on 11.15
million hectares (27.6 million acres) as of May 26, and total
grain crop sowing rose to 24 million hectares, up 7 percent from
last year, researcher SovEcon  said , citing agriculture ministry
figures.  Feed barley had sown on 6.46 million hectares, corn on 1.39
million hectares, and sunflowers on 6.18 million hectares as of
yesterday, the Moscow-based researcher said.  Russia’s Central Federal District accelerated sowing and
reduced a lag behind 2010 to 35,000 hectares from 270,000
hectares 10 days ago, SovEcon said.  Oilseed sowing was done at a record pace, the researcher
said. Sunflower sowing exceeded last year’s by 278,000 hectares,
mostly in the Volga regions. Rapeseed planting exceeded 2010 by
65,000 hectares, mostly in Siberia and the Urals, SovEcon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
