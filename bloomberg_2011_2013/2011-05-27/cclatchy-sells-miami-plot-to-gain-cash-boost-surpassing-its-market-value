McClatchy Co. (MNI) , publisher of the Miami
Herald, sold a 14-acre parcel of Miami land for $236 million to
 Genting Malaysia BHD (GENM) , a sale begun six years ago by then-
independent Knight Ridder Inc. The shares rose 6.9 percent.  The sale includes the Miami Herald Media Co.’s headquarters
and a parking lot, the company said today. Under the agreement,
the  Miami Herald  and El Nuevo Herald can operate out of the
building for up to two years rent free while seeking a new home.  The deal may provide McClatchy with a cash boost surpassing
its market value. Revenue at the Sacramento, California-based
company has dropped for three years as circulation and ad sales
were hurt by competition from Internet publications. Its shares
have lost 94 percent in the past five years, leaving the company
with a market value of $234.7 million, as of yesterday’s close.  McClatchy added 19 cents to $2.95 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, for the biggest single day
gain since March 21. The stock had lost 41 percent this year
before today.  The company inherited the sale of about 10 acres in Miami
when it acquired Knight Ridder for $4.1 billion in 2006. It
extended the closing deadline for another buyer three times and
collected at least $16 million during the negotiations.  Slumping Circulation  The publisher said it will contribute $163 million of the
sale price toward its  pension plan , $65 million will be offered
to certain debt holders, $6 million will be held in escrow and
$2 million will be used to pay taxes.  McClatchy’s paid circulation for newspapers including the
Kansas City Star and  Fort Worth Star-Telegram  fell 3.7 percent
in the first quarter and its advertising sales, which account
for almost three-quarters of revenue, dropped 11 percent to
$225.1 million.  Bonds of McClatchy rose to the highest in more than two
weeks. Its $865 million of 11.5 percent debt due in February
2017 increased 1.6 cents to 109.8 cents on the dollar at 12:37
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
