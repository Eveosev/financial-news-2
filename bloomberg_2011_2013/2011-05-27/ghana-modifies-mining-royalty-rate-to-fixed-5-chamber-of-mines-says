Ghana , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, began charging a fixed 5 percent royalty rate to
mining companies operating in the West African nation in a bid
to boost government earnings from the industry.  The new rate, which took effect in March, changes the
previous range of 3 to 6 percent, Dan Owiredu, president of
Ghana Chamber of Mines, said at the group’s annual meeting in
Accra, the capital, today.  South Africa’s  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , which operates the
Obuasi gold mine, and Greenwood Village, Colorado-based  Newmont
Mining Corp. (NEM)  have so-called stability agreements that make them
exempt from the changes, Owiredu said.  “Mining companies which do not have stability agreements
with the government have started paying the new rate,” he said.  AngloGold and Newmont’s agreements are capped at 3 percent
over 15 years, said Newman Kusi, an adviser to Ghana’s  Finance
Ministry , by phone today. The government is “negotiating” with
those companies about paying the new rate, he said.  In 2010, gold production in Ghana rose 1.4 percent to 2.97
million ounces, with sales earning $3.62 billion, the Chamber of
Mines said March 8. Ghana also mines manganese, bauxite and
diamonds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
