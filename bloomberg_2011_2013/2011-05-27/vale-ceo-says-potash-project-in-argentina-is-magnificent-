Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest  iron-ore 
producer, sees a “great future” in potash and “solid
fundamentals” in the copper market, newly appointed Chief
Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira said.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale needs to grow “in a significant
way” in markets other than iron ore and nickel, including
fertilizers, copper and coal, Ferreira, who took over as CEO
five days ago, said today on a webcast with analysts and
investors. The copper market has “one of the most solid
fundamentals in the whole industry including iron ore.”  The outlook for fertilizers is “excellent” because world
demand continues to increase, Ferreira said. “Copper will
continue with supply problems.”  Ferreira, 57, replaced  Roger Agnelli  after the Brazilian
government criticized Vale in the past two years for not
investing enough in domestic projects such as steelmaking. The
company will keep its $24 billion investment plan this year and
doesn’t see alterations in its strategy after the replacement.  “The substitution of the CEO is not a reason to have a
substantial change,” Ferreira said today. “The projects were
approved by the board and the shareholders.”  Vale  gained  25 centavos, or 0.6 percent, to 45.03 reais as
of 12:37 p.m. in Sao Paulo, after earlier rising as much as 1.1
percent to 45.25, its highest level in three weeks. Before
today, the stock had declined about 7.7 percent this year, more
than the 7.5 percent decline for the benchmark Bovespa  Index. (IBOV)   To contact the reporter on this story:
