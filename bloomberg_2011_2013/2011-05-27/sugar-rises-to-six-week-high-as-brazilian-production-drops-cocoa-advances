Raw-sugar prices rose to a one-month
high on signs of higher demand and an output decline in  Brazil ,
the world’s top producer. Coffee and cocoa fell.  Unica, a Brazilian sugar group, said yesterday that output
in the main growing region fell 17 percent in the first half of
May from a year earlier.  Mexico  and the European Union increased
import allowances this week.  “The raw market is tight,” said Michael McDougal, a
senior vice president at Newedge USA in New York. “Prices have
started rising in anticipation of rising demand.”  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.3 cent, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at 22.99 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached 23.16 cents, the highest
for a most-active contract since April 27. The commodity climbed
2.6 percent this week, heading for the first monthly gain since
January.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , refined-sugar futures for August
delivery gained $8.30, or 1.3 percent, to $658.30 a metric ton.  Yesterday, Tunisia bought 18,000 tons of white sugar and
14,000 tons of raw sweetener in a tender.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery declined 1.9
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.637 a pound in New York. The price
rose 1.8 percent this week, halting a three-week slide.  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell $41, or 1.4 percent,
to $2,969 a ton. The price climbed 2.3 percent this week, ending
a three-week slump.  In London, robusta coffee and cocoa dropped.  ICE will be closed on May 31 for a U.S. holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
