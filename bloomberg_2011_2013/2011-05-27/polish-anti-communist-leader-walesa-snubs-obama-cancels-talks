Former Polish President Lech Walesa,
who led the Solidarity labor movement that helped bring down
communism, canceled a meeting with U.S. President  Barack Obama ,
saying he had other plans.  “It just isn’t convenient now,” Walesa told private
broadcaster TVN24 in a live interview today, adding that he
hoped to meet with Obama “another time.” Their meeting had
been scheduled for tomorrow in the Polish capital, Warsaw.  While ties between  Poland  and the U.S. were long buoyed by
a shared history of anti-communism, the invasion of Iraq and
Poland’s exclusion from America’s visa-waiver program have
dampened enthusiasm before Obama’s first visit to Poland today.
Forty-three percent of Poles currently have a favorable opinion
of Americans, down from 62 percent in 1993, according to a
survey by the Center for Public Research in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
