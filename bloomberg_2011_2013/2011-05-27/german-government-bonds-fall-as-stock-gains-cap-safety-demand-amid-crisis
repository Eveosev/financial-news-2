German bunds dropped, paring their
longest streak of weekly gains in more than a decade, as
advances in Asian and European stocks curbed demand for the
perceived safety of the euro region’s benchmark securities.  Ten-year bund yields rose from their lowest level in four
months as the  MSCI AC Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index of stocks and the Stoxx
 Europe  600 index gained 0.7 percent. A report today is expected
to show inflation in Europe’s largest economy remained at a 2
1/2 year high this month. Italy is scheduled to sell up to 1.5
billion euros ($2.14 billion) of inflation-protected bonds due
2021 today.  The 10-year bund yield rose one basis point to 3.01 percent
as of 8:27 a.m. in  London , after earlier reaching 2.99 percent,
the lowest since Jan. 12. The 3.25 percent security due July
2021 fell 0.115, or 1.15 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
102.050. Yields on two-year notes were unchanged at 1.61 percent
after dropping to 1.60 percent, the least since March 18.  Benchmark bund yields are set for their seventh consecutive
week of declines, their longest losing streak since January
2001, as investors purchased the securities as a buffer against
the euro-region’s worsening debt crisis.  Germany ’s inflation rate, using a harmonized European Union
method, stayed at 2.7 percent in the year to May, matching the
highest level since September 2008, according to the median
forecast of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a return of
0.1 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg, while Treasuries have returned 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
