The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries plans to seek a $2 billion loan from the Dubai
Sovereign Fund, and wealthy individuals in the  United Arab
Emirates , the Herald reported, citing the group’s President
Joseph Kanyekanye.  Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru and leaders from the
group that represents manufacturers in the southern African
nation, will travel to Dubai next month, the Harare-based state-
owned newspaper cited Kanyekanye as saying on its website.   Manufacturers in the country haven’t been able to borrow
from Zimbabwean banks because they don’t have enough money to
lend, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
