Spot gasoline gained in  Chicago  on
speculation that refinery outages at two Illinois plants may
raise demand for pipeline shipments of motor fuel to Chicago-
area markets.  The premium for 87-grade conventional gasoline in Chicago
versus July futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  widened
5.75 cents to 23 cents as of 2:44 p.m. The price for prompt
delivery rose 7.61 cents to $3.256.  “It could generate interest in Gulf Coast barrels going
north,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply
at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas. “We have seen
evidence of that this week.”  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  said yesterday it was working to restart
its Robinson refinery after a power loss May 25. A catalytic
cracker at  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Joliet refinery is expected to
remain shut for until at least next week, a person with
knowledge of the situation said.  “Repairs continue,” Kevin Allexon, a spokesman for Exxon
in Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail today, while declining
to identify the unit being repaired.  The premium for the fuel in the Midcontinent narrowed 1.5
cents to 4.25 cents a gallon. The prompt price rose 2.47 cents
to $3.1305.  “Marathon is still in restart and Chicago is strengthening
a little,” said Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in Kansas City.  In the Gulf Coast market, 87-grade gasoline was unchanged,
trading a second day at a discount to July futures of 11.5
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
