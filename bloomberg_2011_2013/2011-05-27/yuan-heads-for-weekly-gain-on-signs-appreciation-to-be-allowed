China ’s yuan completed its second
consecutive weekly gain on speculation policy makers will
tolerate appreciation to tame inflation.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.04 percent stronger at 6.4898 per dollar today, the
highest level since July 2005. Year-on-year inflation may
accelerate to 5.7 percent in May and 6.3 percent in June, making
the government’s goal to keep it under 4 percent “impossible,”
said Shen Jianguang, the Hong Kong-based chief economist for
greater China at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  “China has to use whatever tools it can deploy to tackle
inflation, including interest-rate hikes and currency
appreciation,” Shen said.  The yuan strengthened 0.02 percent this week to 6.4917 per
dollar as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It was little changed today
and touched 6.4858 yesterday, the strongest level since 1993.
The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than 0.5 percent either side
of the central bank’s daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.02
percent this week and was unchanged today at 6.4925 per dollar.  Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a year
earlier following a 5.4 percent increase in March that was the
biggest since July 2008. A stronger currency helps curb
inflation by reducing the cost of imports.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.13 percent
this week to 6.3760 per dollar in  Hong Kong , declining 0.4
percent on May 23 as  Greece ’s worsening debt crisis prompted
investors to favor safe-haven assets. The contracts reflect a
1.8 percent premium over the onshore spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
