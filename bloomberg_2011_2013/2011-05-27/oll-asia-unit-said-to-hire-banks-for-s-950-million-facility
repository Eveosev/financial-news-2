Toll Holdings Ltd. (TOL) ’s  Asia  unit hired
DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp. to help it
borrow S$950 million ($768 million), according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The loan, a multi-part revolving credit facility, is being
marketed to other lenders, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  Melbourne-based Toll, the Asia-Pacific region’s third-
biggest air freight and logistics company by market value, has
the equivalent of about A$490 million ($524 million) in loans
maturing before the end of 2014, and gets about 18 percent of
its revenue from Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reported a 53 percent increase in first-half earnings in
February because of acquisitions and new contracts with
companies including Woolworths Ltd. and BHP Billiton Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
