Germany ’s steel industry said it
fears costs for electricity could at least double to 400 million
euros annually as the country seeks to move toward renewable
sources of energy.  Hans Juergen Kerkhoff, president of the German steel
association, said in an e-mailed statement that the country’s
 renewable energy  bill would “deal a new blow to the steel
industry.”  He said that “in view of total costs for energy and
climate policy, all possibilities must be utilized to bring down
power prices to a competitive level for energy-intensive
industries,” adding that the German environment ministry had
done “exactly the opposite” in its existing bill.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
