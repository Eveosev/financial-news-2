U.S. government bonds declined as
stocks surged before a report forecast to show  consumer
confidence  in the world’s largest economy climbed to the highest
in three months in May.  A final index of sentiment from Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan is projected to climb to 72.4, matching the
preliminary figure, from 69.8 at the end of April, according to
the median estimate of 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.7 percent and futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 0.2 percent. The 10-year yield
earlier fell to the lowest level this year.  “You can’t rule out a further leg down in yields but
ultimately Treasuries are coming towards the end of their recent
rally,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA
Capital Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The soft patch in the  U.S. economy 
is going to be short lived.”  Ten-year yields advanced two basis points to 3.08 percent
as of 8:58 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.125 percent note due in May 2021 fell 5/32, or
$1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 13/32.  The rate, which has fallen nine basis points this week,
dropped to 3.04 percent earlier today, the lowest since Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
