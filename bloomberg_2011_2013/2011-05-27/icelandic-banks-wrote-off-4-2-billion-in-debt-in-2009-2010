Iceland’s three largest lenders wrote
off 481 billion kronur ($4.2 billion) in debt in 2009 and 2010,
according to Economy Minister Arni Pall Arnason.  Debt to real estate companies and property-related loans
were written down by 34.5 billion kronur, followed by retail-
related writedowns of 29.6 billion kronur, Arnason said in a
 statement  to the Reykjavik-based legislature. The largest
category is “other” sectors, which accounted for 345.8 billion
kronur in write-offs.  Kaupthing Bank hf, Glitnir Bank hf and Landsbanki Islands
hf all collapsed in 2008 after they amassed debt about 10 times
the size of the economy. The banks were taken over by the
government and foreign assets and liabilities were left with the
old units and domestic assets and liabilities were transferred
into new units.  The resolution committees of Kaupthing and Glitnir have
since been given a majority stake in the domestic offshoots,
Arion Banki hf and Islandsbanki hf. The resolution committee of
Landsbanki holds a minority stake in the government-owned
Landsbankinn hf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
