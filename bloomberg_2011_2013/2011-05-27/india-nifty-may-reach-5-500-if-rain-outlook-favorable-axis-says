Suresh Babu Pyarla, a derivatives
strategist at Axis Securities & Sales Ltd, a unit of  India ’s
third-biggest non-state lender, comments on the outlook for
Indian equities. He spoke by phone today in Mumbai.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. gained 1.1 percent to 5,471.80 as of 2:29 p.m. local
time, paring a fifth straight week of losses.  On the June series:  “5,000 and 5,200 put option on the Nifty has the highest
open interest, a signal the market may find a floor around that
level. The recent rebound in the Nifty is not likely to hold as
technical indicators are suggesting a downward trend.”  On outlook for monsoon:  “The market will look to the rain gods for direction next
week. Monsoon will be a key factor for stocks in the near term.
Nifty may rally to 5,500 if initial indications are strong.”  The monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of
India’s annual rainfall, may cover the South Andaman Sea during
the next two to three days, the weather bureau said yesterday.
Agriculture makes up a fifth of  India’s economy  and a bumper
harvest boosts rural incomes, lifting sales of everything from
cars and consumer appliances.  On the May series rollover:  “Rollovers and the roll cost for the May series were the
lowest in at least 20 months, which indicates that the overall
 market sentiment  is weak.”  Indian derivative contracts expire on the last Thursday of
every month. The May series ended yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
