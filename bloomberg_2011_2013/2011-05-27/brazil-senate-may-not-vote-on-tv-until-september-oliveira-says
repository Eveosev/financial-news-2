Brazil â€™s Senate may not vote on a law
which would permit telephone operators such as  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,
 Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP3)  and GVT Holding SA to enter
the subscription television market until September, according to
Senator Eunicio Oliveira.  The measure, which would also end the restriction of
control of television operators to national companies, may not
be under discussion until the second half of the year due to
other priorities, Oliveira said today by telephone from
Fortaleza.  To contact the reporters on this story:
