Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  unit Seattle’s Best
Coffee LLC asked a bankruptcy judge to reject  Borders Group
Inc. (BGP) ’s request to end the companies’ licensing agreement.  Borders isn’t entitled to cancel the agreement and continue
to use Seattle’s Best’s trademarks and products, the coffee
company said today in a filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan. Seattle’s Best also disputed Borders’s claim that
terms of the agreement are excessive.  Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this month asked for
permission to end the licensing agreement, saying that operating
its own cafes would reduce the company’s licensing fees, cut
costs and boost profit at the sites.  Seattle’s Best had cafes in 225 of Borders’s stores that
have closed in bankruptcy, Seattle-based Starbucks said in a
regulatory filing for its quarter ended April 3. Seattle’s Best
is owed about $5 million in trade debt, according to a summary
of Borders’s largest creditors.  Borders, the second-largest book chain after  Barnes & Noble
Inc. (BKS) , filed for bankruptcy in February. The company reported a
loss of $479.9 million for the year ended Jan. 29, on revenue of
$1.67 billion.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
