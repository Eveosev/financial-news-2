Police in Barcelona used force to
clear demonstrators from a protest camp, while a sit-in
expressing opposition to corruption, austerity measures and bank
bailouts continued for a 12th day in  Madrid .  Police cleared about 300 people from the camp in Plaza
Catalunya for safety reasons, said a spokeswoman for the Catalan
police force who declined to be named, citing government policy.
TV images showed police using truncheons. Authorities removed
butane-gas cylinders and other objects that would have been
dangerous if soccer fans take to the square tomorrow during
Barcelonaâ€™s Champions League final, and protesters can go back
once the site is cleaned, she said.  The sit-in demonstration in the Plaza del Sol in central
Madrid continued today as Spaniards protest against corruption,
budget cuts and a youth unemployment rate of 45 percent. The
rally, which began before the ruling Socialist party suffered
its worst local election defeat in three decades on May 22, will
move to several neighborhoods across Madrid this weekend,
according to the organizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
