BDO International, a U.K.-based
auditing firm with annual sales of 5.25 billion euros ($7.5
billion), expects revenue in sub-Saharan  Africa  to increase at
least 10 percent this financial year, Chief Executive Officer
Jeremy Newman said.  “I would be disappointed if we don’t continue to see a
double-digit growth rate in the region,” Newman said in an
interview on May 24, in Bel Ombre, in the southern part of
Mauritius.  Total fees in sub-Saharan Africa increased 28 percent to
53.2 million euros for the financial year through September
2010, with the company’s Mauritian office contributing 15
percent of revenue, Newman said. Operations have been expanded
to 17 countries compared with 14 in the previous year, he said.  After targeting English speaking countries, using  South
Africa  as a hub, BDO International is now seeking growth in
French and Portuguese-speaking nations, Newman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
