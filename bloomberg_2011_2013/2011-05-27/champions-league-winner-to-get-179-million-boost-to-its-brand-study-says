The winner of tomorrow’s  Champions
League  final between  Manchester United  and Barcelona will get a
126 million euro ($179 million) boost to its brand because of
increased broadcast income and prize money, a study says.  The losing team will benefit by about 73 million euros,
according to research released today by MasterCard, a sponsor of
the event, which is being held this year at London’s Wembley
Stadium.  United and Barcelona have each won three European crowns.
The continent’s top club championship is valued at 369 million
pounds, an increase of 17.5 million from last year’s final.
That’s because the two teams already have high global profiles,
the study, done by  Simon Chadwick , a sports business professor
at the U.K.’s Coventry University Business School.  This is “the dream final as far as most football fans are
concerned,” Chadwick said in the statement. “But the English
and Spanish champions are two of the most successful teams off
the pitch too. They will collectively scoop 200 million euros,
making this the most lucrative final in European club football’s
history.”  London ’s economy will get an economic boost of about 52
million euros as supporters come to the city, and spend money on
hotels, food and drink, he said.  Barcelona is the world’s second-most valuable team by
revenue behind Real Madrid, which had 401.4 million euros in
sales in the 2008-09 season, according to figures released by
Deloitte LLP in March. Barcelona had 365.9 million euros in
revenue, while Manchester United had 327 million euros in sales.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
