French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
pushed Group of Eight members to come up with a $40 billion aid
package for Arab nations to support their transition to
democracy, Tunisian Finance Minister Jelloul Ayed said.  “Sarkozy proposed $40 billion in aid for countries in the
region,” Ayed said at a press conference in Deauville, France.
“He said finance ministers would meet by July to decide how to
divide it up among donors and projects.” Ayed didn’t provide
additional details.  G-8 officials met today with the leaders of Tunisia and
 Egypt  to discuss financial assistance for the pro-democracy
movements in North Africa and the Middle East. While a
communique issued after the meeting pledged support, it made no
specific pledges beyond previously announced loans from regional
development banks and international multilateral institutions.  Ayed said he was still “very satisfied” with the
statements of support, saying the G-8 summit in the French
seaside resort was never meant as a donors’ conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
