Minister  Bill Shorten  said rules on foreign ownership in  ASX
Ltd. (ASX) , the country’s main exchange operator, didn’t sink
 Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) ’s bid and they don’t need revision.  “I don’t see the case for changing it at this point,”
Shorten said today in Canberra, referring to the 15 percent cap
on foreign investors in ASX. “This whole issue of ownership
comes down to the future of the ASX.”  The government’s April 8 rejection of Singapore Exchange’s
bid came as pressure increased on rival exchanges to attract
global capital by consolidating. This year, Europe’s Deutsche
Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext agreed to merge, while London Stock
Exchange Group Plc said it would buy Canada’s TMX Group Inc.  Treasurer  Wayne Swan  in April  said  he was “open to the
right deal” if it came along and asked the Council of Financial
Regulators to examine ways to protect the integrity of the
financial system should another bid emerge.  “I don’t think the 15 percent foreign ownership issue is
the reason why the ASX-SGX merger fell over,” Shorten said.
“We have no objection in principle to mergers, but the deal has
got to be a good deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
