German Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s
Free Democratic Party coalition partner is seeking more than 10
billion euros ($14 billion) in tax cuts for middle and lower
incomes,  Bild  reported, citing unnamed party officials.  The size of possible cuts depends on the cost of a planned
phase-out of nuclear power in  Germany , the newspaper said today.
If costs are higher than anticipated, the coalition may consider
a reduction of the so-called solidarity surcharge paid on income
tax to finance eastern German development, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
