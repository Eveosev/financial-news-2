Chile’s peso strengthened for a
fourth day as rising copper prices bolstered trade prospects in
the metal’s top-producing nation and global stock gains
increased demand for riskier assets.  The peso strengthened 0.6 percent to 466.90 per U.S. dollar
at 1:29 p.m.  New York  time, from 469.49 yesterday. Chile’s
currency was little changed for the week.  “Everything is looking rosy today,” said Flavio Magnasco,
an economist at Banco Falabella in Santiago. “Copper is posting
a massive gain and economic data also helped the markets.”  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks rose as much as 1.1 percent
after the leaders of the Group of Eight said the global economy
is gaining strength, while the U.S. dollar fell versus the euro.  Copper rose to a three-week high in New York as increased
premiums signaled stronger demand in  China  and Standard
Chartered Plc predicted price gains, joining banks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The metal for July delivery rose as
much as 2.4 percent to $9,238 a metric ton in  London , and 2
percent in New York to $4.18 a pound.  The five-member cental bank policy board, led by bank
President Jose De Gregorio, voted unanimously on May 12 to raise
the overnight rate by a half-point for the third straight month,
according to minutes distributed today on its website.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 467.74 per  U.S.
dollar  for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
