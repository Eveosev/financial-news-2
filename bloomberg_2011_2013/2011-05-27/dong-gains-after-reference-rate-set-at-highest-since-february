The Vietnamese dong rose for a second
day as the central bank set the currency’s reference rate at the
highest since before the last devaluation in February.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  set the fixing at 20,653 per
dollar, compared with 20,658 yesterday, according to its website.
That’s the highest level since Feb. 10. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of that rate. The
country devalued the dong for the fourth time in 15 months on
Feb. 11, by about 7 percent, to help cut the widening trade
deficit.  The dong gained 0.4 percent to 20,550 per dollar as of 4:30
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  Government bonds  were steady, with yields on benchmark
five-year notes unchanged at 12.75 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
