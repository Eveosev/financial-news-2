The  Prague  Municipal Court sent
indebted lottery company Sazka AS into bankruptcy after a
meeting with creditors in Prague today, the CTK news agency
reported.  The court initiated bankruptcy proceedings against Sazka AS
in March. Creditors voted during a meeting today whether to
allow the company to be declared legally bankrupt and then
reorganize it, CTK said. An insolvency administrator will take
over running the company while it is restructured.  The company was declared insolvent after it breached
covenants on bonds issued to finance building O2 Arena, which
hosted the World Hockey Championship in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
