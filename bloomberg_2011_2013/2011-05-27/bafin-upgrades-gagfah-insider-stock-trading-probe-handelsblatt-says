German financial regulator Bafin
initiated a formal investigation into suspected  insider trading 
in shares of  Gagfah SA (GFJ) ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
unidentified spokeswoman at the watchdog.  A routine inquiry in March revealed enough
“abnormalities” to warrant a more thorough investigation,
Handelsblatt cited the Bafin spokeswoman as saying.  Calls to the office of Bettina Benner, a spokeswoman for
Luxembourg-based Gagfah, weren’t answered outside business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
