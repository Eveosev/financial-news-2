Tea production in Malawi,  Africa ’s
largest producer of the leaf after Kenya, declined 3.2 percent
during the first quarter, the  Reserve Bank  said.  Output between January and the end of March fell to 20.9
million kilograms from 21.6 million kilograms a year earlier,
the Lilongwe-based central bank said in a report published on
its website today. It didn’t give a reason for the decline.  Earnings from sales of the leaf dropped to $2.6 million
from $2.9 million during the period because of increased
supplies of the leaf in Kenya, the bank said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from  Malawi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
