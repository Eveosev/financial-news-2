Russia’s government may want to renew
a grain export ban if prices rise as shipments resume,  SovEcon 
Managing Director Andrey Sizov Jr. said.  The ban started in August may be lifted because of good
crop prospects and stockpiles, Sizov said by e-mail. “The
government is likely to monitor the situation closely due to
risk of higher food inflation and may warn of possible ban on
exports later this year,” Sizov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
