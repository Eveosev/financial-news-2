Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  hired  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s Don Birchenough as co-head of mergers and acquisitions
for the telecommunications, media and technology group in the
Americas, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  Birchenough, who most recently was head of telecom and
media M&A at Deutsche Bank in New York, will start at Credit
Suisse in August, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the move hasn’t been made public. John Gallagher, a
spokesman for Deutsche Bank, confirmed Birchenough’s departure.
 Duncan King , a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to comment.  Birchenough, 43, will lead the Credit Suisse team together
with Steve Geller and report to Boon Sim, global head of mergers
and acquisitions. Birchenough, who started his banking career at
 Salomon Brothers  in 1995, advised Deutsche Telekom AG on its $39
billion sale of T-Mobile USA to AT&T Inc. Last year he advised
Qwest Communications International Inc. on its purchase by
CenuryLink Inc. In 2009 he advised Time Warner Inc. on its
spinoff of AOL Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
