Medical-device maker  Boston
Scientific Corp. (BSX)  said it is recalling ICross coronary imaging
catheters after getting reports that the tip of the device
detached inside patients.  The devices are used in imaging procedures for heart
patients. The company is recalling 29,664 of the catheters
distributed to hospitals in the U.S.,  Puerto Rico , Trinidad,
Tobago and the American Virgin Islands, Natick, Massachusetts-
based Boston Scientific said today in a statement.  The catheter tips may come off when the device becomes too
brittle, the company said in its statement. Eight confirmed
cases have been reported since April 1, 2010, of the device
breaking, which can hurt blood vessel walls, create clotting, or
leave the part trapped in the patient and force another
procedure to retrieve it.  No patients died as a result of the malfunctions, Eric
Olson, a spokesman for Boston Scientific, said in a telephone
interview. Boston Scientific said it will replace the recalled
devices with other brands of imaging catheters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
