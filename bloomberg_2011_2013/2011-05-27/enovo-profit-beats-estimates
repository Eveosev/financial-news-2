Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , China’s biggest
computer maker, climbed the most in two months in  Hong Kong 
after reporting quarterly profit that tripled, beating analyst
estimates.  Lenovo rose 3.7 percent to HK$4.49, the most since March 22,
as of 10:59 a.m. in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI) 
added 0.4 percent.  Net income climbed to $42 million for the quarter ended
March 31, compared with the $38.4 million average of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company wants to capture 20
percent of China’s tablet market with its LePad, and demand for
the device outstripped supply, Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing told reporters yesterday.  Revenue rose 13 percent to $4.88 billion, surpassing the
$4.1 billion median of nine analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Raleign, North Carolina-based Lenovo plans to start
selling tablet computers in the U.S. in the summer, Yang said.
The company aims to double revenue from its touch-screen LePhone
smartphone this fiscal year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
