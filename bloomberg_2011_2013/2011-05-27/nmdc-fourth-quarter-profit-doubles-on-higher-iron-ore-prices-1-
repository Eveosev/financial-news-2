NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) ,  India ’s largest  iron ore 
miner, said fourth-quarter profit almost doubled, in line with
analyst estimates, as prices surged.  Net income climbed to 21 billion rupees ($465 million), or
5.29 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from
10.7 billion rupees, or 2.69 rupees, a year earlier, the
Hyderabad, India-based company said today in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange. The average profit estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 20.8 billion rupees. Sales
rose 90 percent to 37.7 billion rupees.  Rising demand for steel from automobile and construction
companies is spurring demand for iron ore in India. The nation’s
steel demand rose almost 10 percent in the last fiscal year as
higher incomes lifted demand for cars and  government spending 
pushed up sales to infrastructure companies.  NMDC, which sells about 85 percent of output in India,
raised domestic prices by 74 percent to 3,366 rupees a metric
ton in the last quarter from a year earlier. Cash iron ore
prices at Tianjin port in  China  rose 36 percent on average in
the period.  The shares of NMDC rose 2.3 percent to 258.4 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The stock has declined 7.3 percent
this year, compared with an 11 percent decline in the benchmark
Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange. The earnings were
announced after the markets closed.  The company’s tax and royalty expenses in the last quarter
more than doubled to 3.34 billion rupees from a year earlier,
while other income rose 80 percent to 4.43 billion rupees, the
statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
