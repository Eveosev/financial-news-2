Spending on advertising via mobile
phones reached 500 million rand ($72 million) in 2010 and may
double by next year,  Business Day  said, citing Jason Probert,
head of Vodacom Mobile Media, a unit of Vodacom Group Ltd., the
biggest provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans.  Cheaper data rates and an increase in smart-phone users is
driving growth in the mobile-phone advertising market, the
newspaper said, citing Probert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
