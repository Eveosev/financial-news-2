South Africa ’s Bureau For Economic
Research said it expects the country’s Reserve Bank to start its
rate-tightening cycle in September with a 50 basis point
increase.  That compares with an earlier forecast for an initial rise
in November, the bureau, based at the University of Stellenbosch
near  Cape Town , said in a report handed to reporters in
Johannesburg today.  The September increase is expected to be followed by a
further 50 basis point rise in November, and then a 100 basis
point rise during the first quarter of 2012, it said.  In total, the so-called repo rate is projected to rise by a
cumulative 200 basis points during 2012, BER said in its report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
