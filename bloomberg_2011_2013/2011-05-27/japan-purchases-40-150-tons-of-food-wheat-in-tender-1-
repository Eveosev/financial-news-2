Japan  bought 40,150 metric tons of
food wheat from  Australia  and Canada in a tender today, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the total, 26,350 tons were from Canada and the
remainder was from Australia, the ministry said in a statement.
Shipments must be made by Aug. 31, according to Masafumi Otsuka
at the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
