Oil options volatility slipped as the
underlying futures rose after leaders of the Group of Eight said
the global economy is strengthening and as the dollar dropped to
a one-week low against the euro.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New York , down
from 30.4 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for July delivery gained 36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $100.59 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up 0.5 percent for the week. The front-
month contract has increased 35 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $90 puts, with 1,242 lots changing hands. They lost 3 cents
to 41 cents a barrel. July $95 puts, the next-most active
option, dropped 13 cents to 99 cents a barrel with 1,209 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $95 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,738 lots changing hands. They slipped 1 cent
to $1.12 a barrel. The next-most active options, July $90 puts,
dropped 5 cents to 44 cents a barrel on volume of 5,029 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,108 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 42,654
and December 2011 $100 calls with 37,221.  To contact the reporter on this story:
