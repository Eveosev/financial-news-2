Carbon permits in the European
Union’s emissions-trading system had their biggest weekly gain
since April after a report indicated that  Germany ’s seven oldest
nuclear reactors will be permanently shut.  EU allowances for delivery in December jumped as much as 3
percent today on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. They were
headed for a 2.5 percent gain for the week amid speculation that
the German reactors won’t come back online after a temporary
halt boosted demand for pollution rights.  Germany’s environment ministers at the federal and state
levels have agreed not to restart the plants, Deutsche Presse-
Agentur reported, citing Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen.
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in March ordered the reactors to stop
for safety checks following the nuclear crisis in  Japan , where a
tsunami and earthquake crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi station.  “It is only a recommendation, but it could set the tone,”
said Andrew Ager, the  London  head of carbon and emissions at
Prudential Financial Inc.’s Bache Commodities Ltd.  A closure of nuclear  power plants , which are almost
emissions-free, will require more generation from coal and
natural gas plants, which require permits to discharge carbon
dioxide.  Trading in EU power, fuels and carbon permits will probably
surge next month if Germany decides to proceed with the
permanent halt, said Kris Voorspools, director of 70Watt
Capital, the Luxembourg-based hedge fund that trades spreads in
energy and carbon markets.  Germany’s government may decide June 6 on the reactors,
Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
