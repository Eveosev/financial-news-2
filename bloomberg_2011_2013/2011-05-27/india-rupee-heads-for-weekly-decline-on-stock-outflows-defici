India ’s rupee fell for a fourth week
as global funds cut holdings of the nation’s assets after the
government said it may miss its budget-deficit target.  Overseas investors sold $115 million more local shares than
they bought in the first three days of the week, taking net
sales this month to $1.8 billion, exchange data show.  Kaushik Basu , chief economic adviser to the country’s finance ministry,
said May 24 that India may not be able to reduce its budget
shortfall to a four-year low if global  oil prices  continue to
rise.  “There were outflows from the equity market and payments
by importers,” said Priyanka Kishore, a Mumbai-based foreign-
exchange strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “There was a
liquidity shortage. Persistent concerns on the economic
fundamentals have kept the rupee on the back foot.”  The rupee fell 0.3 percent this week to 45.165 per dollar
at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 45.4303 on May 25, its weakest level since
March 17, and advanced 0.3 percent today.  In February, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee forecast a
4.6 percent budget shortfall for the year ending March 31, 2012,
from 5.1 percent in the previous 12 months.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.84 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.92
yesterday and 45.61 at the end of last week. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
