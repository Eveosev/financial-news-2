Aurora Empowerment Systems Ltd., the
company led by a grandson of  Nelson Mandela , has been given
three days to vacate gold mines at Orkney and Springs that it
planned to acquire, two labor unions said.  Aurora, which owes workers “millions” of rand, was
ordered by provisional liquidators appointed this week to leave
the sites by the close of business on May 30, said the National
Union of Mineworkers, South Africa’s largest labor union.  Zondwa Mandela and Aurora Chairman Khulubuse Zuma, a nephew
of South African President Jacob Zuma, had planned to acquire
the assets and to list a mining company on the  Johannesburg
Stock Exchange  last year. Aurora took over management of the
mines in 2009 when owner  Pamodzi Gold Ltd. (PZG)  was placed under
provisional liquidation.  “Aurora is not only responsible for the massive social
crisis which impoverished more than 40,000 people, but they also
stripped the mining asset of all value,” Solidarity labor union
said in a separate statement. Aurora is facing a liquidation
application from Solidarity over unpaid wages, the union said
May 20.  Zondwa Mandela  asked for questions to be e-mailed to him,
when contacted today by telephone for comment. He didn’t
immediately respond to the list of queries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
