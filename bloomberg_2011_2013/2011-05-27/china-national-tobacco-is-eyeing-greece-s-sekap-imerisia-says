China National Tobacco Corp., the
world’s biggest cigarette maker, is in talks with the Greek
Cooperative Cigarette Manufacturing Co., known as  Sekap , about a
cooperation agreement, Imerisia reported.  The Chinese company sees a possible future purchase of
Sekap, a unit of  Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA, as a way to
enter tobacco markets in the Balkans, the newspaper reported,
without saying how it got the information.  Sekap has also held talks with  India ’s BBM Bommidala Group
and an unidentified Turkish tobacco company, Imerisia said.
Agricultural Bank intends to sell units unrelated to banking as
part of a reorganization plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
