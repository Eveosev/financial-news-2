Germany ’s biggest political parties
brokered a compromise over a new privately financed bank-rescue
fund by agreeing to force lenders to pay more into the bailout
pot, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats and the
opposition Social Democrats agreed to raise fees payable by
larger lenders while exempting development banks and smaller
savings and cooperative banks, the newspaper said, citing
unnamed officials.  Fees will be calculated on banks’ assets as well as profit,
scrapping a previous plan to limit the contributions to the
latter, Handelsblatt said. The Social Democrats threatened to
veto fund legislation in the upper house of parliament, which
the party dominates, unless banks made a bigger contribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
