BP Plc (BP/)  shut a unit of its Tangguh
liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia’s West Papua province
earlier this week for maintenance, the country’s regulator said.  BP may close the unit, Train 2, for as long as two months,
Elan Biantoro, head of public relations at BPMigas, said by
telephone from Jakarta today. Each train, or production line,
has an annual capacity of 3.8 million metric tons, London-based
BP said on its website.  The $5 billion Tangguh project, which shipped its first LNG
cargoes in 2009, has multi-year contracts to supply 2.6 million
tons a year to  China , 1.15 million tons a year to  South Korea 
and an agreement to supply as much as 3.7 million tons a year to
Sempra Energy, BP said.  BP, which owns 37.16 percent of Tangguh, is planning to
build a third  production line  at the plant with a capacity of
3.8 million tons by 2014, BPMigas Deputy Chairman Hardiono said
Dec. 16.  LNG is natural gas chilled to liquid form for
transportation by ships to places not connected by pipelines.
Indonesia is the world’s third-largest LNG exporter, after Qatar
and Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
