Coal stockpiles are rising at the
port of Rotterdam as low river levels hamper delivery to German
power plants,  SteelGuru  said, citing a report from Montel.  Emo, the portâ€™s largest service provider, has 2.7 million
metric tons of coal on hand, up 200,000 tons from late April, it
reported. European Bulk Service has inventories of 100,000 tons,
an increase of more than 65 percent from the end of last month,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
