The cost of insuring against default
on European bank debt rose after  Belgium â€™s stock market
regulator suspended trading of  Dexia SA. (DEXB)   The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers climbed 3 basis
points to 160 as of 10:30 a.m. in  London , the highest since
March 15, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Swaps tied to
Belgian government debt were also affected, climbing 7.5 basis
points to a 2 1/2-month high of 158.5, according to CMA.  Dexia, the lender to local governments that was rescued by
France and Belgium in 2008, said it will hold a conference call
at about noon Brussels time after the regulator halted trading
without giving a reason.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15
governments increased 2 basis points to 201.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements and an
increase signals a deterioration in investor perceptions of
 credit quality .  To contact the reporter on this story:
