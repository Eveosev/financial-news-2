Calling George III the “tyrant of
the earth,” colonists dumped tea valued at about $2 million in
today’s currency into Boston Harbor on Dec. 16, 1773.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  His soldiers, they claimed, constituted “a mercenary,
licentious rabble of banditti,” ready to spill innocent blood.
Thus did the rebels build up fervor for the coming war.  In reality, the Americans knew they were not oppressed,

States ,” says the colonists revolted not “to create, but to
maintain their freedom.”  Ultimately, it was an intellectual revolution, making
Americans into an “ideological people.”  I spoke with him on the following topics:  1. Identity With the Founders  2. Liberty & Equality  3. Bottom-Up Power  4. Jefferson’s Radicalism  5.
