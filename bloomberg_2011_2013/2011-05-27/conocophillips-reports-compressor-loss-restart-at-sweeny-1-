ConocoPhillips (COP)  reported a compressor
loss on a hydrogen purification unit at its Sweeny, Texas,
refinery, according to a regulatory filing.  The C-103 compressor at Unit 26.2 was restarted, the
company said in the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The 260,000-barrel-a-day plant, located 69 miles (111
kilometers) southwest of Houston, processes mostly high-sulfur
crude oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
