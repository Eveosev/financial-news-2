HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  Chief Executive
Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said the company’s German business is
“going very well,” Deutsche-Presse Agentur said, citing an
interview with the manager.  HeidelbergCement is selling every ton of cement it can and
ready-mix concrete is showing double-digit growth rates, the
German newswire cited Scheifele as saying. The company expects
strong growth from China and India in coming years, while “no
big impulses” are expected from the U.S. market, the CEO told
the newswire.  The German cement maker isn’t planning to enter the South
American market at the moment as it is better for the company to
invest where it is already strong, the CEO said, according to
DPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
