Croatia’s economy contracted in the
first quarter on an annual basis as consumption and investment
continued to slump.  Gross domestic product dropped 0.9 percent after falling
0.6 percent in the final three months of last year, the
 statistics office  in Zagreb said today in a preliminary estimate
on its website. It gave no further details.  The Adriatic Sea nation’s economy is struggling to recover
after cash flows from abroad dried up and foreign direct
investment fell to 439 million euros ($624 million) in 2010 from
2 billion euros in 2009. The economy shrank 1.2 percent last
year and 5.8 percent in 2009, after growth averaged 4.6 percent
a year between 2000 and 2007.  Croatia had its long-term sovereign  credit rating  reduced
in December to BBB-, one step above junk at  Standard & Poor’s ,
which cited the country’s deteriorating “fiscal position and
continuously weak external financing.”  The government forecast the economy to grow 1.5 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
