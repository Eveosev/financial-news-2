Landsbankinn hf , the state-created
successor to failed Icelandic lender Landsbanki Islands hf, said
first-quarter profit rose 52 percent on gains in equity
holdings.  Net income rose to 12.7 billion kronur ($110 million) from
8.3 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank said
in a statement posted late yesterday on its website.  Net interest income after adjustments fell to 5.4 billion
kronur from 6.7 billion kronur a year earlier, while operating
income slid to 13.3 billion kronur from 14.7 billion kronur.  The bank reported a 9.1 billion kronur gain on stocks and
equity instruments in the quarter.  Landsbanki Islands collapsed in October 2008 after it was
unable to secure short-term funding. A year later, 18.7 percent
was taken over by a resolution committee representing the bankâ€™s
creditors. The  Icelandic government  holds 81.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
