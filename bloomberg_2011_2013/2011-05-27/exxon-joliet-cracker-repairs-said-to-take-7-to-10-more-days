A catalytic cracker at  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s Joliet refinery is expected to remain shut for seven to
10 more days as workers attempt to repair an air blower,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  Workers are opening the main air blower turbine associated
with the catalytic cracker for repairs, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The refinery has one cat cracker with a capacity of 98,000
barrels a day, said the person.  Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman based in Fairfax,
 Virginia , declined to comment today. He said in an e-mail May 24
that the plant had a compressor trip. He declined to give more
details or say whether any units had been shut.  The refinery reported an upset late May 21, according to a
filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.  The premium for conventional 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
rose 2.75 cents to 20 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:44 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel was at a 1.5-cent discount
on May 20.  The refinery has a capacity of 248,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Joliet refinery is
42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest of Chicago on the Des Plaines
river.  To contact the reporters on this story:
