Hovensa LLC will shut a crude unit in
the fall of next year for planned maintenance at its St. Croix
refinery in the  U.S. Virgin Islands , according to a person with
knowledge of the plans.  A gas recovery unit and vacuum unit also will be stopped
during the turnaround, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Michael Fennessy, the company’s chief financial officer,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Hovensa
is a joint venture of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela
SA and  Hess Corp. (HES)   Hovensa has scheduled a coker turnaround for the fall of
2013, said the person. A vacuum unit and a sulfur recovery unit
Alo will be shut during that work, said the person.  The company said in January that it would cut crude
distillation capacity at the St. Croix refinery by 30 percent to
350,000 barrels a day in the first quarter to trim losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
