Arion Bank hf , the state-created
successor to failed Icelandic lender Kaupthing Bank hf, reported
an 18 percent drop in first-quarter profit as expenses rose.  Net income fell to 2.79 billion kronur ($24 million) from
3.39 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank
said today in an e-mailed statement. Net interest income rose to
5.89 billion kronur from 5.64 billion kronur, and operating
income climbed to 9.48 billion kronur from 8.18 billion kronur a
year earlier.  Arion was created from the domestic operations of Kaupthing
after it failed in October 2008 when it was unable to secure
short-term funding. Kaupthingâ€™s collapse left creditors
struggling to recoup $31 billion in debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
