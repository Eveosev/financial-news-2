Gunmen in  Nigeria  suspected to be
Islamic militants attacked two police stations and a bank today
in the northeastern city of Maiduguri today, killing six people,
police said.   The attackers, about 70 in number, were armed with
explosives and automatic rifles which they used to attack
multiple targets in the Damboa district, Mohammed Abubakar, the
police commissioner in charge of the region, said by phone from
Maduguri. Four policemen and two civilians were killed in the
attack, he said.       Authorities in Nigeria’s north have blamed a radical
Islamic sect, Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and
killings targeting government officials and the security forces
since last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
