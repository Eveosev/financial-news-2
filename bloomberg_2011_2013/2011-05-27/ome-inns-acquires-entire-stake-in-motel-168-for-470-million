Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) ,
 China ’s second-biggest budget hotel operator, said it bought all
stakes from shareholders of Motel 168, including  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
 for $470 million.  Nasdaq-traded Home Inns paid $305 million in cash and will
issue 8.15 million shares at $20.19 each to pay for the rest, it
said in a statement on its website today. Morgan Stanley owned
59 percent of Shanghai Motel Management Ltd., which operates
Motel 168.  Morgan Stanley is selling control of the budget hotel chain
five years after its real estate fund first invested in the
company. Non-star, non-rated hotels accounted for 95 percent of
China’s lodging industry at the end of 2008, making the business
ripe for consolidation, Credit Suisse Group AG said in January.  Home Inns has received up to $300 million in a  credit line 
from Credit Suisse and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the company said.
The deal will be completed by the end of the year pending
conditions and Chinese regulatory approvals, it said. New York-
based JPMorgan advised Home Inns on the transaction.  The company will have more than 1,120 hotels covering about
170 cities after the acquisition, and it will keep the brand of
Motel 168, it said.  Motel 168 is China’s fourth-biggest branded budget hotel
chain in terms of number of rooms with a 7.3 percent market
share, according to Credit Suisse. Shanghai Motel Management

brand, signed an agreement with Poly Real Estate Group Co.,
