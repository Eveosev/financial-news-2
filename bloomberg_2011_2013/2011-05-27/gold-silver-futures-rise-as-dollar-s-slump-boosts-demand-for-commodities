Gold futures rose to a three-week
high and silver climbed as the dollar’s slump spurred demand for
commodities.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
headed for the third straight weekly gain after the Group of
Eight leaders said the global economy is strengthening. The
dollar fell as much as 1 percent against a basket of six major
currencies. Gold has gained 27 percent in the past year,
reaching a record $1,577.40 an ounce on May 2.  “Risk assets are back in vogue, and the camp that buys
commodities when the dollar is weak is jumping on that,” said
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago. “There’s still a place to own gold in a
portfolio.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $13.60, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,537.30 at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached $1,539.50, the highest since
May 4. The metal has gained 1.9 percent this week.  Bullion priced in euros and British pounds climbed to
records this week as European policy makers seek ways to restore
investor confidence amid increasing concern that Greece won’t be
able to repay its debts after last year’s 110 billion euro ($157
billion) bailout.  ‘Safe-Haven Buying’  “With a lot of talk in  Europe  about Greece’s debt crisis,
gold safe-haven buying should continue in the near term,”  Mark Pervan , the head of commodity research at ANZ Banking Group
Ltd., said in a report.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 53.3 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $37.863 an ounce. The metal gained 7.9 percent this
week. Prices, down 24 percent from a 31-year high of $49.845 on
April 25, have still doubled in the past 12 months.  “If you’re a trader looking for volatility, then you’re
putting money in silver,” Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock said.
“Gold is considered a more stable asset.”  The  U.S. Mint  said yesterday that its San Francisco
facility will start producing American Eagle silver coins to
meet demand at “unprecedented high levels.” The plant can
produce as many as several hundred thousand coins a week.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $2.75, or 0.4
percent, to $761.90 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for July delivery rose $21.90, or 1.2
percent, to $1,800 an ounce on the Nymex.  Comex and Nymex floor trading will be closed on May 30 for
the Memorial Day holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
