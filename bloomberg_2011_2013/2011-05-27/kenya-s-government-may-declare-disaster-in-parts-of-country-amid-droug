Kenya may declare a drought disaster
in arid and semi-arid parts of the East African nation where
 food security  has been compromised and livestock are in danger
following poor rains, Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  said.  Odinga ordered the National Drought Steering Committee to
“urgently” draft proposals on the drought and food situation
in the country, according to an e-mailed statement from his
office in Nairobi, the capital, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
