Ethanol futures advanced to a one-
week high in  Chicago  as corn gained on concern that exports of
the grain will increase.  The gasoline additive rose 0.7 percent as corn, the primary
ingredient for ethanol made in the U.S., climbed amid
speculation supply will be tight at the September harvest.  “We had a nice little pushup in corn so that helped move
ethanol up,” said Matt Royer, a trader at BiofuelsConnect, a
Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy broker. “People are
trying not to go into the long weekend without having positions
covered.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 1.9 cent to
settle at $2.66 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since May 20. Prices have increased 12 percent
this year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York  at
$2.745 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.645, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.765 and on the West Coast at $2.80 a gallon, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for July delivery rose 13 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
$7.585 a bushel in Chicago, also the highest price in a week.
Prices have doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
