Britvic Plc (BVIC)  Chief Executive Officer
Paul Moody said restructuring at its Irish business has been
completed and full-year restructuring costs aren’t expected to
exceed the 10 million pounds ($16.4 million) flagged in March.  “Given the program that we’ve operated, that is the
conclusion of the exceptional items in relation to the Irish
restructuring,” Moody said in a call with reporters.  Britvic said today it recorded a 7.5 million pound
restructuring charge for its Irish business in the 28-week
period ended April 17. Moody said he expects to take the
remaining 2.5 million-pound charge in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
