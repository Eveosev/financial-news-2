Russia’s two largest oil export ports
will cut daily shipments of Urals crude by 2.9 percent in June
from this month to 2.2 million barrels, according to a final
loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 58 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each will be
shipped from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  in June. That’s
equivalent to 1.42 million barrels a day, down 3.3 percent. The
total volume is unchanged from the preliminary plan.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be 3.2
million tons, or 782,600 barrels a day, 2.1 percent less than in
May. The preliminary plan showed a total of 3.1 million tons
will be shipped.  The world’s largest oil producer will also export six
cargoes totaling 450,000 tons of Siberian Light crude from
Tuapse on the Black Sea. That’s equivalent to 109,950 barrels a
day, 2 percent more than this month, the plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
