Asian stocks rose for a second day,
paring the regional benchmark gauge’s fourth weekly decline, as
corporate profits at companies including Genting Bhd.
overshadowed data showing U.S. economic growth is faltering.  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) ,  China ’s biggest computer maker, climbed
5.3 percent in Hong Kong after posting fourth-quarter profit
that tripled.  Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Ltd. (FPA) , New
Zealand’s largest refrigerator maker, jumped 9.9 percent after
posting earnings that beat analyst estimates.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) ,
the biggest supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., fell 2.6 percent in Hong Kong after U.S. data showed the
economy grew at a slower rate than forecast.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index gained 0.7 percent to 134.35 as
of 5:34 p.m. in  Tokyo , erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.2
percent and paring the measure’s fourth weekly decline to 0.2
percent. About five stocks rose for every four that fell on the
gauge, which last week slid as Greece’s debt crisis intensified,
Japan’s economy contracted, and disappointing U.S. economic data
fueled concern about the global recovery.  “Following the recent market decline, stock valuations are
offering investors some scope for upside,” said Ng Soo Nam, the
Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $126 billion. “While the
 U.S. economy  is showing a painfully slow pace of recovery, I’m
comfortable as long as the momentum doesn’t reverse. Most
corporate earnings have also met expectations.”  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.4 percent and
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.5 percent.  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index advanced 1 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index retreated 1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
dropped 0.4 percent.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,329.70 yesterday as higher-than-estimated corporate profits at
companies including Tiffany & Co. overshadowed disappointing
U.S. economic data.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.4 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the  S&P 500  and 11 times
for the Stoxx 600.  About 53 percent of the 633 companies on the MSCI Asian
gauge that reported earnings since April 11 posted an increase
earnings, while 40 percent beat analyst estimates.  ‘Lack of Conviction’  “There’s a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines and some
of that is being deployed on a case-by-case basis,” said  Tim Schroeders , a Melbourne-based  fund manager  at Pengana Capital
Ltd., who oversees about $1 billion. “Investors are putting toe
in the water, rather than diving in at the deep end. Overall,
there remains a lack of conviction in markets despite a more
positive tone early today.”  Lenovo climbed 5.3 percent to HK$4.56 in Hong Kong. The
company said fourth-quarter net income tripled to $42 million,
exceeding the $38.4 million average of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., China’s second-
largest electronics retailer, jumped 8.2 percent to HK$3.04
after saying first-quarter profit surged 66 percent from a year
earlier to 552 million yuan ($85 million).  Fisher & Paykel surged 9.9 percent to 61 New Zealand cents
in Wellington, the best performance since May 2009. The company
said full-year profit excluding one-time items rose 67 percent
from a year earlier to NZ$30 million ($24 million), beating the
NZ$24.7 million average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Restoration Demand  Genting Bhd. (GENT) , Asia’s third-biggest casino operator by
market value, rose 0.9 percent to 11.20 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur
trading. The company reported first-quarter net income jumped
255 percent from a year ago to 824.2 million ringgit ($273
million), bolstered by higher contributions at its  Singapore 
gambling resort and Malaysian plantations business.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Japan’s second-largest
maker of construction equipment, gained 1.4 percent to 1,688 yen
in Tokyo. The company forecast net income will more than double
to 23 billion yen ($284 million) from 11.1 billion yen a year
earlier on growing sales.  Senshu Electric Co., a Japanese distributor of cable and
wire products, jumped 8.5 percent to 1,099 yen. The company
boosted its full-year net income forecast 34 percent to 1.68
billion yen, due to higher overseas sales and increasing
restoration demand after  Japan  was struck by the biggest ever
earthquake in March.  Exporters Drop  Exporters declined after reports showed U.S. economic
growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
reflecting a smaller gain in  consumer spending  than previously
calculated. That compared with a 3.1 percent expansion in the
prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 2.2
percent growth.  Unemployment claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 last
week, Labor Department figures showed. The median estimate of
economists was for a drop to 404,000.  Li & Fung, which gets 65 percent of sales from the U.S.,
fell 2.6 percent to HK$16.20 in Hong Kong.  HTC Corp. (2498) , the
Taiwanese smartphone maker that counts America as its biggest
market, declined 1.3 percent to NT$1,180.  Brambles Ltd. (BXB) , the
world’s largest supplier of wooden pallets, dropped 0.8 percent
to A$7.25 in Sydney.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the maker of PlayStation gaming consoles and
Bravia televisions, decreased 3.2 percent to 2,167 yen in Tokyo,
its lowest close since July 2009. The company said net income
will probably be 80 billion yen in the year to March 2012. That
missed the 115.9 billion yen average of 12 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
