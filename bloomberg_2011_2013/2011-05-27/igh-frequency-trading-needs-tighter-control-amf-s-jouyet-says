Regulators may need to develop
“circuit-breakers” that halt high-frequency trading practices
like those that exacerbated a stock market plunge a year ago,
said the head of  France ’s financial markets regulator.  The measure, “rather like a pilot switching from autopilot
to manual mode when he needs to take control, is necessary in my
view, in the same way as what has been decided in the United
States,”  Jean-Pierre Jouyet , chairman of Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said in a speech at the International Capital Market
Association annual conference in Paris today.  High-frequency trading is a computer-driven trading method
in which firms may make thousands of transactions a second. The
so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, which temporarily erased
$862 billion in stock value, spurred U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission proposals for market circuit breakers and
plans to establish a system for cross-market surveillance.  The rise of high-frequency trading techniques has made it
harder for investors to analyze movements in markets, Jouyet
said. “Precise rules” are required to ensure markets can
“return to their role of financing the economy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
