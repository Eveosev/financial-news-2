Economists at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch reduced their U.S. second-quarter growth forecast to a 2
percent annual rate from a previous estimate of 2.8 percent.  “The weakness reflects both the temporary impact of
disruptions to global supply chains and more lasting shocks from
higher oil prices, fiscal tightening and slower growth
overseas,”  Ethan Harris , head of Developed Markets Economic
Research at Bank of America in New York, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
