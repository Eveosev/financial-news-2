Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way,” from
 Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music Group, is poised to become the
biggest album debut since ‘N Sync’s “Celebrity” in 2001,
buoyed by sales for 99 cents at Amazon.com.  The album, released May 24, will sell about 1.15 million
copies in its first week, Billboard.biz projected today. That
would be the most since ‘N Sync sold 1.88 million copies in a
week, Nielsen SoundScan said in an e-mail.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s servers were overwhelmed on May 24 by the
99-cent, one-day promotion. To make amends, Amazon.com offered
the discount again on May 26. The two days resulted in sales of
about 440,000 copies, Billboard reported, citing anonymous
sources. The album carries a suggested retail price of $11.99
and costs $8.40 wholesale, Billboard reported.  “Born This Way” is also available in 20,000 stores,
including CVS, Whole Foods and Walgreens, Billboard said, citing
sources at  Universal Music  it didn’t name. It’s the most widely
distributed album in “current times,” the music industry
publication said.  Excluding Amazon.com, a deluxe digital version priced at
$15.99 retail made up 70 percent of the album’s opening-day
sales, Billboard reported.  Vivendi, controlling shareholder of video-game publisher
Activision Blizzard Inc., gained 12 cents to 19.12 euros in
Paris trading. The shares have slid 5.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
