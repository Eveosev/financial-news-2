Canadians should favor bank and
energy stocks over gold producers based on past performance when
U.S. manufacturing growth has slowed,  UBS AG (UBSN)  said.  In the 12 months after the last 10 peaks in the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s gauge of U.S. manufacturing, indexes of
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index energy companies and banks
have outperformed the broader index, on average, while gold
stocks have plunged, George Vasic and Garry Cooper, Toronto-
based strategists at UBS, said in a note to clients today.  “Resources tended to outperform in the year running up to
the ISM peak, and were mixed to lagging in the year
after,” the strategists wrote.  The factory index of the Temple, Arizona-based ISM slipped
to 60.4 last month from a six-year high of 61.2 in March. The
gauge will drop to 57.7 when the ISM releases May data on June
1, according to the median of 66 economist forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey.  After peaks in the ISM index from 1973 to 2004, S&P/TSX
banks and energy stocks have gained an average of 7.8 percent
and 6.3 percent, respectively, while the S&P/TSX itself advanced
an average of 4 percent, according to UBS. S&P/TSX gold
companies sank an average of 16 percent.  In the year after the last peak in May 2004, the S&P/TSX
Energy Index soared 42 percent and the S&P/TSX Banks Index 17
percent. The S&P/TSX Gold Index tumbled 12 percent.  This year through yesterday, S&P/TSX banks and energy
stocks gained 9.5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, while
gold companies lost 8.1 percent. Gold stocks have lagged behind
the commodity as the growth of exchange-traded products has
allowed investors to more easily own bullion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
