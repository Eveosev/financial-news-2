China  won’t add another offshore yuan
trading center to supplement  Hong Kong  before 2015, the Caixin
magazine reported, citing an unidentified central bank official.  The nation “can’t support” other offshore centers and the
liquidity of yuan in Hong Kong is inadequate, the unidentified
central banker said, according to the Caixin report yesterday.  China was considering measures on yuan repatriation rather
than additional moves to push the currency out of the country,
the unidentified central banker said.  If Singapore were to be assigned a yuan clearing bank, that
won’t receive “the same status as the clearing bank in Hong,”
the unidentified central bank said without giving other details.
