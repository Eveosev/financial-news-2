Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said
a rupture on a 20-inch natural gas pipeline in Wilson County,
 Texas , caused no fire, injuries or major supply disruptions.  A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality  filing  that
characterized the rupture as “catastrophic” was inaccurate,
Randy Burkhalter, vice president of investor relations at
Enterprise in Houston, said in an interview. The incident
occurred at 12:46 p.m. local time yesterday, according to the
TCEQ report.  The information in the report was submitted by Enterprise,
said Andrea Morrow, a spokeswoman for the commission in Austin,
Texas.  One gas producer was affected by the incident and there was
no impact to utilities, said Rick Rainey, a spokesman for
Enterprise.  The line segment may return to service tomorrow morning,
Rainey said. No evacuations were necessary as a result of the
rupture. The incident occurred about 20 miles southeast of  San
Antonio .  The burst segment released butane, isobutane, isopentane,
pentane, propane and hexanes, according to the TCEQ report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
