Priyanka Kishore, a Mumbai-based
foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered Plc, comments
on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.2 percent to 45.82 per dollar as of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will fall 1.3 percent from the spot rate of
45.2100.  “We are looking at inflation to peak around October.
Unless inflation breaks back into double digits, there shouldn’t
be depreciation pressure on the rupee. The second half will be a
good time for India fundamentally, which should revive capital
inflows.  “The currency will be in the range of 45.1 to 45.8 over
the next month, unless there is more bad news from the euro zone,
which can make it weaker. Persistent concerns on the economic
fundamentals have kept the rupee on the back foot.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
