Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the maker of
Scope mouthwash, sued  Vi-Jon Inc. , claiming the packaging of the
private-label manufacturer’s mouthwash violates P&G’s patents
and trademarks.  P&G charged that its patents, trademarks, trade dress and
copyright were infringed by closely held Vi-Jon through the
bottle and shape of the label of its mouthwash, according to a
statement from the Cincinnati-based company.  “Vi-Jon is using and benefiting from our intellectual
property, which we developed and promoted at great cost,” P&G
said in the statement. “We’re taking this action to prevent
consumers from being misled.”  P&G also makes Tide, Pampers, Crest and Bounty. Its shares
rose 16 cents to $66.35 at 3:03 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite trading. They have gained 3.1 percent this year.  According to its website, Vi-Jon, based in  St. Louis  since
1912, provides private-label health and beauty products to
retailers in all 50 U.S. states.  Roy Rosas, the chief marketing officer of Vi-Jon, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
