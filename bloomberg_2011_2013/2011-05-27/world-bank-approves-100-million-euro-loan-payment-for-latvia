The  World Bank  board of directors
approved a 100 million-euro ($142.6 million) loan to help Latvia
fund programs such as education and health care for poor people
as the country recovers from its worst recession.  The loan will help Latvia finance primary education and
child development, subsidize drug costs, exempt needy households
from co-payments for medical services and improve health care,
the Washington-based lender said in a  statement  late yesterday.  “Latvia is now beginning to emerge from the crisis and see
positive signs of growth,” said Peter Harrold, the lender’s
country director for Latvia, in the statement. “This operation
ensures that society’s most vulnerable groups are shielded from
the worst effects of the downturn until the growth momentum can
restore employment opportunities in the economy.”  The loan is the final payment  Latvia  intends to use from a
7.5 billion-euro international bailout authorized in 2008. The
Baltic country has drawn about 4.4 billion euros and plans to
sell Eurobonds this year for the first time since 2008.  The International Monetary Fund’s board yesterday approved
the fourth review of Latvia’s standby agreement, freeing up
about $170.7 million in funding if needed. Latvia turned to a
group led by the IMF and European Commission for the bailout
after the country’s second-biggest bank needed a state rescue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
