Orkla ASA (ORK)  is looking to make an
acquisition before the end of the year and will pay out an
extraordinary dividend should a suitable target not be found,
Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing Chairman Stein Erik Hagen.  Hagen wants to announce an acquisition of 10 billion kroner
($1.8 billion) or more, and is notably looking at large consumer
brands, the Oslo-based newspaper reported.  Orkla isn’t planning on selling its Renewable Energy Corp.
ASA stake for the time being as the company is undergoing
“demanding adjustments” that require a large and stable owner,
Hagen told the paper. A sale of Borregaard is unlikely this
year, Dagens Naeringsliv said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
