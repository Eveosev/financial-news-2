European Central Bank Governing
Council member Nout Wellink said Lex Hoogduin, who leaves the
Dutch central bank in July, would be a “good candidate” for
the ECB’s executive board.  “If posts become available, then it would be very good for
the Netherlands to put him forward,” Wellink, who also heads
the Dutch central bank, said in an interview in Amsterdam today.
“But political elements continue to play a role,
unfortunately.”  Hoogduin, who was seen as a possible successor to Wellink,
last week announced his resignation after Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  picked top civil servant Klaas Knot to lead the
bank in July. Hoogduin, 54, a former adviser to late ECB
President Wim Duisenberg, joined the Dutch central bank’s
governing board in 2009.  “It depends on what will happen with the post of Bini
Smaghi, who will fill that, and that depends on what happens
next year with the Spaniard in the ECB’s executive board,”
Wellink said, referring to Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, whose
term ends in May 2012.  “I don’t know what has been agreed between the French and
the Italians about the possible replacement of Bini Smaghi,”
Wellink said. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi’s term ends in May 2013.  De Jager  said the Frankfurt-based ECB’s executive board
needs more members from fiscally prudent countries such as
 Germany  or the Netherlands, Financial Times Deutschland reported
yesterday, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
