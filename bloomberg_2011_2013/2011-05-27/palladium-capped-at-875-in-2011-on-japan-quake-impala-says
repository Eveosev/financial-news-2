Palladium prices will be capped at
$875 an ounce in 2011 as demand is deferred because of damage to
car production following Japan’s magnitude-9 earthquake and 23-
foot tsunami on March 11, said  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)   Impala, the third-biggest producer of the metal, lowered
its estimates for the palladium price in 2011 to between $725
and $875 an ounce, Derek Engelbrecht, head of marketing, said in
an e-mail. Impala in February forecast prices at $775 to $950 an
ounce.  “The market will trade a little lower,” Engelbrecht said.
The “drop in demand for palladium should not exceed 100,000
ounces,” and consumption will catch up from the end of 2011 and
into 2012, he said.  Tightening monetary measures in  China  and the European debt
crisis may reduce vehicle and palladium demand, he said. The
palladium market will still post a 500,000-ounce shortage in
2011, while exports from  Russia  won’t have a “material impact
on the market,” Engelbrecht said.  Palladium for immediate delivery was up 0.6 percent at
$759.25 an ounce by 4:13 p.m. in London, bringing the decline
for the year to 5.3 percent.  Demand for car pollution-control devices, which use
palladium, prompted record 2010 consumption and the biggest
shortage in a decade, Johnson Matthey Plc said May 16. Russian
sales, the fourth-biggest source of 2010 supplies, will drop to
“several hundred thousand ounces” this year, said Johnson
Matthey, supplier of one in three auto catalysts.  Impala ranks third in terms of production after Russia’s
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel and South Africa’s Anglo American
Platinum Ltd., according to GFMS Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
