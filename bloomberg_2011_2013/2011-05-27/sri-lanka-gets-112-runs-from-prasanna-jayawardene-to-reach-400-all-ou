England trails  Sri Lanka  by 353 runs
in their first cricket Test after losing captain  Andrew Strauss 
with five balls left in the second day.  Strauss was caught on 20 on the first ball of the last,
leaving the hosts on 47-1 in their first innings in Cardiff.
 James Anderson  came in to see out the rest of the day with
Alastair Cook, who is not out on 24.  Sri Lanka reached 400 all out in its first innings, boosted
by Prasanna Jayawardene’s 112 runs. Jayawardene had partnerships
of more than 50 runs with three other batsmen, including one of
84 with Thilan Samaraweera. Tharanga Paranavitana was the second
highest scorer with 66 before being bowled this morning by  Chris Tremlett .  Paranavitana had combine for 93 runs with fellow opening
batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan, who lost his wicket to Graeme Swann in yesterday’s shortened day.  England’s James Anderson took 3-66 before leaving the field
to get medical scans for a back strain. Swann was 3-78, while
Stuart Broad struggled, ending the innings on 2-113.  To contact the reporter on this story:
