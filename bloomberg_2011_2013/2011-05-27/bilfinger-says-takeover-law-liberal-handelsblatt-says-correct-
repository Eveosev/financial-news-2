(Corrects name in second paragraph.)  Bilfinger Berger AG’s outgoing Chief
Executive Officer Herbert Bodner said  Germany ’s takeover law is
too liberal,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  Bodner, who will be replaced by  Roland Koch , said the law
makes hostile takeovers in Germany easier than in other
countries, the newspaper reported.  The company has 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to spend on
acquisitions that Bodner said will serve to expand its service
business, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
