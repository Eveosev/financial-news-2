Rosatom Corp. wants to revive ties to
 Siemens AG (SIE)  even after the German engineer signaled a strategy
shift,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Nikolai Spassky, deputy chief of the Russian nuclear company.  Rosatom wants to “hold serious talks to renew the level of
our partnership” with Munich-based Siemens, which could deliver
technology and factory parts, the German newspaper cited Spassky
as saying.  Siemens has said it will discuss with its Russian partner
the implications of an arbitration tribunal decision forcing the
German company to pay  France ’s Areva SA 648 million euros ($923
million) following its exit from a nuclear joint venture. Talks
will “take into account the events in  Japan  and the worldwide
market environment as well as the social and political
aspects,” Alfons Benzinger, a Siemens spokesman, said in an e-
mail May 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
