The  Miami Heat  rallied from a 12-
point deficit with just more than three minutes to play to beat
the Chicago Bulls 83-80 and advance to the National Basketball
Association finals against the Dallas Mavericks.  Miami trailed 77-65 with 3:02 to play last night before
outscoring the Bulls 18-3 to win the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference finals by four games to one. LeBron James gave Miami
an 81-79 lead with 29 seconds to play at the United Center in
Chicago.  “We’ve been in these situations before, been down late in
the fourth,” James said during a televised courtside interview.
“We just buckle down and execute.”  James had 28 points and 11 rebounds,  Dwyane Wade  added 21
points and  Chris Bosh  contributed 20 points and 10 rebounds,
accounting for 69 of the Heat’s 83 points. The trio scored
Miami’s final 33 points of the game.  Derrick Rose  had 25 points and Luol Deng scored 18 for the
Bulls, who had a 45-38 halftime lead.  The Heat beat the Mavericks the only previous time either
team made the NBA finals in 2006.  The Mavericks defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 100-96 two
days ago to win the Western Conference finals by four games to
one.  The opening game of the NBA finals will be May 31 in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
