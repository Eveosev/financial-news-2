Kenya ’s shilling headed for the first
weekly advance in four against the dollar as the central bank
continued tightening currency supply.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 85.23 per dollar and traded 0.2
percent up at 85.45 at 2:24 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. The
shilling has rallied 0.5 percent this week.  The central bank sold 1 billion shillings ($12 million) of
 repurchase agreements  at an average rate of 5.75 percent,
bringing the total sold since May 11 to 19.9 billion shillings,
“keeping with the stance of monetary tightening,” it said in a
statement on its Bloomberg page today. Kenya’s monetary policy
committee is expected to announce its decision on  interest rates 
on May 31.  “The continuous mopping up is curbing  money supply  and the
market expects the central bank rate to be raised, a further
indication of the monetary-tightening policy being enforced to
rein in on inflationary pressure,” Joshua Anene, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  The MPC unexpectedly increased the key lending rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent at its last meeting
on March 22, following eight reductions between December 2008
and January 2011. Inflation accelerated for the sixth straight
month in April to 12.05 percent in April, the highest in two
years and above the government’s 5 percent target, as food and
fuel prices rose.  “The market expects the central  bank rate  to be raised by
a minimum of 50 basis points to 6.75 percent and guided by the
rising yield on  government securities ,” Anene said. The
monetary policy committee will meet on May 31.  Yields on 91-day bills climbed to 7.94 percent at an
auction yesterday, the highest since January 2009. Yields also
increased on 2-, 10-, and 20-year bonds sold on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
