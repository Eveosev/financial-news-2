Nigeria ’s state-owned energy company
signed agreements today with local units of  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  for the supply of natural gas to the
country’s power stations.  The two agreements, which cover the supply of more than 70
percent of the total gas requirements to the domestic power
industry, serve as a framework for future agreements, Petroleum
Minister Diezan Alison-Madueke told reporters today in Abuja,
the west African nation’s capital.  “We are now in a position where we can very rapidly
replicate these agreements across all other power plants,” she
said. “ Although it has taken a while to close the
negotiations, the knock-on effect in terms of other agreements
that can be immediately executed is phenomenal.”  Nigeria, holder of  Africa ’s largest gas reserves, wants to
expand transmission and processing facilities to deliver the
fuel to  power plants  in order to increase generation more than
fourfold to about 14,000 megawatts by 2013. Most of the gas
currently pumped with crude oil in the nation is flared off due
to inadequate infrastructure to process it.  Shell will supply 90 million standard cubic feet of gas a
day to the country’s largest power plant under the new
agreements signed, Osten Olorunsola, Shell’s vice president in
charge of gas in sub-Saharan Africa, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “This will assure regular supply of gas and result in
improved electricity supply in the country,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
