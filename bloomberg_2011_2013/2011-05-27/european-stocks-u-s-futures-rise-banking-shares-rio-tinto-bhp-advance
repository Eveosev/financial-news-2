European stocks climbed, with the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index paring this week’s drop, before
a U.S. report that may show  consumer confidence  rose. Asian
shares and U.S. index futures increased.  Banking shares advanced 1.4 percent as a group after
Citigroup Inc. raised its recommendation on the sector to
“overweight.” BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining
company, and  Rio Tinto  Group, the third biggest, led gains in
basic-resource companies as metal prices rallied in  London .  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.8 percent to 279.24 at 8:02 a.m. in
London, trimming this week’s drop. The gauge has risen 6.6
percent from this year’s low on March 16 amid optimism that
company profits and government stimulus measures will keep the
economic recovery on track. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
expiring the same month advanced 0.3 percent, while the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
