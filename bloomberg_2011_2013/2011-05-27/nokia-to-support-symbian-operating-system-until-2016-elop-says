Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , which was overtaken by
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  as the largest maker of mobile phones last quarter,
will extend the life of its own operating system as it prepares
the first handset running on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 7.  Nokia will provide software updates and support for the
Symbian operating system “at least” until 2016, Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Elop said in a post on the Espoo,
Finland-based company’s Nokia Conversations website.  Elop turned to Windows Phone 7 to restore Nokia’s
smartphone prospects after determining that the company’s own
Symbian and MeeGo systems couldn’t keep up with Google Inc.’s
Android, the fastest-growing smartphone platform, and Apple
Inc.’s iPhone.  Nokia will outsource its Symbian development to  Accenture
Plc , moving over 3,000 personnel and cutting 4,000 jobs, the
Finnish company said last month. Nokia, which has said it plans
to sell 150 million more Symbian phones, intends to introduce
its first Windows Phone handsets in the fourth quarter.  Nokia called 2011 and 2012 “transition years” in its Feb.
11 statement and  told developers  on March 25 it has a legal
obligation to maintain the system for some time after the last
Symbian handset has been sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
