European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said an exit of a euro-region country from
monetary union is “entirely unrealistic,”  Germany ’s  Aachener
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  “There’s not even any provision for it in the EU Treaty,”
Trichet told the newspaper in an interview. “The euro area is a
community that shares the same destiny: each member is dependent
on the others,” he was quoted as saying.  The Greek aid program “does not envisage restructuring,”
Trichet said.  The ECB’s “responsibility is to prevent price-setters and
social partners from increasing other prices and wages in the
medium term,” he was quoted as saying. “We are there to
prevent these second-round effects.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
