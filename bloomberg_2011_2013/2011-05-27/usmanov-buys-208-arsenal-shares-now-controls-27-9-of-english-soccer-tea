American billionaire Stan Kroenke
said he’s lifted his stake in Arsenal soccer club to 66.1
percent as he looks to increase his control of the 13-time
English champion.  Investors controlling about 19.97 percent of the shares of
Arsenal Holding Plc have accepted his offer of 11,750 pounds
($19,386) a share, according to a Regulatory News Service
statement released today. He’d already controlled 46.1 percent.
The offer will close June 10.  Earlier today, Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov said
he’d bought 208 more shares of Arsenal Holding for 14,000 pounds
each, taking his stake in the London soccer club to 27.9
percent.  Usmanov, using his Red and White Holdings Ltd., is vying
for influence at the club with Kroenke, and reported the
purchase of 122 shares yesterday. The Russian’s newest purchase
was announced today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  The team finished fourth in the just finished season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
