Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE) , the maker of low-
calorie sweetener Splenda, raised its dividend after reporting
an increase in annual income, even as it warned of “more
modest” profit growth this fiscal year at one of its units.  Operating profit rose to 303 million pounds ($498 million)
in the year ending March 31, compared with a 44 million-pound
loss a year earlier, the company said today in a statement. The
median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
306.9 million pounds. The company had said in March it expected
operating performance for the year to be “similar to market
expectations.”  Tate & Lyle raised its dividend to 23.7 pence for the year
compared with 22.9 pence a year earlier “reflecting its
confidence in the business, Javed Ahmed, the London-based
company’s chief executive officer, said today.  The company has sold its sugar interests in the European
Union and  Vietnam  and its molasses business to concentrate on
more profitable units including its speciality food ingredients
and bulk ingredients divisions. Tate said today it expects a
“more modest” level of profit growth in speciality food
ingredients, which represents more than half of its operating
profit from continuing operations, and said sweetener margins at
its bulk ingredients unit will remain “flat” compared with a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
