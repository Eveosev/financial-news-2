Renault SA (RNO)  and Ukraine’s bus maker
Lvivskyi Avtobusnyi Zavod may assemble ambulances for the former
Soviet state as it prepares to host the Euro-2012 soccer
championship,  Kommersant Ukraine  reported, citing Deputy Prime
Minister Borys Kolesnikov.  The companies may also produce minibuses together,
Kolesnikov said in Leipzig,  Germany , according to the newspaper.  Lvivskyi Abtobusnyi, based in the western Ukrainian city of
Lviv, may produce as many as 1,500 ambulances a year, Kommersant
said, citing Ihor Churkin, the head of the plant’s supervisory
board. Churkin said the company agreed with Renault that it may
export to other former Soviet states, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
