(Corrects spelling of company name in headline.)  AS Merko Ehitus (MRK1T) , the largest listed
Baltic builder, reported a first-quarter loss, citing lower
demand and rising raw material prices.  The net loss was 4.1 million euros ($5.8 million), compared
with a profit of 1.1 million euros a year earlier, Merko, based
in Tallinn, said today in a stock exchange statement. Revenue
fell 18 percent to 26.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
