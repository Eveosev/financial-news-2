Ratko Mladic,  Serbia ’s top
general during the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica
massacre, can be extradited to the United Nations  War Crimes 
Tribunal in The Hague, a Serbian court ruled today, Mladic’s
lawyer said.  After confirming that the judge ruled that Mladic can be
extradited to the court in the Netherlands to face charges of
genocide and other war crimes, lawyer Milos Saljic said he would
“promptly” appeal and a ruling on the appeal
could come as soon as May 30.  If the appeal is rejected “there’s a possibility
that the justice minister could sign extradition papers” on May
31, Saljic said today in a phone interview with Bloomberg News
in Belgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
