The Philippine peso dropped this week
ahead of a government report that economists predict will show
economic growth slowed in the first quarter.  Gross domestic product increased 5.1 percent in the three
months through March from a year earlier, compared with 7.1
percent in the fourth quarter, according to the median estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the May 30 data.
Inflation this month may range from 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent,
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday.  “Softer growth is on the cards and everyone’s waiting for
that,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
 Singapore . “Expectations that inflation this month could breach
the central bank target are adding to the concern.”  The peso fell 0.6 percent this week to 43.370 per dollar as
of the 4 p.m. close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency touched 43.585 on May 25, the weakest since March
29. It strengthened 0.1 percent from yesterday.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in a year. The top end of Tetangco’s
projection for May would be the quickest inflation since March
2009, based on official data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which raised the overnight
borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point each at the
March 24 and May 5 meetings to 4.5 percent, is “prepared to
take additional action” to meet this year’s inflation target,
Tetangco told reporters today.  The yield on the 9.125 percent September 2016 peso bond
rose 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.40 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate declined
five basis points from the end of last week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
