Thousands of Egyptians rallied in
Cairo today demanding faster trials of ex-president  Hosni Mubarak  and other officials in his ousted regime, as well as a
bigger role in policy making during the transition period.  Protesters had failed to agree on their demands. The
demonstrations, called by some “The Second Revolution” or
“Friday of Rage,” didn’t include the Muslim Brotherhood. The
Islamic group said May 25 it will not participate in the “rift-
causing” protests, even though it says there is a “delay in
implementing many important and vital matters” and that the
performance of the military council is not “ideal,” according
to a statement on its official website.  Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February 11 when he
ceded power to  Egypt ’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces after
18 days of mass protests.  The ruling military council said yesterday it will withdraw
from all protest sites and warned against actions committed by
“suspicious elements” to “cause drifts between the Egyptian
nation and the military troops,” according to a statement on
its Facebook page.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
