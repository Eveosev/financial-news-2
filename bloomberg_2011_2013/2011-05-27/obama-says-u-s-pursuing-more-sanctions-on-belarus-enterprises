President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
will pursue new sanctions against some Belarusian state-owned
enterprises following the conviction and sentencing of
opposition presidential candidates.  The measures would be in addition to travel restrictions,
asset freezes and other sanctions announced in January.  “The  United States  considers these candidates and the
other courageous activists and candidates arrested and charged
in conjunction with the crackdown on Dec. 19 as political
prisoners,” Obama said in a written statement distributed today
as the president attended the Group of Eight summit in
Deauville, France.  Obama called the recent trials “politically motivated”
and a “major step backward” for democracy in Belarus.  “These measures are targeted against those responsible for
the repression, particularly President Lukashenka, and are not
directed against the people of Belarus,” said Obama.  The U.S. announced earlier sanctions in January in response
to what the State Department called a “brutal crackdown” by
President Alexander Lukashenko after the December presidential
election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
