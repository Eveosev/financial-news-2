European coal derivatives slipped for
a second straight day.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year fell 15 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $129 a
metric ton by 12:50 p.m. in  London .  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 9.95 euros
($14.40) a megawatt-hour, compared with 5.56 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in  Germany  and takes emission costs into
account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were little changed at 16.73 euros per ton.
Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012 to the
U.K., Europeâ€™s biggest consumer of the fuel, was 0.9 percent
lower at 65.46 pence ($1.07) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information

Credit Suisse Group AG, IHS McCloskey, Bloomberg, Tradition
Financial Services and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
