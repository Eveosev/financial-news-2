Siemens AG (SIE)  said it is investing 24
million euros ($34.2 million) to produce a new type of
electricity generators for wind farms at a plant in  Serbia .  Designs for the new generators featuring “no conveyors,
with direct drive” were made at the plant in Subotica in
northern Serbia where Siemens will upgrade and expand the output
to 400 units a month from 280. It will also add 150 jobs to some
550 at present over the next 18 months, the company said in e-
mailed statement.  The plant making electrical machinery, power generators and
converters for photovoltaic panels had sales of 74.7 million
euros in fiscal year ending September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
