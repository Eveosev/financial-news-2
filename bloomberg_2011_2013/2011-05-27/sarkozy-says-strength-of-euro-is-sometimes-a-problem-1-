French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
the euro’s strength is “sometimes a problem” for exporters,
calling its level a paradox considering the attention paid to
 Greece ’s debt crisis.  Sarkozy said that he and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
discussed the euro-area debt crisis and both pledged to do all
they can to support the single currency. The future of the euro
is “non-negotiable,” he told reporters today at the end of a
Group of Eight summit in Deauville,  France .  “The euro zone is stable,” Sarkozy said, citing economic
growth in the region that “picked up rather strongly” in the
first quarter. “There is a paradox to talk about the problems
of the euro while the euro has never been that strong,” he
said. “That high level can sometime be a problem for exports.”  G-8 leaders discussed the strength of the euro at the two-
day summit, Sarkozy said. The Swiss franc strengthened to an
all-time high against the euro today amid deepening concern that
the European sovereign-debt crisis will deteriorate, spurring
demand for a haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
