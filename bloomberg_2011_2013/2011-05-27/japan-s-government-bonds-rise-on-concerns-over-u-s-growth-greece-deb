Japan ’s bond futures rose, touching a
10-week high, on concerns the U.S. economic recovery is slowing
and the International Monetary Fund will withhold aid for Greece.  Benchmark 10-year yields fell toward a six-month low before
U.S. data forecast to show business activity grew at a slower
pace in May.  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said on May 26 that the IMF may withhold
aid for Greece as questions mount about how the country can
avoid default next year.  “The  U.S. economy  is showing weakness as people had
expected, which is having a big impact” on bonds, said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  Tokyo .
“I expect yields to continue to stay low.”  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.06 to
140.88 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange this week. The contracts
reached 141.00 yesterday, the highest since March 15.  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 fell to
1.12 percent this week in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  The yield touched 1.105 percent on May 16, the lowest since
Nov. 24. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. is
forecast to say its business barometer dropped to 63.0 in May
from 67.6 in April, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the data due May 31. Figures greater than
50 signal expansion.  Reports on May 26 showed  consumer spending  cooled in the
first quarter more than previously estimated, while initial jobs
claims rose 10,000 to 424,000 in the week ended May 21, when
economists had estimated they would decline.  Bonds maintained gains even after Japan’s statistics bureau
reported yesterday consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.6
percent in April from a year earlier. That’s the first increase
since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
