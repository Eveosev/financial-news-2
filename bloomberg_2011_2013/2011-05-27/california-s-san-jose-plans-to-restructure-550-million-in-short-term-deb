San Jose , California, the 10th-
largest U.S. city by population, plans to restructure as much as
$550 million in airport debt this year as it weighs whether to
declare a state of fiscal emergency, municipal officials said.  The City Council will consider refinancing as much as $300
million in short-term notes on June 21, Arn Andrews, the Finance
Department’s treasury manager, said today in an interview. The
refunding isn’t tied to the fiscal situation, he said.  “We have short-term commercial notes outstanding and so
we’ll pay part of that off with the long-term financing,” Scott Johnson, the finance director, said in the City Hall interview
with Andrews.  San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed has proposed declaring a state of
fiscal emergency for the city as retiree costs are projected to
increase $216 million by fiscal 2016. The city, with retirement
payments of about $186 million this year, has $1.43 billion in
estimated unfunded pension liabilities. The council is also
slated to consider the emergency declaration on June 21.  The city,  California ’s third-biggest after  Los Angeles  and
 San Diego , has projected pension costs will account for about
$57 million of a $115 million budget gap in fiscal 2012, which
begins in July.  Another note refinancing, of about $250 million for an
airport rental-car center, will take place later this year,
Andrews said.  “These airport refundings are part of a long-term strategy
for financing the airport’s capital projects,” Andrews said
later by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
