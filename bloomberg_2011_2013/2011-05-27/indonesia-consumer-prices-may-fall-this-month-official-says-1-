Indonesia’s consumer  price index  will
likely fall about 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent in May from the
previous month, Rusman Heriawan, chairman of the central
statistics office, said ahead of an inflation report next week.  Food prices remain “stable” even as the cost of rice has
begun to increase “slightly,” Heriawan said in Jakarta today.
The price index fell from the previous month in March and April.
Stocks and the rupiah climbed today.  Inflation pressure in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy has
eased, with consumer prices rising 6.16 percent in April from a
year earlier compared with 7.02 percent in January. The price
index may rise about 5.8 percent to 5.9 percent in May from a
year earlier, Bank  Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution told
reporters in Jakarta today.  The Jakarta Composite index climbed 0.5 percent, gaining
for a second day. The rupiah added 0.1 percent, appreciating for
a second day.  Indonesia’s currency will likely strengthen further even as
the gains may ease from the previous months, Nasution said.  The economy may expand more than 6.5 percent from a year
earlier this quarter because of an increase in foreign direct
investment, Heriawan said. Gross domestic product rose 6.5
percent in the three months through March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
