Athens International Airport SA  said
passenger traffic dropped 12 percent in the first four months of
the year as  Greece ’s economic crisis hurt domestic travel.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport fell to 3.9 million, from 4.43 million a year earlier,
according to a statement posted on the company’s  website  today.  Domestic passengers declined 22.4 percent, to 1.39 million,
while international traffic fell to 2.51 million from 2.64
million, the statement said. In April, the number of domestic
travelers was down 14.3 percent at 409,773, and international
traffic rose for the first time this year to 816,772 from
780,694.  A volcanic eruption in Iceland last year, which caused
disruptions to international  air travel  as  Europe ’s airspace was
shut for days, affected last April’s foreign arrivals.  Greek travel spending has been hurt by government-imposed
austerity measures, including wage cuts and higher sales taxes,
agreed in exchange for 110 billion euros ($156.3 billion) of
emergency loans from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  last May.  Domestic traffic figures aren’t fully comparable with last
year, when disruption on the main highway linking the capital to
Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-biggest city, and low-fare offers
by  Aegean Airlines SA (AEGN)  and Olympic Air boosted air travel by 10
percent in the first quarter, according to the statement.  Tourism is Greece’s biggest industry. It will account for
almost 16 percent of national income and almost one in five jobs
in 2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
