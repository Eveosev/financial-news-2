New Zealand’s four biggest banks had
their credit ratings cut one level by Moody’s Investors Service
after the lenders’ Australian parent companies were lowered.  The New Zealand units of  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
and  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  were cut from Aa2 to Aa3,
Moody’s fourth-highest investment grade, the New York-based
ratings company said in a statement today.  Echoing its rationale for cutting the Australian banks on
May 18, Moody’s cited the New Zealand lenders’ reliance on
wholesale markets, where banks raise money to lend to customers.
The ratings company also said the earthquake that wrecked the
city of Christchurch in February weakened a “subdued” economy.  “Recent natural disasters have devastated parts of the
country,” Marina Ip, a Moody’s assistant vice president in
Sydney, said in the statement. Today’s cut “reflects the
ongoing impact of the challenging economic environment in  New
Zealand , which has resulted in asset quality metrics continuing
to deteriorate.”  The New Zealand banks, which rely on wholesale funding for
about 40 percent of their funds, are sensitive to conditions in
those markets, Moody’s said. While pressure on wholesale funding
has eased in the past six months amid slower loan growth and
higher customer deposits, Moody’s said “this dynamic is not
sustainable in the long term.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
