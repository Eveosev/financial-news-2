Empresas Copec SA (COPEC)  rose for a third
day in Santiago trading after first-quarter profit more than
doubled on higher pulp exports.  Copec, the company with the largest weighting in Chile’s
IPSA benchmark index, gained 1 percent to 8,800 pesos at 12:35
p.m. New York time.  Net income climbed to $295 million from $130 million a year
earlier, according to data posted on the Chilean securities
regulator’s website after the close of trading yesterday. Sales
surged to $4.76 billion from $2.71 billion a year earlier.  Copec’s forestry unit, Celulosa Arauco & Constitucion SA,
had first-quarter profit of $172 million, up from $62 million a
year earlier, boosted by higher pulp prices and export volumes,
Copec said in a statement accompanying the results.  “China remains the motor of activity and growth” in the
pulp market, Copec said in the statement. “New projects, low
inventories and demand for pulp from new niches have led to a
level of Chinese imports that had not been seen in several
years.”  Copec also operates the largest chain of service stations
in  Chile  and has operations in  Colombia  after the acquisition of
Organizacion Terpel SA in May 2010. This area had profit of 47.6
billion pesos ($102 million), a 47 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
