BP Plc (BP/)  plans to shut an ultracracker
at its Texas City, Texas, refinery during a turnaround scheduled
for September, two people with knowledge of the plans said.  The work is expected to begin Aug. 20 and last until Sept.
20, said one of the people who declined to be identified,
because the information isnâ€™t public. An ultraformer unit will
also undergo work during the maintenance, said the person.  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, declined to comment.  The Texas City refinery has a capacity of 475,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
