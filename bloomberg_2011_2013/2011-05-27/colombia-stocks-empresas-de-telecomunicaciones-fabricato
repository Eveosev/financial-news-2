The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index was little changed at 14,338.1, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.1 percent to 1,732.02.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
state-run phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, climbed 7.1
percent to 683 pesos, the most in two months, on speculation the
city is ready to sell its stake after the government named an
official to handle the potential sale, said Santiago Melo,
analyst at Alianza Valores SA in Bogota.  The interior ministry named Cristina Plazas as the ad hoc
mayor on the issue after acting mayor Maria Fernanda Campo
Saavedra declared a conflict of interest because she holds ETB
shares, according to a decree on the presidential website.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
fell 1.7 percent to 58 pesos after the Chief Executive Officer
Oscar Ivan Zuluaga denied “rumors” in local press reports that
the company plans to sell to  Mexico ’s Grupo Kaltex SA, according
to a regulatory filing after markets closed yesterday.  Zuluaga said he has no knowledge of plans to sell the
company and asked shareholders to make public any plans for a
sale, the filing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
