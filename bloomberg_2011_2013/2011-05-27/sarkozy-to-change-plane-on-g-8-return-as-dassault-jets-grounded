French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  was
forced to change planes to return home from the Group of Eight
meeting in Deauville after  Dassault Aviation SA (AM) ’s Falcon 7X jets
were grounded.  The  French presidency  sent a Dassault Falcon 900 from its
fleet to bring Sarkozy to Paris today from the coastal town in
Normandy, his office said.  The European Aviation Safety Agency grounded all Falcon 7X
jets yesterday after a plane “experienced an uncontrolled pitch
trim runaway during descent,” according to  a statement  on its
web site.  Sarkozy will conclude the two-day G-8 meeting in Deauville.  To contact the reporter on this story:
