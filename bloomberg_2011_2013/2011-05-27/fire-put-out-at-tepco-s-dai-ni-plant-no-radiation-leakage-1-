A fire that broke out at  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ni nuclear station today was
extinguished in three minutes, Junichi Matsumoto, a general
manager at the company, said in Tokyo. No radiation leaked to
the environment, Matsumoto said.  The fire started at a power distribution panel for lighting
in the building of reactor No. 1 at the Fukushima Dai-Ni plant
at 10:01 a.m. local time today. There were no injuries, he said.  The Dai-Ni plant is about 12 kilometers, or 7 miles, south
of Tokyo Electric’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi station, where three
reactors melted down and radiation is being emitted after the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Dai-Ni automatically shut down
after the quake and is in a stable state,  Tokyo Electric  has
said.  “We are still investigating the cause of the fire,” said
Matsumoto. “The International Atomic Energy Agency team
inspected the Dai-Ni plant yesterday and will visit Dai-Ichi
today,” he said.  The IAEA team has members from 12 countries and is led by
the U.K.’s heard nuclear safety inspector, Mike Weightman. The
group also made an inspection tour of Japan Atomic Power Co.’s
Tokai plant northeast of Tokyo yesterday. The Tokai nuclear
station shut down automatically after the quake.  The mission will finish on June 2, according to a  statement 
posted on the IAEA website. The team will prepare a report for a
ministerial conference on nuclear safety in Vienna on June 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
