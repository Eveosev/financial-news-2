Islandsbanki hf , the state-created
successor to failed Glitnir Bank hf, said profit was little
changed in the first quarter as interest income declined,
offsetting lower loan losses and rising fee income.  Net income was 3.59 billion kronur ($31 million) in the
first three months, the Reykjavik-based lender said today. Net
interest income fell 12 percent to 8.06 billion kronur, while
fee income rose and loan losses declined.  Operating income rose to 9.36 billion kronur from 8.61
billion kronur a year earlier, the bank said. Its capital-
adequacy ratio was 27.4 percent, compared with 26.6 percent at
the end of 2010.  “The results for the first quarter of 2011 are in line
with expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Birna Einarsdottir
said in a statement. “The largest project this year has been
the restructuring of the retail and corporate loan portfolios.”  Glitnir was the first of Iceland’s biggest banks to fail,
in October 2008, precipitating the collapse of the island’s
financial system and sending the krona down as much as 80
percent against the euro on the offshore market. Kaupthing Bank
hf, Landsbanki Islands hf and Glitnir together left an $86
billion debt mountain in their wake, compared with Iceland’s
2010 gross domestic product of $13.3 billion.  Glitnir creditors have brought a total of $29.7 billion in
claims against the bank, its 2010 financial statement showed.
Investors who bought bonds in the bank can expect 28 cents back
on the euro, data provided by brokerage  H.F. Verdbref hf  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
