Botswana will reopen state senior
schools on May 30 after closing them for two weeks because of
violence during a pay strike by government workers, Education
Minister Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi said.  The government will hire temporary teachers for schools
affected by the strike, Venson-Moitoi said in a faxed statement
today from Gaborone, the capital.  State employees, including teachers and nurses, have been
on strike for six weeks. Labor unions want a 12 percent pay
increase while the government offered 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
