Reid Park Properties LLC, owner of a
 Doubletree Hotel  in  Arizona , filed for bankruptcy court
protection with a plan for the owners to invest new money into
the hotel and retain their equity.  Reid Park owes about $51.8 million to creditors while the
main asset of the company, a hotel in Tucson, Arizona, is worth
$13.5 million. The company owes  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  about $30
million, which is guaranteed by the hotel, according to court
papers filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Tucson.  A new investment by the current owners “will be used to
make repairs, perform deferred maintenance and make capital
improvements to the hotel in order to allow the debtors to
become more profitable,” Reid Park said in court papers.  Under the proposed plan of reorganization, creditors
wouldn’t be paid in full. Wells Fargo would be given a note that
would replace the current loan the bank is owed, according to
the plan.  That note may be changed should Reid Park and Wells Fargo
agree on a new plan, the hotel owners said in court papers.  The company didn’t say how much it would invest in the
hotel in order to retain its equity. Under U.S.  Bankruptcy Code ,
owners must either pay all creditors in full in order to keep
their interest in a company, or invest new money.  The case is In re Reid Park Properties LLC, 11-15267, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Arizona (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
