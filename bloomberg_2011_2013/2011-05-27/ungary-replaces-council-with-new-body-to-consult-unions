Hungary’s government will replace a
forum it uses to consult trade unions and employers on economic
policy with a new organization that includes scientists and
church representatives.  The government will no longer take a “leading” role in
the work of the new National Economic and Social Council, which
replaces the National Interest Reconciliation Council, and in
turn it won’t guarantee the implementation of any proposals, the
 Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The viewpoints formed during the consultation are never
binding for the government, they are rather recommendations
whose implementation is merely a possibility for the
government,” the ministry said.  The previous council issued a recommendation for wage
increases that was watched by the central bank. In 2008, the
Cabinet of former Prime Minister  Ferenc Gyurcsany  also scaled
back a plan for tax cuts aimed at accelerating economic growth
after unions and employers protested against some of the
changes.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government this year
presented plans to cut spending in areas including welfare
payments and drug subsidies to help reduce the biggest debt
burden among the European Union’s eastern members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
