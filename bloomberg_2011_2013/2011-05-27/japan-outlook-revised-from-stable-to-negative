Japan  had its outlook lowered to
negative from stable by  Fitch Ratings .  “Japan’s sovereign credit-worthiness is under negative
pressure from rising government indebtedness,” saidAndrew Colquhoun, head of Fitch’s Asia-Pacific Sovereigns team, in a
statement today. “A stronger fiscal consolidation strategy is
necessary to buffer the sustainability of the public finances
against the adverse structural trend of population ageing.”  Japan’s gross government debt reached 210 percent of GDP by
end-2010, by far the highest ratio for any Fitch-rated
sovereign, the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
