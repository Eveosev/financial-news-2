Japan ’s bonds rose, pushing down 10-
year yields toward a six-month low on concerns the U.S. economic
recovery is slowing and the  International Monetary Fund  will
withhold aid for Greece.  Bond futures climbed to a 10-week high before U.S. data
forecast to show personal income and spending gained at a slower
pace in April.  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said yesterday the IMF may withhold aid
for Greece as questions mount about how the country can avoid
default next year.  “The  U.S. economy  is showing weakness as people had
expected, which is having a big impact” on bonds, said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
Tokyo. “I expect yields to continue to stay low.”  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 fell three
basis points to 1.115 percent at 3:08 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.264 yen to 99.867 yen.  The yield touched 1.105 percent on May 16, the lowest since
Nov. 24. It has dropped one basis point this week. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.28 to
140.88 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They were up from 140.82 on
May 20. The contracts earlier reached 141.00, the highest since
March 15.  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a 0.6
percent return this month, according to an index compiled by
Merrill Lynch & Co.  Income, Spending  U.S. personal income rose 0.4 percent in April after
gaining 0.5 percent in March, while spending increased 0.5
percent last month, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in March,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
today’s data.  Reports yesterday showed  consumer spending  cooled in the
first quarter more than previously estimated, while initial jobs
claims rose 10,000 to 424,000 in the week ended May 21, when
economists had estimated they would decline.  Bonds maintained gains even after Japan’s statistics bureau
reported today consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.6
percent in April from a year earlier. That’s the first increase
since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
