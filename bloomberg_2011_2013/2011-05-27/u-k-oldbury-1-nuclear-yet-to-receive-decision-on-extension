One of Britain’s oldest working
nuclear reactors, which projected it won’t produce power next
year in a revision of plans, is still waiting for approval to
operate beyond a deadline to shut next month.  The Oldbury station started in 1967 and is set to close at
the end of June. It is operated by Magnox North Ltd. on behalf
of the U.K.’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Reactor 1,
capable of producing 215 megawatts of power, has asked to
operate beyond next month’s deadline.  “All the safety cases have been submitted to the Office
for Nuclear Regulation for their consideration,” Dan Gould, a
Warrington, England-based spokesman for Magnox North said today
by telephone. “We haven’t had a response yet, which isn’t
unusual.”  Reactor 1 will produce zero megawatts until May 2012,
according to information submitted yesterday to  National Grid
Plc. (NG/)  That’s a revision from a week earlier, when it said it
would have 200 megawatts of available capacity until at least
May 2012. Electricite de France SA trades the plant’s power
output on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
