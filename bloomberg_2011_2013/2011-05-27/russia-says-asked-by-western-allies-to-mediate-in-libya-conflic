Western countries asked  Russia  to
help mediate the conflict in Libya, said Natalia Timakova,
President Dmitry Medvedev’s spokeswoman.  “This request was voiced by our partners at practically
all the bilateral meetings,” Timakova told reporters at the
Group of Eight summit in Deauville, France, late yesterday.
Medvedev held talks earlier with his U.S. and French
counterparts Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy and U.K. Prime
Minister David Cameron.  Russia this week hosted a Libyan rebel representative after
holding a meeting in Moscow on May 17 with envoys from Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  in a bid to negotiate a cease-fire in the
North African country.  Russia abstained from the United Nations Security Council
 vote  in March that authorized military intervention by the U.S.
and its allies in  Libya  to protect civilians. It has since
accused the NATO-led air campaign of violating the resolution by
supporting the rebels and causing civilian casualties.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Leon Mangasarian  To contact the reporter on this story:
