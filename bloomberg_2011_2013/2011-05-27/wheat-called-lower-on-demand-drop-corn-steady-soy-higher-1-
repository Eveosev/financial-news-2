What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open steady to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of
Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that
demand for U.S. supplies may decrease on signs that Russia will
resume exports, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent a bushel higher to 1 cent lower
on the CBOT on bets that drier weather in the next week in the
eastern Midwest will allow farmers to speed up planting, while a
decline by the dollar boosts prospects for U.S. exports, Grow
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents a bushel higher in Chicago
as the greenbackâ€™s drop boosts the appeal of U.S. supplies, Grow
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to 0.1
cent a pound higher, while soybean-meal futures may open down $1
to $2 per 2,000 pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
