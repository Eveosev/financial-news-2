Qihoo 360 Technology Co., developer
of  China ’s most-popular computer security software, plans to
offer new services including cloud computing to increase revenue,
Chief Executive Officer Zhou Hongyi said.  The Chinese company is developing data-storage services that
could be accessed via the Internet, Zhou said in an interview in
Beijing yesterday, without disclosing when they will be
introduced. Qihoo 360 has started selling technical support and
repair services for computer users, he said.  Qihoo 360 will use proceeds from its $202 million initial
public offering in the U.S. in March to acquire companies to
boost its technology and expand its product line, according to
Zhou, a former head of Yahoo! Inc.’s China operations. The
Beijing-based company this week reported its first-quarter
revenue more than doubled after it increased online advertising
sales, and started offering Web games.  “We see ourselves as an  Internet company , not merely a
security software company,” Zhou said. Qihoo 360, with more
than 300 million users who download the company’s free security
software online, will boost revenue by marketing new Internet
services such as group buying to subscribers and increase
advertising sales, he said.  Qihoo 360 stock fell 1.1 percent to $26.48 in New York
trading yesterday, and has gained 83 percent from its IPO price
of $14.50.  First-quarter revenue rose to $22.9 million, compared with
$9.7 million a year earlier, Qihoo 360 reported May 24. The
company had a loss of $21.4 million, after booking $26.7 million
of share-based compensation expenses after its IPO.  “We believe security software, like search, or instant
messaging, are basic infrastructure services, and should be
totally free,” Zhou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
