European private-equity company, is interested in bidding for A-
Tec Industries AG and has been touch with the management of the
company but no decision has been made yet about how to proceed,
Penta spokesman Martin Danko said today in a phone interview.  A-Tec, majority-owned by Chief Executive Officer Mirko

Vienna-based company to refinance a bond failed. The insolvency
is  Austria ’s third-biggest in postwar history. A-Tec’s creditors
will receive 47 percent of their claims if A-Tec finds an
investor before the end of June.  A-Tec has until June 30 to find a buyer or face
