Ivory Coast  needs between 15 billion
euros ($21.3 billion) and 20 billion euros of aid through 2016
after years of political tension that periodically erupted into
violence, President  Alassane Ouattara  said.  “The country needs support,” he  said today on Europe 1 
radio from Paris. “If Ivory Coast is to come out of this long
period of economic agony and reconcile its people, there is a
price to pay.”  Ouattara, an economist who was sworn in as president a week
ago, made the remarks before meeting with Group of Eight leaders
in Deauville,  France . His election in November led to four
months of violence between his supporters and those loyal to the
incumbent,  Laurent Gbagbo , who ruled the world’s largest cocoa
producer for a decade and who refused to cede power.  Gbagbo was captured by the Ivorian Republican Forces
militia in Abidjan, the commercial capital, on April 11
following a 10-day siege of the city. French troops, United
Nations peacekeepers and pro-Ouattara fighters battled Gbagbo’s
armed supporters. At least 2,000 people were killed during the
crisis, according to the UN.  France has pledged 2 billion euros in aid and Ouattara said
he’s seeking further support, notably from the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
