Texas  Governor Rick Perry said he’s
considering a campaign for president in 2012.  “I’m thinking about running,” Perry, a 61-year-old
Republican, said at a press conference in Austin, the state
capital. “I’m going to think about it, but I think about a lot
of things.”  Perry’s comment is a stronger indication of interest in
running than previous statements, said Michael Quinn Sullivan,
president of Empower Texans, a nonprofit group in Austin that
lobbies for limited government. “That’s a change in tone,”
Sullivan said.  Perry was re-elected last year to his third term as
governor of the second-most-populous state. He has previously
said he was focused on Texas politics rather than the
presidency, often saying, “I have the best job in the world.”  Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney received the most
support among the field of potential Republican candidates in a
Gallup poll released yesterday.  Romney said yesterday he will formally announce on June 2
in  New Hampshire , while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas, former New Mexico Governor
Gary Johnson, former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty  and Herman
Cain, the former chairman and chief executive officer of
Godfather’s Pizza Inc., have declared their candidacies.  Other potential Republican challengers to President Barack Obama include former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin,
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Jon Huntsman
Jr., a former Utah governor and ambassador to  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
