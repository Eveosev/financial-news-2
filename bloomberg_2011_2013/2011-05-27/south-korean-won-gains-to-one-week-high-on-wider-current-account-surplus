South Korea ’s won strengthened for a
second day to its highest in two weeks after the nation’s
current account surplus widened to a four-month high in April on
record exports.  The surplus was $1.88 billion, from a revised $1.33 billion
in March, the  Bank of Korea  said today. The current account is
the broadest measure of trade, tracking goods, services and
investment income. South Korea will likely post a surplus this
month similar to April’s and major export items appear to be
resilient to the won’s gain, Bank of Korea director Yang Jae
Ryong said.  “Exports rose despite the won’s appreciation and that
helped widen the current-account surplus,” said Jeon Seung Ji,
currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “That’s
adding to the sentiment that the currency may have further room
to rise.”  The won strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,082.25 per dollar at
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, after rising as much as 0.9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached
1,101.68 on May 25, the weakest level since March 31. The won
was little changed this week, down 0.05 percent.  The currency also rose after foreign investors purchased
more stocks than they sold in South Korea for a second day. The
main Kospi index gained 0.4 percent to close at a one-week high
of 2,100.24, rising for a second day.  South Korea’s benchmark three-year bonds were unchanged,
with the yield on the 3 percent note due December 2013 at 3.6
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc. The yield
fell two basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
