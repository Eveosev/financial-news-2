Japanese stocks fell, sending the
 Nikkei 225  Stock Average to a third straight weekly decline, as
reports showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a slower than estimated
rate, reducing the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera maker that gets more
than 80 percent of its revenue outside  Japan , slid 0.4 percent.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 0.6
percent after the company said its production in Japan declined
the most in 35 years in April after the nation’s record
earthquake disrupted output.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest
exporter of consumer electronics, retreated 3.2 percent after
forecasting profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.4 percent to 9,521.94 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index dropped 0.3 percent to
824.90 with seven stocks retreating for every four that rose.
For the week, the Nikkei has lost 0.9 percent, completing its
longest streak of weekly losses since October, while the Topix
is down 0.4 percent.  “It takes a while to turn bullish,” said Takashi Miyazaki, a senior strategist who helps oversee about $84
billion at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “Some
economic figures were weak because of the disrupted supply
chain.”  The Topix has lost 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, crippling four of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
nuclear reactors and disrupting supply chains at companies from
Toyota Motor Corp. to chipmaker Renesas Electric Corp. Companies
in the Topix traded at an average 0.94 times estimated book
value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  U.S. Economy  Canon dropped 0.4 percent to 3,835 yen. Kyocera Corp., a
maker of mobile phones and solar panels that derives more than
20 percent of its sales from the U.S., sank 0.6 percent to 8,400
yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , an industrial robot maker that gets 75 percent
of its revenue outside Japan, slumped 1.2 percent.  In the U.S. economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, reflecting a smaller gain in  consumer
spending  than previously calculated. That compared with a 3.1
percent expansion in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for 2.2 percent growth.  Unemployment claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 last
week, Labor Department figures showed. The median estimate of
economists was for a drop to 404,000.  Carmakers Retreat  “People are feeling anxious about the outlook of the
economy and corporate earnings,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who
helps oversee about $18 billion as chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  Carmakers were the heaviest drag on the Topix among its 33
industry groups after carmakers said production fell last month.
Toyota said domestic production plunged 78 percent, the largest
decline since 1976. Japan output at Honda Motor Co. and Nissan
Motor Co. fell 81 percent and 49 percent respectively. Toyota
shares lost 0.6 percent to 3,335 yen. Honda dropped 0.8 percent
to 3,070 yen. Nissan sank 0.5 percent to 796 yen.  Sony slumped 3.2 percent to 2,167 yen, the biggest decline
on the Nikkei. The company said its full-year net loss widened
to 259.6 billion yen ($3.19 billion) from 40.8 billion yen in
the year ended March 31. The company forecast profit of 80
billion yen this fiscal year, lower than the 115.9 billion yen
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Even for Sony, it’s difficult to survive a competition in
the field of high-tech and home electronics that’s getting
severer,” said Masaru Hamasaki, who helps oversee about $18
billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “The company was a leader in the industry but it has
lacked distinguishing products lately.”  -- Editor: Nick Gentle  To contact the reporters on this story:
