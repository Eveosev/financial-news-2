Los Angeles Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  told Major League Baseball that he expects to meet the
team’s May 31 payroll of about $9.8 million, the Los Angeles
Times reported, citing three unidentified people.  The Times reported in early May that the Dodgers lacked
the cash to meet the second of their two May payrolls. That
could have led to the league being forced to provide money for
the team’s payroll. Baseball in late April appointed Tom Schieffer to oversee day-to-day and financial operations of the
Dodgers.  Pat Courtney, a league spokesman, yesterday said he
couldn’t comment on the Times report. Josh Rawitch, a spokesman
for the Dodgers, wasn’t available for comment. Steve Sugerman,
a spokesman for McCourt, didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mail seeking comment.  The amount of money needed to meet payroll will increase
June 30, when the Dodgers must pay former player  Manny Ramirez 
more than $6 million in deferred compensation, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
