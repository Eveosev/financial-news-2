The economic recovery in the euro
region strengthened for a second month in May as the progress in
 foreign trade  more than offset the performance of equity
markets, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The index measuring economic expansion in the 17-nation
region climbed to 0.62 percent from 0.60 percent in April, the
London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the Bank of
 Italy , which co-produce the index, said in an e-mailed report.  “The main factor was the good performance of foreign
trade,” according to today’s report. Exports “more than offset
the negative effect of share prices.”  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
