Japan  land values declined at more
than two-thirds of the country’s land sites after record
earthquake and tsunami slowed a recovery in the  property market ,
according to a quarterly land ministry  survey .  Values fell at 98 of 146 locations throughout Japan in the
three months ended April 1, according to a survey by the
 Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism  today.
The survey excluded three sites in Sendai and one in Urayasu
that were “directly affected by the quake,” it said.  The latest survey follows a magnitude-9 earthquake on March
11 and after property values declined at fewer land sites in the
previous five quarters. The temblor sent office vacancy rates in
 Tokyo  and  Osaka  to a record high in March and pushed Tokyo
apartment supply down by 27.3 percent in April, according to
Miki Shoji Co. and the Real Estate Economic Research Institute.  In the preceding quarter, which included the sites in
Sendai and Urayasu, values declined at only 80 of 150.  The Topix Real Estate Index fell 0.2 percent following the
survey, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
