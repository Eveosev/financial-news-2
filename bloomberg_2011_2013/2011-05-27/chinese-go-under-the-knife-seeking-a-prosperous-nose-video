Bloomberg's Rosalind Chin reports 
from Shenzhen, China, on rising demand for plastic surgery in 
the country.   The popularity of cosmetic surgery underlines how much 
China has changed since 1979, when former leader Deng Xiaoping 
ditched predecessor Mao Zedong's hard-line communism, opened the
nation's doors to the world and introduced pro-market policies. 
Then, most Chinese struggled for conformity rather than beauty.
