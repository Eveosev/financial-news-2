Saudi Arabia  is trying to persuade
other Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia
and central Asian states, to form an informal Arab alliance
directed against Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified officials.  U.S. officials are concerned that this may increase
sectarian tensions, the newspaper said.  Prince Bandar bin Sultan al Saud, who heads the Saudi
National Security Council, asked Pakistani generals in March to
support the intervention in Bahrain, the Journal said, citing
Pakistani, Saudi and U.S. officials.  The prince told the generals that the U.S. shouldn’t be
counted on to restore stability in the Middle East or safeguard
Pakistan’s interests in south  Asia , the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
