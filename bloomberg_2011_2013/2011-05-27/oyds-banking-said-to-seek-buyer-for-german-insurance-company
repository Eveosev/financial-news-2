Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  plans to
sell its German life insurance company, Heidelberger Leben,
according to a person with knowledge of the lender’s plans.  Heidelberger Leben has about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion)
of assets, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the sale is private.  The London-based bank is examining its strategy following
Antonio Horta-Osorio’s appointment as chief executive officer on
March 1. Lloyds has sold assets including its Bank of Scotland
Integrated Finance investment unit and cut about 27,500 jobs
since its 20 billion-pound ($33 billion) taxpayer-funded rescue.
The bank plans to shrink its balance sheet by 200 billion pounds
by 2014.  Ross Keany, a Lloyds spokesman, declined to comment.  Reuters reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
