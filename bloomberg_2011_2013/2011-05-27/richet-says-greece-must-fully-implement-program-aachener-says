European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said  Greece  has to commit to its austerity plan
to reduce its budget deficit, Germany’s  Aachener Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  “Greece must implement the program fully and rigorously,”
Trichet told the newspaper. “This is very important to correct
the errors of the past and pave the way for sustainable  job
creation .”  “The euro and prices are stable” and inflation in the
medium term “will go back to our definition of price stability:
below 2 percent, close to 2 percent,” he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
