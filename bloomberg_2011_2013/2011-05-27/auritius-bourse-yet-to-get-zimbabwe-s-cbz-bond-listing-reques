The Stock Exchange of Mauritius has
yet to receive an application from Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
Ltd. to start trading its bonds on the Indian Ocean island
nation’s bourse, Chief Executive Officer Sunil Benimadhu said.  “As of now, we have not received any request from the said
institution,” Benimadhu said in a phone interview from  Port
Louis , the capital. “We welcome such initiatives as it’s in
line with our strategy to reach out to international debt
issuers.”  The Zimbabwean lender is completing plans to list $50
million of three-year bonds in Mauritius, the Herald reported
today, citing Chief Financial Officer Never Nyemudzo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
