Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal, scrapped a plan to
boost output at its Marula Platinum Ltd. unit by 35 percent in
two years after the mine missed targets.  “Initial indications are that Marula should remain a
70,000 platinum ounces-per-annum producer for the next two years
as opposed to growing to 95,000 ounces of refined platinum by
2013,” Johannesburg-based Impala, which owns 73 percent of
Marula, said in a statement today. Jobs will be cut at Marula
because the mine is staffed for higher levels of production, the
company said, without giving numbers.  Impala and rivals including Anglo American Platinum Ltd.,
the world’s biggest producer, are trying to boost output to
benefit from metal prices that climbed 58 percent over the past
two years to $1,791.75 an ounce as of 4:39 p.m. in  London .  Marula has underperformed because of “logistical
constraints” caused by a conversion to conventional mining from
mechanized techniques at its Clapham shaft, Impala said.  Impala will probably produce 1.82 million ounces of the
metal in the year ending June 30, compared with a target of 1.85
million ounces, the company said May 17. Impala is targeting 2.1
million ounces by 2014, it said last year.  The production adjustment is “not significant,” for the
company, spokesman  Bob Gilmour  said by phone from Johannesburg
today. It’s too early to say how many jobs will be lost, he
said.  The stock rose 3.29 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 186.50 rand at
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, giving Impala a value of 118
billion rand ($17 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
