Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  has
further reduced staffing at its Horizon oil-sands site in
anticipation of planned burns that are expected to produce
significant smoke in the area, according to the company’s
employee hot line.  Firefighters plan “proactive burns” north and east of the
Horizon site to return the area to normal conditions following
forest fires, the company said. Because of the smoke, Canadian
Natural cut staffing to “fire watch” levels.  Company officials weren’t immediately available for
comment.  Canadian Natural previously evacuated 1,300 people from the
Horizon site near Fort McMurray,  Alberta , as forest fires
threatened the plant and camps housing workers.  Since April 1,  Alberta’s Sustainable Resource Development
agency  said firefighters have responded to 16 fires in the
Waterways area of the province, a hub for oil-sands production.
In an  update  dated May 26, the agency said the wildfire hazard
remains “extreme” for the region, with five fires active.  To contact the reporter on this story:
