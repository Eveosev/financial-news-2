Metallurgical coal prices were
unchanged this week on the U.S. market amid resistance from
foreign buyers, according to Energy Publishing Inc.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal were unchanged
at $315 a ton in the week ended today, the  Knoxville, Tennessee-
based  data provider reported. High-volatility coal was steady at
$268.33.  “European buyers are hesitant to accept $315 as a global
benchmark but are still working to determine exactly where the
market is,” Energy Publishing said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
