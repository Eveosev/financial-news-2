Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS) , the
largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager by sales, will lose a $3
billion Blue Cross Blue Shield Association contract to  CVS
Caremark Corp. (CVS)  in 2012, taking almost 5 percent of its revenue.  Medco tumbled $7.33, or 11 percent, to $57.11 at 9:05 a.m.
in trading before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange.
CVS rose $1.24, or 3.3 percent, to $39.39.  The contract, for Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Federal Employee
Program, includes 9.8 million annual mail-order prescriptions
and expires Dec. 31, the companies said today in separate
statements. The contract change won’t affect earnings until 2012,
said  Franklin Lakes , New Jersey-based Medco.  The Blue Cross Blue Shield contract accounted for almost 5
percent of Medco’s $66 billion in revenue last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new contract with CVS runs
through 2014 and adds mail-order and specialty pharmacy services
to the retail pharmacy benefits program already offered to the
Federal Employee Program, CVS said.  The contract was awarded “based on the best overall
value,” CVS said today in a statement. CVS, based in Woonsocket,
 Rhode Island , is the largest provider of prescription drugs in
the U.S.  Blue Cross Blue Shield is based in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
