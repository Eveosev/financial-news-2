(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  Merck KGaA, a German drugmaker based
in Darmstadt, sold its South African manufacturing business to
Nkunzi Investment Holdings, Engineering News reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The company started trading on May 3 in Johannesburg under
the name Nkunzi Pharmaceuticals, the magazine said. Its
shareholders include Merck and black-owned investment company
Omame, which has acquired a 15 percent stake, Engineering News
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
