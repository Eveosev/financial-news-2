Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa â€™s fourth-largest airline, will operate direct weekly
flights to  Shanghai  from February 2012, the government said.  The airline will start a service to the Chinese city with a
stop-over in  Kuala Lumpur  on July 5 this year, the Port Louis-
based government said in a statement published on its website
today, following the weekly cabinet meeting. The company will
introduce a second weekly direct flight from October 2012, it
said.  Chinese visitors to  Mauritius  during the first quarter
through March increased 30 percent to 3,123, according to data
released by the  Central Statistics Office  on May 25.  Non-stop flights will be extended to Beijing, the
government said, without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
