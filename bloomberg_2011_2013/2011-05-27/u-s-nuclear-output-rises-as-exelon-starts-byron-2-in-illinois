U.S. nuclear-power production rose
2.5 percent after  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  started the Byron 2 reactor in
Illinois, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 2,027 megawatts
from yesterday to 82,810 megawatts, or 82 percent of capacity,
the most since April 1, according to an NRC report today and
data compiled by Bloomberg. Eighteen of the nationâ€™s 104
reactors were offline.  Exelon is operating the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2 reactor at
27 percent of capacity after shutting the unit May 21 to replace
a pressure relief valve. The reactor is 85 miles (137
kilometers) west of  Chicago . Another unit at the site, the
1,164-megawatt Byron 1, is operating at 98 percent.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased output from the 1,020-megawatt
Indian Point 2 reactor to full power from 63 percent of capacity
yesterday after shutting it on May 20 to replace three high-
voltage bushings on a main electrical transformer.  The 1,025-megawatt Unit 3, the other operating reactor at
the site, is running at full capacity. The plant is about 27
miles north of  New York City .  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted the 1,065-megawatt
Browns Ferry 1 to 88 percent of capacity from 21 percent, and
the 1,104-megawatt Unit 2 to 86 percent from 43 percent
yesterday as the plant powered up after storms on April 27
knocked out parts of the regional transmission grid.  Awaiting Repairs  The 1,115-megawatt Browns Ferry 3 is expected to resume
service after further repairs to transmission lines. There was
no damage to the plant, located 84 miles north of Birmingham on
Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee line.  The TVA also increased output at the 1,123-megawatt Watts
Bar 1 reactor in Tennessee to 92 percent of capacity from 77
percent yesterday. The unit, 55 miles southwest of Knoxville,
was shut for refueling April 4.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  slowed the 1,130-
megawatt Salem 2 reactor in  New Jersey  to 90 percent of capacity
from full power yesterday. Another unit at the site, the 1,174-
megawatt Salem 1, is operating at full power.  The plant is about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 1,295-megawatt Seabrook
reactor in New Hampshire to 100 percent of capacity from 94
percent yesterday. The plant, 13 miles south of Portsmouth, was
shut for refueling April 1.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
