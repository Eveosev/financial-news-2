The state-owned National Railways of
 Zimbabwe  plans to buy 14 locomotives from  China  at a cost of
about $29 million, the  Herald  said, citing NRZ spokesman Fanuel
Masikati.  The railway company currently has 65 locomotives against a
requirement of 83, the Harare-based newspaper said on its
website.  NRZ  owns about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles) of
railway line and carries 6.4 million metric tons of freight a
year, the Herald said.  The railway company needs an additional $10 million to
replace vandalized equipment that has stopped the movement of
its electric-powered locomotives, said the state-owned Herald.  To contact the reporter on this story:
