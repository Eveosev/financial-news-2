Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , the
carrier under pressure from shareholder  William Ackman  to boost
efficiency by changing management, said its expense margin
worsened in the fourth quarter.  Operating expenses climbed to 78.5 percent of revenue in
the fourth quarter from 77 percent a year earlier, the Calgary-
based company said today in a statement.  Canadian Pacific is seeking to keep Chief Executive Officer
Fred Green while Ackman says  Hunter Harrison , the former chief
of rival  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR) , should take his place.
Ackman has pushed to cut Canadian Pacific’s ratio of expenses to
revenue, an efficiency gauge, to 65 percent by 2015.  When Harrison retired from  Canadian National , the measure
had been cut to 67.3 from 76 at the end of 2002, filings show.  Canadian Pacific  said today its strategic plan has already
yielded benefits that enabled the railroad to narrow its
operating ratio target range to 70 to 72 percent by 2015,
compared with a goal of a “low-70s” ratio given previously.  “We have no intention of stopping there,” Green said in
the statement.  The rate of improvement advocated by Ackman has never been
achieved by any railroad from that starting point, Canadian
Pacific chairman John Cleghorn has said, maintaining that
current CEO Fred Green is the best person to lead the Calgary-
based railroad to its target operating ratio by 2015.  Earnings Estimates  Earnings excluding some items were C$1.08 a share, trailing
the C$1.10 average of 23  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Net income rose to C$221 million ($220.8 million
U.S.), or C$1.30 a share, from C$186 million, or C$1.09, a year
earlier, the company said.  The fourth quarter was the only one in 2011 when net income
rose. Canadian Pacific has suffered profit declines this year
and saw its operating ratio reach its highest since at least
2005 in the first quarter as avalanches forced the rail carrier
to halt trains and reroute shipments.  Revenue in the fourth quarter rose to C$1.41 billion,
topping the average estimate of C$1.39 billion in a Bloomberg
survey of 18 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
