Companies may be able to repeatedly
renew short-term employment contracts, the  European Court  of
Justice  ruled  today.  An employer may not be “acting in an abusive manner” by
using a series of fixed-term contracts to deal with staffing
shortages, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Luxembourg-based EU tribunal.  The court ruled on a challenge by a German court clerk who
argued that her work contract was “indefinite in nature” after
13 fixed-term employment contracts between 1996 and 2007.  The case is:  C-586/10 , Kucuk v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
