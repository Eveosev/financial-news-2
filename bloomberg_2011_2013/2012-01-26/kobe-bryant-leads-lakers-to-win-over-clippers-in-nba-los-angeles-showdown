Kobe Bryant  scored 24 points and the
 Los Angeles Lakers  rallied from a four-point deficit early in
the fourth quarter to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 96-91 in a
National Basketball Association game.  Pau Gasol had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers (11-
8), who broke a three-game losing streak with the victory at the
Staples Center that the teams share.  Blake Griffin had 26 points for the Clippers (9-6), who
welcomed back point guard Chris Paul -- who had four points and
12 assists in 27 minutes in his first game after missing five
contests with a strained left hamstring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
