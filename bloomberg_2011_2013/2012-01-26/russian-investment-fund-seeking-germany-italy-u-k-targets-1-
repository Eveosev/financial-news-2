Russia’s Direct Investment Fund is
looking to acquire assets in countries including  Germany , Italy
and the U.K., according to head of the company, Kirill Dmitriev.  “We are looking at things like automotive components and a
bunch of assets in logistics, which we think are undervalued
now,” Dmitriev said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland.  The Kremlin established the fund in June to invest in
modernizing industries and help wean the economy off its
dependence on energy exports, which account for 17 percent of
gross domestic product. While its primary aim is to finance
domestic projects, the fund also wants to use the financial
turmoil in  Europe  to snap up technology assets.  France  is also interesting because of the number of
technological companies that are “synergistic with the Russian
market,” Dmitriev said.  The Russian government will pump about $10 billion into the
fund in the next five years, and wants to attract $50 billion of
co-investments from foreign buyout firms, sovereign-wealth funds
and companies seeking to expand in the country, Dmitriev said at
its inception.  To contact the reporters on this story:
