Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) 
shares jumped, leading gains in the Persian Gulf city, after the
United Arab Emirates third-largest lender reported full-year
profit that exceeded analysts’ expectations.  The shares surged the most since May 2010, rallying 5.7
percent to 2.97 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in  Abu Dhabi . The
 ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,390.16, the highest
since Jan. 5. The measure reversed an  earlier drop  of as much as
0.2 percent after ADCB’s results were announced.  Union National
Bank PJSC (UNB)  advanced 2.4 percent to 3.01 dirhams.  Investors were “definitely positively surprised by ADCB”
results, said Ahmed Talhaoui, the Abu Dhabi-based head of
investment and asset management at Royal Capital PJSC. “This is
giving us a nice boost.”  Banks in the second-largest Arab economy are starting to
recover from a slowdown in credit growth after the global debt
crisis triggered a real-estate slump, slowed tourism and trade
and investment banking revenue plunged. U.A.E. President Sheikh
Khalifa bin Zayed  Al Nahyan  ordered a state fund to settle debt
owed by citizens totaling about 2 billion dirhams ($544
million), the official WAM news agency reported yesterday.  ADCB said  2011 profit  rose to 3.03 billion dirhams from 381
million dirhams a year earlier. The mean estimate of 12 analysts
was for a profit of 2.22 billion dirhams, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Three analysts recommend investors
“buy” the stock, three recommend they “sell” it, while eight
rate it “hold,” according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares have surged 35 percent in the past year,
compared with a 1 percent decline in the  ADX Banks Index. (ADBF)  The
index rose 0.7 percent today to the highest since Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
