Google Inc. (GOOG)  opened its social-
networking site to anyone 13 or older and added features to
protect teenagers’ safety, helping the company compete with
Facebook Inc., which has similar age requirements.  The Google+ service, until now limited to users 18 and up,
will be available to all teenagers, except those in Spain,  South
Korea  and Netherlands, where the age requirements are higher,
the company said. New safety enhancements, meanwhile, will help
control who can contact teens online and put restrictions on
group video chats.  “With Google+, we want to help teens build meaningful
connections online,” Bradley Horowitz, a vice president in
charge of the service, said today on his  Google+ page . “We also
want to provide features that foster safety alongside self-
expression.”  Google+, unveiled last June, is the company’s latest effort
to push back against Facebook, the largest social-networking
service in the world. Google’s service has more than 90 million
users, up from more than 40 million in October, Chief Executive
Officer  Larry Page  said earlier this month. Facebook has more
than 800 million.  The company also  announced  that Google+ will be integrated
into Google Earth as part of an upgrade to the service. That
means users can more easily share maps such as maps of mountains
or oceans, with friends.  Google shares were little changed today, closing at
$568.10. The  Mountain View , California-based company climbed 8.7
percent in value last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
