Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, plans to boost loans to small
businesses in the country by 26 percent, or C$10 billion ($10
billion), in the next three years to attract more customers.  “We’re sending a signal on all fronts that this is a great
time for Canadian businesses to be investing for the future,”
Frank Techar, head of personal and commercial banking at the
Toronto-based company, said today in an interview.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  had C$38 billion in loans to small and
medium-size companies in Canada at the end of October, Techar
said. The lender said in a statement that it’s extending credit
to show its confidence in entrepreneurs as well as the Canadian
economy.  “We also are hopeful that we’re going to strike a chord
with our competitors’ customers as well,” Techar said. “We’d
like to see a few more of them giving us a shot.”  The bank’s plans to increase loans to small businesses in
Canada comes about six months after a similar move at its U.S.
subsidiary. Last July, the company’s BMO Harris Bank unit
offered an extra $5 billion in loans to small and medium-size
U.S. businesses to gain customers after completing a C$4.1
billion takeover of Wisconsin-based lender Marshall & Ilsley
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
