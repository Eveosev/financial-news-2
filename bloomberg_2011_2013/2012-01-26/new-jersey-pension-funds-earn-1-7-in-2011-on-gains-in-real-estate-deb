New Jersey’s (STONJ1)  pension funds, with
$67.2 billion of assets, returned 1.7 percent last year as gains
from debt, private-equity and real-estate investments tempered
losses from global stocks.  International equities lost 18.3 percent, while investments
in U.S. fixed-income gained 15.1 percent, according to a report
to the State Investment Council. Real estate added 13.7 percent
and private equity returned 13.3 percent, according to data from
the treasury’s investment division.  The state’s pension funds, which cover government workers
and teachers, had 67.5 percent of the assets needed to pay
future benefits as of July 1, down from 70.5 percent a year
earlier, according to treasury reports released this week. For
2010, New Jersey’s funding ratio was 13th-lowest among U.S.
states, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Last year’s return was short of the 8.25 percent gain
assumed by actuaries assessing the system’s capacity to meet
promised benefits.  To address the underfunding, Republican Governor  Chris Christie  signed bills in June that raised pension and health-
care expenses, increased the minimum  retirement age  for new
employees to 65 from 62 and froze cost-of-living increases.  Increased Gap  The state’s estimated pension-funding deficit fell to $36.3
billion from $53.9 billion after passage of Christie’s plan. The
gap then swelled by $5.5 billion to $41.8 billion for the 12
months through June after Christie skipped the state’s pension
payment.  A 2010 law required the state to begin phasing in the full
payments over seven years after a decade of lapsed funding.
Christie, 49, this year has budgeted $484 million for a pension
payment. Actuaries had recommended the state put in $3 billion.  New Jersey ’s fund manages investments for seven public-
retirement systems that provide benefits for 769,000 members and
their families.  The funds returned 18 percent in the 12 months ended June
30, and have an annualized 10-year return of 5.1 percent.  The value of the pension assets dropped to $67.2 billion as
of Dec. 31, from $69.6 billion as of Oct. 31. It’s down 3.4
percent in the fiscal year that began July 1, through Dec. 31,
according to the investment reports.  The  California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the
largest U.S. public pension, posted 2011 earnings of 1.1
percent. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the
second-largest, gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
