The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ’s
best January rally since 1997 has pushed a pair of momentum and
sentiment gauges to levels seen only 6 percent of the time since
1993, a sign the market is due for a pullback, BTIG LLC said.  The benchmark index’s 14-day  relative strength index , which
measures the degree that gains and losses outpace each other,
rose above 70 yesterday for the first time since Feb. 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some technical analysts
consider RSI readings above 70 a sign that stocks have risen too
far, too fast. The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index , a gauge known as the VIX, fell below 20 for the first
time since July on Jan. 19.  The last time RSI exceeded 70 while the VIX stayed below
20, 11 months ago, the  S&P 500  reached a 32-month high before
dropping 6.4 percent over the next month, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The VIX is the benchmark gauge of S&P 500
options prices.  “We’re definitely in a rare spot,” Josh Dollinger, Chief
quantitative and technical strategist at BTIG in New York, said
in a telephone interview. “These are extreme readings. They
more often than not prove to be exhaustion tops.”  The S&P 500 rose 5.4 percent this year through yesterday,
poised for the best January since it rose 6.1 percent during the
first month of 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Stocks are extending the measure’s 11 percent rally in the
October-December period, its best fourth-quarter increase since
2003 as improvements in hiring, manufacturing and home sales
bolstered confidence in the world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
