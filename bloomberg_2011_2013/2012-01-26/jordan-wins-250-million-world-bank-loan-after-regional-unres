The  World Bank  said it approved a
$250 million loan to  Jordan  to aid the nation in overcoming
economic difficulties.  The loan “helps the country manage the global economic
downturn and the short-term shocks caused by political events in
the region,” the World Bank said in an e-mailed statement. It
didn’t give details on the interest rate of the loan.  The kingdom’s economy was hurt by increasing food and fuel
prices as tourism dropped 16 percent, remittances from
expatriates fell 3 percent and foreign direct investment
declined 32 percent last year due to regional unrest, it said.
“Social expenditures in response to these shocks, including
large untargeted subsidies, have increased fiscal deficits and
Jordan’s vulnerability to further shocks,” the World Bank said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports almost all of its energy needs and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. Jordan’s energy bill is forecast to rise this year to
4 billion dinars ($5.64 billion) from 3.5 billion dinars in 2011
because of disruption to natural-gas deliveries from  Egypt  and
as consumption rises, Al Arab Al Yawm reported Jan. 24, citing
Energy Minister Qutaiba Abu Qura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
