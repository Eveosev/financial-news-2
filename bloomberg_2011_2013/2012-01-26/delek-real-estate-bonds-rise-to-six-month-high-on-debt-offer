Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  bonds rose to
the highest level in almost six months and shares advanced as
the property company controlled by shareholder Isaac Tshuva got
a debt-settlement offer from dalet and heh  debt holders .  Delek’s 4.8 percent bonds due in February 2019 climbed to
42 agorot on the shekel, the highest since Aug. 4, pushing the
yield down 3.03 percentage points to 49.93 percent at 12:29 p.m.
in  Tel Aviv . The  shares  jumped 10 percent to 0.273 shekel,
poised for the highest close since July 24.  As part of the settlement offer, dalet and heh bondholders
demanded Tshuva put up an 8 percent stake in Delek Group Ltd. as
collateral should Delek Real Estate not meet its commitments.
Delek Real Estate hadn’t examined details of the offer and said
negotiations were ongoing, with no agreement yet reached,
according to a statement filed today with the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange.  Delek Group shares  advanced 1.2 percent to 798.10
shekels.  TheMarker reported Jan. 24 that Tshuva may assume as much
as 1 billion shekels ($266 million) of the  Ramat Gan , Israel-
based company’s liabilities and retain the controlling equity
interest as part of a settlement.  Tshuva owns  50.79  percent of Delek Real Estate, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG) , which is 64.36
percent owned by Tshuva, holds 4.99 percent of the property
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
