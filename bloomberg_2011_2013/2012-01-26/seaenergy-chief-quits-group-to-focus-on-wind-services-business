SeaEnergy Plc (SEA) , the Aberdeen-based
energy company, will continue to focus on developing businesses
that service offshore wind farms after announcing its executive
chairman will step down.  Steve Remp will leave the company he founded in 1977 to
concentrate on personal investments, SeaEnergy said today in a
statement. He will be replaced as chairman by David Sigsworth, a
non- executive director . John Aldersey-Williams, also non-
executive director, will be acting chief executive.  The company will concentrate on businesses providing
services such as operations and maintenance as well as vessels
that work on wind farms at sea, according to the statement.  SeaEnergy changed its name from Ramco Energy Plc in 2009
and switched its focus from oil and gas exploration after Remp
saw potential for wind power in the  North Sea . The company
agreed to sell offshore wind unit SeaEnergy Renewables Ltd. to
Repsol YPF SA, Spainâ€™s biggest oil company, for about 50 million
pounds ($79 million) in June to concentrate on marine services.  SeaEnergy closed up 2.53 percent at 25.4 pence in  London 
today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
