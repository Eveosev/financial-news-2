Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d.
expects 2012 to be a “difficult” year for the company’s
operations, Finance newspaper reported, citing Ziga Debeljak,
the chief executive officer of the Slovenian retailer.  “Economists are saying 2012 will be one of the most
difficult in recent times and this will impact the economics of
our operations,” Debeljak was quoted as saying by the
Ljubljana-based newspaper. “We have invested a lot in lowering
prices and some unexpected  currency risk  appeared in the second
half of last year.”  Mercator, whose owners are in exclusive talks to sell a
majority stake in the company to Croatian  Agrokor (AGROKOR)  d.d., withdrew
its support for the sale process because the sellers “failed to
take into account our concerns” in protecting the company’s
interests, Debeljak said, according to Finance.  “It’s very bad for the company if the process drags on and
on, but our position would be even more negative if there was an
agreement that in the end wouldn’t be carried through, because
in the interim period Mercator would be paralyzed,” Debeljak
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
