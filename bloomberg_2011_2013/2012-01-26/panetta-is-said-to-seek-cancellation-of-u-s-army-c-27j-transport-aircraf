Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  may
seek a greater role for the U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class
submarines by outfitting them with additional cruise missiles,
according to a person familiar with plans to be announced today.  Panetta will lay out the Pentagon’s $525 billion budget
plan for fiscal 2013 and also may ask Congress for authority to
close domestic military bases, the person said.  The U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class submarines, built by  General
Dynamics Corp. (GD)  and  Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII) , will be
redesigned to carry out so-called prompt global strike missions,
the person said.  Panetta also will propose reducing the Army from 562,000
personnel to 490,000 by fiscal 2017 and the Marines from 202,000
to 182,000 by that date, according to the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity before Panetta presents his budget
outline at the Pentagon.  Air Force aircraft will be reduced to match a reduction in
personnel under a defense plan to be outlined today by U.S.
Panetta, according to the person.  Panetta will propose canceling the C-27J transport plane
made by  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL) , and Alenia  North
America , a subsidiary of Italy’s  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , the person
said. Panetta may also call for retiring some C-5 and C-130
transport planes, both made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   The Pentagon budget will call for reducing the number of
Air Force tactical air squadrons to 43 from 50, while plans for
new bombers and refueling aircraft will go forward, according to
the person.  The Defense Department will say it can find $60 billion in
savings by reducing waste and overhead, increasing information-
technology efficiency, streamlining staff  and inventory
management.  To contact the reporters on this story:
