An Ethiopian judge sentenced three
journalists, an opposition politician and another person to
prison terms ranging from 14 years to life in jail for
terrorism-related crimes.  Elias Kifle, who was convicted in absentia and runs the
U.S.-based Ethiopian Review website, received a life sentence,
said Federal High Court Judge Endeshaw Adane. Woubshet Taye,
former deputy editor of the now-closed Awramba Times and Reeyot
Alemu, a columnist for Fitih newspaper was were sentenced each
to 14 years by the court in the capital,  Addis Ababa , today.  The group were found guilty Jan. 19 of conspiring to commit
terrorist acts and belonging to a banned group under a 2009
anti-terrorism law. All five are “prisoners of conscience” and
did not commit any crimes, according to London-based  Amnesty
International .  “We are going to appeal to the  Supreme Court ,” said Molla
Zegeye, a lawyer for Reeyot, after the sentencing. “She did not
commit terror attacks. She is a professional journalist.”  Hirut Kifle got a 19-year sentence and Zerihun Gebre-
Egziabher, president of the  National Democratic Party , was
jailed for 17 years, said Endeshaw.  “I am not guilty,” Zerihun said to the court after the
sentencing. “History will prove I am innocent.”  Since March, 108 politicians and six journalists have been
arrested for having links to banned groups, according to
Amnesty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
