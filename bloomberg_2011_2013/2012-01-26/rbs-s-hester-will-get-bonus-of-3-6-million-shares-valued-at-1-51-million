Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  will receive a bonus of
963,000 pounds ($1.51 million) for last year, less than half his
2010 payout.  The all-stock award of 3.6 million shares, whose value was
based on the closing price on Jan. 25, will be deferred until
2014, Edinburgh-based RBS said in a statement yesterday. Hester,
51, took a 2 million-pound bonus for 2010, his first since
replacing  Fred Goodwin  in 2008. He made 1.22 million pounds in
salary last year.  Executives at RBS, Britain’s biggest government-controlled
lender, have been urged by Prime Minister  David Cameron  to show
restraint on pay at a time when real household incomes are
falling and public spending is being squeezed. Cameron this
month said Hester’s bonus should not exceed 1 million pounds
this year.  “Hester came in to clear up the mess and is steering  RBS (RBS) 
in the right direction,” said Tom Rayner, an analyst at Exane
BNP Paribas in London who rates RBS “neutral.” “Hester is not
Fred Goodwin. It’s a dangerous game that is being played here as
he could just walk away.”  RBS shares fell by 48 percent last year as  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis eroded revenue from its securities unit.
The Edinburgh-based bank announced about 4,800 job cuts earlier
this month and said it plans to sell or close its cash equities,
mergers advisory, corporate broking and equity capital markets
operations. John Hourican, who leads RBS’s securities unit, is
in line for a payout of as much as 5.8 million pounds this year
as part of his 2009 share award that vests in April.  ‘Out of Touch’  Chris Leslie , the opposition Labour party’s spokesman for
finance, said Hester’s award showed that Cameron’s promises to
rein in excessive bonuses at state-owned banks “have proved to
be utterly worthless.”  “Anyone who thinks it is acceptable to award a bonus of
almost 1 million pounds on top of a basic salary of 1.2 million
pounds in these tough times is desperately out of touch with
millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet,”
Leslie said.  A spokeswoman for Cameron’s office declined to comment on
Hester’s compensation. Cameron’s  Conservative Party  said that
Labour failed to curb bonuses when it was in power.  “It would clearly have been unacceptable for Stephen
Hester’s bonus to have been the same as last year,” the
Conservative Party said in an e-mailed statement. “We have been
very clear that at RBS and in other banks the bonus pool has got
to be considerably lower than it was last year.”  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio said on
Jan. 13 he won’t take a 2011 bonus following his nine-week
absence for exhaustion at the 41 percent government-owned
lender. The payment could have been as much as 2.39 million
pounds, according to company filings.  Morgan Stanley CEO  James Gorman ’s 2011 pay was cut by 25
percent to $10.5 million from the previous year while JPMorgan
Chase & Co. held CEO  Jamie Dimon ’s pay steady at $23 million,
two people familiar with the plans said earlier this month.  Britain has an 82 percent stake in RBS after bailing out
the bank with 45.5 billion pounds of capital during the banking
crisis in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
