Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  retreated

three, gaining 0.3 percent to 902.84 in Windhoek. Mauritius’s
 SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  fell for a third day, weakening 0.1 percent to

Lagos, according to a statement on the bourse’s website.  The following shares were active in sub-Saharan Africa,

third largest bank by market value, advanced for a third day,
surging 4.9 percent to 9.61 naira, the highest since Nov. 22, on
speculation the lender will pay a dividend for the year through
December.  “Investors anticipate that First Bank will be able to pay
a dividend of at least one naira per share for the full year
through December, given that its earnings per share for the nine
months were already above one naira,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., a brokerage, said by phone today. “That means that at the
current price, the dividend yield will be more than 10 percent,
and that means a lot globally.”  Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc  (JAPAULOI NL), a
Nigerian oil-services company, rose for a second day, gaining 4
percent to 79 kobo. Oil rose after the  Federal Reserve  announced
it plans to keep U.S. interest rates near a record low through
2014 and as a report showed durable goods orders in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming country increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
