The  New York Yankees  signed right-
handed pitcher Hiroki Kuroda to a one-year contract, the Major
League Baseball team announced today in an e-mailed release.  Kuroda, 36, was 13-16 with a 3.07 earned run average in 32
starts with the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, establishing
career bests in wins, ERA and strikeouts with 161. A native of
Osaka, Japan, Kuroda has spent his four-year major league career
in Los Angeles.  The Yankees acquired Michael Pineda from the  Seattle
Mariners  earlier this week. New Yorkâ€™s staff ERA was 3.73 last
season, the fourth-best mark in the American League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
