Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  declined, set for its
lowest in most more than five months after the biggest Czech oil
refiner said fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes
will be negative and worse than in the previous quarter.  The stock slid 1.8 percent to 168 koruna by 9:38 a.m. in
Prague, making it the worst performer in the  PX (PX)  equity gauge,
which increased 1 percent. A close at that level would be the
lowest for Unipetrol shares since Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
