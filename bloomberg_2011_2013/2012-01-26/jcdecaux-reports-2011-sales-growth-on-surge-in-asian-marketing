JCDecaux SA (DEC) , a French outdoor
advertising company, said sales in 2011 rose 4.8 percent,
boosted by revenue from the Asia-Pacific area.  Sales climbed to 2.46 billion euros ($3.23 billion) from
2.35 billion, the company said in a statement. That was in line
with the average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  JCDecaux, based in Neuilly-Sur-Seine outside Paris, said
sales from the Asia-Pacific region grew by 20 percent. That
offset a decline in  North America  and slower  growth  in its
European markets, which account for most of the companyâ€™s
revenue.  The company makes almost half of its money from street
furniture with ads that appear on objects such as bus shelters,
toilets, trash bins and benches. Sales in that group grew 2.8
percent to 1.18 billion euros. The transport business, including
ads in airports and train stations, gained 13 percent to bring
in 874.8 million euros. Billboards shrank 3.8 percent to 409.2
million euros.  JCDecaux rose 1.6 percent to 19.30 euros in Paris  trading 
today. The stock has declined 14 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
