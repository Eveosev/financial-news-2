Maria Sharapova  beat Wimbledon
champion Petra Kvitova in three sets to advance to her third
Australian Open final, where she’ll play first-time Grand Slam
finalist Victoria Azarenka.  Sharapova, the No. 4 seed from Russia, won the rematch of
last year’s Wimbledon final 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 against her second-
seeded Czech opponent at Melbourne Park, where she took the
title in 2008 for her third Grand Slam championship.  No. 3-seed Azarenka of Belarus earlier overcame a second-
set comeback from defending champion Kim Clijsters to win 6-4,
1-6, 6-3 and advance to the Jan. 28 championship match. The
winner will also take the No. 1 ranking.  Four-time champion  Roger Federer  of Switzerland, the No. 3
seed, faces No. 2  Rafael Nadal  of Spain in the first men’s
semifinal tonight. It will be their first final-four showdown at
a major since 2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
