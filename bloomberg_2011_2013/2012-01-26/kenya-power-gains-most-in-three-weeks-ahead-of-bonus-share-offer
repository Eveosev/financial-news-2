Kenya Power & Lighting Ltd. , the
east African nation’s sole electricity distributor, headed for
its biggest gain in three weeks on increased demand for the
stock before a bonus issue deadline runs out on Feb. 28.  The stock rose as much as 1 percent to 15.65 shillings and
traded 0.7 percent higher at 15.60 shillings as of 2:42 p.m in
Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level will be the biggest
gain since Dec. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We may also see growing demand on Kenya Power ahead of
the company’s books closing for the 1:8 bonus issue,” Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients
today.  Investors have until Feb. 28 to buy the stock to be
eligible for the company’s one-for-eight bonus share offer,
according to data from the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The
company’s shares are down 11 percent this year after declining
27 percent last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Last year the fall was in line with the market that was
down 30 percent,”, Vimal Parmar, head of research at Kestrel,
said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
