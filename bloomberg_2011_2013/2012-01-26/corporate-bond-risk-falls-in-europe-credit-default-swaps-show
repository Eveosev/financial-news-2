The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 12.5
basis points to 623.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30
a.m. in London. A decline signals improved perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down 2.5 at 147.75 basis points.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25
banks and insurers declined six basis points to 221 and the
subordinated gauge was eight lower at 387.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
