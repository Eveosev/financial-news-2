Russia ’s  Finance Ministry  has
proposed taxing interest payments for Eurobond coupon payments,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing a letter from Deputy Minister  Sergei Shatalov  to the Federal Tax Service.  Shatalov said Russian companies that issue Eurobonds via
special investment vehicles abroad should be subject to the
country’s profit tax, according to the Moscow-based newspaper.
The tax could be as much as 20 percent of Eurobond coupon
payments, Vedomosti said, citing an unidentified investment
banker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
