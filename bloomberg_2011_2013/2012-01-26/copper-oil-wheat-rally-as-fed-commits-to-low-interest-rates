Commodities (SPGSCI)  rose to the highest
level in two weeks as copper and oil jumped on speculation that
 Federal Reserve  plans to keep U.S. interest rates near a record
low will bolster investor demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities gained
0.9 percent to 667.54 at 1:34 p.m. in  New York . Earlier it
reached 671.58, the highest level since Jan. 10.  Oil futures advanced as much as 2 percent after the Fed’s
announcement sent the dollar to its lowest in more than a month
against the euro, making assets priced in the U.S. currency more
attractive. The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday it
expects its benchmark  interest rate  to stay “exceptionally
low” at least until late 2014. A halt of Iranian oil supplies
may boost crude by as much as $30 a barrel, the  International
Monetary Fund  said.  “It’s a big commitment from the central bank,” said
Sintje Boie, an analyst at HSH Nordbank AG in Hamburg, who
correctly predicted in November that  oil prices  would slide by
year-end. “For the markets, it’s a liquidity thing. All this
liquidity must go somewhere, and so we have some money also
going into oil. Prices are higher because of this bubble of
liquidity.”  Copper for March delivery rose for a fourth day in New
York, adding 1.8 percent to $3.8965 a pound at 12:13 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. It reached $3.9105, the highest level since
Sept. 19, and topped the 200-day moving average for the first
time since August. Copper for three-month delivery rose 2.3
percent to $8,573.50 a metric ton in  London . Tin climbed the
most since Aug. 3, 2009.  Gold Rises  Gold climbed to a seven-week high on speculation that the
Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates low will drive
the dollar lower and boost demand for precious metals as an
alternative asset. Gold for April delivery jumped 1.3 percent to
$1,724.70 an ounce at 12:23 p.m. in New York after climbing to
$1,734.50, the highest price since Dec. 8.  Wheat advanced for a sixth day to the highest price in more
than three weeks as Russia may have to slow shipments of the
grain as exportable supply declines. Corn and soybeans gained.  Wheat stockpiles held by farmers in  Russia ’s main exporting
regions in the south have dropped below last year’s levels,
declining as much as 50 percent in some areas, SovEcon, a
Moscow-based agricultural researcher, said yesterday. The
country banned  exports  in August 2010 after its worst drought in
half a century. The ban was lifted in July.  “Russia could potentially put some export curbs in place,
but nothing is for certain,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an
analyst at Barclays Plc in London. “For grains we have quite a
bit of fundamental support.”  Wheat for March delivery climbed 2.9 percent to $6.565 a
bushel at 12:24 New York time on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price rose to $6.5825 earlier, the highest since Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
