Representatives of  Greece ’s private
creditors will propose that bonds issued as part of a debt
exchange should carry a weighted average coupon of 3.75 percent,
 Kathimerini  reported, without saying how it got the information.  Charles Dallara , the managing director of the Washington-
based  Institute of International Finance , will make the proposal
when talks with Greek officials resume in  Athens  today, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
