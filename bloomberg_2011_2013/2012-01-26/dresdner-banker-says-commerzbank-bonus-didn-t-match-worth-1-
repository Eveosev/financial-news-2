(Corrects currency conversion in fourth paragraph.)  A former manager at  Commerzbank AG’s (CBK) 
Dresdner Bank unit told a  London  court he was suing the German
lender because it hasn’t paid him the bonus his performance
deserved -- $394,000.  Desmond McNamara, who headed up risk management for
Dresdner’s capital-markets division, is one of 104 London-based
bankers who have sued claiming Commerzbank failed to honor a
bonus pledge Dresdner made before it was taken over in 2009.  “I’m only claiming the amount my line manager determined
during the year my performance was worth,” McNamara said. While
he received salary and a guaranteed bonus worth around 400,000
pounds ($628,000) for 2008, Commerzbank didn’t pay a
discretionary bonus he was told was worth another $394,000.  Commerzbank, Germany’s second biggest lender, completed a
takeover of Dresdner in January 2009 then cut bonuses by 90
percent or more, according to court filings from the former
Dresdner bankers. Stefan Jentzsch, Dresdner’s former chief
executive officer, had in 2008 promised to set aside 400 million
euros ($524 million) for workers who stayed at the bank.  Commerzbank, which took an 18.2 billion-euro bailout from
 Germany  during the credit crunch, has been sued in London,
Germany and  Singapore  by workers who claim they weren’t paid
what they were owed after the buyout.  Not ‘Legally Binding’  Earlier, Commerzbank lawyer Tom Linden set out the
Frankfurt-based lender’s case, saying the 400 million-euro
promise made by Jentzsch at a 2008 meeting “cannot have been
intended to be legally binding even if it genuinely represented
the intentions of the bank.”  The reason employees had stayed after the takeover was that
“they had no wish to move and nowhere to go,” not because of a
retention bonus, he said.  McNamara, the first employee to testify at the U.K. trial,
said his role as risk manager was “better rewarded in what were
extremely volatile markets” in 2008. He said he had added
substantial value to Dresdner in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc.’s collapse.  The bankers are seeking a total of about 50 million euros,
with individual payouts of as much as 2 million euros.  The cases include: Mr. Fahmi Anar & Others v. Dresdner
