Gasoil discounts narrowed in Europe
as BP Plc bought barges of the heating fuel. Diesel advanced
relative to gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) ’s administrators said they will
resume fuel shipments from the 220,000 barrel-a-day Coryton
refinery in the U.K.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $980 to $990 a metric ton, according
to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That’s the most since Oct. 17 and compares with deals
yesterday at $970 to $982.  Cargill Inc. and OAO Lukoil’s trading unit Litasco bought
barges of the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished fuel. Cargill also sold, along with Morgan Stanley and
Gunvor Group Ltd.  “The sudden raft of closures of U.S. and European
refineries has injected some life into the otherwise ailing
downstream sector,” Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays Plc in
London, said in a note today.  Stoppages of three Petroplus Holdings plants and reduced
runs at two others, along with Hovensa LLC’s decision to close
its St. Croix refinery in the  U.S. Virgin Islands , are among the
outages boosting refining profits this month, the bank said.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , fell to $7.21
a barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
refined products broker in London. It jumped to $8.05 a barrel
yesterday, the most since Aug. 31. Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent
widened to $4.21 from $3.94 the previous session, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the main seller of  heating oil ,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. The
product traded at a discount of $2 a ton to February gasoil on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. That’s the highest in two
weeks. BP and Gunvor were the main buyers.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel traded once at a premium of $16 a
ton to February gasoil. Shell sold to Omneo Trading. That’s up
from the last deals at $14.50 to $15 on Jan. 24. Total SA also
sold a 20,000-ton cargo of diesel to Mercuria Energy Trading SA
at $1 premium to the French benchmark price.  Gasoil for February increased 0.5 percent to $946.75 a ton
at 5:25 p.m. local time on the ICE exchange. The March contract
gained 0.6 percent to $948.75. The front-month contract’s
discount to the second month, a price structure known as a
contango, grew to $2 from $1.25 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, shrank
to $16.29 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. from $16.59 yesterday, according
to ICE exchange data. Front-month Brent rose 1.1 percent to
$111.03 a barrel on ICE.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $670.50 to $679 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. Yesterday’s deals were struck
from $665 to $670. The  low-sulfur  grade $678 and $680 traded at
a ton, compared with $668 to $670 the previous session.  Refineries  Steven Pearson, an administrator for Petroplus’s Coryton
refinery, said the plant will resume fuel shipments “with
immediate effect” in an e-mailed statement today.  The facility, running at reduced capacity after Petroplus
had $1 billion in credit lines frozen last month, supplies about
20 percent of southeast  England ’s fuel, according to Unite, the
U.K.’s biggest union. Petroplus this week announced plans to
file for insolvency.  Two  oil tankers  were anchored on England’s southeast coast
near the refinery, according to AISLive ship-tracking data on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
