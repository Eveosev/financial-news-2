Sugar and wheat farming probably
will become more productive as the average temperature rises
across the U.K. in the next 40 years, the government concluded
in a report assessing the impact of  climate change .  Sugar beet yields may rise 20 percent to 70 percent and
wheat yields by as much as 140 percent because the atmosphere is
warming, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
said today.  “A warmer climate presents opportunities to grow new crops
such as soya, sunflowers, peaches, apricots and grapes,” the
department said a statement in London.  The study also found that climate-related deaths would
increase in the summer and decline in the winter and that both
floods and dangerous droughts would become more frequent. The
report is meant to advise Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
government on the measures it needs to endorse to adapt to
climate change.  “Without an effective plan to prepare for the risks from
climate change, the country may sleepwalk into disaster,” John Krebs, a lawmaker who leads the Committee on Climate
Change, said in the statement.  The number of days that the temperature rises above 26
degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) may increase from about
18 currently to 27 to 121 days by the 2080s, Defra said. That
would reduce the need for heating in buildings and increase the
demand for air conditioning.  Premature deaths in cold weather that currently range from
26,000 to 57,000 a year in the U.K. may decline to 3,900 to
24,000 by the 2050s. An additional 580 to 5,900 people may die
in heat waves by then, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
