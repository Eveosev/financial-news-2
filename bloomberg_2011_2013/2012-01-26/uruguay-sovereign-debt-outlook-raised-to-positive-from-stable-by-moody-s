Uruguay ’s credit-rating outlook was
raised to positive by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited the
government’s commitment to keeping its  budget deficit  in check.  Moody’s raised the South American country’s outlook from
stable today, 13 months after lifting the rating to Ba1, or one
level below investment grade.  “A steady improvement in Uruguay’s sovereign credit
profile as a result of a strong and continued commitment by the
government to fiscal discipline, a condition that has led to
moderate deficits and declining debt metrics,” wrote  Mauro Leos , a Latin America sovereign credit analyst for Moody’s
Investors Service, in a report.  Yields on government dollar bonds due in 2022 fell 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.94 percent as of 2:53
p.m. New York time, and the extra yield investors demand to hold
Uruguayan bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 3 basis points
to 210. That’s less than some investment-grade countries
including Peru,  Russia , and Poland.  The Uruguayan government reduced its debt by extending
average maturities and decreasing the share of foreign currency-
denominated debt, according to the report.  Moody’s lowered Uruguay’s rating to Ba2, two levels below
investment grade, in 2002 as neighboring Argentina struggled in
the aftermath of its record default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
