Treasuries and commodities rose for
a second day after the Federal Reserve yesterday pledged to keep
 interest rates  low and said it is considering more bond
purchases. U.S. stocks retreated from a six-month high, while
 Europe ’s benchmark equity index entered a  bull market .  Ten-year Treasury yields slid six basis points to 1.94
percent at 4 p.m. in New York after decreasing the most in two
weeks yesterday. Nickel and copper climbed at least 2.5 percent
to lead gains in 19 of 24 materials in the S&P GSCI Index. The
dollar weakened against 13 of 16 major peers. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.6 percent to 1,318.45. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index added 1.1 percent, extending its rebound from
last year’s low to 20 percent, while Italy’s 10-year yields
dropped to a seven-week low.  The Fed said yesterday it plans to keep interest rates low
through at least late 2014 and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
policy makers are considering more bond purchases to boost
growth. U.S. equities turned lower after new-home sales
unexpectedly decreased, erasing gains triggered after earnings
and orders for durable goods topped forecasts and initial
jobless claims remained below 400,000.  “You’ve got the Fed saying: don’t worry about us raising
rates,” Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort
Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees $40
billion, said in a phone interview. “The risks are still out
there, but the evidence doesn’t suggest that it’s bad as people
thought. There’s a revaluation going on.”  Record Low  Five-year Treasury yields touched a record low of 0.75
percent. A third, fourth and fifth round of quantitative easing
by the Fed “lie ahead,”  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in
a Twitter post.  Treasuries also gained as a $29 billion auction of seven-
year securities at a record low yield of 1.359 percent, compared
with a forecast of 1.346 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The previous all-time low
auction yield was 1.415 percent in November. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of debt offered, was 2.73, versus an average of 2.82 for
the past 10 auctions. The Fed yesterday said bond buying is “an
option that’s certainly on the table.”  ‘Free Pass’  “Bernanke gave people a free pass to buy the belly of the
curve,” said Dan Mulholland, a Treasury trader in  New York  at
RBC Capital Markets LLC, one of the 21 primary dealers required
to bid at government debt auctions. He was referring to
Treasuries maturing in the medium term. “Yesterday’s Fed
announcement caught the market off guard.”  Benchmark gauges of corporate credit risk in the U.S. and
Europe fell to the lowest in more than five months. The Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 0.8 basis point to a mid-
price of 101.13 basis points, according to Markit Group Ltd. In
 London , the Markit iTraxx Europe Index fell 6.5 basis points to
143.2, the lowest since Aug. 17.  The dollar declined the most against the Brazilian real and
South African rand, losing more than 0.7 percent against each.
It touched the lowest level since September versus the Mexican
peso. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying the peso and
the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. currency, saying the Fed’s
pledge to keep rates low reaffirms a dollar “weakening trend.”  Copper increased 1.9 percent to $3.9015 a pound in New
York, a four-month high, while oil added 0.3 percent to $99.70 a
barrel.  Retreat From Six-Month High  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  slipped 22.33 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,734.63 after climbing above its highest
closing level since  May 2008  in the first hour of the session.   The  S&P 500  retreated from a six-month high as banks led
losses among 24 industries, falling 3.3 percent as a group, amid
concern prolonged record-low interest rates will weigh on
lending profits.  Wells Fargo & Co.  and Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. paced declines with losses of more than 2 percent.  NVR Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. helped lead declines in an
S&P index of homebuilders, dropping at least 5 percent.
Purchases of single-family properties decreased 2.2 percent
in December from the prior month to a 307,000 annual pace,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today. Builders sold
302,000 homes last year, down 6.2 percent from 2010 and marking
the worst year in data going back to 1963.  Earnings Season  AT&T Inc., the largest U.S. phone company, declined 2.5
percent after predicting 2012 earnings that trailed analysts’
forecasts.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  tumbled 11 percent after the world’s
biggest maker of flash-memory cards gave a sales forecast that
fell short of projections.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, rose 2.1 percent for the biggest gain in the
Dow as earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) 
surged 22 percent after earnings beat analyst estimates as the
online and mail-order video-rental service signed 610,000 U.S.
customers last quarter and forecast improving margins in its
streaming business.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.1 percent as eight
shares advanced for every one that declined. Rio Tinto Group and
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  led a rally in mining companies, advancing
more than 3 percent. Logitech International SA tumbled 12
percent after the world’s biggest maker of computer mice cut
full-year profit and sales forecasts.  Italy ’s 10-year bond yield dropped 18 basis points to 6.05
percent as the government sold 5 billion euros of zero-coupon
and inflation-linked debt maturing in 2014. The nation’s two-
year yield declined 14 basis points, while the similar maturity
Spanish yield slid 23 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
