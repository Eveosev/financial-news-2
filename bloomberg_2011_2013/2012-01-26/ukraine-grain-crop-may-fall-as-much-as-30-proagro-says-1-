Ukraineâ€™s grain harvest may fall by
20 percent to 30 percent this year from a year earlier after
drought damaged winter crops, Kiev-based agriculture researcher
ProAgro said.  The wheat harvest will be about 14 million metric tons in
2012, the researcher said in a statement e-mailed late
yesterday. Ukraine reaped a record 56.7 million ton grain
harvest last year and wheat accounted for 22.3 million tons,
according to National Statistics Office data.  Farmers will have to re-seed about 2 million hectares (4.92
million acres) of winter grain even if the weather is favorable
for the rest of the winter, the researcher said. Re-seeding of
winter rapeseed may reach 300,000 hectares, according to the
statement.  Winter grain losses will be offset by increased planting of
corn, barley, oats and sunflowers, according to ProAgro. Corn
planting may rise by 21.5 percent to 4.4 million hectares and
sunflower seed areas by 14.5 percent to 6.2 million tons, the
researcher said.  Spring barley planting will exceed 2.9 million hectares
compared with 2.6 million hectares in 2011, according to
estimates by ProAgro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
