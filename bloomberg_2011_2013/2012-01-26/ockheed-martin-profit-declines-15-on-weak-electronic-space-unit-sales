Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 15
percent on weak sales in its electronic and space businesses.  Net income from continuing operations fell to $698 million,
or $2.14 a share, from $821 million, or $2.28 a share, a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The average
 estimate  of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit
of $1.95 a share. Sales declined 4.3 percent to $12.2 billion.  Lockheed forecast 2012 full-year profit per share from
continuing operations of $7.70 to $7.90 on sales of $45 billion
to $46 billion. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated profit
of $7.63 a share on revenue of $46.6 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Stevens  is confronting
challenges to the company’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -- its
single largest program -- as the Pentagon extends the plane’s
development phase and plans to delay purchases.  The Defense Department’s 2013 budget will include 13 fewer
F-35 jets than previously planned, U.S. officials said
yesterday. Purchase of as many as 179 planes may be pushed off
beyond 2017, according to the officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity before Defense Secretary Leon Panetta outlines the
budget plans at the Pentagon today.  Proposed Delays  Proposed delays for the jet come even after Panetta
signaled support for the plane last week by lifting a yearlong
probation on the Marine Corps’ F-35 model. The $382 billion jet
program is the costliest weapon system and the U.S. plans to buy
2,443 jets.  Lockheed of Bethesda,  Maryland , fell 51 cents to $81.71
yesterday in New York  trading . The shares have gained 3.4
percent in the 12 months before today.  Sales at three of  Lockheed’s four units  fell during the
quarter, led by a 7.8 percent decline in the Electronics Systems
unit, which makes anti-missile systems and oversees the Navy’s
Littoral Combat Ship program. Sales fell to $3.7 billion because
of fewer deliveries of tactical-missile systems, and profit
declined 12 percent to $431 million, the company said.  Space Systems sales declined 7.4 percent to $2.11 billion,
Lockheed said. Unit profit declined 7.5 percent to $258 million.  Sales at the Information Systems & Global Solutions unit
fell 3.5 percent to $2.55 billion. Profit at the unit, which
provides information-technology services to U.S. agencies
including the Pentagon, rose 28 percent to $254 million.  Revenue at the Aeronautics unit, which makes the F-16, F-22
and F-35 jets as well as C-130J transport planes, increased less
than 1 percent to $3.86 billion because of F-35 work, the
company said. Unit profit 11 percent to $461 million, driven by
higher profits on F-16 jets, the company said.  Sales for 2011 rose 1.8 percent to $46.5 billion from $45.7
billion and per-share profit from continuing operations
increased to $7.85, compared with $7.10 a share in 2010.  Lockheed’s discontinued operations including the Pacific
Architects & Engineers unit that was sold in April 2011 and the
Savi Technologies Inc. unit, which is up for sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
