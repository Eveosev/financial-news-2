AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, predicted 2012 earnings that trailed analysts’
estimates as record demand for smartphones such as the iPhone
drive up subsidy costs. The stock fell.  The carrier projected “mid-single-digit or better earnings
growth” for 2012, according to statement today. Analysts
predicted 11 percent on average. Dallas-based AT&T also reported
a fourth-quarter net loss of $6.68 billion because of a pretax
charge of about $4 billion for the failed takeover of T-Mobile
USA, and expenses for revaluing benefit plans and other assets.  AT&T and main rival  Verizon Wireless  sell  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhones and other smartphones at a loss as they compete to get
 customers  to sign on for two-year service contracts. Activations
of the iPhone soared to 7.6 million last quarter, boosted by the
new 4S model and a previous version that AT&T offered for free
with a contract.  “What’s driving the stock down this morning is the 2012
outlook,” Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst in New York
with a “neutral”  rating  on AT&T stock, said in an interview.
“Overall the fourth-quarter numbers were pretty much in line.”  AT&T fell 2.5 percent to $29.45 at the close in New York,
the most since August. It added 2.9 percent last year, compared
with a 12 percent gain by  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , which
owns Verizon Wireless with  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   Subscriber Growth  AT&T gained 717,000 subscribers on monthly contracts, more
than the 574,000 projected by nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg on average.  James Ratcliffe , a Barclays Capital
analyst, predicted iPhone activations of 6.6 million.  Sales rose 3.6 percent to $32.5 billion, AT&T said.
Analysts  predicted  $32 billion, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The net loss was $1.12 a share, compared
with a profit of $1.09 billion, or 18 cents a share, a year
earlier. Earnings, excluding some items, fell to 42 cents a
share, AT&T said. Analysts predicted 43 cents.  Revenue at the wireless business increased 10 percent to
$16.7 billion, boosted by Web browsing and e-mailing by
smartphone users. Smartphone subsidies helped reduce operating
profit at the unit to 15.2 percent of sales from 22.9 percent.  The average monthly revenue was $63.76 per wireless
contract customer, compared with $63.69 in the third quarter.
Analysts projected $64.16, according to the Bloomberg survey.  The monthly  defection rate , or churn, of wireless contract
customers was 1.21 percent, compared with 1.15 percent in the
third quarter. Analysts predicted 1.2 percent.  Spending Increase?  AT&T withdrew its $39 billion bid for  T-Mobile USA  last
month after authorities said the deal would diminish
competition. The company said at the time it would record the
pretax charge to reflect cash payments and other considerations
due to  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , T-Mobile’s parent.  In the absence of the T-Mobile network, and a year behind
Verizon Wireless in the construction of a higher-speed LTE
network, AT&T may have to increase spending in 2012, Synesael
said.  AT&T said  capital expenditures  will be about $20 billion
this year, little changed from 2011, with an increase in
wireless spending and decline in wireline spending.  Wireline revenue dropped 1.4 percent to $9.3 billion. AT&T
added 208,000 subscribers to its U-verse TV service for a total
of 3.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
