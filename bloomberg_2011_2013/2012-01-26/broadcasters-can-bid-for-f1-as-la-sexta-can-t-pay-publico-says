Spanish broadcasters will be able to
bid for the rights of Formula One racing as La Sexta can’t pay
for them due to declining advertising revenues,  Publico 
reported, citing unidentified people at the commercial
television station.  Mediapro, which owns the rights to broadcast Formula One
races in  Spain  for five years from 2012, has ended the contract
with La Sexta, the newspaper said.  Mediapro has opened a bidding process for broadcasters
interested in the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons, it said,
adding that the deadline to present bids for the free-to-air and
Internet rights is Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
