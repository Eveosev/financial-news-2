Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  dropped to the
lowest in a month after  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , the
world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value, reported
results that were below analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  of Israel Chemicals, which makes fertilizer and
potash from minerals harvested from the  Dead Sea , declined 1.6
percent to 38.80 shekels, at 2:41 p.m in Tel Aviv, the lowest
intraday level since Dec. 22.  Potash reported  fourth-quarter net income of 78 cents a
share, trailing the 87-cent average of 25 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales were $1.87 billion, lagging behind the $2.10
billion average of 12 estimates. Potash also forecast first
quarter profit below analysts’ estimates as distrubotrs delayed
purchases.  Potash Corp. is cutting output from three Canadian potash
mines after demand weakened. Fertilizer distributors and farmers
are delaying potash purchases in anticipation of lower prices
ahead of the U.S. planting season. Potash helps to strengthen
plant roots and defend crops against drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
