German payrolls growth will continue
this year and  unemployment  will decline even as economic growth
cools, according to Unicredit Group.  “Although the pace of  job creation  will soften in coming
months, strong momentum is still in the pipeline,” said  Andreas Rees , chief German economist at Unicredit in Munich. “As a
result, purchasing power of private households will rise further
and bolster consumer expenditures.”  Data next week may show German unemployment fell by 5,000
people in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey,
extending a trend that has seen the number of jobless drop to a
two-decade low. The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2012
growth forecast for  Germany  to 0.3 percent. Still, that compares
with a 0.5 percent contraction projected for the euro area.  Rees also said labor demand may create bottlenecks in the
next few years as the supply of workers dwindles. Labor Minister
Ursula von der Leyen said on Jan. 25 that companies may struggle
to find workers amid a shrinking population.  “Paradoxically, the German labor market’s whopping success
story seems to entail some risks going forward,” Rees said.
“Highly qualified personnel becoming increasingly scarce may
cause companies to move their businesses abroad or lose market
shares instead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
