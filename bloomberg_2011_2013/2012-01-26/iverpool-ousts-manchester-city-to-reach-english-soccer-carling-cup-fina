Record seven-time winner Liverpool
tied  Manchester City  2-2 last night to advance to the final of
the Carling Cup with a 3-2 victory over the two-game series.  The Reds will play Cardiff in the Feb. 26 championship
match at Wembley Stadium, where Liverpool hasn’t played since
1996. Cardiff beat Crystal Palace 3-1 two days ago in a penalty
shootout to reach the final of English soccer’s second-tier cup
competition for the first time.  Steven Gerrard  scored with a 41st-minute penalty kick after
Micah Richards was ruled to have handled the ball and  Craig Bellamy  earned the host the tie on the night with a 74th-minute
goal.  “Craig Bellamy was the difference,” Gerrard told the
British Broadcasting Corp. “His pace is always a threat and
when a chance falls to him we know he can finish it.”  Gerrard’s penalty in Manchester gave Liverpool a 1-0 lead
going into the return match.  Nigel de Jong gave City the lead in the 31th minute and
Edin Dzeko put the visitors ahead again in the 67th minute at
Anfield.  Last year, Birmingham beat Arsenal 2-1 in the final to
secure its first major trophy in 48 years. At the time, Arsenal
was second in the Premier League, while Birmingham was 16th.
Cardiff of the second-tier Championship is the first team from
outside the top division to reach the final since Birmingham
lost on a penalty shootout to Liverpool in 2001.  “Arsenal underestimated Birmingham last year so we need to
show Cardiff respect, show up like we did tonight and I’m sure
we can pick up that trophy,” Gerrard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
