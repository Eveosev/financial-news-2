OPEC will increase shipments through
the middle of February as winter demand in the northern
hemisphere reaches its peak, according to tanker-tracker Oil
Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will  ship 
23.51 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 11, 1.3
percent more than the 23.2 million transported in the period to
Jan. 14, the Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an
e-mailed report. The figures exclude  Angola  and Ecuador.  “February is still the winter as far as the east is
concerned, and as always practically all of the increase is
eastbound,” said Roy Mason, Oil Movements’ founder. Refiners in
 Europe  and the U.S. are importing crude in preparation for their
return from seasonal maintenance in six to eight weeks, he said.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will rise 1.4 percent to 17.65 million
barrels a day in the four-week period, according to the report.  Crude on board tankers will average 471.65 million barrels
in the four weeks, down 0.8 percent from 475.46 million in the
month to Jan. 14, according to the report.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya ,
Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
