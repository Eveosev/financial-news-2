Rhapsody International Inc., the
largest U.S. music-streaming service, bought Napster Inc.’s
businesses in Germany and the U.K. as it seeks to double its
more than 1 million subscribers.  The acquisition, which includes Napster’s subscriber base
in the two countries, “gives us an ideal entry to the European
market,” Rhapsody President Jon Irwin said today in a
statement. The Seattle-based company didn’t disclose a price.  The expansion in  Europe  intensifies competition for London-
based Spotify Ltd., which has about 2.5 million paying users
worldwide. Rhapsody is talking with mobile-phone companies
globally about agreements like the one it has with MetroPCS
Communications Inc., which bundles music with prepaid text and
data plans, Irwin said in December. Closely held Rhapsody, spun
off from  RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK)  in 2010, bought Napster’s U.S.
business from Best Buy Co. last year.  The company will use the Napster brand in Germany and
Britain because it’s widely recognized, it said in the
statement. Napster International employees will keep their jobs.  “Rhapsody has played a pivotal role defining streaming
music services, which are essential to the future of the entire
industry,”  Rob Wells , president of global digital business of
 Universal Music Group , said in the statement.  Rhapsody, started in 2001, charges monthly fees to
subscribers, while some competitors offer free or advertising-
supported services. Napster subscribers in Europe will be moved
to Rhapsody’s infrastructure in March, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
