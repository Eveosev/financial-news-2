Ed Miliband , Britain’s opposition
leader, suggested he’d vote with euroskeptic rebels in Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservatives against increasing U.K.
contributions to the  International Monetary Fund .  “We’ll look at any vote there is on the IMF,” Miliband
told The House Magazine. “The reason we’ve taken the position
we have on the IMF is you can’t have a sticking-plaster solution
to the euro zone’s problems. Seventeen countries of the euro
zone have enough firepower to provide the backing for the euro-
zone countries.”  The comments echo those of Cameron, who said today that
Germany and the  European Central Bank  should do more to end the
debt crisis affecting Europe. Without Labour’s support, Cameron
may fail to muster a majority in Parliament to back any
international agreement to approve giving the Washington-based
lender more resources.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said on Jan. 16
he will seek parliamentary approval to expand the resources of
the IMF if it puts forward a convincing case for more money. The
U.K. says the IMF’s role is to support countries not currencies.  Miliband said in the interview that the ECB rather than the
IMF should act as the main backstop for the euro. Labour voted
in July against increasing the U.K. contribution to the IMF.  In October, Cameron overcame the largest ever Conservative
Party rebellion over the European Union as a quarter of his
lawmakers voted in favor of a referendum on British membership
of the bloc. Some Tory lawmakers say they want Britain to leave
the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
