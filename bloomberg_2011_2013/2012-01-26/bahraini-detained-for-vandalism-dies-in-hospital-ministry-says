A Bahraini man detained late
yesterday on vandalism charges died in a hospital, the Interior
Ministry said today on its account on Twitter Inc.  The ministry didn’t give details of the circumstances of
his death or identify him. The opposition al-Wefaq group said in
a statement that the 19-year-old detainee was run over by a
police patrol in Sitra.  Tensions in the island nation persist almost a year after
the resurgence of protests led by members of the Shiite Muslim
majority demanding a more representative government and greater
rights from the country’s  Sunni Muslim  rulers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
