Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television provider, gained the most since
April 2009 after reporting quarterly profit that beat analysts’
estimates and announcing a $4 billion share buyback plan.  The company advanced 7.8 percent to $74.51 at the close in
 New York  after it reported a 44 percent jump in fourth-quarter
profit. The share gain was the biggest one-day increase since
April 29, 2009.  Time Warner Cable’s strategy to rebrand itself as a
broadband provider paid off with a better-than-estimated gain in
high-speed data customers, making up for the loss of video
subscribers. The buyback was “unexpectedly” large and the
timing of a new authorization was surprising, said  Marci Ryvicker , an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.  “The $4 billion reload certainly gives comfort that Time
Warner Cable is continuing on an aggressive capital return
pace,” said  James Ratcliffe , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
New York.  Net income rose to $564 million from $392 million a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding one-time items, earnings per share climbed to $1.39
from 99 cents, exceeding the $1.20 average of analysts’
estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  Embracing Broadband  Fourth-quarter high-speed data customers increased by
130,000, compared with the 96,000 average estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Time Warner Cable chief
operating officer Rob Marcus said during the conference call.
Internet connects were up in each month in the quarter over the
comparable month in 2010, the company said.  Time Warner Cable is setting itself up as a broadband
company, rather than a cable-TV business, to attract  Internet
users  and make up for losses of video subscribers. Chief
Strategy Officer Peter Stern said Time Warner Cable was
“basically a broadband provider” and provided video service
“as a convenience for our customers” around  Internet service 
during a Nov. 17 conference.  “Broadband was a real success story in the fourth
quarter,” Marcus said on the call.  Time Warner Cable lost 129,000 video  subscribers  in the
quarter. Overall customer additions in the first few weeks of
2012 have been better than the same period a year ago, Marcus
said.  Fourth quarter sales rose 4 percent to $4.99 billion,
compared with the average estimate of $4.97 billion.  Time Warner Cable Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves
said the company’s 2012 earnings per share would be between
$5.25 and $5.50, below analysts’ estimates of $5.53. Programming
costs per subscriber will increase 8 to 9 percent in 2012 and
operating income will grow in the “high single” digits,
Esteves said.  Time Warner Cable boosted its quarterly dividend 17 percent
to 56 cents per share. Ratcliffe estimates Time Warner Cable
will buy back $2 billion of the authorized $4 billion in 2012.
The company declined to forecast the pacing of buybacks for this
year. An existing $4 billion plan is about 80 percent complete.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable operator, is
scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Sherman in New York
