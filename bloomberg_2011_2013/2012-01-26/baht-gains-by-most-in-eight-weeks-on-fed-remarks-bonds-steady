Thailand’s baht advanced by the most
in eight weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it would
keep borrowing costs low until late 2014, bolstering sentiment
toward higher-yielding assets.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency snapped a two-day drop and the  MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday the Fed is also considering additional asset
purchases to boost growth in the world’s largest economy.  The
Dollar Index (DXY) , a gauge of the greenback’s value against six major
currencies, fell 0.5 percent yesterday.  “The baht is benefitting from the Fed-inspired risk
rally,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of
Singapore Ltd. The Fed’s comments are “a big boost for risky
assets and a drag for the broad dollar trend,” he said.  The baht strengthened 0.7 percent, the most since Dec. 1,
to 31.38 per dollar at 7:59 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bank of  Thailand  cut its one-day bond repurchase rate
by a quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent yesterday, a
decision predicted by all 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
That is still 12 times the upper end of the range for the Fed’s
benchmark rate.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017
was little changed at 3.08 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.91 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
