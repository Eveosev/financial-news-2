Argentina  will extend the list of
goods that require a government permit to be imported and will
raise  import  taxes for 100 products to 35 percent from 20
percent, newspaper Ambito Financiero reported.  The measures aim to defend local production from an
increase in imports from  China  caused by the global crisis, the
newspaper said, without specifying where it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
