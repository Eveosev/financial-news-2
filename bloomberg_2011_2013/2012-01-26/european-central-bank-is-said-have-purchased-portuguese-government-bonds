The European Central bought
Portuguese government bonds today, according to three people
with knowledge of the transactions, who declined to be
identified because the deals are confidential.  A spokesman for the central bank in  Frankfurt  declined to
comment when contacted by phone today.  Portuguese 10-year  bonds  pared a drop. The yield was 31
basis points higher at 14.91 percent at 12:04 p.m. London time
after earlier jumping as much as 47 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
