French  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly climbed from its lowest in almost three years,
suggesting  Europe ’s second-largest economy may be stabilizing
amid predictions of a recession.  A  measure of sentiment  rose to 81 in January from 80 in
December, national statistics office Insee in Paris said today.
Economists expected a reading of 80, according to 13 forecasts
gathered by Bloomberg News.  The increase is a sign that while France may have entered a
recession, the slump is unlikely to deepen. By cutting interest
rates twice since October and offering banks unlimited loans for
three years, the European Central Bank’s stimulus may be
starting to seep through to businesses, providing financing and
boosting confidence, economists said.  The French economy is probably already in recession, with
output shrinking in the last quarter and the current one, Insee
said last month. Business confidence dropped to the lowest in
almost two years this month as President  Nicolas Sarkozy  looks
for ways to cut labor costs and reduce France’s budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
