South Korea ’s won climbed to its
strongest level in more than two months after the Federal
Reserve’s forecast that it will keep  interest rates  low until
late 2014 weakened the dollar.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed is considering
additional asset purchases to boost growth yesterday after a
Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington.  Government
bonds  were little changed after a central bank report showed
Korea’s economy expanded 0.4 percent in the final three months
of 2011 from the third quarter, slower than the 0.5 percent
median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The global weakness of the dollar gave an early boost to
Asian currencies including the won,” said Kim Sung Soon, chief
currency dealer at state-run Industrial Bank of  Korea . “Risk-on
sentiment continues as people didn’t read too much from the
announcement of an economic slowdown in Korea. Growth isn’t
slowing enough to shake confidence.”  The won advanced 0.4 percent to close at 1,121.82 per
dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
strengthened to 1,120.43, the highest level since Nov. 14.
Global funds bought more local shares than they sold for an 11th
straight day, according to  exchange data .  From a year earlier, the economy grew 3.4 percent, after a
3.5 percent gain in the third quarter, today’s report showed.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due
September 2016 held steady at 3.53 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
