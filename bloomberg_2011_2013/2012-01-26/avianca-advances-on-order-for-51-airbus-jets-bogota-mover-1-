Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA) , the owner
of  Colombia ’s largest airline, rose to a two-month high after it
agreed to purchase 51 jets made by Airbus SAS as part of an
effort to expand in  Latin America .  Avianca shares rose 0.7 percent to 3,800 pesos at 4 p.m.
Bogota time, the highest level since Nov. 18.  “This is a concrete deal, a solid order,” said Jorge Zuniga, an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage. “It’s a positive for the company because it shows
the purchasing process is moving forward.”  The purchase includes 33 A320neo planes, the largest single
order of such jets in the region, according to an Avianca Taca
filing today with Colombia’s securities regulator.  Avianca Taca has gained 17 percent this year, the best
performance among stocks excluding Canadian  oil companies  on
Colombia’s benchmark IGBC Index.  Airbus, a unit of the European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Co., is the world’s largest commercial planemaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
