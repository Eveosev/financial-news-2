     Jan. 26 (Bloomberg) --The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.4 percent to 664.43 at 5:01 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials climbed
0.5 percent to 1,606.053.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for a second day in  New York  on speculation that
 Federal Reserve  plans to keep U.S. interest rates near a record-
low will bolster economic growth and stoke fuel demand in the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  Crude for March delivery rose as much as 84 cents to
$100.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at
$99.82 at 3:56 p.m. Singapore time. The contract closed 45 cents
higher at $99.40 yesterday. Prices are up 14 percent in the past
year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas climbed for a fifth day in New York, the
longest winning streak in more than a year, on speculation a
glut of the heating fuel may ease.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  swaps for February rebounded $7, or 1
percent, to $712.25 a metric ton at 11 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s
the highest since Aug. 4, 2008.  Fuel oil surged 81 cents to 91 cents a barrel above Asian
marker Dubai crude, PVM data showed. Yesterday, the residual
product rose to a premium for the first time in Bloomberg
records going back to August 2006. Refiners typically accept a
loss from producing fuel oil because of profits from making
distillates and gasoline.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude increased
58 cents to $18.13 a barrel, according to PVM. This crack
spread, a measure of processing profit, widened for a second
day.  February gasoil swaps rose 85 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$126.80 a barrel, PVM said. Jet fuel fell 5 cents to 15 cents
below gasoil. A negative regrade indicates it is unprofitable to
make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures,
also known as the crack spread, increased $3.35 to $119.54 a
ton, PVM data show.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,709.52

time on the LME. Inventories of the metal in warehouses
