Banco Sabadell SA (SAB)  will anticipate a
government order to banks to clean up real estate on their
balance sheets by completing the job this year, Chairman Josep Oliu said.  “We have in our plan to do it all in 2012,” Oliu said in
a news conference in Barcelona today. “I don’t know if they’re
going to give us two, three or four years, but to be sure our
plan is to do it in one year.”  Spain’s government is pushing banks to recognize losses on
real estate assets amid a property-market crash, while coaxing
stronger lenders into mergers with weaker companies. Sabadell
said in December it would buy Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo,
a failed lender seized by the Bank of  Spain , for 1 euro in a
deal financed and guaranteed by other commercial lenders. The
merger will create the country’s fifth-largest bank.  Sabadell has 7.8 billion euros ($10.3 billion) of what it
terms “potentially problematic” assets linked to real estate
on its books with provisions set aside to cover 36 percent of
that amount, the bank said today in an earnings presentation.
The number includes 4 billion euros of foreclosed or acquired
real estate and 1.16 billion euros to cover those assets,
Sabadell said.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has pledged to enforce
a cleanup of the balance sheets of the country’s banks and also
wants more of them to merge to cut capacity in Spain’s financial
system. Banco Espanol de Credito SA, a Spanish retail banking
unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , posted a 173.3 million-euro fourth-
quarter loss on Jan. 12 after taking a 280 million-euro charge
for souring real estate.  Net Income Declines  Sabadell said today fourth-quarter net income fell 38
percent from a year earlier as it booked more charges to cover
the declining value of real estate.  Profit dropped to 24.47 million euros, the bank said in a
filing to regulators. Earnings compared with the average 21.97
million-euro  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  Bad loans as a proportion of total loans climbed to 5.95
percent in December from 5.72 percent in September, the bank
said in the filing to regulators.  Provisioning costs for bad loans and assets rose to 281.6
million euros from 154.2 million euros a year earlier. Of that,
106 million euros was for real estate, up from 41.2 million in
the third quarter, and 32 million euros was for its stake in
Banco Comercial Portugues SA, a Portuguese lender.  Net interest income rose 15 percent to 384.1 million euros
from 332.8 million euros in the same period a year earlier,
Sabadell said. Gross lending increased by 0.8 percent from a
year earlier as deposits rose 6.1 percent.  Sabadell  shares  fell 0.1 percent to 2.93 euros at 12:17
p.m. in  Madrid , valuing the bank at 4.73 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
