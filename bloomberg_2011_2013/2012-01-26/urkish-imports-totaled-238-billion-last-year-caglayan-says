Turkish imports totaled $238 billion
last year, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said, raising the
possibility of a narrower  trade gap  in December.  Imports in the first 11 months of the year were $220
billion, the Ankara-based state statistics agency said on Dec.
30. It will announce official December figures on Jan. 31.  If Caglayan’s figure is right, it means “monthly imports
in December were not more than $18 billion, which will bring the
monthly foreign trade deficit to around $5.5 billion in December
compared to the market consensus and our estimate of $8.5
billion,”  Ozgur Altug , chief economist for BGC Partners in
Istanbul, said today in an e-mailed comment. That would “signal
a faster-than-expected improvement in the current-account
deficit.”  The  current-account gap  is improving and authorities are
still “battling” to reduce it further, Deputy Prime Minister
Ali Babacan said in televised comments today from Davos,
 Switzerland . The cumulative deficit in the 12 months through
November was $77.8 billion, or about 10 percent of gross
domestic product.  Concern about  Turkey ’s ability to finance the gap helped
drive the lira 18 percent lower against the dollar last year,
the biggest depreciation among emerging-market currencies
