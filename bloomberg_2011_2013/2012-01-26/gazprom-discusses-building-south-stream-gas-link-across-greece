OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s natural-gas deliveries
to Greece are exceeding contracted levels after cold weather
hindered supplies through Turkey, the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Russia’s gas-export monopoly increased daily supplies to
the southern European nation by more than 2 million cubic meters
starting Jan. 20. It supplied 2.9 billion cubic meters of the
fuel to Greece last year.  “Gazprom has more than once responded to urgent requests
from partners by increasing supplies above daily contracted
volumes,” Sergei Kupriyanov, a company spokesman, said in the
statement.  Gazprom may build the South Stream  gas pipeline  across
Greece, the company said in a separate statement after Chief
Executive Officer Alexey Miller met with Antonis Samaras, the
head of  Greece ’s New Democracy party, in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
