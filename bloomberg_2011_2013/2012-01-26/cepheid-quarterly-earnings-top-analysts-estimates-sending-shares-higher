Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) , maker of a rapid test
for the drug-resistant staph infection known as MRSA, surged 22
percent in early trading after the company yesterday reported
fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Cepheid rose $7.68 to $42.03 at 8:32 a.m. New York time.
Earnings excluding one-time items of 14 cents a share beat by 10
cents the average of 12  analysts’  estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue jumped 36 percent to $80.1 million, on demand for
its Xpert tests, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said in
a statement yesterday. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, or MRSA, is primarily a hospital-acquired infection that
sickens about 90,000 Americans annually, killing about 15,000,
according to the Atlanta-based U.S.  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention .  “We’ve increased our sales forecast following Cepheid’s
strong fourth-quarter sales result,” wrote  Dan Leonard , an
analyst for Leerink Swann, in a note to investors today. He
raised his 2012 and 2013 sales outlook after Cepheid’s hospital-
acquired infections market beat his estimates in the fourth
quarter, he wrote.  Cepheid had a net loss of $1.6 million, or 3 cents a share,
reflecting a one-time charge associated with the end of a patent
license, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or 2 cents, a
year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
