U.S. defense contractors are turning
to buyers abroad in an effort to sustain sales and profit as the
Pentagon faces as much as $1 trillion in budget cuts over 10
years.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , Boeing Co., and Raytheon Co., which
announced their fourth-quarter financial results this week, told
investors that export sales may make up for declining U.S.
spending on weapons and technology.  “We foresee significant upside potential in international
markets, which we expect will generate 25 percent to 30 percent
of revenues within just a few years and offer an opportunity to
offset domestic reductions,” Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chairman
and chief executive officer, told investors on a conference call
Jan. 25.  Overseas sales now account for 24 percent of defense
revenue for Chicago-based Boeing, the world’s biggest aerospace
company, according to company spokesman Daniel Beck. Defense
sales accounted for 46.5 percent of Boeing’s 2011 revenue of
$68.7 billion.  Defense suppliers are looking to piggyback on President
Barack Obama’s strategy of realigning forces toward the Asia-
Pacific region and strengthen partnerships with friendly nations
there as the U.S. draws down in Iraq and  Afghanistan . Tensions
in the  Middle East  over Iran’s nuclear ambitions may lead
nations in that region to bolster their arms.  “You’re seeing softness here domestically on defense
spending, and that’s likely to continue,”  Peter Arment , a
defense equities analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., in New
York said in an interview. “But you have a threat environment
globally that supports continued military sales.”  Panetta’s Plan  Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  presented an outline
yesterday for $613 billion in spending for fiscal 2013. The
proposal is part of an effort to cut $487 billion, or 8.5
percent, from $5.62 trillion in defense spending that had been
planned for 2012 to 2021. Automatic spending cuts could force an
additional $500 billion in reductions over a decade.  Global demand for U.S. technologies in cybersecurity;
missile defense; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance;
and electronic warfare is strong, Bill Swanson, chairman and CEO
of  Raytheon (RTN) , said on a conference call yesterday with analysts.  For Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon, about 37 percent
of a $35.3 billion backlog came from international customers,
Swanson said. That illustrates the “continued success of our
international strategy,” he said.  Lockheed’s F-35  Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense company, which
has sold more than 4,000 of its F-16 jet fighters around the
world, is attempting to create a similar market for the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter it is developing, even as it faces
challenges on the airplane’s performance in Pentagon testing.  The F-35 is the Pentagon’s biggest weapons program, at an
estimated cost of $382 billion for development and the purchase
of planes. The Defense Department plans to buy 2,443 F-35s.  In December,  Japan  became the latest customer outside the
U.S. to order F-35s.  Lockheed Chairman and CEO Bob Stevens told reporters on a
conference call yesterday that defense budget pressures on the
U.S. “ means more cooperation on shared security objectives”
with allies that are likely to embrace advanced U.S.
technologies.  Countries such as  Iran  and  China  are “investing very
heavily on advanced technologies that include anti-access and
area denial capabilities” that will require the U.S. and its
allies to counter such measures, he said.  Planes, Anti-Missile Systems  Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed are among the U.S. defense
contractors that have sold airplanes, missile defense systems,
and electronic-warfare equipment to countries from the Middle
East to  Asia . The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency
said in December that the U.S. had signed deals valued at $34.8
billion to sell weapons globally.  Shareholders will be looking to see how the companies’
strategies align with the revamped U.S. global military posture,
Roman Schweizer, a Washington-based defense policy analyst at
the investment firm Guggenheim Partners, said in an interview.  Yesterday, Lockheed shares rose 74 cents to $82.47 at the
close in  New York  trading; Raytheon rose 18 cents to $49.89;
General Dynamics fell 6 cents to $71.51; and Boeing declined 51
cents to $75.31.  Announcing quarterly results yesterday, Lockheed said 2012
sales would be $45 billion to $46 billion, generating a profit
per share in the range of $7.70 to $7.90. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expected sales of $46.2 billion and a profit of $7.75
a share.  Forecasts for 2012  Lockheed’s 2012 forecast compares with 2011 sales of $46.5
billion and per-share profit from continuing operations of
$7.85.  Raytheon forecast 2012 profit from continuing operations of
$4.90 to $5.05 a share on sales of $24.5 billion to $25 billion.
It fell short of analysts’ estimate of $5.26 a share and sales
of $25.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Boeing said Jan. 25 that full-year net income will drop to
$4.05 to $4.25 a share, trailing 2011’s $5.34 and the $4.75
average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in 2012 may
rise to $78 billion to $80 billion, up from $68.7 billion and
matching analysts’ projections.  General Dynamics Corp. (GD) , of  Falls Church ,  Virginia , which
announced results Jan. 25, said its full-year profit will be
$7.10 to $7.20 a share, less than the average analysts’
estimates of $7.48 a share. Defense sales may fall about 1
percent to 2 percent in 2012, Chairman and CEO Jay Johnson said
on a conference call with analysts.  “We are doing everything in our control to position our
defense businesses for the declining budget headwind, including
continuous improvement initiatives, restructuring, divesting non
core businesses, and head count reductions,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
