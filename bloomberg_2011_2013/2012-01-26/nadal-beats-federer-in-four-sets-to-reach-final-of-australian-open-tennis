Rafael Nadal  beat  Roger Federer  in
four sets to advance to the Australian Open tennis final for the
first time since winning the title three years ago.  Nadal, the No. 2 seed from Spain, defeated the four-time
champion from Switzerland 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 at
Melbourne Park. He now holds an 8-2 lead over Federer, the
winner of a record 16 major singles championships, in Grand Slam
matches.  Nadal will face top-ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia or Andy
Murray, the No. 4 seed from Britain, for the championship on
Jan. 29 in what will be his fourth straight Grand Slam final.
Djokovic and Murray play their semifinal tomorrow night at Rod
Laver Arena.  Maria Sharapova  of Russia and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus
earlier won the womenâ€™s semifinals to advance to the Jan. 28
title match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
