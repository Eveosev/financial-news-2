Japanese  stocks  declined, snapping a
seven-day winning streak on the  Topix (TPX)  Index, amid speculation
the market is overbought and as European policymakers squabbled
over the mounting cost of a Greek rescue.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for a fifth of its
sales, lost 1.4 percent.  Nippon Electric Glass Co. (5214)  tumbled 6.7
percent after bellwether Corning Inc.’s profit plunged on
falling glass prices. Tokyo Electric Power Co. jumped 5.5
percent on a report the utility plans to take public funds to
avoid bankruptcy.  The Topix, Japan’s broadest equity gauge, fell 0.4 percent
to 764.61 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  slid 0.4 percent to 8,849.47. The gauge has risen 4.7
percent this year. Stocks fell today even after the  Federal
Reserve  extended its pledge to hold its key rate near zero.  “The market is overheated,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“Investors have already priced in both the European debt issues
and the U.S. news.”  The 25-day  Toraku (TORAKU)  index, a momentum indicator, exceeded 120
yesterday, a level that suggests the market may be poised to
fall. The gauge surged 12 percent yesterday to its highest since
July 27.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent
today after the gauge rose 0.9 percent yesterday in  New York 
after the Fed’s announcement and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the central bank is considering another round of bond purchases
to bolster growth.  Debt Relief Debate  In Europe, a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government rejected suggestions that the  European
Central Bank  take losses on its Greek debt holdings after the
 International Monetary Fund  said more public funds were needed
to fight the crisis. Policymakers are continuing to negotiate
with private holders of Greek bonds to avert a default.  Sony lost 1.4 percent to 1,434 yen. Canon Inc., which
depends on Europe for about a third of its sales, slipped 0.7
percent to 3,485 yen.  Glassmakers declined the most in the 33 Topix industry
groups after  Corning (GLW)  reported fourth-quarter profit fell 53
percent as prices for glass used in liquid-crystal displays
tumbled. Nippon Electric Glass tumbled 6.7 percent to 761 yen,
while Asahi Glass Co. slumped 3.6 percent to 671 yen.  Fuji Electric Co. (6504)  declined the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) ,
plunging 7.5 percent to 210 yen, after the device maker slashed
its full-year net income forecast 42 percent to 7 billion yen
($90 million), citing falling sales in China and Europe.  Tepco Surges  Tokyo Electric Power gained the most on the Nikkei 225,
rising 5.5 percent to 213 yen after the Yomiuri newspaper
reported the company will take 1 trillion yen in public funding
to help it survive after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The
Nikkei newspaper reported the utility also known as Tepco
expects to return to profit in three years.  Among other companies that rose, commodity-related stocks
gained.  Toho Zinc. Co. (5707) , a non-ferrous metal producer, climbed
2.9 percent to 322 yen. Mitsubishi Materials Corp., which gets
more than 40 percent of its revenue from copper sales, gained
2.6 percent to 240 yen. JX Holdings Inc., an oil refiner, rose
2.4 percent to 472 yen.  Crude oil for March delivery climbed 0.5 percent to settle
at $99.40 a barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial commodities
including copper and aluminum rose 0.7 percent to its highest
level since Sept. 20. Prices climbed on speculation that
continued low interest rates in the U.S. will boost growth.  Japanese stocks plunged last year after the March 11
earthquake and resulting Fukushima nuclear disaster. The  Topix (TPX) 
tumbled 19 percent in 2011, eclipsing an 11 percent drop on the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
