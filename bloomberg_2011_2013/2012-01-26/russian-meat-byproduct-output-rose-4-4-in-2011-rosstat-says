Russian output of meat and
byproducts rose 4.4 percent to 1.2 million metric tons last
year, the Federal State Statistics Service said.  Beef production dropped 12 percent to 183,000 tons and pork
output gained 10 percent to 812,000 tons, the service, known as
Rosstat, said in a statement today. Output of poultry and
byproducts, tallied separately, increased 8.5 percent to almost
3 million tons.  The national cattle herd rose 0.5 percent to 20.1 million

million cows, up 1.2 percent from a year earlier. Numbers of
other animals rose 0.7 percent to 17.3 million for pigs, gained
2.7 percent to 22.4 million for sheep and goats, and climbed 4.8
