Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest air carrier, reached a pay agreement today with
about 33,000 members of the Ver.di union after making an
improved offer.  Ground staff at the Lufthansa Systems  unit  as well as
employees of Lufthansa Technik and Lufthansa Cargo will receive
a 3.5 percent wage increase backdated to Jan. 1 and effective
for 13 months, Ver.di said in an e-mailed statement. The union’s
negotiators agreed to the deal after Lufthansa increased the
holiday pay contribution offer to 1,075 euros ($1,408),
according to the statement.  “The 3.5 percent wage increase is a good result which puts
more money in employees’ pockets and corresponds to their good
work ethic,”  Christine Behle , a Ver.di board member, said in
the statement.  The deal doesn’t include cabin personnel who are members of
the flight attendants’ union UFO. Talks will continue with cabin
personnel at a later point, Ver.di said. UFO’s contract is valid
through March 31, Lufthansa said in an e-mailed statement.  The wage talks, which started on Jan. 13, came ahead of
cost-saving measures that Lufthansa intends to announce this
quarter. The Cologne, Germany-based carrier has already trimmed
its growth plans this year, cutting capacity growth to 3 percent
from a planned 9 percent, while reducing the number of jets it
operates by six.  To contact the reporter on this story:
