Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi faces a no-confidence vote in parliament that could bring
down the government and undermine his efforts to trim the
deficit and shield the country from fallout from the debt
crisis.  Gonzi, who holds a one-seat majority in the parliament,
told the legislature in Valletta today before the noon vote that
early elections would increase the risk to Malta’s economy.  The motion was presented by Joseph Muscat, leader of the
opposition  Labour Party , after Franco Debono,a member of Gonzi’s
ruling coalition, threatened to withdraw  his support for the
government. The 38-year-old lawmaker has criticized Gonzi for
failing to implement constitutional reforms, including an
overhaul of party financing rules, and has called for Gonzi’s
resignation.  Debono may abstain in the vote, granting Gonzi’s government
a lifeline, newspapers including the Times of Malta have
reported.  Earlier this month, Gonzi said the government will impose
as much as 40 million euros ($51 million) in cuts to its 2012
budget as it bows to pressure from the European Commission to do
more to meet its goal of reducing the deficit to 2.8 percent of
gross domestic product this year. The cuts may reach as much as
0.6 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
