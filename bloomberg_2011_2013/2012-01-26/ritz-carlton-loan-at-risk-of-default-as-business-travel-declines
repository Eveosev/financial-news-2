A $170.6 million loan backed by four
Ritz-Carlton hotels in  New York  and Washington may be at risk of
default as a drop in business travel to the luxury properties
cut into their owners’ ability to pay the debt.  The loan was put on the watch list of master servicer  Wells
Fargo (WFC)  Bank Minnesota this month, Morningstar Inc. said.  “We consider this loan a moderate to high risk,” Horsham,
Pennsylvania-based Morningstar’s structured credit ratings
division said in a report. Reasons include the properties’
“inability to generate sufficient net  cash flow , the weak
outlook for the lodging sector and the forecasted decreases in
revenue per available room,” Morningstar said.  While two of the properties had positive net cash flow as
of June 30, the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park in Manhattan and the
Ritz-Carlton in Washington’s Georgetown area had negative cash
flow. The hotels were built or renovated from 2000 to 2003 for
$820 million, or $673,235 per room, Morningstar said.  The borrowers include Millennium Partners, ERGO
Versicherungsgruppe AG and Provinzial Rheinland
Lebensversicherung AG, according to Morningstar.  Marriott
International Inc. (MAR)  owns the Ritz-Carlton brand.  Christoph Hartmann, a spokesman for Provinzial, and
Alexandra Klemme, an Ergo spokeswoman, declined to comment. A
message left on Millennium Partners’ voice mail wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
