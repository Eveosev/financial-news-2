Apax Partners LLP plans to raise
1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion) of loans and bonds for
its leveraged buyout of  France Telecom  SA’s Orange  Switzerland 
mobile-phone unit, said two people with knowledge of the deal.  The financing includes 225 million francs of term loan A,
400 million francs of term loan B, 100 million francs of
revolving credit and 125 million francs of credit facility for
capital expenditure, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the deal is private.  Orange Switzerland will also sell 325 million francs of
senior secured bonds and 225 million francs of senior unsecured
notes, the people said.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are arranging
the financing, said the people.  Ben Harding , a spokesman for Apax in  London , hadn’t
responded to e-mail and phone messages seeking comment.  Apax agreed to buy Orange Switzerland for 1.6 billion euros
($2.1 billion), France Telecom said in a statement Dec. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
