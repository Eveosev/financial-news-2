Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said today that she doesn’t plan to stay in her post if
President Barack Obama wins a second term.  “I’ve made it clear that I will certainly stay on until
the president nominates someone and that transition can occur,”
Clinton told State Department employees during a town-hall
meeting. “But I think after 20 years -- and it will be 20 years
-- of being on the high wire of American politics and all of the
challenges that come with that, it would probably be a good idea
to find out how tired I am.”  Clinton became first lady when her husband,  Bill Clinton ,
was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, 1993. She was elected
to the  U.S. Senate  from  New York  in November 2000 and was sworn
in as the 67th secretary of state on Jan. 21, 2009.  Separately, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, the
last member of the Obama administration’s original economic
team, said yesterday that he doesn’t expect to remain in his job
if the president is re-elected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
