About one third of New York City
residents nearing  retirement age  won’t be able to quit or will
have to rely entirely on Social Security because they have less
than $10,000 in savings, according to a  study  released today.  About 40 percent of New York workers had access to an
employer-sponsored  retirement plan  in 2009, compared with the
national average of 53 percent, according to the report by the
New School’s Bernard Schwartz Center for Economic Policy
Analysis. It was released by the Office of New York City
Comptroller  John Liu .  “It’s going to mean a generation of retirees will do worse
than their parents and grandparents,” Teresa Ghilarducci, the
center’s director, said in a telephone interview. “This means a
lot more downward mobility.”  About 36 percent of households near retirement had less
than $10,000 in liquid assets and about 19 percent had $10,000
to $99,999, according to the report. The median net worth of New
York households where the head is nearing retirement, defined as
age 55 to 64, was $442,450 including  home equity , for married
couples. It was $46,000 for single people.  “We have a large proportion of people who are nearing
retirement, but without enough money to live comfortably,” Liu
said in a telephone interview. For those households with less
than $10,000, “that gives you probably a movie every couple of
months,” said Ghilarducci.  The top 1 percent of New York taxpayers earned an average
of $2.2 million in 2009, according to a Dec. 6  letter  by the
city’s Independent Budget Office. There were almost 35,000
taxpayers in that group.  Retirement Assets  Total retirement assets in the U.S. were $17 trillion in
September, according to the Washington-based  Investment Company
Institute , a trade group for the mutual-fund industry. That
included about $4.2 trillion in government-sponsored pension
plans and $2.3 trillion in private-sector defined-benefit plans.  The study from the Comptroller’s Office included data from
2001 and 2010 surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau and the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics , in addition to data from a 2008
nationwide survey on income levels and 2009 New York State
income-tax returns, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
