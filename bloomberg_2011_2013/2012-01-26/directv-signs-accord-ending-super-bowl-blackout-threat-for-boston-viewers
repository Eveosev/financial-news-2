DirecTV (DTV)  reached an agreement with
Sunbeam Television Corp., restoring subscriber access to two
stations in Boston and one in Miami and ensuring that viewers in
Massachusetts will be able to see the  Super Bowl .  The accord was reached with Miami-based Sunbeam Television
following a fee dispute that blocked out broadcasts this month,
El Segundo, California-based DirecTV, the biggest U.S.
satellite-TV service, said yesterday in a statement.  DirecTV subscribers in Boston now will be able to watch the
 New England Patriots  take on the New York Giants in the National
Football League’s championship game, broadcast by NBC on Feb. 5.
U.S. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked both
sides on Jan. 24 to end the dispute that would have prevented
200,000 subscribers from watching the game.  “We are pleased to have reached an agreement to end the
Sunbeam blackout, and regret that any of our customers were
forced into the middle of a business dispute where they should
never have been in the first place,” DirecTV said.  DirecTV gained less than 1 percent to $44.54 yesterday at
the New York close. The  shares  climbed 7.1 percent in 2011.  “We appreciate our viewers’ patience during this tough
negotiation,” Chris Wayland, general manager of WHDH-TV Channel
7 and WLVI-TV Channel 56, said in a  statement  on the stations’
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
