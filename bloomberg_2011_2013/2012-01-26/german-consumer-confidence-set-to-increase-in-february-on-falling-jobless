German  consumer confidence  will
increase in February as falling unemployment boosts the economic
outlook and households’ willingness to spend even as  Europe ’s
debt crisis remains unresolved,  GfK SE (GFK)  said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will rise to 5.9 from revised 5.7 this month.
Economists predicted it would remain unchanged from the initial
January reading of 5.6, according to the median of 26 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Unemployment in Europe’s largest economy is at a two-decade
low of 6.8 percent, supporting consumer spending and helping to
limit the impact of the euro-region turmoil.  Business confidence 
jumped to the highest in six months in January and the
 International Monetary Fund  said Jan. 24 the economy will
weather a recession in the euro region and keep growing.  “German consumers are defying Europe’s recession trends,”
GfK said in a statement. “To ensure  consumer spending  can
support the economy in the face of a weaker global economy,” it
is “vital that decision makers do everything needed to re-
establish trust.”  GfK’s gauge of economic optimism surged to 7.5 in January
from minus 0.9 in December, and an index of income expectations
increased to 34.1 from 34. A measure of consumers’ willingness
to spend rose to 41.8 from 27.4.  Germany ’s statistics office said Jan. 11 that the economy
probably shrank about 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter. Growth
slowed to 3 percent in 2011 from 3.7 percent in 2010, which was
the most since German reunification two decades ago.  The country’s economic upswing has only come to “a
temporary halt,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on
Jan. 23. While growth may stagnate in the first three months of
2012, “dynamism should return in the course of the year.”  The IMF forecast growth of 0.3 percent in 2012. While
that’s lower than its previous estimate, it compares with a
contraction of 0.5 percent predicted for the euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
