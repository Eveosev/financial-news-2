Iceland’s corporate bankruptcies
rose 60.7 percent last year as the fallout of the island’s 2008
banking crisis continues to take its toll.  A total of 1,578 companies were declared bankrupt by
Icelandic courts from January through December last year,
compared with 982 bankruptcies in 2010, Reykjavik-based
Statistics Iceland said today in a statement on its  website .
Most bankruptcies were in the  construction industry , it said.  At the same time, registrations of new limited-liability
corporations rose 4.5 percent in the period to 1,700, the office
said.  “The huge number of company failures indicates that the
economy is still severely impaired after the crisis,” Ingolfur Bender, an economist at Islandsbanki hf, said in a note to
clients before the data were published. “It also bears witness
to the extensive financial restructuring currently under way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
