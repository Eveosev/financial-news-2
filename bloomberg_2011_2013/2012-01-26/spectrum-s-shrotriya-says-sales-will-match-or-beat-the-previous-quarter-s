Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SPPI) ’s
fourth-quarter sales will match or beat the previous quarter’s
revenue, Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Shrotriya said.  “We will maintain our revenue, the same or better” than
Spectrum’s third-quarter sales of $51 million, Shrotriya said
today in a telephone interview.  Spectrum, of  Irvine , California, declined 6.6 percent to
$14 at 1:49 p.m. New York time in the biggest intraday drop
since Dec. 9. “Rumor and perception” that the company’s
fourth-quarter revenue will fall short of third-quarter sales
may have caused the decline, he said.  The company’s stock has had a “tremendous run” in the
past year, and “we’re not hearing anything that would have us
worry that it’s being derailed,” Reni Benjamin, an analyst with
Rodman & Renshaw in  New York , said today by telephone. The
shares had more than doubled in the year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
