Czech stocks rose the most in almost
two months, led by  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  and Komercni Banka AS,
after the Federal Reserve signaled it will keep rates near-zero
through 2014 to boost the world’s largest economy.  Erste increased 8.6 percent to 441.4 koruna and  Komercni
Banka (KOMB) , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, rose 4.2 percent
to 3,710 koruna at the end of trading in Prague. The  PX (PX)  equity
gauge rose 3.4 percent to 978.1, its biggest one-day rally since
Nov. 30 and the highest close since Sept. 9.  European stocks rose as the Fed comments bolstered investor
confidence that the U.S. recovery will continue and after a
report that Greece’s creditors will make a new offer for a debt-
swap deal. Erste and Raiffeisen Bank International AG yesterday
had their A credit ratings affirmed by  Standard & Poor’s , which
had put them on review for a possible downgrade on Dec. 8.  “After a rating downgrade for Austria and given that
French banks had their ratings lowered recently following the
cut for France, the fact that Erste’s rating was maintained is a
slightly positive surprise,” Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at
Cyrrus AS brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report
to clients today.“We still see the risk of a downgrade as non-
negligible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
