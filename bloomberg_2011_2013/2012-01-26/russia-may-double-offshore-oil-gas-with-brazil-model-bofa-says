Russian offshore oil and natural gas
reserves could more than double in the next 15 years should the
country follow Brazil’s example in attracting foreign investment
and expertise, Bank of America Corp. said.  Russia  could add 6 billion barrels of proved and probable
reserves as well as gain additional revenue and a higher
valuation for its oil and gas companies, the bank said in a
report today.  “We see inaction as the largest risk to developing
offshore reserves in Russia,” Karen Kostanian, head of Emerging
Europe,  Middle East  and Africa Oil and Gas Research at the
bank’s Merrill Lynch unit, said in the report. “We do not
believe that status quo on taxation or one-off  tax  breaks are
enough to attract adequate investment to the industry.”  Russia, the world’s biggest oil  producer  and second-biggest
gas producer, restricts development of fields in its waters to
state companies. The country is considering adjusting the laws
to allow more companies into offshore exploration and form
ventures for field developments.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest
oil producer, last year agreed with Exxon Mobil Corp to develop
fields in the Kara Sea.  Like  Brazil , Russia should allow private companies into
licensing rounds for offshore reserves, form joint ventures with
foreign partners and adopt “a comprehensive, clear and
sustainable” tax regime, Merrill Lynch said.  Most of Russia’s oil and gas production comes from onshore
Siberian deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
