U.S. state tax collections rose 6.1
percent from July to September, the seventh straight quarter of
growth, and now exceed pre-recession levels, according to a
report from the Nelson A.  Rockefeller Institute  of Government.  The increase was relative to the same period of 2010, the
 Albany , New York-based group  said today . Preliminary figures
from 44 states also show revenue growth of 5.2 percent in
October and November compared with the year-earlier period,
signaling the streak may extend into the fourth quarter,
according to the study.  The recovery in revenue, along with Federal Reserve policy
of keeping its benchmark  interest rate  near zero, helped the
$3.7 trillion municipal market in 2011 record its biggest yearly
 rally  since at least 1992.  Yields (BBWK20GO)  on 20-year general-obligation bonds with an average
Moody’s Investors Service rating of Aa2, the third-highest, fell
to 3.6 percent in the week ended Jan. 19, according to a Bond
Buyer index. That’s the lowest since April 1967, when  Lyndon B. Johnson  was president.  While state collections have caught up to levels from
before the 18-month recession that started in December 2007,
revenue is still below the peak, which came several months into
the contraction, the institute said. For fiscal 2011, 36 states
were still below the high-point, the report said.  Revenue Disparity  “In recent months, state tax revenue has risen
significantly while the overall economy has been growing at a
relatively slow pace,” Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at
the Rockefeller Institute, wrote in the report. “Such a
disparity is not sustainable over time.”  The U.S. unemployment  rate  fell to 8.5 percent in December,
from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009. The rate was 5
percent in December 2007, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.  Tax-collection growth in the third quarter was the slowest
since the same period of 2010, the report showed. At the end of
fiscal 2011, collections were 3.5 percent below their peak, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
