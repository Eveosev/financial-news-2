The German government will guarantee
a 39 million euro ($51 million) loan to a Turkish wind developer
that’s buying turbines from  Nordex SE (NDX1)  in an effort to boost
exports.  Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ) , or BayernLB, is providing the loan
to Bilgin Enerji Yatirim Holding AS to buy 20 Nordex turbines
for a wind farm near Izmir, in western Turkey, according to an
e-mailed statement from  Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG (HKV) , the
credit insurer owned by  Allianz SE  that’s handling the state
guarantee.  The guarantee will protect BayernLB against the risk of
default during the loan’s 10-year period, according to Ruth
Bartonek, a spokeswoman at Euler Hermes. The German government
will pay 95 percent of the loan if the Ankara-based developer
defaults, she said.  “The financing of projects during the financial crisis
becomes more difficult, especially for small and medium-sized
companies,” she said today by e-mail.  Germany  and Denmark are among the nations supporting
exports from their renewable-energy industries. Euler Hermes,
based in Hamburg, also insured loans to buy  wind turbines  made
by Germany’s Repower Systems SE for the Thornton Bank wind farm
offshore Belgium.  Eksport Kredit Fonden, a Copenhagen-based lender,
guaranteed loans for equipment for the London Array offshore
plant planned by Danish utility Dong Energy A/S, Germany’s EON
AG and  Abu Dhabi ’s Masdar.  The Zeytineli wind project is expected to be operational by
September 2013, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
