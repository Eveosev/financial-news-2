Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, said first-quarter profit increased 10
percent as consumers bought more specialty beverages during the
holidays.  Net income in the period ended Jan. 1 rose to $382.1
million, or 50 cents a share, from $346.6 million, or 45 cents,
a year earlier, the Seattle-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts  projected  49 cents, the average of 25
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  spent more than a
year planning merchandise and beverages for the holiday season.
Starbucks sought to boost sales with a low-calorie peppermint
mocha that was new this year, along with Via instant coffee and
Keurig brand single-serve capsules.  “It was the most successful holiday season in our
history,” Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said in a
telephone interview. Customers loaded $500 million onto
Starbucks gift cards in December, he said.  Starbucks narrowed its  forecast  for profit excluding
certain items to a range of $1.78 to $1.82 a share for fiscal
2012, compared with a previous projection of $1.75 to $1.82.
Analysts estimated $1.83, on average.  Starbucks fell 1.9 percent to $47.40 at 4:54 p.m. in  New
York  after rising 1.2 percent during regular trading. The  shares 
gained 43 percent last year.  Higher Costs  Along with other restaurants, Starbucks has been forced to
raise menu prices to help recoup higher raw-ingredient costs.
The company has locked in its coffee costs for 2012 and for half
of 2013, Alstead said.  The company’s operating income as a percentage of revenue
narrowed to 16.2 percent in the first quarter from 17 percent a
year earlier because of higher commodity costs, the company said
in the statement.  Sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 9 percent
globally in the quarter. Analysts estimated a gain of 7.6
percent, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Schultz recently has sought to draw more customers by
expanding beyond traditional coffee. Starbucks bought juice
maker Evolution Fresh Inc. in November and earlier this year
began selling so-called blonde coffee -- a lighter blend
compared with its signature dark roast. The company also is
expanding the number of stores where it sells beer and wine.  Revenue advanced 16 percent to $3.44 billion during the
quarter, topping analysts’ average estimate of $3.29 billion.  Starbucks, which has more than 10,700 U.S. cafes and 6,200
abroad, gets more than 20 percent of revenue from international
stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
