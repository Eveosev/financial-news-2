Telekom Slovenije (TLSG)  Group d.d.’s
purchase of units in the Republic of Macedonia,  Kosovo , Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Slovenia failed to adhere to “good practices”
of corporate governance, according to an audit of the deals by a
Slovenian unit of  Deloitte & Touche LLP .  “We believe the company failed to act in accordance with
good corporate practices in the purchase of units in Slovenia
and abroad,” state-owned Telekom Slovenije said in a  statement 
today, citing the audit by the Ljubljana-based Deloitte revizija
d.o.o. The auditor said the company failed in risk management
and estimates 7 million euros ($9.2 million) of damages from the
purchases of units in the Balkans.  The audit report will be discussed at a shareholders
meeting set for March 7, Telekom Slovenije said.  The Slovenian company expanded in the Balkans in recent
years to benefit from increased spending by consumers as
economies in the area of former  Yugoslavia  expanded to catch up
with the Western European standards.  Telekom Slovenije acquired the Macedonian mobile operator
Cosmofon in March 2009 for 185.6 million euros and later renamed
it ONE. Ipko, its mobile-phone and Internet provider unit in
Kosovo, was purchased in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
