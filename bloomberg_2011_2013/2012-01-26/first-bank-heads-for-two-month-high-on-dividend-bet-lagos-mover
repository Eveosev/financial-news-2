First Bank of Nigeria Plc  headed for
a two-month high on speculation the country’s third-biggest
lender by market value will pay a dividend for the year through
December.  The stock gained 4.9 percent, its biggest intraday advance
since Dec. 21, to 9.61 naira as of 1:41 p.m. in Lagos. A close
at this price would be its highest since Nov. 22.  “Investors anticipate that First Bank will be able to pay
a dividend of at least one naira per share for the full year
through December, given that its earnings per share for the nine
months were already above one naira,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., a brokerage, said by phone today. “That means that at the
current price, the dividend yield will be more than 10 percent,
and that means a lot globally.”  Earnings at Nigerian lenders are rising after the west
African nation’s central bank fired eight chief executives of
the country’s 24 lenders and set up a state-owned company to buy
bad debts amassed in 2008 and 2009 and triggered by loans to
equity speculators. Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , as the
company is known, had acquired bad debt worth 3.14 trillion
naira ($20 billion) by Nov. 28, Chief Executive Officer Mustapha
Chike-Obi said then.  First Bank’s net income rose 32 percent to 42.9 billion
naira in the third quarter to September, the lender said in a
statement to the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  on Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
