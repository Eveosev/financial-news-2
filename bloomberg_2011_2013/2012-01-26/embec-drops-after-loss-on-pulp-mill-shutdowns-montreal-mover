Tembec Inc. (TMB) , a Canadian maker of
paper, pulp and wood products, fell the most in six weeks after
its quarterly loss widened more than analysts expected on
unscheduled mill shutdowns.  Tembec fell 6.1 percent to C$3.26 at the close in Toronto,
its biggest intraday decline since Dec. 14.  The company’s net loss in its fiscal first quarter widened
to 16 cents a share, Montreal-based Tembec said today in a
statement. The average of five analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg was a loss of 2 cents. Sales in the period, ended Dec.
24 fell 5 percent to C$401 million ($401.5 million) as specialty
pulp shipments declined, the company said.  “The biggest surprise in the quarter was the unplanned
equipment downtime at two of the company’s specialty pulp
mills,” Kevin Cohen, a New York-based capital-structure analyst
at investment bank Imperial Capital LLC, said today by
telephone. “Specialty pulp is a critical cash flow driver.”  Specialty pulp is used in pharmaceuticals, textiles and
cigarette filters.  Cellulose and chemical pulp is Tembec’s largest unit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also
produces paper and lumber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
