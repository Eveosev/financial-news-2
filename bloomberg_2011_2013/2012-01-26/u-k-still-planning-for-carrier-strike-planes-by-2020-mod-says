The U.K. is continuing to plan for
the delivery of  Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT)  F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter in 2020, defense procurement minister  Peter Luff  said.  The U.K. is among the partner nations in the jet and still
intends to use it on two new aircraft carriers it is building,
Luff said. The  Times newspaper  reported today that the Royal
Navy is considering buying  Dassault Aviation SA’s (AM)  Rafale M
instead because of delays and increased costs, citing a note of
a speech by Admiral Trevor Soar, the fleet commander.  “We continue to plan on delivery of Joint Combat Aircraft
capability coherently with the carrier from 2020 as noted in the
Strategic Defense and Security Review,” Luff said in an e-
mailed statement.  The MoD will take delivery of the first aircraft for test
and evaluation this year and is committed to buying the carrier
variant of the F-35, a defense ministry spokeswoman said in a
telephone interview. The U.K. is confident the U.S. defense
review will not affect the U.K.’s plans, she said.  Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said on Jan. 5 that he was
reassured about the project after meetings at the Pentagon.  “What I’ve heard today is reassuring on that score,”
Hammond said in an interview. “We’ve had a confirmation of an
in-service date for the carrier variant.”  ADS, a trade group promoting U.K. aerospace, defense,
security and space industries that hosted Soar’s speech, posted
a  statement  on its website saying that comments about the
fighter had been incorrectly attributed to the admiral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
