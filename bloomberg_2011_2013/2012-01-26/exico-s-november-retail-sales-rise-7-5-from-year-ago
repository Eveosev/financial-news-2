Mexican  retail sales  rose the most
in November in more than six years on improved domestic demand
and after the country implemented holiday discounts modeled
after Black Friday in the U.S.  Sales rose 7.5 percent from the same month in 2010, beating
14 of 16 forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
figure matched the year-on-year pace of April 2005.  In a bid to boost services and consumer goods, Mexico’s
government sponsored a Nov. 18-21 nationwide sales push that it
called “Buen Fin,” which is Spanish for “good weekend.”
Higher-than-expected sales shows that beyond the discounts,
Mexico’s domestic economy continues to strengthen, said Sergio Martin, a Mexico City-based economist at  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   “Part of this is Buen Fin, but this also reflects a
recovery in the domestic markets,” Martin said by phone.  Martin pointed to strong service industry performance in
November’s global economic indicator, which rose a greater-than-
expected 3.75 percent, and net job creation figures for 2011,
which Mexico reported at over 590,000.  The peso strengthened for a ninth straight trading session,
gaining 0.5 percent to 12.9507 per dollar at 11:46 a.m. Mexico
City time from 13.0190 yesterday. The currency has appreciated
7.6 percent in 2012, the best performance against the dollar
among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg
worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
