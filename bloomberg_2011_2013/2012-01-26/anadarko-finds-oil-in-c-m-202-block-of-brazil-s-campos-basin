Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
independent U.S. producer that plans to sell its assets in
Brazil, found traces of oil at an offshore well in the country’s
most productive basin.  Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, found oil at the
C-M-202 block in Brazil’s  Campos Basin  in 82 meters (269 feet)
of water, according to a  posting  today on the website of
Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency. The discovery hasn’t yet
been declared commercially viable.  Last year Anadarko said it would consider a sale of its
share in Brazilian offshore blocks to help pay off debt. Demand
for Brazilian exploration assets has increased over the past two
years because the government hasn’t sold any new licenses since
2008. On Jan. 6  Sinochem Group  agreed to buy 10 percent stakes
in five deepwater exploration blocks from Perenco SA.  Anadarko has about 1 million gross acres off Brazil’s coast
where it has discovered the Wahoo and Itaipu fields that have a
combined potential of at least 500 million barrels of oil
equivalent, the company has said. Wahoo and Itaipu are also
located in the Campos Basin, where Brazil pumps 84 percent of
its oil.  Anadarko has a data room open and the process is
continuing,  John Christiansen , a company spokesman, said today
in a telephone interview from The Woodlands, Texas.  Anadarko fell 2.2 percent to $79.31 in  New York . The stock
has climbed 3.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
