An Azerbaijan-based housing
developer plans to build the world’s tallest building on a
manmade island in the  Caspian Sea  as part of a $100-billion
project.  Avesta Concern has spent $1 billion on the  Khazar Islands 
after starting construction last year, company President Haci
Ibrahim Nehramli said in an interview in the capital, Baku,
today.  “This is the world’s most expensive project,” he said.  The town will be built 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of
Baku on 50 artificial islands resembling a carpet, Nehramli
said. Six of the islands will be connected with 19 bridges and
will be ready by 2016, he said. Azerbaijan’s government approved
the project in March, he said.  One of the buildings will reach 1,051 meters and would
eclipse the 828-meter Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Construction of the
tower would start in 2015 and cost $2 billion, Nehramli said.  Avesta Concern is in talks with “Arab real estate
developers” that have shown interest in backing the project, he
said.  The plan was reported by the Associated Press yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
