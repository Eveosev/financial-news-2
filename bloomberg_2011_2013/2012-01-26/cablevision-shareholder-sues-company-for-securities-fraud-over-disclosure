A Cablevision Systems Corp.
shareholder sued the company for  securities fraud  claiming it
failed to disclose costs and lost customers.  Gary Livingston, who in 2011 bought 50 shares of the fifth-
largest U.S. cable-television provider by subscribers, sued
today in federal court in  Brooklyn ,  New York . He is seeking to
proceed on behalf of other buyers of the  shares  from February to
October of last year.  The company misrepresented or failed to disclose that it
was experiencing higher retention and advertising costs and that
it was losing more video customers than expected, especially in
the New York area, according to the complaint.  Investors “paid artificially inflated prices for
Cablevision common stock,” according to Livingston’s complaint.  Cablevision was  raised  to “buy” from “market perform”
at Albert Fried & Co. by analyst Richard Tullo on Jan. 20.  “We have not been served with the complaint, let alone had
an opportunity to review the claims, but will certainly defend
against it vigorously,” Kim Kerns, a spokeswoman for Bethpage,
New York-based Cablevision, said in an e-mail.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto.  The case is Livingston v.  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , 12-
cv-377, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
