Public support for  Greece ’s
Socialist Party, led by  George Papandreou , dropped to 12
percent, putting it in fifth place behind other parliamentary
groups, according to a monthly research poll.  Former prime minister Papandreou’s  Pasok  party’s support
dropped 6 percentage points from December, the poll, conducted
by researcher VPRC for  Epikaira  magazine, indicated. Support for
the main opposition  New Democracy  party remained at 30.5
percent. Almost 34 percent of the 801 people surveyed between
Jan. 20 and Jan. 23 said they would abstain from voting in an
election. The margin of error is 3.5 percent.  Ninety two percent of the people of the people surveyed
said they are dissatisfied with the interim government led by
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , while eight out of 10 people
believe the country is going in the wrong direction.  The  Communist Party of Greece  and the Coalition of the
Radical Left, or  Syriza , would each receive 12.5 percent of the
vote if elections were held tomorrow. Both Syriza and the
Communist Party declined to join the interim government.  The nationalist  Laos  party, which is part of the interim
government along with Pasok and  New Democracy , was backed by 6
percent of those questioned.  -- Editors: Chris Peterson, Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
