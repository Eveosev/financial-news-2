Property insurers may face 300
million euros ($390 million) in costs from windstorm Joachim,
which hit northern  France ,  Germany  and  Switzerland  in December,
according to data provider  Perils AG .  “The majority of the losses occurred in France,” Zurich-
based Perils, an  insurance industry  initiative founded in 2009
to aggregate European data on natural-disaster losses, said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The insurance industry’s most expensive storm on record in
 Europe  was winter storm Lothar, which caused $5.9 billion in
insured losses in 1999, according to  estimates  by reinsurer
 Munich Re . Kyrill, which battered countries including the U.K.,
the Netherlands and Germany in January 2007, caused $5.8 billion
in insured losses while Xynthia, which hit western Europe in
February 2010, cost the industry $3.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
