The Virginia Retirement System and
the Canadian province of Alberta will lead a class action, or
group lawsuit, against  Jon Corzine , a judge said.  They are typical of the class of investors who lost money
on MF Global Holdings Ltd. investments, and their combined
losses of $19 million give them a larger stake in the lawsuit
than other applicants, the judge said. The judgeâ€™s order was
signed on Jan. 20 and entered on the docket yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
