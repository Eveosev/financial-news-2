Indonesia ’s rupiah approached the
strongest level in almost three months after global funds raised
holdings of local assets to benefit from the nation’s higher
yields.  Overseas investors bought $414 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold this month through yesterday and were net
purchasers of bonds worth $338 million, according to exchange
and finance ministry data. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the
greenback’s value against six major currencies, fell 0.5 percent
yesterday as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that it will keep
 interest rates  low until late 2014.  “The Fed’s decision has boosted risk appetite,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
Singapore. “The dollar is weak. The rupiah is following the
global trend.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.6 percent to 8,981 per dollar as
of 8:30 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 8,895 earlier and touched
8,875 yesterday, the strongest level since Nov. 1.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.64 percent
yesterday, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The
difference in yields between the nation’s notes due in a decade
and similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries was 365 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
