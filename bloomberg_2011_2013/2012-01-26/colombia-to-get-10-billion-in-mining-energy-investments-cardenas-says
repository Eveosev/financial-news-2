Colombia,  South America ’s third-
largest oil producer, expects about $10 billion in international
investment in crude, mining and energy projects this year, Mines
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said.  The amount is similar to last year’s foreign direct
investment, Cardenas said in an interview today at the World
Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  President  Juan Manuel Santos  has lured companies owned by
billionaires Carlos Slim and Eike Batista to Colombia, where
production of crude rose to a record last year. The nation also
is South America’s largest supplier of coal.  Cardenas has been meeting in Davos with executives from
companies such as  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Glencore International
Plc, and Chile’s state-owned copper company, Codelco, which may
seek to explore for the metal in  Colombia , according to the
minister’s account on Twitter Inc.  Foreign direct investment in Colombian coal mines and
metals and oil projects climbed to $6.5 billion in the first
nine months of 2011 from $3.6 billion a year earlier, according
to the South American country’s  central bank  figures.  Oil production will increase 18 percent to an average of
1.1 million barrels a day in December from a year earlier, while
coal output this year will climb about 14 percent to 97 million
tons, Cardenas said in a Jan. 12 interview.  Colombia is the third-largest crude producer in South
America after Venezuela and  Brazil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
