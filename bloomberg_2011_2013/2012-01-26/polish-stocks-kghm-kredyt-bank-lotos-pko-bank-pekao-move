Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  jumped 52.56,
or 2.3 percent, to 2,305.55 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
the biggest gain in almost two months.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  , Poland’s biggest bank, rose
3.7 percent to 34.95 zloty, the biggest gain since Dec. 5.  Bank
Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, increased
4.6 percent to 156.8 zloty and  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW)  , a unit
of Citigroup Inc., advanced 3.7 percent to 73.1 zloty.  Banks rose in Europe as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
it may keep interest rates low through 2014 and a report said
Greece’s creditors will make a new offer for a debt-swap deal.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, advanced 2.7 percent to 131.9 zloty, the
highest close since Dec. 5, as the price of the metal rose for a
fourth day in New York.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  , the Polish lender owned by KBC
Groep NV, soared 5.8 percent to 10.4 zloty, the biggest daily
gain in more than three months. KBC is close to an agreement to
sell Kredyt Bank, De Tijd reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  of Spain is the most likely
candidate to take over Kredyt Bank, according to the newspaper.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
increased for a ninth day, adding 1.6 percent to 26.04 zloty as
crude oil advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
