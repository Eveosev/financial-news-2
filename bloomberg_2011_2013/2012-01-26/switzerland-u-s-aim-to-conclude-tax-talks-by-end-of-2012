Switzerland  and the United States
aim to conclude talks about off-shore bank accounts by the end
of the year.  “We’ve said that at the end of 2012 we want to end these
negotiations,” Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf
told reporters today in Davos after a meeting with her U.S.
counterpart  Timothy Geithner .  The U.S. is in talks with the Alpine country to resolve a
dispute over offshore  tax evasion  that led to the
indictment of client advisers at Swiss banks. The U.S.  Justice
Department  had set a deadline of Jan. 23 for 11 Swiss banks to
disclose information on all transactions with U.S. customers
since 2000, Neue Zuercher Zeitung reported earlier this month.  “I have expressed that we’ve been in talks for a year,
that we’ve invested a lot of time and energy to propose a fair
solution,” Widmer-Schlumpf said. “Amounts were already
discussed on a technical level. Our aim, and he agreed, is to
find a solution where we won’t be confronted with a question
about the past every year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
