The  United Arab Emirates , the
second-biggest Arab economy, expects gross domestic product to
expand “at least” 4 percent in 2012, Economy Minister Sultan al-Mansouri said.  “Under the circumstances, this is healthy, this is good,”
al-Mansouri said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, where he
is attending the  World Economic Forum .  Asked if the U.A.E., home to 7 percent of the world’s oil
reserves, would boost the resources of the International
Monetary Fund to avert a global slowdown, al-Mansouri said:
“This issue, we are not part of it right now. We have to
address issues in our region, our country.”  To avoid a 1930s-style worldwide depression, IMF Managing
Director Christine Lagarde has called on other countries to
contribute. The IMF, which co-finances loans to Greece, Ireland
and  Portugal , identified a potential global financing need of $1
trillion in coming years and is seeking $500 billion in new
lending resources from its members to address potential loan
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
