U.S. stocks fell, reversing a rally
that sent the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  toward its highest
level since 2008 earlier today, as  banks (S5BANKX)  tumbled and a report
showed that sales of new homes unexpectedly declined.  Banks had the biggest drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index among 24 groups on concern about the industry’s ability to
boost profits after the Federal Reserve yesterday pledged to
keep the benchmark  interest rate  low.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and
Fifth Third Bancorp slumped at least 3 percent.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) 
and  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  retreated more than 2.3 percent to pace losses
in homebuilders.  AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone company, slid
2.5 percent as its profit forecast trailed estimates.  The S&P 500 lost 0.6 percent to 1,318.43 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time, reversing a gain of as much as 0.6 percent. The Dow fell
22.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,734.63, after earlier rising
to the highest level on a closing basis since May 2008.  “It’s a little bit of cold water in the face,” Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief
investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in
Cleveland, said in a telephone interview. “We’re in risk
territory because we’ve come a long way in the market and in
terms of optimism on the economy. It’s premature to think that
we’ve solved all problems.”  The  S&P 500  has risen 4.8 percent so far this year, poised
for the best January since it gained 6.1 percent during the
first month of  1997 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Stocks are extending the measure’s 11 percent rally in the
October-December period, its  best  fourth-quarter increase since
2003, as improvements in hiring, manufacturing and home sales
bolstered confidence in the world’s largest economy.  Economic Data  Equities  reversed  gains today after a report showed that
sales of new U.S. homes unexpectedly declined in December for
the first time in four months, capping the slowest year on
record for builders. Claims for U.S. jobless benefits rose last
week, displaying the usual volatility around holidays that has
masked an improvement in the labor market. Orders for U.S.
 durable goods  advanced more than forecast in December.  Benchmark gauges rose yesterday as the Fed signaled low
rates through at least late 2014 and didn’t rule out bond
purchases to bolster the economy. Investors also watched
earnings reports. Of the 151 S&P 500 companies that reported
results since Jan. 9, 103 posted per-share earnings that  beat 
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A measure of  banks  in the S&P 500 slumped 3.3 percent.
Wells Fargo lost 3.8 percent to $29.05.  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)  slid
3 percent to $13.08.  Fed’s Pledge  The Fed’s low interest rate pledge may hurt lenders’
 profits  as they struggle to find loans or securities with yields
high enough to support their net interest margins, a gauge of
profitability that measures the difference between the cost of
funds and what they earn on assets.  “The statement itself was market friendly in terms of
reiterating that the Fed is going to remain largely
accommodative,”  Ryan Larson , Chicago-based head of U.S. equity
trading at RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc., said in a
telephone interview. His firm oversees $250 billion in assets.
“When you talk about the banking environment and some of these
companies that are directly tied to interest rates, it’s going
to probably put a cap on some of those companies going forward
until rates start to increase.”  A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes slumped 3.4 percent.
PulteGroup retreated 2.4 percent to $7.80. Lennar decreased 2.9
percent to $22.13.  AT&T Slumps  AT&T lost 2.5 percent to $29.45, the biggest decline in the
Dow. The carrier projected “mid-single-digit or better earnings
growth” for 2012. Analysts predicted 11 percent on average.
AT&T also reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $6.68 billion
because of a pretax charge of about $4 billion for the failed
takeover of  T-Mobile USA , and expenses for revaluing benefit
plans and other assets.  E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  tumbled 15 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $7.99 after the online  brokerage  reported results
that missed analyst estimates and Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP
cut its rating.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  dropped 11 percent to $46.39. The biggest
maker of flash-memory cards gave a sales  forecast  that fell
short of estimates, citing lower prices for chips that store
data in mobile phones.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  rallied 2.1 percent, the biggest gain in
the Dow, to $111.31. The largest construction and mining-
equipment maker posted fourth-quarter earnings and forecast
full-year profit that topped analysts’ estimates as demand rose
for shovels and trucks.  3M, Netflix  3M Co. (MMM)  added 1.3 percent to $87.58. The maker of Post-it
Notes and fuel system tuneup kits reported higher profit than
analysts had estimated as demand increased for aerospace and
auto industry products.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  surged 22 percent, the most since January
2010, to $116.01. The online and mail-order video-rental service
reported fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates
and forecast improving margins in its streaming business.  J.C. Penney Co. climbed 19 percent to $40.72 after saying
cost reductions from new Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson’s
turnaround plan may boost 2012 profit more than analysts
estimated.  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  advanced 7.8 percent, the biggest
gain since April 2009, to $74.51. The second-largest U.S. cable-
television provider reported fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and said it would repurchase $4 billion in
shares.  ‘Nightmare’  “The backdrop that is coming forth is a nightmare for
those who are way underinvested,”  Jeffrey Saut , chief
investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates in  St.
Petersburg ,  Florida , said in a phone interview. His firm manages
$300 billion. “Earnings continue to come in better than
expected, our economy is improving. In addition, it looks like
the ‘euro-quake’ situation appears at least in the short term to
be on the backburner.”  European stocks advanced, climbing 20 percent from a
September low and entering a  bull market . The Stoxx Europe 600
Index added 1.1 percent to 257.86 today.  The S&P 500’s best January rally since  1997  has pushed a
pair of momentum and sentiment gauges to levels seen only 6
percent of the time since 1993, a sign the market is due for a
pullback, BTIG LLC said.  Too Far  The benchmark index’s 14-day  relative strength index , which
measures the degree that gains and losses outpace each other,
rose above 70 yesterday for the first time since Feb. 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some technical analysts
consider RSI readings above 70 a sign that stocks have risen too
far, too fast. The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index (VIX) , a gauge known as the VIX, fell below 20 for the first
time since July on Jan. 19.  The last time RSI exceeded 70 while the VIX stayed below
20, 11 months ago, the S&P 500 reached a 32-month high before
dropping 6.4 percent over the next month, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The VIX is the benchmark gauge of S&P 500
options prices.  “We’re definitely in a rare spot,” Josh Dollinger, Chief
quantitative and technical strategist at BTIG in New York, said
in a telephone interview. “These are extreme readings. They
more often than not prove to be exhaustion tops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
