European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  is set to appoint former European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet to its supervisory board as part of a wider
management reshuffle, two people familiar with the plan said.  EADS (EAD)  holds a board meeting today and may decide on the
nomination then, said the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the information is not yet public.
Shareholders will vote on the proposal at the annual general
meeting in May in Amsterdam.  EADS, the Paris- and Munich-based parent company of
aircraft manufacturer Airbus SAS, is nearing a management
overhaul in which Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders is
set to take over from retiring EADS CEO Louis Gallois, while
Arnauld Lagardere will become EADS chairman and Airbus Chief
Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier will succeed Enders at Airbus.  The company, which is partly owned by the French and German
governments, has agreed to alternate nationalities in key
executive positions as the state shareholders seek to guard a
balance of influence. Trichet stepped down from the Frankfurt-
based ECB last year and handed over to  Mario Draghi .  Les Echos  reported earlier today that Trichet will take the
board place vacated by  Lagardere (MMB)  when he is named chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
