Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, said it would buy back
as much as $1.2 billion in shares after posting fourth-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as sales advanced.  Net income  slipped 27 percent to $452 million, or $1.60 a
share, from $620 million, or $2.02, a year earlier, the Warren,
New Jersey-based company said in a statement today after the
close of regular trading. Operating profit, which excludes some
investment results, was $1.63 a share, beating by 3 cents the
average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. commercial insurers have been raising rates as
catastrophe claims pressure underwriting results and near
record-low yields limit income from bond portfolios. The average
rate increase of  2.8 percent  in the fourth quarter was led by
gains in workers’ compensation and commercial-property coverage,
the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers said Jan 24.  Chubb is among firms that may benefit “based on sustained
improvement in commercial property and casualty insurance
pricing, which has achieved a positive inflection point for the
first time since 1999,”  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc,
said in a note to investors yesterday.  Fourth-quarter policy sales climbed to $2.97 billion from
$2.85 billion a year earlier. Chubb projected 2012 operating
profit of $5.30 to $5.70 per share, compared with $5.12 in 2011.
The projection is based on a sales gain of 2 percent to 4
percent.  Commercial Rates  “The fourth quarter was especially encouraging as the
commercial rate environment continued to improve,” Chief
Executive Officer John Finnegan said in the statement.  Chubb has risen 19 percent in the past 12 months, compared
with the 11 percent fall in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus liabilities
used by analysts and investors, rose to $57.15 from $56.23 as of
Sept. 30. Full-year net income for 2011 fell to $1.68 billion
from $2.17 billion in 2010 on higher catastrophe costs in the
first nine months of 2011.  Travelers Cos., the only insurer in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , had its least profitable year since 2004 as
fourth-quarter profit fell 31 percent to $618 million on lower
investment income and a smaller reserve benefit.  Chubb’s realized investment losses were $8 million,
compared with a $101 million gain a year ago. Chubb said the
fluctuation reflects the performance of so-called alternative
investments, which may include private-equity assets. The
results are not included in operating income.  The insurer spent 89.9 cents of every premium dollar on
claims and expenses, compared with 87 cents a year earlier.
The prior buyback program, which provided for the repurchase of
as many as 30 million shares, has been completed, Chubb said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
