Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK)  dropped the
most in three months in New York trading after the company’s
fourth-quarter profit trailed analysts’  estimates.   Alaska , the parent of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air
Industries, fell 3.6 percent to $72.71 at 4:15 p.m., the largest
decline since Oct. 25. The Seattle-based airline is the only one
of the six biggest U.S. carriers reporting earnings that didn’t
top analysts’ forecasts for the quarter.  Profit, excluding a gain tied to fuel hedging contracts,
was $37.2 million, or $1.02 a share, below the $1.14 average of
14  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $1.04
billion lagged behind estimates of $1.06 billion.  Including the gain, Alaska’s net income slipped 1.2 percent
to $64 million, or $1.76 a share, from $64.8 million, or $1.75,
a year earlier, the carrier said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
