Mineros SA (MINEROS) ,  Colombia ’s largest gold
producer, gained the most since September 2010 after the company
bought 11 percent of Canadian mining company  Quia Resources Inc. (QUIA) 
and reached a separate agreement giving it options to acquire
interest in Peruvian gold mining concessions.  Mineros rose 6.4 percent to 5,300 pesos in Bogota today.
Mineros has the option to increase its stake in Quia, which is
exploring for gold in Colombia, to almost 15 percent, according
to a statement distributed yesterday by e-mail.  Quia is among the first miners operating in the San Lucas
gold belt in Colombia, which is “among the least explored and
most prospective gold belts in Colombia,” analysts from
Interbolsa SA, including Juan Felipe Mejia, said in an e-mailed
report on the acquisition today.  Mineros has also reached an agreement with  GoldSands
Development (GSDC)  giving Mineros options to acquire 85 percent
interest in 50 gold mining concessions in  Peru , GoldSands said
in a regulatory filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
