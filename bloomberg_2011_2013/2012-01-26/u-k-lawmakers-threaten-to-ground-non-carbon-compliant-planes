Airlines using U.K. airspace should
be grounded if they refuse to comply with the European Union’s
greenhouse-gas emissions-trading system, according to a panel of
lawmakers.  Any country or operator that refuses to accept EU carbon-
trading rules on aviation could alternatively face an increased
Air Passenger Duty tax in the U.K., the British parliament’s
Energy and  Climate Change  Select Committee recommended.  “International airlines using U.K. and European airports
must pay up for the carbon pollution they produce or risk having
their planes grounded,”  Tim Yeo , chairman of the committee,
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “Aviation is one of
the fastest-growing sources of climate-changing emissions, so
the industry must accept responsibility.”  Aviation was included in the European carbon market, the
world’s largest by traded volume, as of Jan. 1. The expansion
sparked opposition from countries including the U.S.,  China  and
Russia, which said  Europe  should let the United Nations’
International Civil Aviation Organization decide on greenhouse-
gas limits for the industry.  The price of permits has dropped 49 percent to 7.75 euros
($10.18) a metric ton in the past year, on muted demand and
surging supply.  “The U.S. needs to recognize that if it wants to do
business in the world’s largest single market, it is going to
have to get serious about tackling climate change,” Yeo said.  The ICAO said in November it wants to strike a deal to
create a global carbon market for the  airline industry  this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
