Malaysia’s ringgit may advance 1.3
percent against the dollar in the next two weeks after it
breached technical levels some traders consider significant,
according to  Mizuho Corporate Bank  Ltd.  The currency strengthened beyond an Oct. 31 high of 3.0422
and a 200-day moving average of 3.0721 yesterday, a bullish
signal for the ringgit, according to  Hiroyuki Tanaka , chief
technical analyst at Mizuho Corporate Bank in  Tokyo . It also
surpassed 3.0498, a 61.8 percent retracement of its decline from
a July 27 high of 2.9335 and an Oct. 4 low of 3.2380 based on a
series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence.  “People expected an Oct. 31 low for the dollar would be
quite a big support for the greenback,” Tanaka said. “A break
of this level indicates there’s some more room for the dollar to
weaken versus the ringgit in the short term. The next target
should be 3, which is a big figure.”  The ringgit strengthened 1.5 percent to 3.0375 per dollar
as of 6 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may climb to around 3 in a
week or two, Tanaka said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other Fibonacci levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent and 50
percent. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
