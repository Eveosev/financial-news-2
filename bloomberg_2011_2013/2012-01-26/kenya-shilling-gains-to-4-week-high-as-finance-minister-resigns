Kenya ’s shilling reached the highest
in four weeks as Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  resigned three
days after the  International Criminal Court  ordered him to stand
trial for inciting violence following the 2007 election.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1 percent to 84.73 per dollar, the strongest since
Dec 30., after the presidency office announced the resignation
in an e-mailed statement from the capital, Nairobi, today. It
closed at 0.6 percent higher at 85.10, from yesterday’s close in
New York.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened on increased dollar demand by
businesses to pay month-end bills. The currency of the second-
largest East African economy depreciated as much as 0.5 percent
to 1,605 per dollar and closed 0.1 percent lower at 1,598.35 in
the capital  Dar es Salaam .  “There is dollar demand from corporate clients to pay
monthly obligations,” Eric Chijoriga, a dealer with National
Bank of Commerce Ltd., ABSA Group’s Tanzanian unit said today by
phone from Dar es Salaam, the commercial Capital.  Uganda’s shilling didn’t trade as it was a public holiday.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
