Romania and the  World Bank  are in
talks over a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion)  credit line  to
support the Balkan nation’s budget, the bank’s country manager
Francois Rantrua said.  Prime Minister Emil Boc’s government, which is carrying out
an austerity program, is negotiating with the Washington-based
lender the terms of the precautionary accord, which will let it
to decide at a later stage whether to draw from the funds or
not, Rantrua said in an interview in Bucharest today.  The World Bank will join the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union in a precautionary agreement with
Romania, signed in March, once the credit line is approved. The
IMF and the EU set aside 5 billion euros for the government to
access on in case of market turmoil.  Romania  hasn’t drawn any
money so far.  “Romania will have to meet certain mutually agreed
measures, which are currently being discussed,” Rantrua said.
“The duration of the credit line can be as long as three
years.”  The bank completed disbursement in December of another 1
billion-euro loan to Romania as part of a 20 billion-euro
international bailout, which was signed in 2009 and ended in May
2011.  Romania needs the World Bank’s “guidance on policies and
reforming the state,” Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu
said on Dec. 27.  Boc’s cabinet pledged to cut the  budget deficit  to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product this year from 4.4 percent of
GDP in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
