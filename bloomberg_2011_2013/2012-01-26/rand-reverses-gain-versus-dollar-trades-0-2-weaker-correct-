The rand rose to its strongest level
against the dollar in almost three months after the U.S. Federal
Reserve signaled it would keep  interest rates  low until late
2014, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.5 percent
to 7.8536 per dollar, the strongest level since Nov. 9. It
traded 0.2 percent up at 7.8717 per dollar as of 10:51 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  The  MSCI Emerging Market Index (MXEF)  of stocks rose to its
highest since October and  commodities  gained for a second day
after the Fed said economic conditions will probably “warrant
exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least
through late 2014” and Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said bond buying
is “an option that’s certainly on the table.”  “The Fed is reluctant to take its foot off the pedal in
terms of being accommodative,” Michael Grobler, an analyst at
Afrifocus Securities in  Cape Town , said in e-mailed comments.
The statement was a “dollar negative event” allowing
currencies including the rand “to claw back more ground lost in
the fourth quarter”.  The Fed had previously pledged to keep borrowing costs low
at least until the middle of 2013.  South Africa ’s central bank
on Jan. 9 left its benchmark rate unchanged at 5.5 percent,
compared with 0.25 percent in the U.S.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 yielded 7.91
percent, little changed from yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
