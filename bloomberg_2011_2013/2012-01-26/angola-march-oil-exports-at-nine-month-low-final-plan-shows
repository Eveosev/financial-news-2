Angola plans to reduce its daily
crude oil exports in March by 12 percent to 1.61 million barrels
a day, the lowest in nine months, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country plans to ship 52 cargoes, three less than
February, the schedule shows. The final program is unchanged
from the preliminary one released on Jan. 16. Angola is  Africa â€™s
second-largest oil producer, after  Nigeria .  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
