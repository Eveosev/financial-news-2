Entergy Corp. (ETR)  was ordered by the
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission  to teach reactor managers across
the U.S. the lessons it learned from violating radiation safety
procedures at the FitzPatrick plant in  New York .  Rule breaches from 2006 to 2009 involved protective gear
for technicians, documentation of valve positions and
contamination surveys at the 852-megawatt plant 6 miles (10
kilometers) northeast of Oswego, the NRC said in a statement.  “No health and safety impacts on workers as a result of
these violations were identified,” the NRC said.  The order requires Entergy to develop a case study of its
errors within 180 days, then present it to managers of the 104
U.S. nuclear plants within 360 days. The New Orleans-based
company also has 60 days to report on its training procedures
and 90 days to review its safety plans, the NRC said.  “Entergy agrees with the NRC’s confirmatory order,” Tammy Holden, a spokeswoman at the plant, said in an e-mail. “We are
confident the corrective actions taken in response to the
conduct identified in the 2009 investigation were thorough and
comprehensive.”  Entergy took steps to assess the causes of the breaches,
conduct training and improve management oversight, the federal
agency said. Those measures were taken after the violations were
found and before a Nov. 9, 2011, meeting with the NRC and a
mediator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
