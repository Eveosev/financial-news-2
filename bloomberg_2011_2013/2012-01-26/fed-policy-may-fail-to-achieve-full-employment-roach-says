The Federal Reserve’s efforts to
spur the U.S. expansion may not be enough to achieve full
employment, said  Stephen Roach , non-executive chairman of Morgan
Stanley Asia.  “It worries me,” Roach said today in an interview at the
 World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “It’s a model that’s designed to
deal with economies in crisis,” though not with economies in
the midst of an “anemic” recovery, he said. “Do we really
have the recipe here to a fully employed U.S. economy? I don’t
think we do.”  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday the Fed is
considering more asset purchases after extending its pledge to
maintain low borrowing costs to at least late 2014.  The best way to spur demand in the world’s largest economy
is to boost the amount of goods and services it exports to
markets abroad, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
