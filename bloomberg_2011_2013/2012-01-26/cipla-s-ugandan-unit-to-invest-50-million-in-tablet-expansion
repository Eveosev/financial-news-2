Quality Chemicals Industries Ltd.,
the  Uganda  drug maker partly owned by  India ’s  Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA) , said
it secured $50 million to fund expansion, which will boost its
daily capacity to 24 million tablets.  The funding will enable it to raise daily production by an
additional 18 million tablets from 6 million tablets, the
Kampala-based company said in an advertisement published in the
New Vision newspaper today.  The company sourced funding after it got the World Health
Organization prequalification and it is targeting the East
African region and beyond, it said.  Quality Chemicals, which produces generic HIV/AIDS and
malaria drugs, opened its plant in Uganda in October 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
