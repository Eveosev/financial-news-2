Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , the online
recruiting service that has lost more than half its value in the
past year, tumbled after giving a profit forecast that was lower
than analysts projected, signaling lessening demand in Europe.  First-quarter profit will be break-even to 4 cents a share,
Monster said today in a statement. That’s less than the 9-cent
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The shares
dropped 20 percent, their biggest decline in a year.  Monster, based in  New York , is trimming its workforce by
about 400 jobs, or 7 percent, after economic turmoil in Europe
caused clients to pare use of the job-search website, Chief
Executive Officer Sal Iannuzzi said in an interview. Iannuzzi is
cutting costs while trying to retain users as sluggish growth
slows job listings and newer websites such as  LinkedIn Corp (LNKD) .
provide cheaper ways to recruit employees.  “ Europe  has decelerated very, very rapidly,” Iannuzzi
said. “Small businesses are not going to recruit in times of
indecision. Companies are not going to take on the extra load
resulting in those hires until they have clarity.”  Monster  shares  slid $1.83 to $7.15 at the close in New
York.  Bookings will fall 6 percent to 10 percent in the current
quarter from a year earlier. Revenue will decline 3 percent to 7
percent from $253 million in last year’s first quarter, Monster
said.  Sales in the fourth quarter fell 2 percent to $250 million
from $255.1 million a year earlier. Excluding a business Monster
exited last year, revenue in the year-earlier period would have
been $243 million, the company said.  Net income increased to $10.9 million, or 9 cents a share,
from $501,000, or break-even, the previous year, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
