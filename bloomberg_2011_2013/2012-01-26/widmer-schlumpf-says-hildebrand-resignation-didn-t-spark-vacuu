Swiss President Eveline Widmer- Schlumpf said the surprise regisgnation of Philipp Hildebrand
didn’t leave a “vacuum’ at the  Swiss National Bank .  ‘‘We have an interim president,’’ Widmer-Schlumpf said at a
briefing at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland,
today, referring to Thomas Jordan. People I met today
‘‘regretted the departure of Hildebrand’’ because ‘‘he was much
appreciated. There were no concerns expressed that it weakened
the SNB. I was positively surprised today.’’  She also said that ‘‘it’s a good sign’’ that the SNB is
‘‘considered this stable.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
