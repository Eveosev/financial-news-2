The founder of Poly Implants
Protheses SA was arrested for questioning by French police
investigating manslaughter and accidental injury claims linked
to the company’s breast implants.  Police detained Jean-Claude Mas at his home early this
morning as part of one of the two criminal probes targeting him,
a man who works at the law firm of Mas’s lawyer, Yves Haddad, in
Toulon,  France , said today by telephone.  The man declined to be identified by name, saying he isn’t
authorized to speak for Haddad, who was with Mas during the
questioning and unavailable to comment. The arrest was
previously reported by  Agence France-Presse .  PIP allegedly used inexpensive materials in its implants,
leading to concerns they were leaking industrial silicone inside
women who received them. Another investigation is pending into
whether PIP and Mas deceived others by not disclosing the
implants’ contents.  PIP, based in Toulon, was liquidated in March 2010 after
French authorities banned the company’s implants. France and
 Germany  are among the countries that have recommended women have
the implants removed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
