E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  shares fell
the most in more than five months after the online brokerage
reported results that missed analyst estimates and Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP cut its rating.  Fourth-quarter sales  were $475 million, falling short of
the $489.1 million average analyst estimate, New York-based
E*Trade said yesterday. The company lost 2 cents a share,
compared with a loss of 11 cents the year earlier.  While E*Trade posted  three quarters  of profits in 2011, it
hasn’t delivered positive fourth-period earnings since 2006, in
part because of losses after the subprime market collapsed in
2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The brokerage’s net
interest margins will be lower after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled yesterday it would keep rates low through at least late
2014, according to Sandler O’Neill analyst Rich Repetto, who cut
the shares to “hold” from “buy.”  “The interest rate environment has likely pushed out
E*Trade’s earnings power by about a year,” New York-based
Repetto wrote in a note today. “We think E*Trade shares have
limited upside in the short/moderate term, especially with the
stock up” for 2012.  E*Trade  shares  declined 12 percent to $8.26 at 10:39 a.m.
New York time, the biggest loss since Aug. 8 and the most in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock was up 18 percent in 2012
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
