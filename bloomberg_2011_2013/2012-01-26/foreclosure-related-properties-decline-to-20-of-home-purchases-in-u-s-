Foreclosure and distressed sales
fell to 20 percent of U.S. home purchases in the third quarter
of last year as legal scrutiny of property seizures reduced the
number of deals, according to  RealtyTrac Inc.   Transactions involving bank-owned property and short sales,
where lenders accept less than the amount owed, were down from
22 percent of total home purchases in the second quarter and 30
percent a year earlier, the Irvine, California-based data seller
said today in a statement.  “The sooner the market gets more clarity about accepted
foreclosure procedures, primarily through the long-promised
settlement between multiple states attorneys general and major
lenders, the sooner the market can more efficiently dispose of
these distressed properties,” RealtyTrac Chief Executive
Officer Brandon Moore said in the statement.  Foreclosure sales and first-time default notices have
declined since banks and servicers were accused more than a year
ago of using flawed documentation to repossess homes. A proposed
settlement with lenders including Bank of America Corp.,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co ., Citigroup Inc.,  Wells Fargo & Co . and  Ally
Financial Inc (ALLY) . is getting closer to resolving the complaints,
Iowa Attorney General  Tom Miller  said Jan. 24.  Properties in the foreclosure process or already seized by
lenders sold for an average $165,322 in the third quarter, up 1
percent from the second quarter and down 3 percent from a year
earlier, RealtyTrac said. The price represents an average
discount of 34 percent compared with a non-foreclosure property,
unchanged from the second quarter and down from a 37 percent
difference a year earlier, the company said.  Repossessions to Increase  As lenders resume foreclosures, home  repossessions  are
likely to rise about 25 percent this year from the more than
804,000 properties seized in 2011,  Daren Blomquist , a RealtyTrac
spokesman, said in an interview earlier this month. Banks had
already begun to accelerate default and repossession proceedings
in the second half of 2011, according to Moore.  A total of 221,536 homes that sold in the third quarter
were in some stage of foreclosure, meaning they had received
notices of default, auction or repossession, RealtyTrac said.
That was down 11 percent from a revised second quarter total and
5 percent from a year earlier. Bank-owned homes made up 128,712
of those sales, and pre-foreclosure transactions, including
short sales, accounted for 92,824.  Pre-foreclosure deals increased 68 percent from a year
earlier in  Michigan , 44 percent in  North Carolina , 43 percent in
Ohio and 35 percent in Georgia. Such transactions outnumbered
bank-owned sales in  Colorado , Florida,  New Jersey  and  New York ,
according to RealtyTrac.  Biggest in Nevada  Nevada had the biggest share of foreclosure-related sales
of any state, at almost 57 percent of total home purchases in
the third quarter. The 13,992 bank-owned and pre-foreclosure
sales represented a 24 percent increase from a year earlier,
RealtyTrac said.  The share of foreclosure sales in  California  was 44
percent, with the state’s 62,583 transactions up 7 percent from
the third quarter of 2010. The proportion in  Arizona  was 43
percent, with 21,619 such purchases up 19 percent.  In Florida, where courts oversee property seizures by
lenders, foreclosure sales plunged to 19 percent of all deals
from 39 percent in the third quarter of 2010.  Foreclosure-related transactions as a share of total sales
were 34 percent in  Georgia , 26 percent in Colorado and 23
percent in Michigan.  RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the U.S. population. Compilation of
property-title transfers delays reporting of foreclosure sales
data by a quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
