United Co. Rusal (RUALR)  rose to a two-month
high in Moscow trading as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
plans to maintain near-zero  interest rates  through 2014,
boosting demand for riskier assets such as commodities.  Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer by output,
rallied as much as 4.4 percent to 236 rubles and traded 4
percent up at 235.12 rubles at 1:29 p.m., the strongest intraday
level since Nov. 21. In  Hong Kong (486) , the stock advanced the most
since Feb. 14 on a closing basis, adding 7.8 percent to HK$6.07,
paring its drop in the past 12 months to 49 percent.  The Fed said yesterday it sees “exceptionally low”
interest rates through 2014, having previously pledged to
refrain from raising borrowing costs until at least the middle
of 2013. Policy makers maintained the  benchmark rate  at 0.2 5
percent. The  LME Index (LMEX)  of the six main industrial metals rallied
for a third day, adding 0.7 percent to 2,689.6, the highest
since Sept. 20.  “The U.S. rate decision late yesterday marked a possible
start of the new round of quantitative easing, which may lead to
a weaker dollar and higher dollar prices for commodities,
including aluminum,” said Dmitry Kolomytsyn, analyst at Morgan
Stanley in Moscow. “In  Hong Kong  trading, a three-day break for
the Chinese New Year contributed to a surge in Rusal shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
