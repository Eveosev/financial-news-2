The European Commission today gave
temporary approval to state aid for Latvia’s Mortgage and  Land
Bank , while also opening an in-depth probe into whether the
support is in line with antitrust rules.  The aid includes a $132.4 million recapitalization of the
lender in March 2010, as well as guarantees and a “standby
liquidity facility” to aid the bank if it has problems with
 cash flow , the regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  The EU “needs to gather all the necessary information to
ensure that the aid granted to MLB’s commercial activities is
compatible with the Commission’s state-aid rules on
restructuring aid,” the regulator said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
