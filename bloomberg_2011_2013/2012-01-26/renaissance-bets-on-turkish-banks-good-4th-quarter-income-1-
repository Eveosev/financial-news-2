Renaissance Asset Managers is
betting on a rally in Turkish banking stocks this year,
expecting “very good” results in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Slowing loan growth will enable the Turkish central bank to
loosen its monetary policy and ease pressure on the banks, Aziz Unan, who manages the Ottoman Fund that focuses on stocks in
 Turkey , the wider  Middle East , eastern  Europe  and north  Africa ,
said in a phone interview today.  Renaissance purchased the Griffin Eastern European Value
Fund and Griffin Ottoman Fund, increasing its assets under
management by $116 million to $2.8 billion, the Moscow-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t disclose
a price for the acquisitions.  “Fourth quarter results will be a lot better than expected
for Turkish banks,” Unan said. “We also expect a rise in
profits of some banks this year.”  Banks dropped 31 percent last year in the worst yearly
performance since 2008, underperforming the Istanbul stock
exchange’s main index that lost 22 percent, as the central bank
raised lending rates to as high as 12.5 percent annually and
lifted  reserve requirements  for lenders to slow credit growth
and rein in a current-account deficit at 10 percent of the gross
domestic product. Turkish banks rallied 6.1 percent today, in
the biggest rally since Sept. 20.  “I expect loan growth in 2012 to be as much as 15 percent
and if this trend is continued, I certainly don’t expect the
central bank to squeeze” liquidity, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
