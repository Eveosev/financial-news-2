President  Barack Obama  said he
second-guesses some of the decisions he makes and that he
expects to win re-election in November.  Obama said in an interview with ABC News that he makes
mistakes in the White House “every hour, every day” and that
“there’re always things that your learning in the job.”  Still, without the actions his administration took, the
 U.S. economy  would be “profoundly weaker,” Obama said.  Asked how much he wants to win a second term, Obama said,
“Badly, because the country needs it.”  Obama, who is running for re-election this year, is on a
trip through five electoral battleground states to promote his
economic policies. The interview was taped while he was in  Las
Vegas  today highlighting the energy initiatives he announced in
his State of the Union speech this week.  Obama said the government bailout of General Motors Co. and
Chrysler Group LLC along with the stimulus legislation saved the
nation from falling into a deeper recession.  “When you look at the broad outlines of what we did, had
it not been for the steps we took, our economy would be
profoundly weaker than we are right now,” he said.  The  unemployment rate  in December dropped to 8.5 percent, a
three-year low, and employers expanded payrolls by 200,000, an
indication that the job market is gaining momentum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
