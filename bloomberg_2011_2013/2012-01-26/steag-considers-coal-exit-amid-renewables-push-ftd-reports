Steag GmbH (STEAG)  is considering a long-
term exit from coal-fired power generation as the German plant
operator invests in renewables,  Financial Times Deutschland 
said, citing Hermann Janning, chairman of the supervisory board.  Steag, based in Essen, plans to invest about 500 million
euros ($656 million) in renewable energy by 2014 as margins at
coal plants are “critical at the moment,” the newspaper cited
Janning as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
