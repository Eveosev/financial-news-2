U.K.  retail sales  fell in January at
the fastest pace in almost three years, reversing an increase in
December when discounting by stores lured shoppers, according to
the  Confederation of British Industry .  The gauge of annual sales growth fell to minus 22, the
lowest since March 2009, from 9 in December, the London-based
business lobby said in a report today. A gauge of expected sales
for next month was at minus 10, indicating retailers expect
sales to decline again in February.  Rising unemployment is undermining confidence and curbing
demand in the U.K. after consumers suffered what  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King  said was a “ferocious squeeze” in 2011
from soaring inflation. While consumer-price growth is easing,
household spending may be slow to recover as wage growth remains
“modest,” according to the CBI.  “Shoppers have reined in spending across the board at the
start of the new year after taking advantage of early
discounting last month,”  Ian McCafferty , chief economic adviser
at the CBI, said in a statement. “Family budgets are under
continuing pressure with inflation still high and wage increases
modest.”  A measure of three-month sales volumes fell to minus 11
this month from minus 7 in December, the CBI said. An index of
the volume of sales for the time of year dropped to minus 20
from minus 16. With retail demand weakening, a gauge of orders
placed on suppliers dropped to minus 14 from minus 4.  The CBI questioned 75 retailers between Jan. 3 and Jan. 17
for the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
