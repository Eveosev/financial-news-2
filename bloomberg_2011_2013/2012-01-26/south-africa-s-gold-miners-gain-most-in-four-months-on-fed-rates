South Africa ’s gold mining index
climbed the most in four months as the price of the metal rose
after the U.S. Federal Reserve extended a pledge to keep
interest rates near zero.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index (JGOLD)  climbed 4.8 percent,
its biggest gain since Sept. 19, as of 1:09 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, rose 4.5 percent.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s
fourth-biggest gold producer, surged 4.4 percent.  Gold rose as much as 0.5 percent to $1,718.57, the highest
since Dec. 9, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said the Fed is considering additional asset purchases to boost
growth after pledging to keep interest rates low through at
least late 2014.  “People are moving into the equities as the gold price
starts to move up,”  David Davis , a gold analyst at SBG
Securities, said by telephone from Johannesburg.  Global gold miners including  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , Newmont
Mining Corp. and  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  outpaced gains by South
Africa’s gold miners as the rand strengthened against the  U.S.
dollar , reducing the price of gold in rand terms, Davis said.  Disappointing fourth-quarter economic growth in the U.K.
also helped push gold higher, he said.  Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from the third
quarter, when it increased 0.6 percent, the Office for National
Statistics said in London yesterday. The median forecast of 33
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey was for a drop of 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
