 Christian Meissner,  Bank of America
Corp. ’s co-head of global corporate and investment banking, said
the mood among investors in  Europe  has improved, though there
will be more “bumps in the road.”  “The first three weeks of this year have been much better
than the final quarter of 2011, so that’s good news,” Meissner
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland. “Without doubt there are
going to be more bumps in the road. There are going to be lots
of unknowns. Volatility is here to stay.”  The  European Central Bank ’s offer of cheap and unlimited
three-year loans to the region’s banks is a “big component” in
the improvement in market conditions, he said.  “The mood certainly is better and there is a sense that
policy makers are beginning to put specific measures in place
that are helping,” Meissner said.  Meissner quit as Nomura Holdings Inc.’s deputy global
investment banking head in April 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
