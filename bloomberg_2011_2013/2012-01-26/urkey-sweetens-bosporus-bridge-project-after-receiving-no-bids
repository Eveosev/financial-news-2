Turkey  will try again to attract
bidders to build a third Bosporus bridge in Istanbul, dropping a
requirement for new highways and connecting roads, Deputy Prime
Minister Ali Babacan said.  The government looked into why there were no bids in
response to its first offer and decided on a simplified project,
with a guarantee of “heavy traffic,” Babacan said in a
television interview with CNBC-e in Davos,  Switzerland .  The project will be offered on a build-operate-transfer
basis and has an estimated value of $2.5 billion, Babacan said.
The bridge will be the third to span the Bosporus Strait that
divides Istanbul’s Asian and European sides.  Turkey aims to reopen the tender in April and to begin
construction by the end of the year, Transport Minister Binali Yildirim said yesterday. The government canceled the project
after receiving no bids by Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
