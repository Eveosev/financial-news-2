Robusta coffee prices in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer of the variety after  Vietnam ,
may get a boost this year as farmers in the Asian nation slow
sales, according to Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo research
group.  Coffee exports from Vietnam may drop to 1.1 million metric
tons in 2012 from 1.22 million tons estimated for last year, the
country’s agriculture ministry has said. Officially, the crop in
the season started Oct. 1 has been estimated at 18.5 million
bags, down from 19.467 million a year earlier, according to the
 International Coffee Organization.   A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Prices for robusta beans in Brazil tend to fall by April,
when the harvest starts in Espirito Santo state, the leading
producer of those beans in the South American country, Cepea
said in a report today.  This year, even with an expected increase of the Brazilian
crop, the price may not reach low levels, analysts at Cepea
wrote in a report today.  In addition to lower production volume and rising domestic
consumption, Vietnamese farmers and exporters have limited
sales, waiting for better prices, Cepea said.  “This posture has boosted international prices,” the
researchers said.  Before today, robusta coffee futures climbed 7.1 percent
since Jan. 9 on  London ’s NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
