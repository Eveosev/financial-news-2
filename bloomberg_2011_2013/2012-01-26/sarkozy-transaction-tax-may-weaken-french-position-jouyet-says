France ’s top financial regulator
said a tax on financial transactions advocated by President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  would weaken the country’s position in the
asset-management industry.  The tax “could penalize our asset management industry” by
pushing professionals and transactions elsewhere if France acts
alone, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, president of the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said in Paris today.  The European Commission has proposed a tax covering a wide
range of trading that could raise 57 billion euros ($74 billion)
a year. Financial institutions would pay in their home
countries, regardless of where transactions take place. U.K.
officials have led opposition to the tax, which they say would
be ineffective unless adopted globally.  Sarkozy has pushed to implement the levy unilaterally,
while French officials including Bank of France Governor
 Christian Noyer  and Sarkozy’s own ministers have cautioned that
such action could cause difficulties. Noyer said this month
“numerous problems” need to be resolved and that any such tax
needs to be “Europe-wide.”  Francois Hollande , the Socialist candidate seeking to
unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy, also supports the transaction
tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
