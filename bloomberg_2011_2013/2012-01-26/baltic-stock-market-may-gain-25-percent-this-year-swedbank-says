Stocks in Estonia, Latvia and
 Lithuania , including  AB TEO LT (TEO1L)  and  Tallink Grupp AS (TAL1T) , may gain 25
percent this year as the region’s economic outlook is among the
best in Europe and prices don’t reflect the companies’ earnings
potential, according to Swedbank AB’s equity research.  The Baltic economies will be some of the fastest growing in
the 27-member European Union this year, with Lithuania’s gross
domestic product seen expanding 3.3 percent, Estonia’s economy
growing 2.7 percent, and Latvia’s 2 percent, Marek Randma, the
head of Baltic equity research at the Stockholm-based bank, told
journalists in Tallinn today.  Baltic companies, which trade at their book value, will
probably report gross profit margins of 34 percent this year
after divesting less profitable businesses, Randma said, based
on the median estimate for 17 listed Baltic companies covered by
Swedbank. The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization was 0.5 at the end of last
year, while return on equity was at 13 percent, the highest
level since 2008.  The Nasdaq OMX Tallinn index  declined 24 percent last year,
while  Lithuanian stocks  lost 27 percent and Latvian equity
market declined 4 percent, in line with a 23 percent fall for
the MSCI Eastern  Europe  index. The markets are at about half of
their peak levels hit in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
