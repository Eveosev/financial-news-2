The Polish central bank’s profit
will “significantly” boost the government’s budget revenue
this year, according to policy maker Andrzej Kazmierczak.  The contribution will be “high,” Kazmierczak said in an
interview in Warsaw yesterday. He declined to estimate the size
of the profit, which is almost entirely transferred to the state
budget.  The central bank may contribute as much as 9 billion zloty
($2.8 billion) to this year’s budget, Dariusz Rosati, the
chairman of parliament’s public finance committee, said on Dec.
14. The lower house of the legislature will vote on the 2012
budget bill starting at 10:30 a.m. in Warsaw tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
