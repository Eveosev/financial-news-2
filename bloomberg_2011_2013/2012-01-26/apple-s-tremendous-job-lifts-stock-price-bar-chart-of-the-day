Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s record earnings and
sales last quarter touched off the biggest one-day increase in
share-price estimates for the maker of iPhones and iPad tablets
in more than two years.  Analysts raised their projections yesterday by an average
of 8.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
figure exceeded Apple’s 6.2 percent advance after the company,
based in Cupertino,  California , said profit more than doubled
and revenue jumped 73 percent in the fiscal first quarter.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the estimated price, based
primarily on analysts’ outlook for the next 12 months, compares
with the stock’s market price. Yesterday’s average of $569.19
was 27 percent higher than the close. Since 2007, the gap has
averaged 26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yesterday’s biggest increase came from Tavis McCourt, an
analyst at Morgan Keegan & Co. in Nashville,  Tennessee , based on
Bloomberg’s data. McCourt lifted his estimate for Apple’s price
by 27 percent to $650 a share.  “They’re doing a tremendous job, obviously,” McCourt said
yesterday in a telephone interview. The higher projection is 15
times his fiscal-year profit estimate of $43.31 a share, which
he raised from $34.20.  Apple earned $13.87 a share in the first quarter on sales
of $46.3 billion. The increase in estimates after those results
was the biggest since Oct. 20, 2009, when analysts raised their
projections by 9.2 percent in the aftermath of a fourth-quarter
earnings report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
