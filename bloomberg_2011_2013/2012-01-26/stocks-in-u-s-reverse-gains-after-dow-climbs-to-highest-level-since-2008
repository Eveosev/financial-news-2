U.S. stocks reversed gains after new
home sales trailed economists’ estimates, halting a rally that
sent the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  above its highest level
since May 2008.  The Dow added 37.31 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,794.27
after earlier climbing as high as 12,841.95. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent after increasing 0.6
percent earlier.  Earlier gains in equities came after earnings at companies
including Caterpillar Inc., 3M Co. and Time Warner Cable Inc.
exceeded analysts’ estimates and orders for durable goods
increased more than economists forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
