An accident at a chemical plant in
Wuelfrath, northwest  Germany , injured nine people today.  A chemical derived from zinc acetate mixed with air and
formed a cloud at about 7.30 a.m., injuring workers from
companies adjacent to a plant operated by  ASK Chemicals GmbH ,
Reinhard Schneider, a spokesman for the town of Wuelfrath, said
by telephone.  The cloud has since dispersed and the air around the site
is being tested to determine whether there is still a potential
health hazard, Schneider said.  ASK Chemicals is a joint venture of  Sued-Chemie (CLN)  AG, based
in Munich, and  Ashland  Inc. based in Covington,  Kentucky . The
company has 1,600 employees, about 250 of whom work at the
Wuelfrath plant, according to its website.  ASK spokesman Ulrich Girrbach wasnâ€™t immediately available
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
