France  needs to build 20,000 more
prison places to be able to carry out sentences, President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  “How can we explain that 100,000 prison sentences have
never been carried out?” he said, speaking in a courthouse in
the eastern city of Dijon. “Without those extra 20,000 places,
how can the justice system function normally?”  Sarkozy, who faces re-election in April, used much of his
speech to assure members of France’s legal professions that the
justice system has become more independent during his five years
in office and that he has given them more resources. French
newspapers such as Le Monde have said his government has put
pressure on investigative magistrates involved in high-profile
political cases, while some judges have protested the
government’s plans to close courts in small towns.  Sarkozy said that in 2008 he had ended the system where the
president was also the head of the administrative body that
selected judges.  “I am the president that put an end to 65 years of
presidency of this institution,” he said.  Sarkozy said that in the past five years the justice-system
budget has risen 20 percent to 7.4 billion euros ($9.6 billion),
and that 450 judges and 1,200 clerks have been hired.  “It was not easy in the midst of an economic crisis
without precedent, but I did it because the justice system is an
absolute priority,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
