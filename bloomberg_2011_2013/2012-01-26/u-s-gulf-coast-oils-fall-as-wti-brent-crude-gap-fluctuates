U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums fell as
the difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
fluctuated.  The premium of Brent to WTI narrowed 5 cents to $10.36 at
1:02 p.m. in  New York , based on the contracts for March
delivery, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread
had widened as much as 71 cents to $11.12 in earlier trading.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium
narrowed $1.35 to $11.90 over the U.S. benchmark at 12:04 p.m.
 Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI narrowed 70 cents to
$9.75 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed $1.10 to $9.40. Mars Blend
weakened 50 cents to $8 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium fell 80
cents to $7.50.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $7.75.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed 20 cents to $2.20 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$22 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
