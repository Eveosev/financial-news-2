Colombia ’s peso strengthened to a
four-month high after the  Federal Reserve  said yesterday it will
keep the benchmark U.S. interest rate low until at least late
2014, bolstering demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,810.80 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,812.65 yesterday. Earlier it reached 1,794.51, the
strongest level since Sept. 9. The peso has gained 7.1 percent
this month, the third-best performer among emerging market
currencies after the Hungarian Forint and Mexican peso.  “Investors are paying attention to the U.S. as the
European crisis has been quiet,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst
at Alianza Valores SA in Bogota. “The Fed decision to leave
rates low until 2014 has helped strengthen the peso” by
encouraging investors to seek higher yields in the South
American country, he said.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday that
economic conditions are likely to warrant “exceptionally low
levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”  Colombia’s central bank should refrain from raising
 interest rates  as the peso’s rally hurts farming exports,
Agriculture Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo said today according
to an e-mailed government statement.  Colombia’s central bank increased benchmark lending rates
in November by a quarter percentage point to 4.75 percent.
Economists expect Colombia’s central bank to hold the overnight
rate at 4.75 percent at a Jan. 30 policy meeting, according to
the median estimate among 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.29 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.280 centavo to 121.649
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
