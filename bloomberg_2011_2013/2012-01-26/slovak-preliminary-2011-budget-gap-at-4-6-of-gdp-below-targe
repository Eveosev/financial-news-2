Slovakia’s budget deficit narrowed
to  4.6 percent of gross domestic product last year, preliminary
data show, below the target as the government cut spending to
counter the effects of slowing economic growth.  The result, released by the  Finance Ministry  in an e-mailed
statement from Bratislava today, compares with a revised
shortfall of 8.1 percent of GDP in 2010 and a 2011 target of 4.9
percent.  The second-poorest euro-area member seeks to improve its
public finances even the export-driven economy is slowing to
retain investors’ confidence and differentiate itself from the
troubled peripheral members of the bloc.  Spending cuts accounted for more than four-fifth of the
year-on-year improvement, with the rest stemming from higher
revenue, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
