Ethanol futures rose for a sixth day
to a two-week high as gasoline and crude oil gained after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will maintain low interest rates.  Futures followed gasoline and oil higher a day after Fed
officials said the benchmark  interest rate  will stay near-zero
until at least late 2014. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to
stretch supply as part of U.S. plans to reduce dependence on
foreign sources of oil.  “The energy markets were higher,” said Matt Janney, a
trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. “Just a little bit of
follow-through from yesterday, and the dollar’s a little
weaker.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery climbed 0.4 cent to
$2.187 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the highest level
since Jan. 11. Prices have gained 3.6 percent since Jan. 18 and
fallen 6.1 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased
1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and in  New York 
the biofuel advanced 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.265,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.155 a
gallon and on the West Coast the additive climbed 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.26.  Crude oil for March delivery increased 30 cents to $99.70 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement price since Jan. 19. Prices are up 14 percent in the
past year.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 1.28 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.8466 a gallon in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
