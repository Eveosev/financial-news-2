Two forged diplomatic pouches
containing a total of 35 pounds (16 kilos) of cocaine were
delivered last week to the UN headquarters building in  New York ,
according to a UN official speaking on condition of anonymity.  The packages, delivered to the mail room, were singled out
Jan. 16 by security staff during a scan, according to the
official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  No recipient was identified on the shipment, which was sent
from Mexico City, and the badly forged UN logo on the parcels
was an effort to get the shipment across the border, the
official said.  “Two suspicious mail bags were intercepted by the Security
and Safety Service at United Nations headquarters in New York,”
according to a statement released by the UN spokesman’s office,
which declined to describe the contents.  “The  United Nations  nor anyone located in the United
Nations was the intended recipient of this delivery and the bags
were not UN bags, diplomatic or other,” according to the
statement.  Paul Browne , a spokesman for the New York Police
Department, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
