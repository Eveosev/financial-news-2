Stephen Mettler, who oversaw  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s  interest rates  and foreign-exchange trading
businesses, has left the bank.  Mettler, who joined the firm in 1997, retired, according to
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company that owns
the world’s largest brokerage, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 53, said a year ago
the firm needed to gain share in interest rates and foreign-
exchange to turn around the fixed-income trading unit. The
company had increased headcount by about 40 percent in foreign
exchange and 20 percent in interest rates in 2010, Gorman said.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last week that
fourth-quarter revenue from foreign-exchange trading was up
“significantly” from a year earlier, while down from the third
quarter. Interest-rate trading revenue increased “modestly”
from the third quarter and “materially” from a year earlier,
she said.  Mettler held roles including global head of foreign-
exchange options and head of global foreign exchange and
 emerging markets . In 2010, he took the position of head of
macro, which involved overseeing interest rates and foreign
exchange trading, and also oversaw the rates and currency parts
of the bank’s emerging-markets group.  CNBC reported Mettler’s departure earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
