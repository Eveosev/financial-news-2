Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed as the yen rose against the dollar after the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to keep interest rates at a record low and U.S.
homes sales unexpectedly fell. Australian equities rose as
commodity prices jumped.  American depositary receipts of carmaker  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
which gets more than 40 percent of its sales in  North America ,
lost 0.7 percent. Nintendo Co. may be active in trading after
the world’s largest maker of video-game machines more than
tripled its full-year loss forecast. ADRs of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,
Japan’s largest commodities trader by market value, rose 0.2
percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil producer and
No. 1 global mining company, climbed 1.3 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,860 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with 8,850
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  8,860 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
rose 0.3 percent today, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.4 percent in Wellington. Stock markets in  China  and Taiwan are
shut for the Lunar New Year holiday.  “Investors may be getting too optimistic about the U.S.
economy,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist
at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. The Fed’s pledge “is a
tailwind for energy-related stocks.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.6 percent in New York yesterday as banks
tumbled and a report showed that sales of new homes declined in
December for the first time in four months. Claims for U.S.
jobless benefits rose last week.  Dollar Falls  The dollar weakened versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep  interest
rates  at a record low for longer than originally forecast
spurred investors to seek higher yields. The U.S. currency
depreciated to as low as 77.29 yen today in Tokyo, compared with
77.63 yen at the close of stock trading yesterday, cutting the
value of income at some Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Copper rose to a four-month high in New York yesterday
after the Federal Reserve extended a pledge on Jan. 25 to hold
interest rates near zero, potentially spurring metals demand.
The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
commodities including copper and aluminum gained 2.4 percent,
the biggest gain since Jan. 10.  Crude oil for March delivery added 0.3 percent to $99.70 a
barrel yesterday in  New York , the highest settlement price since
Jan. 19.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 7.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with increases of 4.8 percent by the
S&P 500 and 5.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index in Europe.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. slid 0.2 percent to 102.55 yesterday in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
