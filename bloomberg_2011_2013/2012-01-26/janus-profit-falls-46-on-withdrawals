Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 46 percent after stock markets declined and clients
withdrew money for the 10th consecutive quarter.  Profit still exceeded analysts’ estimates, and Janus shares
rose the most in three months. Separately, the company said
Glenn Schafer will become chairman of the board of directors in
April, succeeding Steven Scheid, who will retire.  Net income fell to $35.7 million, or 19 cents a share, from
$65.9 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the Denver-based
company said today in a statement. Steven L. Scheid, chairman of
the company’s board of directors since 2004, will retire in
April and be replaced by Glenn Schafer, Janus said today in a
regulatory filing.  Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil has struggled to
halt customer defections from the firm’s active stock funds as
equity markets have declined and investors turn increasingly to
passive vehicles, especially exchange-traded funds. Clients
withdrew a net $4 billion from Janus in the quarter, bringing
redemptions in 2011 to $12.2 billion. Profit has also been hurt
by the funds’ returns and performance-related cuts to fund-
management fees.  “To the extent they are able to improve performance at
some bigger flagship products, we would expect flows to follow,
but they don’t have control over the broad derisking we’ve seen
across the industry,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP in  New York , said in a telephone interview
before results were announced.  Profit at Janus beat the 15-cent average estimate of 18
analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Shares Rise  Janus rose 8.7 percent to $8.24 at 10:03 a.m. in New York
trading, the biggest increase since Oct. 27. Before today,
Janus’s stock had declined 42 percent in the 12 months ended
Jan. 25, worst among the 20-member Standard & Poor’s  index  of
asset managers and custody banks. The index fell 18 percent
during the same period.  Assets under management were $148.2 billion as of Dec. 31,
down 13 percent from a year earlier and up 5.1 percent in the
fourth quarter as $11.2 billion in market appreciation offset
the impact of investor redemptions.  The MSCI ACWI Index of global stocks fell 9.4 percent in
2011 and the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index of U.S. equities was
almost unchanged. Investors withdrew $84.2 billion from U.S.-
registered equity mutual funds in the same period, while pouring
$61.7 billion in equity ETFs, according to Chicago-based
research firm Morningstar Inc.  Janus doesn’t offer ETFs and about 90 percent of the assets
it manages are in stocks.  Revenue Declines  Revenue decreased 22 percent from a year earlier to $216
million, as investment management fees dropped 13 percent and
the company recorded a $9.2 million loss on performance fees.  Asset-management firms such as Janus earn fees on the funds
that they manage for clients. Janus’s mutual funds also charge
fees that rise or fall in connection to the funds’ performance
over 12- to 36-month periods.  The performance of Janus’s funds has deteriorated relative
to their benchmarks. Of Janus’s largest 20 stock and balanced
funds, representing $72.2 billion in assets, four beat their
benchmark index in the year ended Jan. 24, compared with nine
over a three-year period and 15 over the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest money manager, said
Jan. 19 that fourth-quarter net income fell 16 percent to $555
million. The firm also said it would cut 3.4 percent of its
workforce.  (Janus will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. New York
time. The call-in number is +1-888-428-7458 in the U.S. and
 Canada  and +1-201-604-5177 elsewhere.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
