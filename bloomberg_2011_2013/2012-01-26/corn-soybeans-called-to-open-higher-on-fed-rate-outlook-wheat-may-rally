What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the  Federal Reserve 
said that it expects to keep U.S.  interest rates  low into late
2014, eroding the appeal of the dollar and boosting demand for
commodities,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that low borrowing costs will spur
the global economy, boosting demand for food and livestock feed,
Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent
to 0.35 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open
$2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that freezing weather forecast
during the next six days in parts of Russia and Ukraine will
damage winter crops, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
