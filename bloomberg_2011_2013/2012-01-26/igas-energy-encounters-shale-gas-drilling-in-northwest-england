IGas Energy Plc, a U.K. developer of
coal-bed methane gas fields, encountered a shale gas deposit
while drilling at the Ince Marshes site in Cheshire in northwest
 England .  After drilling through coal seams, IGas found a shale
section of at least 1,000 feet (304 meters) with gas indications
observed across the interval, IGas said in a statement today.  The area is part of the Bowland shale, which covers large
parts of northern England. In September, Cuadrilla Reources said
it had found 200 trillion cubic feet of gas in place drilling
the Bowland shale at a licence in Lanacashire, north of Igas’s
well.  At Ince Marshes, previous independent analysis suggested
gas in place of as much as 4.6 trillion cubic feet. The U.K.’s
technically recoverable shale resources are 20 trillion cubic
feet, the U.S. Department of Energy said in an April report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
