Oil production from the Eagle Ford
formation in  Texas  will increase to 421,000 barrels a day by
2015, said John O’Shea, chief executive officer of Tradition
Midstream LLC.  “This crude is coming on like gangbusters,” O’Shea said
during a talk at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston.
“Domestic crude is going to displace imports over the next
decade.”  North American oil supply will grow 1.7 percent annually
over the next 25 years and imported crude could fall 47 percent
in 2012, according to O’Shea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
