NEC Corp. (6701) , forecasting its third
annual loss in four years, will cut 10,000 jobs as slower global
growth reduces demand for its mobile phones, computers and
wireless gear.  “As macroeconomic concerns about  Europe  and developing
countries increase, we decided to invest limited resources in
lesser business segments,” President Nobuhiro Endo said today
in Tokyo.  NEC forecast a 100 billion-yen loss ($1.3 billion) for the
year ending March 31, abandoning a previous outlook for a 15
billion-yen profit, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement
today. The job cuts equal about 8.6 percent of NEC’s workforce.  About 7,000 of those  jobs  will be eliminated in  Japan , and
NEC will take a 40 billion-yen charge for the restructuring,
according to the statement. NEC also won’t pay a year-end
 dividend .  “The job cuts announced today are bigger than expected,”
said Yuichi Ishida, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co.
in  Tokyo . “This will probably help the company reduce expenses,
and we’ll probably see some improvements immediately from next
fiscal year.”  Previous Cuts  The computer maker’s  shares  were unchanged at 168 yen as of
the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, before the statement was
released. NEC has lost 31 percent of market value in the past 12
months, compared with a 23 percent drop for Japanese computer
maker  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  and a 17 percent decline for the broader
Topix index.  Most of the job cuts will come from NEC’s mobile-phone
handset business and may begin March 31, Endo said. The
reduction is split between full- and part-time jobs, Endo said.  In 2009, the company said it was cutting more than 20,000
employees, mostly in the semiconductor and electronic-component
businesses.  NEC, which formed a venture with  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  last
year, had 115,840 employees at the end of March, compared with
154,786 in fiscal year 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lenovo,  China ’s biggest personal-computer maker,
agreed to invest $175 million in the venture to expand in Japan.  NEC’s net loss widened to 86.5 billion yen in the three
months ended Dec. 31 from 26.5 billion yen a year earlier,
according to the statement today. Sales fell 6.7 percent to 672
billion yen.  “NEC has to focus on its strengths and cut the rest,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
