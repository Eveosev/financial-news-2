Zimbabwe ’s  CFI Holdings Ltd. (CFI)  plans
to raise $8 million by selling its stakes in fertilizer-maker
 Windmill (Pvt) Ltd.  and the Beira Port Grain Terminal in
neighboring Mozambique, the  Daily News  reported.  The sales will help CFI offset “expensive local debt,”
the Harare-based newspaper said, citing the company.  The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange has agreed to allow CFI to
delay publishing its 2011 results until the sales are concluded,
the Daily News said. CFI owns milling, poultry, veterinary and
grocery outlets in Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
