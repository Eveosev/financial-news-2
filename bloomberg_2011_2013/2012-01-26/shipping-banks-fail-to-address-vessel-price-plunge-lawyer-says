Frank Dunne, a partner at law firm
Watson Farley & Williams LLP, which has the largest global
shipping and vessel-finance practice, comments on how banks are
handling a decline in ship prices.  He spoke at a conference in  London  today.  “The more problems the banks have, the less willing they
are to recognize the problems that the shipowners have. They
prefer to hold their breath and believe in values that seem to
be somewhat surprising by market standards and prefer to believe
in the future, because the consequence of looking really hard at
the present and admitting how bad things are in some sectors is
so awful for the banks that it might be worse for the banks than
it might be for the shipowners.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
