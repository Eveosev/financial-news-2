K+S AG (SDF) , the world’s largest producer
of salt, has sent salt shipments from its subsidiary in Chile to
China for the first time as it may become a supplier for the
country’s chemical industry.  Santiago-based Sociedad Punta de Lobos is shipping 150.000
metric tons of salt to customers in China’s chemical industry to
potentially enter the market, spokesman Michael Wudonig said,
confirming comments by Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner
in an interview with El Mercurio newspaper.  Kassel, Germany-based K+S has no contracts for regular
shipments yet, Wudonig said.  From April 1, Alexa Hergenroether will head SPL, as current
chief Matthias Mohr moves to Hanover to head Esco, the company’s
salt operations in  Europe , Wudonig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
