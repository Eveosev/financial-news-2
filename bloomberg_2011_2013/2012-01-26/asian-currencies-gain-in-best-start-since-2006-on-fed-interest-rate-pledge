Asian currencies advanced in the
best start to a year since 2006 as the  Federal Reserve  signaled
it will extend near-zero  interest rates , spurring demand for
higher-yielding assets in the region.  The Bloomberg-JP Morgan  Asia  Dollar Index rose for a second
day, contributing to a  1.6 percent  gain for the month, after the
Fed said it expects interest rates to stay near zero through
2014. Malaysia’s ringgit reached the highest level since Sept.
13. South Korea’s won traded at the strongest level in more than
two months as investors pumped $4.5 billion into the local stock
 market  in January, according to exchange data.  “The global weakness of the dollar gave an early boost to
Asian currencies including the won,” said Kim Sung Soon, chief
currency dealer at state-run Industrial Bank of  Korea . “Growth
isn’t slowing enough to shake confidence.”  The ringgit appreciated 1.3 percent to 3.042 per dollar as
of 3:55 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The won closed 0.4 percent stronger at 1,121.82 and
the baht gained 0.8 percent, the most this year, to 31.35.
Financial markets in China,  Taiwan  and  India  are closed for a
public holiday.  The Fed said yesterday that it sees “exceptionally low”
interest rates through 2014, having previously pledged to
refrain from raising borrowing costs until at least the middle
of 2013. Policy makers kept their target rate between zero and
0.25 percent, unchanged since December 2008, to secure a
recovery from the global credit-market crisis.  Korea GDP Report  All 13 economists forecast Bank Negara  Malaysia  will keep
its overnight rate at 3 percent at a policy meeting on Jan. 31,
unchanged since May last year, according to a Bloomberg News
survey.  The yield on Malaysia’s 4.262 percent notes due September
2016 was 3.18 percent, a 238 basis point premium over similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, up from as low as 120 on Feb. 8, 2011.
Indonesia’s 10-year bonds yield 365 basis points more than
benchmark U.S. bonds.  “Bernanke’s statement boosted risk appetite,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB Investment Bank
in Kuala Lumpur.  The won advanced as a Bank of Korea report showed today
that Asia’s fourth-largest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4
percent in the final quarter of 2011 after a 3.5 percent gain in
the preceding three months.  The Philippine peso advanced 0.6 percent to 42.84. The
economy grew 3.7 percent in the final three months of 2011 from
a year earlier, compared with 3.2 percent in the preceding
quarter, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before a government report on Jan. 30.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.7 percent to
8,968 and  China ’s yuan gained 0.05 percent to 6.2958 in the
offshore market in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporters on this story:
