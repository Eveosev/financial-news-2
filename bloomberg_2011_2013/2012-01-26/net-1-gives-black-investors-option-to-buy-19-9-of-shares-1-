Net 1 UEPS Technologies Inc.  said it
agreed to issue a one-year option to black South African
investors to buy 19.9 percent of the electronic-payment systems
maker for $80 million to comply with local regulations.  The option, which will give investors the right to buy as
many as 8.96 million shares in the company for $8.96 each, is
subject to obtaining regulatory approval, the company said in a
statement today.  “Our focus will be on helping expand Net 1’s product
offerings in financial services and health-care processing,
which will become increasingly important across the African
continent with the advent of several large-scale national
projects,” Brian Mosehla, chief executive officer of Mosomo
Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd., the lead partner in the black
empowerment group, said in the statement.  South Africa ’s black economic empowerment laws are meant to
redress discrimination under apartheid by requiring some
businesses to transfer stakes to black owners. The government
considers the empowerment status of companies when contracts are
awarded to suppliers.  “Our new partners will help strengthen the long-term
sustainability of our business in South Africa,” Serge Belamant, chairman and chief executive officer of Net 1, said in
the statement.  Net 1 dropped 3.1 percent, the most since Jan. 13, to $9.99
at 9:59 a.m. in  New York , giving the company a market value of
$450 million. The stock has retreated 14 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
