The  United Arab Emirates  will be
able to use ports on the  Gulf of Oman  for oil exports if Iran
closes the Strait of Hormuz, transit point for about a fifth of
the global oil supply, Dahi Khalfan, Dubai’s chief of Police,
said in an interview with Bahrain TV last night.  “Iran is capable of fomenting tension in the region,” he
said in the interview, which was rebroadcast today. “We in the
Gulf have cards in our hands that allow us to marginalize the
role of the strait and undermine its importance.”  “We tell Iran if you try to close this place, we will open
the other gates and nullify the importance of the  Strait of
Hormuz ,” he added.  Iran has threatened to block the strait if an embargo
against its oil exports is implemented. The European Union
announced Jan. 23 that it would ban oil imports from Iran
starting July 1 to pressure the Persian Gulf nation over its
nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
