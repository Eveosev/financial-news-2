Ortivus AB (ORTIB) , a maker of mobile
solutions for emergency health care, rose the most in over two
years in Stockholm after the company won an order to deliver its
MobiMed Smart monitoring platform to 200 U.K. ambulances.  The share rose as much as 42 percent, the biggest intraday
jump since Jan. 8, 2010, making it the biggest gainer in the
Stockholm All Share Index. It traded 38 percent, or 0.78 krona,
higher at 2.82 kronor as of 4:00 p.m. local time.  The order, placed by the South Western Ambulance Service
NHS Foundation Trust, has a total value of about 30 million
kronor ($4.45 million,) Stockholm-based Ortivus said in a
statement today. MobiMed Smart is built on an open architecture
so its functionality can be expanded. Ortivus sees increased
interest from health-care providers for systems that can be
adapted to specific needs and integrated with existing systems,
the company said.  “The development of the new solution has attracted
interest from a number of existing clients and there is good
hope of new deals and new deliveries during 2012,” the company
said. “The total list of potential deals is longer and more
qualified than in many years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
