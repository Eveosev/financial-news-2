A former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
trader and his father will pay more than $92,000 to resolve U.S.
regulatory claims that they used inside information to reap
profits from illegal trades related to the firmâ€™s exchange-
traded fund investments.  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced resolution
of its allegations against Spencer Mindlin, 33, and Alfred
Mindlin, 68, in a cease-and-desist  order  posted to its website
today.  The two men are jointly required to pay $57,481 in
disgorgement and $10,081 in interest on proceeds from the
illegal trades, according to the SEC. Spencer Mindlin is to pay
an additional $25,000 civil money penalty, the SEC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
