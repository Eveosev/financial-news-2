Zimmer Holdings Inc. (ZMH) , the world’s
top seller of hip and knee implants, jumped the most in a month
in New York trading after forecasting 2012 profit that may top
analyst estimates.  Zimmer climbed 3.2 percent to $59.61 in New York for its
biggest one-day jump since Dec. 20. Earnings excluding items
this year may reach $5.20 to $5.40 a share, the Warsaw, Indiana-
based company said in a statement today. The average of 30
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $5.22.  The orthopedics maker also reported fourth-quarter profit
and sales that topped estimates, boosted by growth outside the
U.S. Share repurchases helped the results and a restructuring
for 2012, expected to generate annual pretax savings of more
than $80 million, bodes well, said Tao Levy, a Collins Stewart
LLC analyst in  New York .  U.S. implant procedures, which had been declining, “appear
to be stabilizing and international looks like it further
improved,” Levy said in a note to clients. He rates the stock a
“buy” “due to our view that orthopedic trends will improve.”  Fourth-quarter net income surged to $156.1 million, or 87
cents a share, from $34.9 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier,
Zimmer said in the statement. Earnings excluding items of $1.36
topped the average analyst estimate of $1.34. Sales of $1.17
billion beat the average estimate of $1.16 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
