Russia’s export  steel prices  started
to recover in January as stockpiles declined, Metal Bulletin
data shows.  The price for hot rolled coil, a benchmark, increased for
the first time since the end of October. It reached $625 a
metric ton last week, compared with a 12-month low of $577 in
December. The price peaked at $790 per a ton in February.  “The demand is healthy as steel stockpiles were low and
even the European market is feeling better,” Anastasia Gracheva, a Moscow-based UBS analyst, said by phone. She expects
prices to climb by as much as 10 percent in the first quarter
compared with the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
