Swedish consumer confidence improved
from near the lowest in 2 1/2 years after the central bank cut
 interest rates  last month to stimulate growth in the largest
Nordic economy.  The consumer confidence index rose to minus 1.3 in January
from minus 7.4 the prior month, the Stockholm-based National
 Institute of Economic Research  said today. Economists predicted
minus 7, according to the median of 11 forecasts in a Bloomberg
 survey . A  manufacturing confidence  index fell to minus 14 from
minus 11.  Sweden ’s central bank, the Riksbank, last month cut its
 benchmark repo rate  for the first time since 2009, lowering it
to 1.75 percent to buoy growth and protect from the fallout of
 Europe ’s debt crisis. The bank predicted it would keep its rate
unchanged over the next year.  Sweden’s economy probably entered a recession this quarter,
and annual growth may only reach 0.6 percent this year,  Swedbank
AB (SWEDA)  predicted on Jan. 24, citing slumping exports and rising
unemployment. Europe’s turmoil will “definitely” get worse
before the situation improves, Finance Minister Anders Borg said
last week.  Inflation (SWCPYOY)  expectations over the next 12 months rose to 2.7
percent in January from 2.4 percent the previous month, the
institute said. The Riksbank targets 2 percent inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
