Facebook Inc. and  Washington  State
sued Adscend Media LLC for running a $20 million-a-year spam
scheme that leads social-media users to advertising sites by
offering fake links to salacious videos.  Lawsuits were filed in federal courts in  Seattle  and
California today, Washington Attorney General Rob McKenna and
Facebook lawyer Craig Clark said. The Adscend scheme spreads
when a post that appears to come from a friend appears on a
person’s Facebook page with a link to a video, McKenna said at a
news conference in Seattle.  When a Facebook user clicks on the link, a box that appears
to come from  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook pops up and
asks the user to confirm that he or she is older than 13 years
of age, McKenna said. When it’s clicked, the original post is
sent to all of the user’s Facebook friends. The video link then
leads users to advertising sites that pay a commission to
Adscend, McKenna said.  Ali Fehzan, a co-founder of Adscend, declined to comment on
the lawsuits in a telephone interview.  The complaints allege violations of U.S. anti-spam laws and
seek court orders blocking Adscend from accessing Facebook and
targeting its users, as well as triple damages.  The  California  case is Facebook Inc. v. Adscend Media LLC,
12-414, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
( San Francisco ). The Washington case is State of Washington v.
Adscend Media LLC, 12-cv-139, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
