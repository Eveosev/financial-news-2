Drew Brees , the  New Orleans  Saints’s
popular quarterback, had an exceptional season in 2011, breaking
a number of records. It reaffirmed his elite status and
catapulted him to new levels of fame and influence.  The 6 ft., 209 lb. quarterback broke Dan Marino’s 27-year-old
National Football League record for most passing yards in a
season, finishing the season with 5,476 yards. Brees, 33, also
completed a record 71.2 percent of his passes and threw for more
than 300 yards in 13 of 16 regular-season games, the most in NFL
history.  That performance, coupled with lingering goodwill for the
role he played in helping the City of New Orleans claw its way
back from Hurricane Katrina’s devastation, vaulted Brees to the
 No. 1 spot  in this year’s  Power 100 , a ranking by CSE, an
integrated sports and marketing firm in Atlanta, and Horrow
Sports Ventures that uses data from Encino (Calif.)-based
research company E-Poll Market Research.  CSE evaluated about 600 of the best-performing athletes from
a pool of 3,000 based on statistics, the popularity and viewing
audience of their sports, endorsement earnings, and their reach
on social media. Nielsen/E-Poll N-Score data, based on surveys
that evaluate such factors as players’ name and face awareness,
appeal, influence, and trustworthiness, were also included to
measure athletes’ endorsement potential. (Here’s more about the
methodology.)  Football Dominates the Pack  The NFL dominated this year’s Top 100 list with 26 players,
followed by the National Basketball Assn., with 20 players, and
 Major League Baseball , with 16.  In 2011, Brees led the Saints to a 13-3 regular-season record
(later losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs), and
his “record-breaking on-field performance, combined with
universal recognition of his charitable and community work”
pushed him to the top spot, says Rick Horrow, president of
Horrow Sports Ventures. The Brees Dream Foundation, which he
founded in 2003, has contributed over $7 million to cancer
research and care and to rebuild schools, parks, playgrounds,
and athletic fields in New Orleans, San Diego, and Purdue, Ind.,
according to the foundation’s website.  “He’s clearly an endorsement darling now,” says Horrow. The
quarterback earned $16 million in salary and endorsements in
2011, according to data from CSE.  Brees first appeared in the 2010 Power 100 at 25th place. He
led the Saints to their first-ever Super Bowl victory that year
and has since soared in the ranking, to seventh place in 2011.  Absent: Lance Armstrong  Rounding out this year’s top five: Green Bay Packers
quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  (who had $19 million in earnings,
estimates CSE), New England Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  ($28
million), Miami Heat basketball forward  LeBron James  ($61
million), and tennis champion  Rafael Nadal  ($21.7 million).  Newcomers to the list include Novak Djokovic (who had a near-
perfect tennis season) at No. 9, rising golf star Rory McIlroy
at No. 21, and the  Los Angeles Dodgers ’s  Matt Kemp , who signed a
contract extension worth $160 million over eight years, the
largest in National League history, at No. 32.  As Brees rose to the top, last year’s most powerful athlete,
 Peyton Manning , fell to 51st place because of injuries. Golfer
 Phil Mickelson  dropped from No. 4 to No. 18 after a
disappointing season.  Lance Armstrong , No. 8 last year, fell off
the list entirely. The pro cyclist announced his retirement in
February and came under scrutiny for alleged drug use; Armstrong
denied doping allegations.  “The real key is measuring how these superstars perform,”
says Horrow. In athletics, power means “earning power for
athletes, owner, agents, communities, and corporate brands.” As
this year’s list shows, an athlete’s value can change
dramatically in one year.  (Click  here  to see the complete 2012 Power 100.)  -- Editor: Daniel Beucke  To contact the writer on this story:
