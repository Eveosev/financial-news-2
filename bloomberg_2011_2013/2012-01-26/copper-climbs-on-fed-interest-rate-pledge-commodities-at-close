The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.5 percent to close at 664.92 at
5:17 p.m. in  New York  as base metals and wheat climbed.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices gained 0.6
percent to 1,606.229.  BASE METALS  Copper rose to a four-month high in New York after the
Federal Reserve extended a pledge yesterday to hold interest
rates near zero, potentially spurring metals demand. Tin climbed
the most since September.  Borrowing costs will stay down through at least late 2014,
the Fed said. It previously vowed to maintain low rates at least
until the middle of next year. The central bank also said it may
buy more assets to spur growth. Copper also gained as orders to
draw the metal from London Metal Exchange inventories reached
the highest level since May 2009, and U.S. durable-goods orders
rose more than forecast last month.  On the Comex, copper futures for March delivery climbed 1.9
percent to settle at $3.9015. Earlier, the price reached
$3.9105, the highest level since Sept. 19, and topped the 200-
day moving average for the first time since August.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery rose 2.5 percent to $8,590 a metric ton ($3.90 a
pound).  Nickel, lead, zinc and aluminum climbed in London.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures rose to a three-week high on signs of
increasing demand from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter,
while Russian supplies decline.  U.S. exporters sold 618,700 metric tons in the week ended
Jan. 19, the most since September, the Department of Agriculture
said today. Shipments from  Russia , which lifted an export ban on
July 1, have surged to 19.5 million tons, a record for this time
of year. That pace may have a “dramatic” slowdown until June
as supplies ebb, the USDA has said.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for March
delivery rose 1.9 percent to settle at $6.535 a bushel. Earlier,
the price reached $6.5825, the highest level for a most- active
contract since Jan. 4. The grain has climbed for six straight
days, jumping 10 percent since Jan. 18.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil and gasoline gained on the  Federal Reserve ’s
pledge to maintain near-zero interest rates.  On the Nymex, February-delivery heating oil rose 3.43
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $3.0535 a gallon, the highest
settlement since Jan. 12. Gasoline for February delivery rose
1.28 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.8466.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures rose, extending the longest rally in three
months, on speculation that reforms in  Ivory Coast , the world’s
top grower, will boost production costs for exporters. Sugar and
coffee also gained.  Ivory Coast is re-examining tax breaks given to cocoa
exporters that grind beans in the West African nation after a
group of buyers and cooperatives asked for the subsidies to be
scrapped.  Cocoa for March delivery rose 1.2 percent to settle at
$2,452 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
climbed for the fourth straight day, the longest rally since
late October. Earlier, the commodity reached $2,474, the highest
price for a most-active contract since Nov. 18.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to
24.73 cents a pound. The price has climbed 6.1 percent this
month.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 1.2
percent to $2.197 a pound.  In London futures trading, cocoa and refined sugar rose,
while robusta coffee declined on NYSE Liffe.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose to a seven-week high as the Federal
Reserve’s pledge to keep U.S. borrowing costs low drove the
dollar down, boosting demand for precious metals as alternative
assets. Silver jumped to a two-month high.  The greenback fell to the lowest in almost seven weeks
against a basket of currencies. Yesterday, the Fed said that its
benchmark  interest rate  will stay low until at least late 2014,
and gold surged 2.1 percent, the most in three weeks.  On the Comex, gold futures for April delivery gained 1.6
percent to settle at $1,729.90 an ounce, the highest closing
level since Dec. 7. Prices have jumped 10 percent this month,
heading for the biggest January gain since 2008.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 1.9 percent to
$33.743 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached $33.79, the highest
since Nov. 17.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery advanced
2.4 percent to $1,616.80 an ounce, rising the most in more than
a week. Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent
to $694.45 an ounce.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose on the Federal Reserve pledge and as a report
showed durable goods orders in the world’s biggest crude-
consuming country increased.  Futures advanced 0.3 percent as Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday that policy makers are considering more
bond purchases to boost growth after extending the pledge to
maintain interest rates. Bookings for goods meant to last at
least three years climbed 3 percent in December, data from the
Commerce Department showed today.  On the Nymex, crude oil for March delivery increased 30
cents to $99.70 a barrel, the highest settlement price since
Jan. 19. Prices are up 14 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for March settlement rose 98 cents, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $110.79 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell in New York for the first time in
five days after a government report showed the surplus of the
heating and power-plant fuel expanded to the widest level in 31
months.  Gas dropped 4.5 percent after the Energy Department said
U.S. inventories were 21.4 percent above the five-year average
for the week ended Jan. 20, wider than a 20.8 percent surplus
reported for the prior week. Mild weather has crimped gas use
during the fuel’s peak-demand season while producers pumped fuel
at record rates.  On the Nymex, natural gas for February delivery fell 12.4
cents to settle at $2.605 per million British thermal units.
Futures have dropped 13 percent this year and slid to $2.231 on
Jan. 23, the lowest intraday price since February 2002.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell the most in four weeks on speculation
that demand will ease as U.S. meatpackers lose money on beef
sales. Hogs dropped to a two-week low.  About 490,000 cattle were slaughtered this week, down 3.2
percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Beef processors are losing about $95 per animal this week
as meat prices fail to keep pace with gains in cattle, said  Don
Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa .  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
April delivery fell 0.9 percent to close at $1.2805 a pound, the
biggest drop for a most-active contract since Dec. 27.  Yesterday, the price reached $1.29675, the highest since
the commodity started trading on the CME in 1964. Futures have
climbed 14 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement declined 0.9
percent to $1.53625 a pound. Yesterday, the price climbed to a

cents a pound. Earlier, the price reached 86.425 cents, the

this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
