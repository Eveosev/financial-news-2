The International Finance Corp., the
 World Bank ’s private lending arm, plans to invest $1.1 billion
to $1.2 billion in  Mexico ’s home-building and financial sectors.  The IFC may also invest in companies that bid on incentive-
based contracts to develop mature oil fields offered by state
crude producer Petroleos Mexicanos, said Roberto Albisseti, an
IFC representative in Mexico, speaking during an event in Mexico
City today.  The IFC will also invest in Mexican education, energy and
telecommunications, Albisseti said, without specifying how much.  -Editor: Jonathan Roeder  To contact the reporter on this story:
