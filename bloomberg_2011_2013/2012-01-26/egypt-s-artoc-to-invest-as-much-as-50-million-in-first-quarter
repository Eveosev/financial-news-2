ARTOC Group for Investment &
Development, an Egyptian real-estate and industrial company with
stakes in Amazon.com Inc and Tesco PLC, plans to invest as much
as $50 million before the end of March.  ARTOC, which had more than $1 billion in revenue in 2010,
is seeking opportunities in real estate in the U.S. and Western
Europe, Chairman Shafik Gabr said in an interview at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland today. The  investment
company  is also in talks with a U.S.-based corporation
“involved in digital media” to transform their platform into
Arabic, he said, declining to provide further details.  “We have always been looking” for investment
opportunities outside Egypt, Gabr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
