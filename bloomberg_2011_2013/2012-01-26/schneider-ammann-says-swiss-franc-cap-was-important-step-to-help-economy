Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said the  Swiss central bank ’s decision to
impose a franc ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro was the “most
important step” to help bolster the economy.  “The first and second quarter should be more critical than
the second half,” Schneider-Ammann told reporters at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, today, when calling the
economic environment in 2012 “difficult.” Companies “are well
aware that the purchasing-power parity is significantly higher
than 1.20. But they haven’t put new demands.”  He also said that it’s up to the  Swiss National Bank  to
take decisions on the franc.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
