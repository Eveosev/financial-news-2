The Philippine peso rose to a 12-
week high and bonds gained on speculation investors will seek
higher-yielding assets after the  Federal Reserve  predicted U.S.
borrowing costs will stay near zero.  The Fed said yesterday it sees “exceptionally low”
 interest rates  through 2014, having previously pledged to
refrain from any tightening until at least the middle of 2013.
Ten-year government notes  yielded  335 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, down from 354 basis points at the
end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We may see more inflows,” said Lito Mercado, head of
trading at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. “Risk is
back, so  emerging markets  will be OK. The Fed is doing something
to protect the economy.”  The peso climbed 0.7 percent to 42.838 per dollar at the
close in  Manila  and reached 42.815, the highest level since Nov.
3, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has advanced
2.4 percent this month.  Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said the Fed’s move
gives the Southeast Asian nation and other emerging-market
economies “some policy breather to concentrate on improving
domestic demand.”  “To the extent that the Fed action sustains the positive
growth outlook in the U.S., this should also be positive for our
own trade prospects,” Tetangco said in a mobile-phone message.  The yield on the 6.375 percent bonds due January 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.23 percent,
according to prices from Amstel Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
