Riverbed Technology Inc. (RVBD) , a maker of
computer-networking products, dropped the most in six months
after the company’s first-quarter sales and profit forecasts
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Riverbed tumbled 18 percent to $24.45 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest decline since July 20. The shares fell 33
percent last year.  Sales will be $183 million to $187 million, the company
said on a conference call. That was below the $197.3 million
average  estimate  from analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Profit
excluding some items will be 19 cents to 20 cents a share,
compared with the average estimate of 25 cents.  For the fourth quarter, profit before certain costs was 25
cents a share on sales of $202.8 million, the San Francisco-
based company said in a statement. That exceeded analysts’
average projection for profit of 24 cents and sales of $200.8
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
