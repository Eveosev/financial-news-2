Russian stocks advanced to their
highest level in more than seven weeks after the  Federal
Reserve ’s pledge to keep  interest rates  low boosted commodities.  The 30-stock  Micex (MICEX)  Index added 1.1 percent to 1,514.72 by
the close in Moscow, its strongest since Dec. 5. VTB Group,
 Russia ’s second-largest bank, jumped 5.4 percent. United Co.
Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum company, and OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,
Russia’s largest producer of coal for steelmaking, surged 4.2
percent and 6.2 percent, respectively. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index gained 2.5 percent to 1,573.04, its highest level
since Nov. 8.  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, gained and copper
and nickel prices advanced after the Fed said it will keep U.S.
rates “exceptionally low” until at least 2014 to bolster the
world’s largest economy and biggest oil consumer. Energy sales
contributed almost 50 percent of Russian government revenue last
year and commodity-related companies make up four of the top
five  biggest stocks  on the Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index.  “The Fed’s decision is being cheered by markets and
accompanied by a weakening dollar,”  Slava Smolyaninov and
Leonid Slipchenko, analysts at UralSib Capital in Moscow, wrote
in a research note today. “We see a very good short-term buying
opportunity in Russian equities, and expect them to
outperform.”  The Micex has gained 8 percent this year and trades at 5.8
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with a 12 percent gain in 2012 for  Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index, which trades at 10.1 times estimated earnings, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
trades at 9.5 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India
Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 15.1.  Oil Climbs  Russian depositary receipts of Rusal jumped to 235.49
rubles, their highest close since Nov. 18. Novolipetsk Steel,
Russian billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, added 2.3
percent to 74.04 rubles.  Mechel, Russia’s largest producer of
coal for steel making, rose to 353 rubles.  Oil climbed on prospects that the Fed’s commitment to
holding rates low for at least two years may bolster growth and
cut unemployment in the U.S., boosting fuel demand. Crude for
March delivery increased as much as 2 percent to $101.39 a
barrel in  New York  while Brent oil rose 1.9 percent to $111.89
in  London .  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil company, added 0.8
percent to 228.64 rubles.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03) , Russia’s biggest lender, advanced 3.7 percent
to 90.31 rubles, its highest level since August, as the ruble
strengthened against the dollar for a ninth day. A stronger
ruble discourages Russians from withdrawing and converting ruble
deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  With assistance from Jason Corcoran in Moscow. Editors: Ash
