Developers installed  wind turbines 
with capacity of 6,810 megawatts in the U.S. last year, 31
percent more than in 2010, as they rushed to qualify for a
federal-tax grant that expired last month, according to an
industry group.  Fourth-quarter installations reached 3,444 megawatts,
topping the first three quarters combined, led by California,
Illinois and Ohio, the fastest-growing state, the American Wind
Energy Association said today in a report.  New wind farms with capacity of more than 8,300 megawatts
are under construction now. Developers will try to complete them
before another federal incentive expires Dec. 31. The
Washington-based trade group is pressing Congress to extend the
Production Tax Credit of 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour for wind
power to prevent manufacturers from firing workers by 2013.  “It is urgent that Congress extend the Production Tax
Credit now, before the end of the first quarter, or risk losing
a new manufacturing sector to foreign countries,”  Denise Bode ,
AWEA’s chief executive officer, said today on a conference call.  A U.S. Treasury Department program that offered cash grants
of as much as 30 percent of development costs ended last year.  General Electric Co. (GE)  held onto its position as the top
supplier last year, delivering turbines with capacity of 2,000
megawatts, followed by  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  with 1,768
megawatts and  Siemens AG (SIE)  with 938.8 megawatts.  Vestas, the world’s largest turbine manufacturer, this
month said it would cut 1,600 jobs at its U.S. factories should
Congress fail to extend the tax credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
