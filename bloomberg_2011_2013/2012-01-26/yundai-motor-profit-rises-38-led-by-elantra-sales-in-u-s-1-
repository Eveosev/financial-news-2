Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and its smaller
affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  fell in Seoul trading after South
Korea’s two biggest automakers reported fourth-quarter profits
that missed analysts’ estimates.  Hyundai fell for a second day, slipping as much as 3.7
percent to 220,500 won at 10:44 a.m. on the Korea Exchange,
while Kia dropped as much as 2.9 percent. Seoul-based Hyundai,
maker of the Elantra sedan, yesterday reported net income that
was about 10 percent below the average analyst estimate compiled
by Bloomberg, while Optima-maker Kia today delivered profit that
was 27 percent lower than the average estimate.  The share declines signal investors are betting that
Hyundai and Kia, the two best performers on the  Bloomberg World
Auto Manufacturers Index (BWAUTM)  in 2011, will fail to replicate their
success this year as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
recover from natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. This week,
Honda President forecast Takanobu Ito forecast earnings will
climb to the highest in at least five years and Toyota raised
its sales forecast.  “There’s an underlying concern that Hyundai and Kia may
not perform as well as they did last year,” said Lee Jin Woo, a
fund manager at Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co., which
manages the equivalent of $3.6 billion in assets, including
Hyundai and Kia shares. “This uncertainty will continue
throughout the year, and each misstep will trigger the
concern.”  Hyundai’s full-year net income rose 35 percent to 8.1
trillion won ($7.2 billion), more than the combined estimated
earnings at Toyota and  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co. Still, the quarterly
results missed estimates because of unexpected bonus payments at
financial affiliate Hyundai Capital, Gregory Kim, an analyst at
 Mirae Asset Securities Co. (037620)  in Seoul, said yesterday.  Kia, the maker of the Optima sedan and Rio compact, today
delivered fourth-quarter net income, operating profit and
revenue that missed average analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
