Sales of new U.S. homes unexpectedly
declined in December for the first time in four months, capping
the slowest year on record for builders.  Purchases (NHSLTOT)  of single-family properties decreased 2.2 percent
to a 307,000 annual pace, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists called for a rate of 321,000 home
sales. Last year marked the worst year for the industry in
records going back to 1963.  The threat of further price declines may be dissuading some
Americans from buying a new home even with  mortgage rates  near
all-time lows and more people finding work. Following a lull in
2011, a wave of foreclosures may hamper the recovery in real
estate as more distressed properties are put on the market.  “Builders continue to contend with a number of existing
homes that are deeply discounted,” said  Anika Khan , an
economist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,  North
Carolina . “We’re expecting a bit of a pickup in 2012, but we
won’t see a meaningful increase as long as new homes are
competing with those existing homes.”  Today’s figures underscore the  Federal Reserve ’s view that
the housing market is holding back the U.S. expansion. In 2011,
builders sold 302,000 homes, down 6.2 percent from 2010. Sales
in the Northeast and West were also the lowest on record, while
purchases in the South were the weakest since 1966.  Stocks reversed gains after the figures. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to 1,324.92 at 10:46 a.m. in
 New York  after climbing as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.95
percent from 2 percent late yesterday.  Economists’ Projections  Projections from the 75 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from 309,000 to 350,000. The government revised November
sales to a 314,000 rate from a previously reported 315,000.  The December decrease in new-home purchases was led by a
10.1 percent drop in the South, the biggest decline since May
2010. Sales also fell in the Midwest. Demand increased 46.7
percent in the Northeast, a rebound from the 16.7 percent
decrease the previous month.  The median price of a new house purchased last month
declined 12.8 percent, the biggest drop since February 2009,
from December 2010 to $210,300, today’s report showed.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate increased to
6.1 months’ worth from 6 months in November. There were 157,000
new houses on the market at the end of last month, the fewest on
record.  Fannie Mae  Home sales and construction will improve in 2012,
contributing “modestly” to economic expansion after acting as
a drag on growth since 2006, according to a  Fannie Mae  forecast
earlier this month. Sales of new and existing homes will
probably increase 3.5 percent and housing starts are projected
to rise 16 percent, the group’s chief economist said Jan. 13.  Builders are becoming more optimistic. The National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index  rose 
this month to the highest level since June 2007 as sales and
buyer traffic improved. Last month, they broke ground on 470,000
single-family houses at an annual rate, the most since April
2010, Commerce Department figures show.  “The economy is beginning to firm up,” Douglas Yearley
Jr., chief executive officer of  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , said in a
Jan. 11 interview with Bloomberg Television. “We see more
people coming out to buy. Affordability has never been better.”  New Construction  A sustained decline in the number of existing homes for
sale will also support new construction. The number of
properties on the market in December dropped to 2.38 million,
the fewest since March 2005, the National Association of
Realtors said last week. At the current sales pace, it would
take 6.2 months to sell those houses, down from 7.2 months at
the end of November. A range of seven months to eight months
supply is consistent with stable  home prices , the group has
said.  There is a chance that inventory could rise, hindering more
progress for new home sales. Banks may seize more than 1 million
U.S. homes in 2012 after legal scrutiny of foreclosure practices
slowed actions against delinquent property owners in 2011,
RealtyTrac Inc., an Irvine, California-based data seller, said
Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
