Reliever Andrew Bailey agreed to a
one-year contract with the Boston  Red Sox , leaving only
designated hitter  David Ortiz  and relief pitcher Alfredo Aceves
as players eligible for salary arbitration.  The Red Sox didnâ€™t disclose terms in a statement on their
website last night. The contract is worth $3.9 million, ESPN
reported.  The 27-year-old right-hander joined the Red Sox in a trade
from the  Oakland Athletics  on Dec. 28. The two-time All-Star had
24 saves and a 3.24 earned run average in 42 relief appearances
with Oakland last season.  Bailey was selected by the Athletics in the sixth round of
the 2006 draft. During his three Major League Baseball seasons,
he has converted 75 of 84 save opportunities while posting a
2.07 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
