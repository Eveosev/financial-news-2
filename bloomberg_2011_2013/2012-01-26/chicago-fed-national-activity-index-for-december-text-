Following is the text of the Chicago
Fed’s National Activity Index from the Federal  Reserve Bank  of
Chicago.  Led by improvements in production- and employment-related
indicators, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index increased to
+0.17 in December from -0.46 in November. Two of the four broad
categories of indicators that make up the index
improved from November, and only the consumption and housing
category’s contribution remained negative in December.  The index’s three-month moving average, CFNAI-MA3, increased
from -0.19 in November to -0.08 in December-- its highest value
since March 2011. December’s CFNAI-MA3 suggests that growth in
national economic activity was slightly below its historical
trend. The economic slack reflected in this level of the CFNAI-
MA3 suggests limited inflationary pressure from economic
activity over the coming year.  The contribution from production-related indicators to the index
rose sharply to +0.24 in December from -0.28 in November.
Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in December after
edging down 0.3 percent in the previous month. Similarly,
manufacturing production rose by 0.9 percent in December after
declining by 0.4 percent in November, and manufacturing capacity
utilization increased to 75.9 percent in December from 75.3
percent in the previous month.  The employment-related indicators’ contribution to the index was
+0.22 in December, up from +0.08 in November. The  unemployment
rate  decreased from 8.7 percent in November to 8.5 percent in
December. Likewise, over the same period, the monthly average of
weekly initial claims for  unemployment insurance  fell from
395,000 to 375,000--its lowest level since May 2008. The sales,
orders, and inventories category made a contribution of +0.01 to
the index in December, remaining level from November. In
contrast, the contribution from the consumption and housing
category to the index was -0.29 in December, down slightly from
-0.27 in November. Housing starts decreased to 657,000
annualized units in December from 685,000 in November, and
housing permits ticked down to 679,000 annualized units from
680,000 over the same period.  Fifty-three of the 85 individual indicators made positive
contributions to the index in December, while 32 made negative
contributions. Fifty-six indicators improved from November to
December, while 27 indicators deteriorated and two were
unchanged. Of the indicators that improved, 11 made negative
contributions. The index was constructed using data available as
of January 19, 2012. At that time, December data for 50 of the
85 indicators had been published. For all missing data,
estimates were used in constructing the index. The November
monthly index was revised to -0.46 from an initial estimate of -
0.37. Revisions to the monthly index can be attributed to two
main factors: revisions in previously published data and
differences between the estimates of previously unavailable data
and subsequently published data. The revision to the November
monthly index was due primarily to the former.  To contact the reporter on this story:
