Following is the text of the
new home sales report from the Commerce Department.  Sales of new single-family houses in December 2011
were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 307,000,
according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S.
Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.  This is 2.2 percent (+/-13.2%)* below the
revised November rate of 314,000 and is 7.3 percent (+/-
16.6%)* below the December 2010 estimate of 331,000.  The median sales price of new houses sold in December
2011 was $210,300; the average sales price was $266,000.
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at
the end of December was 157,000.  This represents a supply
of 6.1 months at the current sales rate.  An estimated 302,000 new homes were sold in 2011.
This is 6.2 percent (+/-3.6%) below the 2010 figure of
323,000.  New Residential Sales data for January 2012 will be
released on Friday, February 24, 2012, at 10:00 A.M. EST.  * 90% confidence interval includes zero.  The Census
Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to
conclude that the actual change is different from zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.
