Morgan Stanley was sued over about
$1.2 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed securities by
 Bayerische Landesbank  and  Dexia (DEXB)  SA in New York state court.  Bayerische Landesbank, based in Munich and the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, asserts claims on almost
$486 million in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased
in 22 offerings in 2006 and 2007.  Dexia asserts claims on more than $680 million worth of the
securities bought in 21 offerings in 2006 and 2007. Belgium and
 France  are dismantling Brussels-based Dexia, once the world’s
leading lender to municipalities, after the company could no
longer fund itself as the sovereign-debt crisis dried up short-
term financing.  Both banks say in their complaints that the loans
underlying the securities were riskier than promised and that
Morgan Stanley “knew or recklessly disregarded” that the loans
didn’t conform to underwriting standards.  Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
declined to comment on the lawsuits, which were both filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan , because
the company hadn’t received them yet.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The cases are Bayerische Landesbank, New York branch v.
Morgan Stanley, 650230/2012; and Dexia SA/NV v. Morgan Stanley,
650231/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
