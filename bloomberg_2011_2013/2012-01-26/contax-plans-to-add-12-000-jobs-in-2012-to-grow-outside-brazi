Contax Participacoes SA (CTAX3) ,  Brazil ’s
largest call-center company, plans to step up hiring and add
12,000 jobs this year to expand in Latin America and into
technology help-desk services, Chief Financial Officer Marco
Schroeder said.  The hiring plans represent a 10 percent increase in
workforce from 115,000 employees currently at Contax, a Rio de
Janeiro-based company spun off of  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes
SA (TNLP4)  in 2005. About 5,000 of the new positions will be outside of
Brazil to serve Spanish-speaking clients, Schroeder said.  “The main industries we service, telecommunications and
finance, continue to grow and create demand,” Schroeder said in
an interview in Sao Paulo Jan. 24. “The goal now is to expand
into other areas as well as  call centers .”  Contax is seeking to expand in parts of Latin America where
demand is growing faster than in Brazil. The company paid as
much as 332 million reais in May to buy Allus Global BPO Center,
a contact-center company with operations in Argentina, Peru and
Colombia, and clients in Spain and the U.S.  Contax surged  36 percent in the past three months  in Sao
Paulo before today, the best performance within the BM&FBovespa
Small Cap Index. The index gained 5.5 percent in the period.
Contax was little changed at 22.98 reais at 12:03 p.m.  The stock has  3 hold recommendations , one sell and one buy,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Contax is scheduled to
report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28, Schroeder said.  An expansion into technology help-desk services would help
boost profit margins, according to Schroeder. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a share of
revenue probably fell to 8.4 percent in 2011 from 12.4 percent
the previous year, according to analysts’ estimates and data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Margins  “ Latin America  is still a market with little consolidation
and with higher revenue margins,” Schroeder said.  Investment will increase to 160 million reais this year
from 150 million in 2011, Schroeder said. Contax will focus on
consolidating assets that it bought recently and has no new
acquisitions on its radar at the moment, he said.  In January 2011, Contax acquired  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) ’s
Dedic/GPTI unit, which provides contact-center services in
Brazil, for 116 million reais.  Contax is in talks with Brazil’s development bank, known as
BNDES, for a 300 million-real  credit line , which should be
approved by the end of the first half, Schroeder said. The funds
will be used to finance its investment plan. The company’s gross
debt was 898.2 million reais in September 2011, according to a
statement reporting its third-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
