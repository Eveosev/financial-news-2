Mild weather is forecast to linger
across the eastern U.S. into the first week of February,
according to forecasters.  New York City  may have a high temperature of 52 degrees
Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) on Feb. 1, said  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Average temperatures along the East Coast may be 5 to 7
degrees above normal, MDA said in its 6- to 10-day forecast. The
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley may be 8 to 14 degrees above normal.  Traders watch long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling. About 51 percent
of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Weather Derivatives
meteorologist  David Salmon  predicted temperatures in the
northern Great Plains to Great Lakes and south into  Arkansas 
will average about 10 degrees above normal.  Commodity Weather Group LLC President Matt Rogers calls for
a similar pattern of above-normal temperatures in his 6- to 10-
day outlook.  The East Coast may return to more seasonal weather from
Feb. 5 to Feb. 9, Rogers, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in
his 11- to 15-day outlook.  MDA’s forecast for the same timeframe also predicts
seasonal weather in the East, with the exception of northern
Maine, which may be warmer than normal, and the South, which may
be cooler.  Salmon, in Belton, Missouri, doesn’t issue an 11- to 15-day
forecast.  The normal average temperature in  New York  for Feb. 2 is 34
degrees, according to MDA. In Boston it’s 30; in  Chicago , 24;
Atlanta, 45; Houston, 54; Seattle, 43; and Burbank, California,
56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
