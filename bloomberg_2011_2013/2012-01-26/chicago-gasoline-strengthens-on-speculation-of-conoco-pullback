Chicago  gasoline strengthened on
speculation that ConocoPhillips lowered production at its Wood
River refinery in Illinois. Conoco called the rumors unfounded
and said operations are “routine” at the plant.  “Word has them cutting runs in half,” Steve Mosby, vice
president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in Kansas
City,  Missouri , said in an instant message. Profit margins for
using West Texas Intermediate crude oil to make fuel products
“aren’t going to cut it,” he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 2.5 cents to 25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:12 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount was 33
cents on Jan. 24. Prompt delivery rose 3.84 cents to $2.6008 a
gallon.  “Recent rumors and reports of the Wood River Refinery
cutting rates are unfounded and operations at the refinery are
routine at this time,”  Rich Johnson , a spokesman for Conoco,
said in an e-mail.  The 380,900-barrel-a-day plant is jointly owned by
ConocoPhillips and Cenovus Energy Inc.  Last month ConocoPhillips completed a project to increase
the refinery’s crude capacity by 50,000 barrels a day and
enhance its ability to process heavy Canadian crude.  Conventional, 87-octane in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3,
strengthened 0.5 cent to a discount of 21.25 cents a gallon
versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
