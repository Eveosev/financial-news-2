RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) , a maker of
software for playing audio and video files, surged the most in
more than a decade after the company sold patents to  Intel Corp. (INTC) 
for $120 million.  The  shares  jumped 35 percent to $9.89 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , the biggest gain since May 16, 2001. Seattle-based
RealNetworks had lost 2 percent of its value this year before
today.  RealNetworks, a company struggling to return to
profitability after three years of  declining sales , is signing
over 190 patents and 170 patent applications worldwide to Intel.
It will retain rights to continue using the intellectual
property in current and future products, according to a
statement from Intel.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is getting patents
that cover media streaming, which lets users listen to music and
watch programs over the Internet. The  Santa Clara , California-
based company plans to use RealNetworks’ technology to improve
its products for laptops and smartphones.  Intel is bolstering its mobile technology as it pushes its
chips into the smartphone market. Earlier this month, the
chipmaker said Lenovo Group Ltd. and Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. will start using its processors in handsets this year, a
breakthrough in Intel’s decade-long campaign to win mobile-phone
customers.  RealNetworks has reported a loss in its most recent three
quarters. The company plans to release its latest results on
Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
