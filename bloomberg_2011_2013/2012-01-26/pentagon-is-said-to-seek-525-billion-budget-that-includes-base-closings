The Pentagon will seek a $525
billion budget for fiscal 2013 and ask Congress for authority to
close domestic military bases, according to a person familiar
with plans to be announced today.  In addition to the base-closing authority, Defense
Secretary  Leon Panetta  will propose reducing the Army from
562,000 personnel to 490,000 by fiscal 2017 and the Marines from
202,000 to 182,000 by that date, according to the person, who
spoke on condition of anonymity before Panetta outlines his
budget plans later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
