Aviation insurers, a group including
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and  Allianz SE (ALV) , probably had
their first underwriting profit in five years as fatalities fell
to the lowest level since 1984, broker  Aon Corp. (AON)  said.  Insurers collected about $1.8 billion in renewal premiums
last year, and incurred an estimated $1.13 billion in claims,
the Chicago-based insurance broker said in a report today.  “The low level of claims in 2011 has meant that the market
is estimated to have enjoyed healthy returns overall,” Aon said
in the report.  Insurers benefited from reduced costs after the 2009 Air
France crash off the coast of  Brazil  and engine failure on an
Airbus SAS A380 jet operated by  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  in 2010
contributed to industrywide underwriting losses those years.
Flying is now about twice as safe as it was 15 years ago,
according to a  report  this month from Ascend, a data and
analytics provider for aerospace investors.  Last year’s worst crash happened July 8, when 83 people
died after a Hewa Bora Airways Boeing Co. 727-100 undershot the
runway on landing in Kisangani, Congo, Ascend said. Thirty-five
people survived the crash.  Other fatal incidents included an  Iran  Air Boeing 727-200
crash that killed 69 passengers and nine crew members in
Orumiyeh, Iran, in January 2011. A Rusair Tupolev 134 crash in
Petrozavodsk,  Russia , killed 45 people in June. In September, a
Russian plane carrying the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team
crashed into a river juts after takeoff, killing 44, according
to Ascend.  Airline Fatalities  There were 175 fatalities covered under standard liability
policies through the first 11 months of last year, compared with
an average of 582, Aon said in a report last month. Not all
incidents are covered by insurance.  AIG sells the most aircraft protection among U.S.-regulated
providers, with 21 percent of the market, according to 2010 data
compiled by the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners .
 Allianz (ALV)  ranks second and  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  is third.  Prices for hull and liability protection fell 3 percent for
coverage placed in 2011, as the low level of claims increased
capacity, pressuring rates, according to Aon. Premiums may be
little changed or decline in 2012 for airlines that have well
understood risks, the broker said.  “A single major incident could harden the market quickly,
however, particularly given the high level of claims prior to
2011,” Aon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
