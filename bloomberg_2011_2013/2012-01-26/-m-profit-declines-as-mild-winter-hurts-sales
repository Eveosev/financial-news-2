Hennes & Mauritz AB ,  Europe ’s
second-largest clothing retailer, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 2.4 percent, matching analysts’ estimates, as mild winter
weather weighed on sales of coats and scarves.  Net income slipped to 5.36 billion kronor ($797 million) in
the three months ended Nov. 30, from 5.49 billion kronor a year
earlier, Stockholm-based H&M said in a statement today.  The retailer, which sells dresses for $12.95, has reported
declining profit for the past five quarters as cotton and labor
costs in Asia increase and as consumers scale back spending in
its European main market.  H&M “continued to gain market share during what was one of
the toughest years for a long time for the fashion retail
industry in many countries,” Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson said in the statement. “The situation in the sourcing
markets has also been challenging.”  Sales increased 12 percent at local currency rates so far
this month, after rising 13 percent in December. The Swedish
retailer, which is selling a collection by Italian fashion house
Gianni Versace SpA, last month reported a 3 percent decline in
fourth-quarter sales, as shoppers delayed buying winter garments
amid mild weather.  H&M slipped 0.2 percent to 224.20 kronor in Stockholm
trading yesterday. The stock has risen 1.3 percent this year,
less than the 6 percent gain for larger competitor  Inditex SA (ITX) ,
owner of the Zara chain.  The average estimate for net income was 5.37 billion
kronor, according to a  Bloomberg survey  of 14 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
