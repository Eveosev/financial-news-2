European stocks  advanced, climbing
20 percent from the September low and entering a bull market,
after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it may keep interest
rates low through 2014 and a report said Greece’s creditors will
make a new offer for a debt-swap deal.  Commodity shares led gains, with  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio
Tinto Group adding at least 3 percent.  Nokia (NOK1V)  Oyj, the world’s
biggest maker of mobile phones, rallied after smartphone
shipments beat estimates in the fourth quarter.  Petropavlovsk
Plc (POG)  jumped 11 percent after reporting a 24 percent increase in
2011 gold production.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 1.1 percent to 257.86 at
the close in  London  as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  made the
case for a third round of asset purchases. The benchmark gauge
has rallied  20 percent  from its low on Sept. 22 amid signs that
the  U.S. economy  is recovering and speculation that the euro
area will contain its debt crisis. Analysts describe a  bull
market  as a gain of 20 percent from the most-recent low.  “Bernanke is saying he’s ‘all in’ as long as the recovery
isn’t any stronger,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, a Copenhagen-based
strategist at Nordea Bank AB, who helps oversee $230 billion.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose 1.3
percent, France’s CAC 40 Index added 1.5 percent and  Germany ’s
DAX Index gained 1.8 percent.  Monetary Accommodation  U.S. policy makers are “prepared to provide further
monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient
progress towards our assessment of its maximum level, or if
inflation shows signs of moving further below its mandate-
consistent rate,” Bernanke said yesterday after European
markets closed. Bond buying is “an option that’s certainly on
the table,” he added.  The Fed also extended its pledge to keep  interest rates  low
through at least late 2014.  Orders for U.S  durable goods  rose 3 percent in December,
exceeding the 2 percent growth estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Orders advanced for a third month boosted
by demand for aircraft, autos and business equipment.  Initial jobless claims  for unemployment insurance payments
climbed by 21,000 to 377,000 in the week ended Jan. 21, up from
an almost four-year low in the prior period, Labor Department
figures showed in  Washington . The median forecast of 47
economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected 370,000.  Credit Default Swaps  The cost of insuring against default on European corporate
debt fell to the lowest in five months. The Markit iTraxx

companies dropped 29 basis points to 607, the lowest since Aug.

officials resume in Athens today, the newspaper said.  Italian bonds advanced as the nation sold its maximum

showing movies, the Espoo, Finland-based company said today.

at $60 million. Logitech, which also produces gaming devices, in
September cut its forecast for full-year operating profit to
