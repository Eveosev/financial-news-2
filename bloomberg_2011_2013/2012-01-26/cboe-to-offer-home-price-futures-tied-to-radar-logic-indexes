CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the biggest U.S.
options market by volume, will begin trading of futures tied to
U.S. home prices.  Barclays Capital  will serve as the designated primary
market maker for the contracts, which will be linked to Radar
Logic Inc.’s 25-Metropolitan Statistical Area Composite Index,
Chicago-based CBOE said today in an e-mailed statement.
Contracts on additional indexes from New York-based Radar Logic
may be added later, according to the statement.  “We are pleased to partner with Radar Logic to bring to
market the industry’s first real estate futures contract
featuring comprehensive national residential real estate values
and daily pricing,” James F. Lubin, a managing director at
CBOE’s CBOE Futures Exchange LLC, said in the statement.  Potential users of the contracts could include mortgage
lenders, fixed-income investors, developers and insurers,
according to the statement. Trading will start Feb. 2.  Derivatives tied to Radar Logic indexes have been  traded 
over-the-counter since at least 2007. In 2006, CME Group Inc.
began listing contracts linked to the S&P/Case-Shiller price
indexes created by economists  Karl Case  and  Robert Shiller .  To contact the reporter on this story:
