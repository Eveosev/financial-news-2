Greek banks rose the most since
September, led by  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR) ,
as talks on a private-sector exchange of the country’s debt were
to resume in Athens today.  The  FTSE/Athex Banks Index (ASEDTR)  climbed 17 percent at 3:21 p.m.
in Athens, having previously risen as much as 19 percent, while
Eurobank and Piraeus, the country’s second and third-largest
lenders, each gained 27 percent.  National Bank of Greece SA ,
Greece biggest bank, increased 14 percent, and  Alpha Bank SA (ALPHA)  was
up 26 percent. The general Athens index rose 3.5 percent.  Charles Dallara, the managing director of the Washington-
based Institute of International Finance, representing Greece’s
private creditors, will propose that new bonds issued as part of
a debt exchange should carry an average coupon of 3.75 percent
when he resumes Athens talks with Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
this evening, Greek newspaper Kathimerini reported, without
saying how it got the information.  “It seems that the prospective agreement on the PSI
together with the initiation of the talks over the next loan
agreement is alleviating some of the risks surrounding Greece at
the moment,” said Vassilis Kararizos, head of research at
Proton Bank.  The FTSE/Athex Banks Index has risen 46 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent increase for the Athens Stock
Exchange General Index and a 4.3 percent gain for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Last year the general Athens index dropped 52
percent, while Greek banks lost 79 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
