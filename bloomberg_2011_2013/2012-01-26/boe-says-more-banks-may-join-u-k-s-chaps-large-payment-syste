The  Bank of England  said a number of
financial institutions may join the U.K.’s large-value payment
system as it intensifies moves to increase participation and
help reduce risks to financial stability.  “Since we initiated this most recent round of discussions,
one large indirect participant has formally committed to join
CHAPS,” Chris Salmon, the central bank’s Executive Director for
Banking Services, said in a speech in London on Jan. 24,
 published  in London today. “A second is moving towards a
similar formal decision, and the remaining banks that we have
spoken to are considering their position.”  The financial crisis strained the payments system with
record volumes, while the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ)  created confusion among traders about how to settle
transactions. With only 18 firms using the U.K.’s  Clearing House
Automated Payment System , or CHAPS, to serve the sterling-
denominated banking industry, more transactions must be settled
indirectly in a so-called tiering problem. That raises the risk
of intraday credit risk in case one of the banks involved in a
payment arrangement runs into trouble.  “If all the banks we have talked to in this round of
discussions were to join CHAPS in due course, payment flows made
by indirect participants would account for less than 40 percent
of the total, making substantial inroads into our tiering
problem,” Salmon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
