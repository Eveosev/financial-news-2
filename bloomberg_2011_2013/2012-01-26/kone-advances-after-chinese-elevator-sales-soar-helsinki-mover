Kone Oyj (KNEBV) , a Finnish maker of
elevators and escalators, rose the most in eight months in
Helsinki trading after boosting revenue and profit from China,
the industry’s biggest market.  Kone rose as much as 6.3 percent, the most since May 10,
making it the second-biggest mover on the OMX Helsinki 25 Index
today. The share gained 1.97 euros, or 4.9 percent, to 42.17
euros at close in the Finnish capital. The stock has increased
3.4 percent this year, giving the company a market value of 9.2
billion euros ($12.1 billion).  Kone today increased dividend payments and reported profits
that beat estimates after the Helsinki-based company in May
doubled its ownership stake of Chinese joint venture GiantKone
to 80 percent. Sales from the Asia-Pacific region made up 27
percent of group revenue in 2011, compared with a share of 17
percent two years ago. Group revenue will grow as much as 13
percent in 2012, which would be a seventh straight year of
expansion, the company said.  Kone grew “faster than the market” in many Asian
countries, Chief Executive Officer Matti Alahuhta said at a
press conference today. Kone’s conversion rate from new orders
to maintenance deals is globally about 80 percent, while in
 China  it is “slightly” more than 60 percent, a number that is
“quite high” for the country, Alahuhta said.  Kone reported a 42 percent advance in fourth-quarter net
income to 246 million euros, exceeding analyst estimates of 214
million euros. Kone proposed a dividend of 1.40 euros a share,
compared with 0.90 euros a share in 2010. Fourth-quarter sales
grew 6.7 percent to 1.59 billion euros.  Last week, the company announced a deal for supplying
escalators and elevators for Beijing’s first magnetic levitation
train line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
