Chile’s peso rose to the strongest
level since September as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pledge to
keep borrowing costs low spurred demand for commodities and
higher-yielding assets.  The currency strengthened 1.2 percent to 486.65 per U.S.
from 492.4 yesterday, after earlier touching 484.18 per dollar.
The peso hadn’t advanced beyond 486 per dollar since Sept. 20.
It was the weakest emerging-market currency tracked by Bloomberg
two days ago. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency
Index  gained  0.5 percent.  Copper, which makes up half the country’s exports, climbed
as much as 2.1 percent to $3.9105 a pound in New York. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers are considering
buying bonds to boost growth and extended a pledge to keep
 interest rates  low through at least late 2014.  “The peso is rebounding after the dovish Fed,” said Katia Diaz, an economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York. “That helped the
peso break the 200-day moving average. If positive momentum in
the euro persists it could propel the peso to 474 per dollar,
but we don’t see that move, if it happens, being very long-
lived.”  Investors have been using the Chilean peso to express views
on global growth, according to Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist at
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in  New York . The peso often
rises and falls in line with the price of copper, used in new
homes and cars.  Offshore investors reduced bets against the currency in the
Chilean peso forwards market to $4.5 billion on Jan. 24, the
lowest since Nov. 3.  Chilean interest rate swaps fell on the Fed’s news. The
two-year swap rate dropped six basis points to 4.37 percent. The
one-year fell four basis points to 4.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
