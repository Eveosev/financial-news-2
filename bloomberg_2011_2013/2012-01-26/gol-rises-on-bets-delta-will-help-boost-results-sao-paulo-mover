Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline by market value, rose the most
in a month on speculation its deal with  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) 
will help boost revenue.  Gol  gained  2.3 percent to 12.52 reais at 4:45 p.m in Sao
Paulo. Earlier, it climbed as much as 4.2 percent, the most
since Dec. 29.  Delta on Dec. 7 agreed to buy a $100 million stake in Gol,
allowing the Brazilian carrier to book reservations on Delta and
giving the airline access to a global network. Delta, based in
Atlanta, said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates as higher fares outpaced rising jet-fuel
costs. Southwest Airlines Co. and US Airways Group Inc. have
also reported earnings that  exceeded  expectations.  “Delta’s good results in the fourth quarter could favor
Gol in the future because of the agreement the companies have,”
Leonardo Nitta, a Banco do Brasil SA analyst, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo today. The code-sharing
accord between the two may bolster revenue for Gol, he said.  Brazil’s civil aviation regulator, known as Anac, said
 yesterday  that demand for Gol and Webjet Linhas Aereas SA’s
domestic flights rose 9.1 and 9.6 percent in 2011. The companies
have a combined market share of 42.9 percent, down from 45.5
percent a year earlier, the agency said. Gol agreed to buy
Webjet in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
