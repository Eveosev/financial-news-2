Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose for a second day after the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to maintain low  interest rates  into late 2014.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.7 as of 3 p.m. in  New York , down from
28.8 yesterday.  Crude for March delivery rose 30 cents to settle at $99.70
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures earlier
touched $101.39 before paring gains as the dollar strengthened
versus the euro and the  Standard & Poor’s 500  fell.  “Volatility was off with the rally and now it’s coming in
almost unchanged,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  “We’re still in a range
and, as long as that persists, you’re going to see volatility
stay in the high 20 percent.”  Since Dec. 22, the front-month crude contract has traded in
a range of about $6, between a low of $97.40 and a high of
$103.74.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, with 1,922 lots changing hands at 3:19 p.m. They
fell 9 cents to $1.06. March $90 puts, the second-most active
option, declined 8 cents to 31 cents with 1,866 lots trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  “March $90 puts were trading and so were March $115
calls,” Rigolini, who trades for clients on the Nymex.  Puts accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume
and were three of the four most-active contracts.  Previous Session  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 59 percent of volume
yesterday. April $90 puts were the most actively traded, with
4,890 lots changing hands as they fell 24 cents to $1.42 a
barrel. The next-most active options, June $75 puts, declined 6
