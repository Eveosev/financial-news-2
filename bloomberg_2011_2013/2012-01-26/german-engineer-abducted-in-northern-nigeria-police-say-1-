A German engineer was abducted in
 Nigeria ’s northern city of Kano today by unknown attackers,
police said, less than a week after coordinated bomb and gun
attacks in the city killed as many as 256 people.  The German employee of Dantata & Sawoe Construction Co., a
Nigerian company, was handcuffed and placed in the trunk of the
attacker’s car, Musa Majiya, a police spokesman in the city said
by phone, without saying how the police obtained the
information.  Calls made by Bloomberg to the phone numbers posted on the
company’s  website  didn’t go through.  The Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which draws its
inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, is responsible
for a surge in violence in the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria,
 Africa ’s largest oil producer.  The group, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language, claimed responsibility for the Kano
attacks on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people, according to
Nigeria’s Civil Rights Congress. Police in the city put the
official death toll at 184.  Unknown gunmen had kidnapped in May two foreigners, a
British citizen and an Italian, in the northern town of Birnin
Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi state. In August, the French news
agency  Agence France-Presse  said it received a video claiming
that the two hostages were kidnapped by al-Qaeda. The U.K. High
Commission said then that it was checking whether the video is
authentic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
