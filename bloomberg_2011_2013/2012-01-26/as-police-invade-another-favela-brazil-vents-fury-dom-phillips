As many of the homemade videos posted on YouTube show, the invasion of the Pinheirinho favela by some 1,800 police in riot gear -- throwing tear-gas bombs and firing rubber bullets -- left residents frightened, furious and homeless. But the raid shouldn't have been a surprise. The residents had been illegally squatting on the property in  Sao Jose dos Campos , in Sao Paulo state, for about eight years. An order to evict them had been meandering through the courts -- and matters were clearly coming to a head. On Jan. 13, local paper O Vale had  printed pictures  of Pinheirinho's "soldiers," male favela residents kitted out to do battle against a police invasion. One  widely circulated image  -- which made the cover of the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper -- showed hundreds of men armed with clubs and iron bars, wearing crash helmets and clutching shields fashioned out of garbage bins. They looked like medieval soldiers. So when the police went in, they went in hard. The fear and panic among people fleeing the confusion is palpable in  videos on the Internet , as is the anger in the crowd outside an ambulance chanting "murderer" at the police (though none of the early reports of death were confirmed). People cover their mouths as they retreat from tear gas. Youths wearing flip-flops throw stones at distant police as the sound of rubber bullets being fired resounds. In one photo  circulating on Facebook , a policeman appears to fire teargas at a young girl. And in a  shocking video  published by the Folha de  Sao Paulo , three police officers approach a lone black man who holds up his arms. They beat him, briefly, with their truncheons, and wander on. The police have promised to investigate. Raquel Rolnik, an urban planner and professor at the University of Sao Paulo, was one of many who  linked this incident  to other recent heavy-handed police actions -- one at her own university, and one in central Sao Paulo's "Crackland" neighborhood -- and to an increasing militarization in Sao Paulo state. “What do these three recent and regrettable episodes have in common?” Rolnik asked. The federal government soon aired its disapproval -- and showed its confusion. Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo  said he was “surprised”  by the decision to evict residents of Pinheirinho. His office had only found out about the state police action the day it happened, he said. Minister Gilberto Carvalho, a senior federal official who is close to President  Dilma Rousseff ,  spoke out against the police  on Jan. 23: Journalist Reinaldo Azevedo, however, saw it as a clear issue of the rule of law. He argued that the court had been correct in finally ordering the eviction, and that members of the ruling Workers Party -- known as Petistas -- were taking political advantage of an unpopular police action in a state ruled by the opposition PSDB party. On  his blog for the news magazine Veja , in all capital letters, he wrote: “PETISTAS SMELLED THE BLOOD OF THE POOR IN A RIVAL STATE.” Having laid out the legal reasoning   that in his view meant the eviction had to go ahead, he argued: One subtext to the outrage over the evictions was that many poorer Brazilians don't trust the legal system. They say it benefits the rich and powerful -- who are rarely jailed for long, if at all, be that for political corruption or financial crimes. That criticism was particularly resonant in this case. Naji Nahas, the Lebanese-born owner of the failed company that claims the land where the Pinheirinho favela stood, had been arrested during a wide-ranging police investigation into financial crimes in 2008, as the magazine Carta Capital  pointed out . He was released shortly afterward. Rodrigo Nunes, a Brazilian philosopher and the editor of the Turbulence blog, noted the inequalities underlying the favela invasion in an  article for the Guardian : Nunes argued that Brazil’s economic boom, plus the country’s role as host for the 2014  World Cup  and 2016  Olympic Games , meant that many more will be evicted from favelas like Pinheirinho: The Folha de Sao Paulo said that the police began the invasion without making adequate provisions for the thousands who would lose their homes. Many of those evicted chose to stay in a local church rather than the shelters made available. The overwhelming impression was that whatever the political games and legal battles being played out, a community of poor Brazilians had lost out to very powerful interests.
