Euro-area finance ministers didn’t
discuss the prospect of  Spain  renegotiating its deficit
deadlines at a meeting this weekin Brussels, the European Union
said.  “That issue was not raised” at the Jan. 23 meeting,
Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn , told reporters today in Brussels. “Our
position hasn’t changed since Monday.”  Rehn on that day “stressed that this is essentially a
crisis of confidence and it’s all the more important now that
Spain remains committed to restoring sustainable public finances
without delay,” Altafaj said, “that it meets the fiscal
targets of 2012, the 4.4 percent deficit target, and the 2013
correction date for excessive deficit.”  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said on Jan. 24 that
it remains to be seen if the EU decides to revise the deficit
targets for the whole region. Meanwhile, Spain is committed to
meeting its existing 2012 target of 4.4 percent of gross
domestic product, Rajoy said at a news conference in Lisbon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
