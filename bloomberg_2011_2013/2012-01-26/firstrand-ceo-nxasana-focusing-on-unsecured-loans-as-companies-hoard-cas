FirstRand Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Sizwe Nxasana (FSR)  said  South Africa ’s second-largest bank is
focusing on unsecured loans to consumers as cash-hoarding
companies have limited borrowing needs.  “South African loans are focused on unsecured lending,”
Nxasana said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland today. South African
companies are sitting on “a lot of cash,” he said.  Local lenders including  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s
largest bank, and  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  are stepping up
loans to South Africans without demanding collateral. The banks
are aiming to capture more low-income customers as consumers are
hurt by higher inflation and falling house prices.  Unsecured lending has “huge” growth potential, Riaan
Stassen, CEO of  Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd. (CPI) , which began business
in 2001 specializing in loans for low-income earners, said in an
interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
