Infonavit,  Mexico ’s largest
originator of mortgages, plans to sell securities known as
Cedevis denominated in pesos for the first time since 2004 next
year, according to the state-owned agency.  The Cedevis, which are Mexican mortgage-backed securities,
may attract foreign investors that don’t currently hold them,
Jorge Marquez, the senior manager of the Cedevis program, said
in an interview today in Mexico City. The agency may sell peso-
denominated Cedevis in the first half of next year, he said.  Less than 0.2 percent of outstanding Cedevis are currently
denominated in pesos with nearly all of them in inflation-linked
units known as udis, Marquez said.  “We will diversify our investor base,” he said. Peso-
denominated issuance will mean foreigners may enter the market
“since they’re more used to that currency,” Marquez said.  The agency plans to issue the peso-denominated securities
after Mexican President Felipe Calderon signed into law a bill
earlier this month that will allow the agency to issue loans in
the Mexican national currency in addition to units tied to
minimum wages, Marquez said.  The peso-denominated Mortgage-backed securities will be
benchmarked to Mexico fixed-rate government debt known as
Mbonos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
