Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
increased 18 percent in the largest gain in almost a year,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen climbed 2.8 million barrels in the
week to yesterday to 18.13 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies rose the
most in percentage terms since the week ended Feb. 23, 2011.  Middle-distillates (SPIVMDIS)  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene dropped 1 million barrels, or 10 percent, to 8.93
million, based on the ministry’s data. That’s a five-week low.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were little changed, climbing 9,000 barrels to
11.05 million. Supplies were the highest in six weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
