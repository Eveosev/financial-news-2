Almost $2.48 billion in debt backed
by  Kerzner International Holdings Ltd. (KZL) ’s Atlantis resorts in the
 Bahamas  was sent to a special servicer,  Fitch Ratings  said.  The debt was sent to  Wells Fargo & Co . because of maturity
default, the credit-rating firm wrote in an e-mail yesterday.
The Atlantis resort and casino on Paradise Island and the Marina
at Atlantis are in the Kerzner portfolio, Fitch said.  Brookfield Asset Management (BAM/A)  this month canceled its deal to
exchange debt for Kerzner properties. Kerzner in November agreed
to hand ownership of its flagship Atlantis resort to the
Toronto-based real estate investor as part of a debt
restructuring.  Brookfield  at the time planned to forgive $175
million of junior debt for ownership of the Atlantis and the
Bahamas One&Only Ocean Club, as well as a half interest in the
One&Only Palmilla in  Mexico .  The properties Brookfield planned to take over had about
$2.6 billion in debt when negotiations began. That would have
shrunk to about $2.3 billion with Brookfield’s forgiveness and
an earlier $100 million payment that was part of a maturity
extension.  Jennifer Ferguson, a Kerzner spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message and e-mail seeking
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
