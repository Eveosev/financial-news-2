The Venezuelan government may reduce
the minimum working day to seven hours,  El Mundo  reported,
citing Antonio Espinoza, a member of President  Hugo Chavez â€™s
commission charged with proposing labor law reforms.  Salaries would not be lowered even if the working week is
cut to 35 hours, the Caracas-based newspaper cited Espinoza as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
