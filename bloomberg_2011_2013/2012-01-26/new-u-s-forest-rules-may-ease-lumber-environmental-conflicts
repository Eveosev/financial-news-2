New rules for managing the nation’s
national forests will require the best available science to
balance recreation and conservation interests with those of
loggers and miners, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  The plan, unveiled today, recognizes that the 193 million
acres in the U.S. forest system are used for a variety of
purposes, Vilsack said in an e-mailed statement. The proposal
will be published in the Federal Register on Feb. 3 and may 
take affect later this year.  The rules “will safeguard our natural resources and
provide a road map for getting work done on the ground that will
restore our forests while providing job opportunities for local
communities,” Vilsack said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
