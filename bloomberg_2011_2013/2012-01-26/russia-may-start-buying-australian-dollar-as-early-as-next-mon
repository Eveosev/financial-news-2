Russia ’s central bank may start
buying the Australian dollar as a reserve currency as soon as
early February, First Deputy Chairman Alexei Ulyukayev said.  “We’re just about to start, everything is ready, the
accounts are open and the agreements are signed,” Ulyukayev
told reporters at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland. “It’ll be February, possibly at the beginning.”  Russia is diversifying its international reserves, the
fourth-biggest in the world, after confidence in the U.S. dollar
and euro eroded. Its  currency holdings  were about 45 percent
dollars, 43 percent euros and 9 percent pounds, with the rest in
yen, Canadian dollars and the International Monetary Fund’s
special drawing rights, as of June 30.  “We’re not looking to seriously change” the structure of
reserves, Ulyukayev said. “There are natural limits -- the low
liquidity of markets for other currencies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
