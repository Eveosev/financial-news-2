OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, joined smaller producer OAO Novatek in testing
an Arctic Sea route to  Asia  as the country seeks to increase
supplies of liquefied natural gas.  Gazprom and OAO Sovcomflot, the country’s biggest shipper,
will soon arrange test cargoes along the Northern Sea Route, the
Moscow-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  Russia is developing the transportation corridor as it
plans to produce and ship LNG, oil and gas condensate to markets
beyond the reach of Gazprom’s pipeline network. The northern
waters may become a viable route as global warming allows for a
longer navigation period.  “LNG production is an absolute priority compared with
supplies by pipeline to Asia-Pacific export markets,” Gazprom
Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller said in the statement.  Novatek has said the Arctic route is more profitable and
faster than shipping via the  Suez Canal  after sending test
cargoes of oil-like gas condensate to Asia along the same route
during the past two years.  Gazprom and Novatek last week agreed to consider boosting
LNG production capacity in the Arctic Yamal region as part of
proposals that may also include development of new fields.
Novatek plans to build an LNG plant on Yamal, with the targeted
start of supplies in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
