The zloty gained to the highest
level in more than four months against the euro as risk appetite
increased after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it may keep
interest rates low.  Poland’s currency surged as much as 0.5 percent to 4.2379
zloty per euro, its strongest intraday level since Sept. 8,
before trading 0.3 percent stronger at 12:34 p.m. in Warsaw.  U.S. policy makers are “prepared to provide further
monetary accommodation” depending on employment and inflation
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday after European
markets closed. Bond buying is “an option that’s certainly on
the table,” he added. Poland should raise its benchmark
 interest rate  this quarter to counter inflation that has become
“stubbornly” high, central banker Andrzej Kazmierczak told
Bloomberg in an interview yesterday.  The zloty may be supported by “more hawkish comments from
the Monetary Policy Council, the Fed becoming more dovish and
European Central bank resorting to the quantitative easing,”
ING Bank Slaski wrote in a note to clients.  The central bank may need to consider tightening monetary
policy, Governor  Marek Belka  said in an interview with Polish
private broadcaster TVN Biznes CNBC yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
