Commercial  property  sales rose 57
percent to more than $220 billion U.S. last year, led by retail
properties and garden apartments, Real Capital Analytics Inc.
said in a report today.  More than 14,700 properties, each worth at least $2.5
million, changed hands in 2011, the New York-based real estate
research  firm  said. Retail-property transactions rose 91 percent
from a year earlier to $42.4 billion, and sales of low-rise
apartments increased 70 percent to $34.5 billion.  Manhattan 
accounted for 12 percent of total deal volume.  Sales rose as investors sought relatively higher yields
from income-producing real estate and debt-laden owners unloaded
properties acquired during the bubble years. Deals slowed in the
second half of 2011 as turmoil in the market for commercial
mortgage-backed securities curbed financing. Office and hotel
transactions fell in the three months through December after six
quarters of “large” year-over-year gains, Real Capital said.  “Buyers have started to broaden their horizons both
geographically and by property type,” the firm said.  The biggest declines in capitalization rates were seen in
well-leased, high-quality suburban offices and in shopping
centers anchored by grocery stores, Real Capital said. Cap rates
are calculated by dividing a property’s net operating income by
purchase price, with rates dropping as prices rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
