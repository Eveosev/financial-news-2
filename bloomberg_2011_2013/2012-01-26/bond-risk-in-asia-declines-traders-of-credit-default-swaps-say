The cost of protecting bonds in  Asia 
against non-payment decreased, according to credit-default swap
traders.  The Markit  iTraxx Asia index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 4 basis points to 185.5 as of
8:13 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge is on course for its lowest close since Oct. 31,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2 basis points to
166 as of 9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
measure is set for its lowest close since Oct. 31, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc., and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Australian market is closed today due to a holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
