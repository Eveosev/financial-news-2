Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest
U.S. maker of computer-memory chips, said Chief Operating
Officer Mark Durcan will retire at the end of August.  Durcan, who joined Micron in 1984, was promoted to his
current position in 2006, the Boise, Idaho-based company said
today in a statement. He also has served as the company’s
president. Durcan will be replaced by Micron’s head of sales,
 Mark Adams , who previously worked as chief operating officer of
Lexar Media Inc. when Micron bought it in 2006.  Micron last month reported its second consecutive quarterly
loss, citing the falling price of dynamic random access memory,
or DRAM, which serves as the main memory in personal computers.
Demand also has been hurt by last year’s floods in  Thailand ,
which left PC makers short of hard-disk drives, forcing them to
cut purchases of other components.  Durcan, 50, is retiring and not leaving for another
position, said Dan Francisco, a company spokesman.  Micron  shares  fell 3.9 percent to $7.55 at the close of
trading in New York, before the announcement. The stock has
increased 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
