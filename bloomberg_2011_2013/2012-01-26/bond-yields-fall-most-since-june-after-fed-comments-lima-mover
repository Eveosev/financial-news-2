Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in seven months, after the U.S. Federal Reserve
said it plans to keep borrowing cheap through 2014, fueling
demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The yield on  Peru ’s 6.95 percent sol-denominated bond due
August 2031 dropped 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point,
to 6.54 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local unit.
That’s the biggest one-day drop since June 7. The securities
price rose 2.94 centimos to 104.58 cents per dollar.  The Fed said yesterday it sees “exceptionally low”
interest rates through 2014. The yield on Peru’s bonds rose to a
three-month high yesterday after Peru’s government sold more of
the bonds as part of its first overseas offering since 2010.  “The issue clearly had an impact on yields yesterday,”
said  Roberto Melzi , a Latin America Strategist at Barclays
Capital Inc. in  New York . “Today, given the Fed’s signal,
people are taking the opportunity to add Peruvian bonds at those
cheaper levels.”  The Andean nation sold $600 million of the bonds due in
2031 and $500 million more of its dollar-denominated securities
maturing in 2050. The sale drew bids totaling $6.4 billion,
according to the  finance ministry .  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.6920 per U.S. dollar,
from 2.6940 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
