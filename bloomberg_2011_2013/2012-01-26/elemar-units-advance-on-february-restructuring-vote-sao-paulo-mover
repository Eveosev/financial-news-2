Units from Telemar Participacoes,
 Brazil ’s telephone company that operates under the Oi brand,
rose after announcing the date for a shareholder meeting to vote
on the company’s restructuring plan.  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP3)   gained  2.7 percent to
16.87 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo, the steepest
increase since Jan. 2.  Brasil Telecom SA (BRTO4)  rose 3.8 percent to
11.20 reais.  The company scheduled a shareholder meeting for Feb. 27 to
vote on the restructuring plan announced May 24 by Telemar
Participacoes. The plan is to merge the units into one entity
that will trade under the name Oi SA.  “We expect the merger to be approved, and a simplified
structure will likely reduce costs, increase liquidity and allow
the company to announce a formal dividend policy,” analysts
Valder Nogueira, Bruno Mendonca and Gregorio Tomassi from Banco
Santander SA said in a note to clients today.  Under the proposal, each Tele Norte common share will be
exchanged for 2.3122 Brasil Telecom common shares, according to
a regulatory filing on Aug. 29. Tele Norte’s preferred stock
will be exchanged for 1.9262 Brasil Telecom preferred shares and
0.1879 of Brasil Telecom’s common shares.  Telemar Norte Leste’s common shares will be exchanged for
5.1149 Brasil Telecom similar stocks, the company said in the
filing. Telemar Norte Leste’s Class A and B preferred stock will
be swapped by 0.3904 Brasil Telecom common shares and 4.0034
Brasil Telecom preferred stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
