Mexico  appealed a  World Trade
Organization  ruling that U.S. curbs on imports of Mexican tuna,
designed to protect dolphins, are more restrictive than needed.  Sales of Mexican tuna to the U.S. have been limited since
1991 under Commerce Department provisions that determine when
products can be labeled as dolphin-safe. The U.S. adopted the
rules in response to complaints that Mexico’s fishing techniques
hurt dolphins. Mexico says its tuna-catching practices and
regulations meet global standards.  The U.S. appealed the WTO’s Sept. 15 ruling last week and
Mexico said at the time it planned to appeal the panel’s
rejection of its claim that the labeling provisions are
discriminatory. Mexico filed its appeal yesterday, the Geneva-
based trade arbiter said on its website today.  WTO judges found that the dolphin-safe provisions “are
more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve a legitimate
objective, taking into account the risks that non-fulfillment
would create.”  The Appellate Body has three months to issue its report on
the appeals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
