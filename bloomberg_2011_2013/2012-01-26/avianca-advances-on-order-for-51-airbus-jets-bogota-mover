Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA) , the owner
of  Colombia ’s largest airline, headed to a two-month high after
it agreed to purchase 51 jets made by Airbus SAS as it expands
 service  in Latin America.  Avianca shares rose 2.3 percent to 3,860 pesos at 9:20 a.m.
Bogota time, the highest level on a closing basis since Nov. 17.  “This is a concrete deal, a solid order,” said Jorge Zuniga, an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage. “It’s a positive for the company because it shows
the purchasing process is moving forward.”  The purchase includes 33 A320neo planes, the largest single
order of such jets in the region, according to an Avianca Taca
filing today with Colombia’s securities regulator.  Avianca Taca has gained 17 percent this year to date, the
best performance among stocks excluding Canadian  oil companies 
on Colombia’s benchmark IGBC Index.  Airbus is the world’s largest commercial planemaker, and is
a unit of the European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
