Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-
largest retailer, climbed the most since November in Paris
trading after a report that Vivarte Chief Executive Officer
Georges Plassat may replace Lars Olofsson as CEO.  Carrefour climbed as much as 8.1 percent to 18.25 euros,
the most since Nov. 28, and were up 8 percent at 18.24 euros as
of 12:24 p.m. The shares have fallen 39 percent in the past 12
months, valuing the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based retailer
at 12.3 billion euros ($16.2 billion).  Carrefour may name Plassat as CEO as soon as this weekend,
Lineaires reported on its website, without saying where it
obtained the information. An external spokesman for Carrefour
declined to comment.  The retailer’s largest shareholders, Groupe Arnault SAS and
 Colony Capital LLC , have been considering replacing Olofsson as
chairman and chief executive officer, people familiar with the
matter said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
