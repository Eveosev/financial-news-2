Japan ’s consumer prices fell for a
third month as an export slump and the stronger yen weighed on
the nation’s economic rebound from the record March earthquake.  Consumer prices  excluding fresh food dropped 0.1 percent in
December from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today
in Tokyo, matching the median estimate of 27 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Slower global growth and a yen that remains near a postwar
record against the dollar are weakening exports, eroding
corporate profits and making it more difficult for the world’s
third-largest  economy  to shake off deflation. The  Bank of Japan 
this week lowered its outlook for consumer prices for the year
ending March 31.  “We can’t foresee the end of deflation,”  Tatsushi Shikano ,
senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.
in Tokyo, said before the report. “Consumer prices face
downward pressures from European debt woes and a strong yen and
there are a lot of uncertainties ahead.”  Exports (JNTBEXPY)  fell for a third month in December, reinforcing the
view that the rebound from earthquake is fading. The yen was at
77.46 per dollar as of 8:35 a.m., compared with the postwar high
of 75.35 touched on Oct. 31.  The BOJ lowered its consumer price forecast to a 0.1
percent decline for fiscal 2011 and trimmed its growth
projection to 2 percent from the previous 2.2 percent for the
year starting April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
