South Korean manufacturers’
confidence is near a 30-month low as  Europe ’s debt crisis dims
the outlook for exports.  An  index  measuring expectations for February was at 81 from
January’s 79, the lowest level since July 2009, a statement from
the Bank of Korea showed in Seoul today. A measure of
expectations at  non-manufacturing companies  was unchanged at 79.
A reading below 100 indicates pessimists outnumber optimists.  South Korea’s economy grew the least in two years in the
fourth quarter as exports sank because of Europe’s crisis and a
faltering global expansion, a government report showed yesterday.
Gross domestic product is likely to shrink this quarter and the
central bank may cut borrowing costs in April and July, Nomura
Holdings Inc. says.  As “economic activity slows, we would expect inflation to
ease and the Bank of  Korea  to start its easing cycle” in the
second quarter,  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB said before today’s release.  The survey, conducted from Jan. 12 to 19, was based on
responses from 1,623 manufacturers and 888 non-manufacturers.  Consumer confidence  fell to the lowest in 10 months in
January, the central bank said in a separate report. The
 sentiment index  fell to 98, from 99 in December, the Bank of
Korea said.  The gauge is based on survey responses from 2,032
households in 56 cities.  The South Korean economy,  Asia ’s fourth largest, expanded
0.4 percent from the third quarter, when it gained 0.8 percent,
the central bank said in  Seoul  yesterday. That was less than the
median 0.5 percent estimate of 10 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. From a year earlier, growth was 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
