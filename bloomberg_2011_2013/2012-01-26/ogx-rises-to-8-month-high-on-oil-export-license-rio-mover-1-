OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
the  oil company   controlled  by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, rose to the highest in almost eight months after being
granted a license to export crude from  Brazil .  OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, rose 1.1 percent to close at
16.00 reais at 6:15 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, the highest since
May 31. OGX is up 17 percent this year, more than the 11 percent
gain in the benchmark Bovespa index.  The company, which plans to start output this month, was
authorized by Brazil’s oil regulator to export, according to a
statement published today in the official gazette. Its first
production vessel was anchored over the Waimea field in the
Campos Basin off Rio’s coast earlier this month to prepare to
start pumping crude from the deposit.  OGX announced Jan. 16 the discovery of its thickest oil
reservoir to date in the southeastern Santos Basin. The company
said it found hydrocarbons in two separate sections of the
basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
