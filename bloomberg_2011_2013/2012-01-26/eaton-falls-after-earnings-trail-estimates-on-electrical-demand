Eaton Corp. (ETN) , a maker of hydraulic
products and circuit breakers, declined after reporting fourth-
quarter earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates, hurt by
weakened demand in its electrical unit.  Eaton  fell  1.2 percent to $48.93 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The
shares have dropped 6.5 percent over the last 12 months.  Revenue in December was lower than expected by about $200
million, Chief Executive Officer Alexander Cutler said today in
a statement. About 75 percent of the revenue decline came from
the electrical business, where demand in  Europe  slowed because
of the sovereign debt crisis, and access to credit caused a
slowdown in  China .  Fourth quarter operating earnings advanced 26 percent to
$366 million, or $1.08 a share, from $291 million, or 85 cents,
a year ago, the Cleveland, Ohio-based company said. Analysts
projected $1.11 a share, the average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales rose 10 percent to $4.03 billion. Net income rose 29
percent to $362 million, or $1.07 per share.  “Many of the factors behind the shortfall in fourth
quarter revenues are temporary and, as a result, should not have
a significant impact on 2012 revenues,” Cutler said in the
statement.  The company forecast full-year operating earnings of $4.15
to $4.55, excluding 5 cents to integrate acquisitions, according
to the statement. Analysts projected $4.45, the average of
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
