Standard Chartered  Plc fully funded
a $1 billion loan sought by Jakarta-based coking coal maker  PT
Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal , said a person familiar with the
matter.  Standard Chartered, which is arranging syndication of the
five-year loan, funded the facility on Jan. 20, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the details are private.  The loan continues to be marketed in senior syndication
after funding, the person said, referring to the process by
which a loan is pitched to a limited number of banks, most of
which would have an existing relationship with the borrower.  The facility is expected to be marketed more broadly as
part of general syndication in February, according to the
person.  The loan was first marketed to a select group of banks in
November as part of senior syndication.  Borneo said on Jan. 20 that it had bought a 23.8 percent
stake in coal producer Bumi Plc from  PT Bakrie & Brothers . It
said in November it would use $1 billion in funding from
Standard Chartered for the acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
