Colruyt SA (COLR) , a Belgian retailer, is
seeking investors to share the costs of offshore wind farms,  De
Standaard  said, without saying where it got the information.  The Northwind NV project requires 760 million euros and
Colruyt may have to take on the debt, the newspaper said.
Colruyt owns 66.7 percent of the Northwind Aspiravi project,
with the rest owned by local governments. Colruyt also owns 26.9
percent of the Belwind project off the coast of Zeebrugge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
