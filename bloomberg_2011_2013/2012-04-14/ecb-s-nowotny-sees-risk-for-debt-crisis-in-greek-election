European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that he sees risk for the
European debt crisis in the Greek elections, according to an
interview with  Vorarlberger Nachrichten .  “I see risks in the political area,” Nowotny, who also
heads  Austria ’s central bank, told the paper. “Elections are
due in early May and I’m not sure that there will be a majority
that continues the current economic program.”  Italy and Spain have carried out reforms and now have to be
given time, Nowotny also said, adding that the situation in
Portugal and Ireland has improved. “The biggest risk is
 Greece ,” he told the paper.  Nowotny also said that he sees the announced review of 110
European banks by Moody’s Investors Service as potentially
“unsettling” Europe, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
