Lu Ting, an economist at Bank of
America Corp., comments on the widening of the yuan’s trading
band by the People’s Bank of  China .  “Widening the band to 1% is an important step towards a
rule-based FX regime with a trade-weighted basket as the new
anchor.” The People’s Bank is under pressure to build such a
regime to avoid having to again peg the yuan to the dollar once
it views the currency as no longer undervalued, Lu said.  The intermediate goal is to “benchmark” the yuan against
a trade-weighted basket, Lu said. “A true rule-based basket
currency regime will unavoidably lead to two-way volatility” so
the central bank should “seize all opportunities” to increase
yuan-dollar volatility, he said.  “China will avoid significant appreciation or depreciation
this year due to uncertain global environment and the need for
stability during the year of leadership change.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
