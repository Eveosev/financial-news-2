Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff
has backed an amnesty plan for small farmers who illegally cut
trees near riverbanks in order to push through legislation aimed
at improving forest management, Folha de S.Paulo reported.  The proposal will help overcome a political deadlock
between the government and the agriculture industry, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information. Brazil’s new forestry code heads for a vote in the
lower house April 24.  Farmers who own large tracts of land would still be
required to replant forests they illegally cleared next to
rivers, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
