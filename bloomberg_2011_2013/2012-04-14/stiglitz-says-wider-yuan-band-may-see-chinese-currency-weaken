China ’s decision to widen the
yuan’s trading band for the first time since 2007 may end up
disappointing the U.S. by helping to weaken the currency, Nobel
laureate  Joseph Stiglitz  said.  China today said it will increase the range in which the
yuan can trade to 1 percent from 0.5 percent. While the currency
reached an 18-year high at 6.2884 per dollar on Feb. 10,
President Barack Obama’s administration has said it remains too
weak and gives an unfair trading edge to China’s exporters.  Alongside steps to allow greater investment to flow out of
the country, the measure may “lead to a fall in the exchange
rate rather than appreciation,” Stiglitz told reporters at a
conference in Berlin today. “What may be happening is that a
free market exchange rate may not go in the way the U.S. thinks
it should. That would twist the knife.”  U.S. criticism of China has already been “defanged” by
reports the  International Monetary Fund  will next week lower its
forecasts for China’s medium-term current-account surplus,
Stiglitz said. The fund in September estimated surpluses of more
than 7 percent of gross domestic product for 2015 and 2016.  The “U.S. Treasury even knows” about the declining trade
gap, said Stiglitz, who teaches at  Columbia University  in  New
York . “They just feel by habit they have to badger China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
