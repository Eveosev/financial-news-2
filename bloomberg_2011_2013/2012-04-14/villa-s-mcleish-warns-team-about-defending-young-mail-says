Aston Villa manager  Alex McLeish 
has warned his defenders to stay on their feet when going
against Manchester United’s  Ashley Young  tomorrow.  Former Villa winger Young was accused of diving to win a
penalty kick in last weekend’s 2-0 win over QPR, resulting in a
red card for defender Shaun Derry. Television replays showed
minimal contact between the two.  “We will stay on our feet against all United players,”
the Mail quoted McLeish as saying. “Ashley is a quality player.
He is renowned for his assists, but players have become clever.
Sometimes the slightest touch can be enough for them go do
down.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
