Tommy Xie, a Shanghai-based
economist at Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp., comments on the
widening of the yuan’s trading bank by the People’s Bank of
 China .  “Technically speaking, I don’t see urgency” for the
move,” Xie said, calling it “more symbolic than meaningful”
while the yuan-fixing mechanism remains non-transparent.  “China was definitely not forced to widen its trading
band” and the move is “definitely not equivalent to renminbi
depreciation in the short term,” Xie said. It’s part of a
package to show the world progress in reform, he said.  “Today’s announcement is likely to lead to a spike in
yuan’s short term volatility. In the medium term, the
correlation between spot yuan and global  currency market  may
increase” given widening room for daily movement, Xie said.
“This may have feed-through effect on Asian currencies.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
