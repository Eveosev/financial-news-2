Shen Jianguang, chief Asia
economist for Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong , comments
on the widening of the yuan’s trading band by the People’s Bank
of  China .  “A step forward to a real floating exchange rate of the
RMB, a de-peg from the dollar, indicating that the authority is
more confident that the current RMB exchange rate is close to
the equilibrium, and it is the right timing to push RMB
internationalization.  ‘‘Other recent moves, such as an increase in the QFII
quota, the establishment of a global RMB settlement center, the
discussion on interest rate liberalization, etc, all point to an
acceleration in RMB convertibility.’’  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
