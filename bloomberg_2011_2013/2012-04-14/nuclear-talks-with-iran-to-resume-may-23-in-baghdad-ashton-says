Talks with  Iran  on its nuclear
program will resume May 23 in  Baghdad ,  Catherine Ashton , the
European Union’s foreign policy chief, said.  “We’re looking for the next meeting to move us forward in
a very concrete way,” Ashton told reporters after talks today
in Istanbul. Ashton, the lead negotiator for the so-called P5+1
group, said today’s discussions were “constructive” and
“useful.”  Representatives of the the U.S. and European allies met with 
Iran’s nuclear envoy,  Saeed Jalili , against a backdrop of tightening
 economic sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to curb its nuclear
program. Israel and the U.S. have raised the prospect of military
action against Iran if agreement can’t be reached.  While Jalili said “we witnessed progress” in today’s
talks, he added that pressure on Iran won’t work.  “One of the issues that should be taken into
consideration, and is the request of the Iranian people, is the
removal of sanctions,” he said.  Iran met with the group that comprises the five permanent
members of the  United Nations Security Council  -- Britain,
China, France, Russia and the U.S -- plus Germany.  The U.S. and EU have said Iran may be seeking the
capability to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says its program is
for civilian purposes only.  Iran’s motto is, “Nuclear bombs for none, and nuclear
energy for all,” Jalili said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
