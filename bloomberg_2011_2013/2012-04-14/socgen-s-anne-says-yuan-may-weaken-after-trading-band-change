The yuan may weaken following
 China ’s decision to widen the currency’s trading band for the
first time since 2007, according to  Benoit Anne , the London-
based head of emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale SA.  He spoke in a phone interview today.  On a weaker currency:  “The markets may take this move as a disguised way of
easing through a weaker currency. A widening of the band is not
a guarantee that the yuan is going to go stronger. Right now I
think the balance of risks is that the currency will swing the
other way.”  On market impact:  “If the market interprets this as an accommodative move,
ultimately that’s positive for risky assets. If you allow your
currency to weaken a bit, this is positive for the economy. It’s
probably good for equities and commodities and emerging-market
assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
