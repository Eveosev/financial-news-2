Dexia Bank  Belgium  SA, the former
 Dexia SA (DEXB)  unit now owned by the Belgian government, plans to
submit its restructuring plan to European Union regulators next
week, Le Soir reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Dexia, which is changing its name to Belfius, will hand the
plan to the European Commission on April 17, Le Soir said. It
didn’t give any details of the restructuring measures. The EU
must approve the plan to authorize Belgium’s bailout of the
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
