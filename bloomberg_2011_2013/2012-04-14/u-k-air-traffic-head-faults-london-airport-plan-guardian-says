London Mayor  Boris Johnson ’s
proposed airport in the Thames estuary would be in the “very
worst spot” for airplane congestion, the Guardian  reported ,
citing an interview with the head of the U.K.’s air traffic
control service.  The site of the proposed airport, which will cost 50
billion pounds ($79 billion), is directly under flight paths for
airplane arrivals and departures at four other London airports,
Richard Deakin, chief executive officer of National Air Traffic
Services Ltd., said in an interview with the Guardian.  Deakin said the architects of the plan did not contact him
before they came up with the proposal last year, the Guardian
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
