Fiat said a Turin tribunal rejected
21 appeals filed by Fiom Cgil, the carmaker’s biggest union,
which had sought to appoint representatives in 15 units of  Fiat
SpA (F)  and  Fiat Industrial SpA. (FI)   The Turin judge ruled that only unions that signed a one-
year collective labor deal in December could appoint
representatives. Fiom was the only Fiat union to reject the
deal, which increased shifts and shortened breaks in exchange
for a 20 billion-euro ($26 billion) investment plan. Instead,
Fiom filed about 60 lawsuits against the company for anti-union
practices.  On March 27, a judge in Bologna ruled against Fiat for
anti-union behavior at its Magneti Marelli plants in the region
in the first verdict concerning the contract, Fiom said. The
union had been excluded from being represented at the plants by
Fiat as it didn’t agree to sign the deal. Fiat vowed to appeal
the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
