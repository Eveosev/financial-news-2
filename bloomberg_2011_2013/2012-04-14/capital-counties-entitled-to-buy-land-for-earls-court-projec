Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) 
said it will be entitled to buy a 22-acre area for 105 million
pounds ($166 million) as a part of an 8 billion-pound
development in London’s Earls Court and West Kensington.  The developer, known as CapCo, can acquire Hammersmith &
Fulham council’s land in the Earls Court and West Kensington
Opportunity Area for cash consideration of 105 million pounds,
plus re-provision of the 760 homes currently on housing estates
there, the company said in a statement today citing a report
published by the council.  In addition to the 15 million pounds it paid in July 2011,
at time of entering into the exclusivity agreement with the
council, CapCo would initially acquire the 11 Farm Lane and
Gibbs Green School sites for another 15 million pounds. CapCo
would also have the option, exercisable until 2017, to buy the
council’s remaining land via a series of payments totaling an
additional 75 million pounds, according to the statement.  Currently “no transaction has been agreed between the
parties and there is no certainty of a transaction being
concluded,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
