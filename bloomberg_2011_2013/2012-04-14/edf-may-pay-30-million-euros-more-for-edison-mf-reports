Electricite de France SA  may need
to pay about 30 million euros ($39.2 million) more in its
takeover bid for  Edison SpA (EDN)  to adjust for the higher price
requested by Italian market regulator Consob, Milano Finanza
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Carlo Tassara SpA won’t tender its 10 percent stake in
Edison because the company, controlled by French investor Romain Zaleski, values the shares at 1.49 euros each and doesn’t want
to book a loss, the Milan-based newspaper said.  Consob requested a revised bid of as high as 89 euro cents
a share, which would have increased the total cost by as much as
60 million euros, MF reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
