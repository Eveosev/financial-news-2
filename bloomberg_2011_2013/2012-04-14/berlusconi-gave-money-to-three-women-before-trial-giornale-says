Former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said that he provided financial assistance to three
women to help with legal fees after they became involved in a
case of criminal accusations against him, il Giornale  reported ,
citing an interview.  “They were in trouble,” Berlusconi told Giornale, adding
that the women didn’t have the resources to “oppose the
powerful machinery of justice.”  The Telegraph reported April 12 that Berlusconi paid more
than 127,000 pounds ($201,000) to showgirls Nicole Minetti and
sisters Imma and Eleonora De Vivo, who allegedly attended his
parties. The three are scheduled to testify in the trial that
accuses Berlusconi of paying for sex with a 17-year-old
nightclub dancer known as Ruby Heart-Stealer and then using the
power of his office to cover his tracks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
