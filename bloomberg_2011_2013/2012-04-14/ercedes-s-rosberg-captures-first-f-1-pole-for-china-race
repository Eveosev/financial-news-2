Nico Rosberg  of Mercedes captured
his first Formula One pole position by topping qualifying for
tomorrow’s Chinese Grand Prix.  Rosberg, 26, posted a time of 1 minute, 35.12 seconds in
Shanghai to beat McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton by half a second. The
German gave Mercedes its first pole since returning to the sport
in 2010.  Hamilton, who was in the pole position for the season’s
opening two races, received a five-place penalty for a gearbox
change and dropped to seventh on the grid. That pushed Rosberg’s
teammate  Michael Schumacher , who was third-fastest, onto the
front row.  “It’s a very special day for me,” Rosberg told reporters.
“We don’t know what will happen in the race tomorrow, and it
will be a challenge to stay in front, but for the moment, I will
enjoy starting next to Michael from the front row.”  Sauber’s Kamui Kobayashi will start third, next to Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus with McLaren’s Jenson Button and Red Bull’s
Mark Webber on the third row. Hamilton, Sauber’s Sergio Perez,
series leader  Fernando Alonso  of Ferrari and Lotus’s Romain
Grosjean round out the top 10 qualifiers.  Two-time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red
Bull will start 11th after failing to make the third qualifying
round.  “We weren’t fast enough and have to accept it,” Vettel
told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
