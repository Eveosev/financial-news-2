Michael Ganske , head of emerging
markets research at Commerzbank AG in  London , comments on  China 
widening the yuan’s trading band to 1 percent from 0.5 percent,
to take effect on April 16. He also speaks about the increase in
the foreign-investment quota enacted by Chinese policy makers on
April 3:  Ganske sent his comments in an e-mail:  “China is targeting to liberalize the capital account
sooner rather than later. All initiatives, the yuan, the latest
increase of the quota, indicate that. They understand that the
export-based growth model is not sustainable and that they have
to strengthen domestic demand.”  “The currency should appreciate.”  “When you have a managed currency and you have a goal to
move to a flexible regime, you widen the managed band.”  “As their economic growth slowed down, market participants
expect a decreased speed of liberalization and I think that’s
not the case. The Chinese economy is still growing with a solid
pace, we are not in the hard-landing camp.”  “As the widening of the band is not significant, the
short-term implication for companies should not be significant.
When a currency appreciates, exports tend to become less
competitive, but Chinese exports have a high import content and
just 10 percent of the workforce are employed directly in
export-related sectors, so the growth and social impact of a
controlled, appreciating currency should be limited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
