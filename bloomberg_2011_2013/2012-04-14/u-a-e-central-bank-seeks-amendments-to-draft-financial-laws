The board of directors of the
 United Arab Emirates ’ central bank called for “major
amendments” to be made to draft financial laws in the Gulf
country, according to an e-mailed statement from the lender.  The laws “should reflect the independence of the central
bank,” the bank said today, without providing details of any
suggested amendments.  One of the draft laws is  Law No-10 of 1980  for the central
bank, the monetary system and organization of banking, while
another pertains to the organization of financial services,
