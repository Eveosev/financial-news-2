Chang Jian, an economist with
 Barclays Capital  in Hong Kong, comments after the People’s Bank
of  China  widened the yuan’s trading band.  “Narrowing trade surpluses and slowing capital inflows
suggests less pressures on the yuan to appreciate. But we still
expect appreciation to return in the second half of the year
with export growth recovering, capital inflows resuming and U.S.
election entering the final stage.”  “They can still exert influence to the direction of the
rate through setting the daily fixing rate, but market supply
and demand will play greater role.”  “The recent development with greater two-way expectations
provides a good opportunity for them to move ahead with the yuan
reform, as believed by most observers and the officials.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
