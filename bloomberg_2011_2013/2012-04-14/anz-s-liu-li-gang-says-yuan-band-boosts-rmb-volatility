Liu Li-Gang, chief Greater China
economist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Hong
Kong , comments on the widening of the yuan’s trading band by the
People’s Bank of China:  “This move is consistent with its recent measures to fast
open China’s capital account. As China experiences two-way
capital flows, the renminbi’s volatility will naturally
increase. Allowing a flexible  exchange rate  will enhance PBOC’s
monetary policy independence and make its policy more effective.  ‘‘Now Chinese residents, firms, and FIs will have to live
with a more volatile renminbi exchange rate and start to use
hedging instruments. As such, Chinese commercial banks will have
a new source of revenue. Indeed, this move is an important step
to help improve the onshore renminbi market efficiency.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
