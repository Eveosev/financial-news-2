  Wang Tao , an economist with UBS AG
in  Hong Kong , comments on the widening of the yuan’s trading
band by the People’s Bank of China.  “This is largely expected” and a good time to increase
the currency’s flexibility, Wang said, citing a reduction in
China’s current account balance and balanced market expectations
on the yuan with “no large speculative bets one way or the
other.”  “Expect increased two way volatility” in yuan trading
this year, Wang said. The central bank acted to increase
exchange rate flexibility, he said. “Over time that should give
monetary policy more independence. For the short term, there is
not much impact.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
