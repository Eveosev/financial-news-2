France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange mobile-
phone unit expects average revenue per user to fall by about 10
percent in its home country, the French weekly  Investir  said,
citing France Telecom Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard.  The decline will be countered in part by growth in the
French mobile-phone market and by a contract the company has
with Iliad SA’s Free mobile-phone service, Investir reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
