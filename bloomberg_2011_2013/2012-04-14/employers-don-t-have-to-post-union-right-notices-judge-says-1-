Employers can’t be required by the
 National Labor Relations Board  to post notices informing workers
of their rights to form a union, a federal judge in  South
Carolina  ruled.  “There is not a single trace of statutory text that
indicates Congress intended for the board to proactively
regulate employers in this manner,” U.S. District Judge David
C. Norton in Charleston said in a ruling yesterday.  The judge issued his decision in a lawsuit brought by the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the South Carolina Chamber of
Commerce, challenging the rule that is set to go into effect
April 30.  A federal judge in Washington, in a separate challenge to
the rule, found last month that the board had the authority to
require companies to post notifications of union rights. The
same judge said the board can’t enforce the rule as a so-called
unfair labor practice, though.  Nancy Cleeland , a spokeswoman for the NLRB, didn’t
immediately return messages after regular business hours
yesterday seeking comment on the ruling .  The case is Chamber of Commerce of the United States v.
National Labor Relations Board, 11-02516, U.S. District Court,
District of South Carolina (Charleston.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
