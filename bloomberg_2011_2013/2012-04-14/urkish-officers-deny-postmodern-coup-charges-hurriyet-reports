Retired Turkish soldiers questioned
by prosecutors about their role in the so-called postmodern coup
of 1997 denied all charges, Hurriyet  reported .  Prosecutors began deposing 26 ex-officers, mostly colonels,
in Ankara after taking them into custody on April 12, according
to the Istanbul-based newspaper. The officers said they were
carrying out orders, Hurriyet reported.  The officers were detained in connection with a Feb. 28,
1997, National Security Council meeting that led to the toppling
of a coalition government led by an Islamist party. Retired
General Cevik Bir, the deputy chief of the General Staff at the
time, who called the ouster a “postmodern coup,” is among
those detained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
