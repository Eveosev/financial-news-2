Argentinian threats against
companies working in the Falkland Islands have no basis in
international law, the Times reported, citing an oil explorer
that plans to begin drilling in the area.  Tim Bushell, chief executive officer of  Falkland Oil & Gas
Ltd. (FOGL) , said that unless companies acquire assets in  Argentina 
that could be seized, international law provides no grounds for
legal action against them, the London-based newspaper reported.  Last month, Argentina’s embassy in  London  sent letters to
as many as 15 banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Plc, warning that they
would face criminal and civil action in Argentine courts for
advising Falkland oil explorers or even publishing research
notes about them, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
