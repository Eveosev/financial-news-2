Dutch bankers and insurers will
have to pledge an oath to put their clients’ interests first in
a government bid to improve confidence in the financial sector.  “With these measures, we’re taking an important step in
the right direction to restore the moral authority of the
sector,” Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  wrote in a
letter to parliament today. The  oath , which will be enforced by
regulator AFM, is part of new financial regulations scheduled to
take effect on Jan. 1, 2013.  The Dutch spent about 30 billion euros ($39 billion) on the
2008 bailout of Fortis’s Dutch units, including its stake in  ABN
Amro  Holding NV. Separate aid for ING Groep NV, SNS Reaal NV,
Aegon NV and the collapse of DSB Bank NV and Landsbanki Islands
hf’s Dutch Icesave unit drove up costs for the state and the
banking sector, respectively.  A parliamentary committee on April 11 concluded that the
previous Dutch government made “large errors” in its bailouts
of Fortis, ABN Amro and ING, pushing up risks and costs for
taxpayers. The committee in 2010 said the central bank’s
supervision of DSB and Icesave had been insufficient.  Separately,  De Jager  said he will expand government
supervision to include  hedge funds  and credit-rating companies.
The measures also include a ban on banks paying bonuses to
executives while receiving state aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
