Alstom SA (ALO)  Chief Executive Officer
Patrick Kron said France must reverse a decade-long decline in
competitiveness.  “Over the past 10 years there has been a narrowing of the
cost of production difference between France and  Germany ,” Kron
told France Info radio. “There has been a 10 percent cost
difference that has disappeared and it hasn’t been compensated
by an improvement in productivity in France.”  Alstom, the third-largest power-equipment maker, has 18,000
employees in France and 9,000 in Germany, Kron said.  Kron declined to say which French political party or
candidate would be best placed to help deliver a more
competitive economy.  “What’s important for a company like Alstom is that France
Inc. be as competitive as possible,” he told  France  Info.  To contact the reporter on this story:
