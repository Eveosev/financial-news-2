Treasuries advanced for a fourth
straight week, in the longest stretch of gains since August, as
concern the European sovereign-debt crisis was worsening drove
demand for the safety of U.S. government debt.  The  yield  on the 10-year note dropped below 2 percent
yesterday amid a report that Spanish banks’ borrowings from the
 European Central Bank  jumped last month. Treasuries were
supported after a report showed China’s gross domestic product
expanded less than economists forecast, encouraging speculation
global growth is slowing. Retail sales slowed in March,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before a report next week.  “The focus has shifted back to  Europe ,” said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, one of 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “All the increasing
concerns across the pond, the doldrums in Spain, are beginning
to impact Treasuries.”  Yields on 10-year notes decreased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point on the week, to 1.98 percent in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 advanced 20/32, or $6.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 5/32.  Strong Streak  The four weeks of price gains was the longest winning
streak since the five days ended Aug. 19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields have declined 31 basis points
since the week ended March 16.  Thirty-year bond yields decreased nine basis points to 3.13
percent. The debt, sensitive to inflation because of its long
maturity, returned 2.7 percent this month as of April 12,
compared with a 0.9 percent gain for the broad market, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Valuation measures show  U.S. government debt  is approaching
the most expensive levels in almost five weeks. The term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed, reached
negative 0.64 percent yesterday after touching negative 0.65
percent on April 10. A negative reading indicates investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-short position in 10-year note and 30-year bond
futures in the week ending April 10, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Futures Positions  Speculative 10-year note short positions, or bets prices
will fall, outnumbered long positions by 206,589 contracts on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Net-short positions fell by 5,538
contracts, or 3 percent, from a week earlier. For the 30-year
bond, net-short positions fell by 4,312 contracts, or 20
percent.  Treasuries were supported yesterday as  China ’s statistics
bureau reported  gross domestic product  expanded 8.1 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest since 2009.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for 8.4
percent growth.  “We’ve had somewhat friendly data, in the form of China
GDP,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government bond strategy at
CRT Capital Group in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default jumped
yesterday to a record as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggled
to prevent the nation from becoming the fourth euro-region
member to need a bailout.  Spain’s Debt  Credit-default swaps on Spain rose 17 basis points to 498
yesterday in  London , surpassing the high closing price of 493,
according to CMA. The contracts are up from 431 at the start of
the month and 380 at the end of 2011, signaling deterioration in
investor perceptions of  credit quality .  The yield on  Spain ’s 10-year bond reached 6 percent, close
to the four-month high of 6.02 percent reached April 11. Spanish
banks’ borrowings from the ECB jumped by almost 50 percent in
March, reaching the most on record, as lenders tapped emergency
loans and channel some of it into sovereign-debt purchases.  “It’s going to be a long process before Europe is out of
the woods,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at
primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York. “Europe has an
effect on our markets as well, and it will have an effect on
economic data and how our economy grows.”  Retail sales rose 0.3 percent in March, down from 1.1
percent expansion in the previous month, a Commerce Department
report April 16 is forecast to show.  Inflation Reading  The cost of living in the U.S. increased 0.3 percent in
March, matching forecasts, according to a report from the Labor
Department yesterday. Wholesale prices were unchanged in March,
Labor Department figures showed April 12 in  Washington .  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, was 2.27 percentage points yesterday. The
average for the past decade is 2.14 percentage points.  The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate, a  measure 
of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed uses to help
guide monetary policy was at 2.69 percent, below its 2.76
percent average during the past decade.  It touched 2.78 percent on March 19, the highest in 2012
and reached 3.23 percent in August, the highest since December
2010. The measure projects annual price increases over a five-
year period beginning in 2017.  Negative Yields  Treasury 10-year notes pay negative 0.7 percentage point,
after subtracting consumer price increases. The so-called  real
yields  in the U.S. averaged 2.6 percentage points during the
past 20 years. It hit a high of 5.9 percentage points in August
2009.  The U.S. will sell $16 billion of five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities on April 19. The U.S. sold $12
billion of the securities at the previous sale Dec. 15.  The Treasury sold $66 billion in notes and bonds this week,
including $13 billion in 30-year bonds April 12, $21 billion in
10-year notes the previous day and $32 billion in three-year
notes on April 10. This week’s sales raised $23.1 billion of new
cash as maturing securities held by the public total $42.9
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
