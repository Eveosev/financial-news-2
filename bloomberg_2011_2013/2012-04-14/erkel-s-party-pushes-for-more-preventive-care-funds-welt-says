The senior party in  Germany ’s
ruling coalition wants to double the amount of money health
insurers must provide for preventative care,  Welt  reported,
citing a strategy paper it had seen.  Insurers should provide a cumulative total of 400 million
euros ($523 million) for such measures annually, compared with
the 200 million euros they must now legally provide, Welt said,
citing the paper from the Christian Democratic Union. The actual
figure currently provided is more than 300 million euros each
year, according to Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
