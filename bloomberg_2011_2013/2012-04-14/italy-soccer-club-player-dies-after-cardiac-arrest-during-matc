A midfield player at Italian  soccer
club  Livorno died after suffering a cardiac arrest during a
match against Pescara today, the country’s Serie B league said
in a statement on its website.  Piermario Morosini, 25, made nine appearances for Livorno
after joining the team from Udinese in January, according to the
statement. His death comes less than a month after Bolton
Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba, 24, suffered a cardiac
arrest during a game on March 17. It took two hours for doctors
to get Muamba’s heart working. He has since started walking
again, manager Owen Coyle said April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
