Germany  has almost one million
unfilled jobs, the equivalent of one third of the nationâ€™s total
unemployed,  Bild  reported, citing a report from the Institute
for Employment Research.  The greatest number of vacancies is in the metal and
electric industries, where 120,000 positions such as
electricians and engineers remain free, Bild cited the
Nuremberg, Germany-based institute as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
