Turkey  is planning to introduce a
tiered natural gas pricing system to help reduce imports and
help plug its current-account deficit, Sabah reported, citing
Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz .  The measure will target low-income families and provide
incentives for energy savings to cut Turkey’s $15 billion annual
gas bill, the Istanbul-based newspaper  reported , citing Yildiz.
Turkey may reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent,
according to Sabah.  The  current account deficit  is equivalent to about 10
percent of Turkey’s $772 billion economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
