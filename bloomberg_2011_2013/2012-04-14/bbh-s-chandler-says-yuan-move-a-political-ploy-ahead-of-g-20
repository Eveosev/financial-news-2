Marc Chandler , chief currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New York ,
comments on China widening the yuan’s trading band today to 1
percent from 0.5 percent.  He spoke in a telephone interview:  “This is just the appearance of giving away something that
they really might not. They haven’t been using the previous 0.5
percent band anyway so it’s not as though they’ll suddenly let
it move 1 percent.”  “Under Bretton-Woods, currencies were allowed to move 1
percent anyway. This is still a fixed-exchange rate.”  “It’s a political ploy with limited economic impact.”  “It’s not coincidental that they’re doing this before the
G-20 and IMF meetings. China typically allows something to
happen before an important meeting. The goal here is to keep
their adversaries unbalanced.”  “The dollar is just one of the currencies they peg
against, so that shows this move is intended for a particular
audience.”  “This move by  China  won’t amount to much. Most people
don’t expect the renminbi to move very much this year,” he
said, referring to the yuan by its other name.  “We’re not expecting significant movement this year. We
think it will be flat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
