Sweden plans to cut carbon dioxide
emissions from vehicles by 600,000 tons per year by raising the
amount of biofuel in gasoline and diesel, the government said.  Under the proposal, fuel producers would from 2014 have to
double the amount of ethanol in gasoline to 10 percent and raise
the share of fatty acid methyl esters, FAME, in diesel to 7
percent from 4 percent, Hannes Carl Borg, political adviser to
Anna-Karin Hatt, minister for information technology and energy,
said in a telephone interview from  Stockholm  today.  The government is considering prolonging a  tax exemption  on
fuels with little or no fossil ingredients which expires at the
end of next year, Borg said. It will also levy a “small” tax
on FAME and ethanol in 2013 to avoid breaching European Union
law by making them too competitive, he said.  The initiatives will be part of the government’s spring
budget to be published on April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
