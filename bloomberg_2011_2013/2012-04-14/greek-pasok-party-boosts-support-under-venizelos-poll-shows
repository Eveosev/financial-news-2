Greece ’s socialist  Pasok  party has
gained support since former Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
was elected the party’s leader, a poll showed.  Pasok, which was the biggest party in parliament before
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos called elections for May 6, has
12.5 percent support, up from 10 percent in a poll on March 13,
according to the survey of 1,206 eligible voters by Pulse RC for
 Tipos tis Kiriakis  newspaper published today. Venizelos was
elected Pasok leader on March 19.  Antonis Samaras’s conservative  New Democracy  party had 17
percent support, unchanged from last month, according to the
poll. Neither New Democracy, which was the second-biggest party
in the Greek parliament, nor Pasok would attract enough votes to
win a majority, the poll indicated.  The combined 29.5 percent support for  New Democracy  and
Pasok, who both participate in Greece’s current interim
government, compares with the combined total of 43.5 percent for
smaller parties that oppose austerity measures required as part
of a 130 billion-euro ($170 billion) financial aid program for
Greece.  The number of parties in the parliament would increase to
seven from five if the election were held now, with the
 Democratic Left , the  Independent Greeks  and  Chryssi Avghi , or
Golden Dawn, all gaining representation for the first time, the
poll suggested. The nationalist  Laos  party, which withdrew from
the coalition government, would lose all its 16 seats, the poll
showed.  The survey was conducted between April 9 and April 11; no
margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
