The  United Nations  should
immediately resume talks with Syria on a monitoring mission to
ensure that a cease-fire agreement is respected, Russia’s
Foreign Ministry said.  The decision to recall UN negotiators has delayed the
deployment of monitors and is hindering the work of envoy  Kofi Annan , the Moscow-based ministry said today on its  website .  “Talks with the Syrian government were halted by the UN at
the very moment when they were starting to progress,” the
ministry said. “The negotiations between the UN and Syrian
authorities should be resumed immediately, and a technical group
should be sent to Syria to conclude that process.”  The UN Security Council plans to vote today on whether to
send as many as 30 observers.  Russia , which has vetoed two draft
resolutions that would have held Syrian President Bashar al- Assad responsible, said in the statement that all sides in the
conflict should observe a cease-fire, following attacks
yesterday on Syrian troops in Hama and other cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
