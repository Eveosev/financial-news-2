King Juan Carlos of  Spain  had
surgery today at a privately-owned Madrid hospital after
breaking his hip in a fall while on a trip to Botswana, the
Palace said.  The King, 74, broke his right hip in three places,
according to a statement on the Palace web site. Surgeons at USP
Hospitales SL’s San Jose Hospital rebuilt the joint, which had
been weakened by arthritis, and added a prosthesis.  Juan Carlos had been on a hunting trip when the accident
happened and was repatriated to Spain in a 10-hour journey by
private jet, El Pais reported, showing a picture of the monarch
holding a rifle in front of a prostrate elephant.  The news provoked criticism from the Spanish media, which
contrasted the King’s travels with the austerity measures
crippling the country’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
