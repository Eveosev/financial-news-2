Yao Wei, a Hong Kong-based
economist at Societe Generale SA, comments on the widening of
the yuan’s trading band by the People’s Bank of  China .  “This is a small step but a big gesture of China’s
commitment to liberalize its  exchange rate . Recently China has
clearly accelerated the pace of capital account openness.  “The change essentially gives more say to the market to
determine the path of the yuan. Given the market expectations
indicated by the currency forward curves, the yuan will probably
continue fluctuating around current levels for some time, but
with more volatility.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
