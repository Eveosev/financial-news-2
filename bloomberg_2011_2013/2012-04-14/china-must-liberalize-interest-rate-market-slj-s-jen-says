China  needs to liberalize its
interest-rate market before the yuan has a chance of becoming a
reserve currency, according to Stephen Jen, a managing partner
of SLJ Macro Partners LLP, a London-based hedge fund and
economic research firm.  Jen, formerly the global head of currency research at
Morgan Stanley, commented by e-mail following China’s decision
to widen its currency’s trading band for the first time since
2007.  On  interest rates :  “Perhaps the most important market that needs to be
liberalized is the interest rate market.  China does not yet
have a yield curve that is market-determined. The liberalization
of the RMB market is the flip side of liberalizing the bond
markets. Both steps will need to be taken for the RMB to ever
become a reserve currency.”  On politics:  “Until Beijing stops intervening in the  currency markets ,
regardless of the variability of the RMB, the RMB will still be
controlled rather than market-determined.  My own guess is that
Beijing is genuine in their desire to scale back
interventions.”  On valuation:  “I personally think that the RMB is no longer under-
valued. Wage inflation has been running at around 15 percent a
year for three consecutive years.  This means that, if the
global economy slows, it will no longer be clear that the RMB
would not depreciate against the dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
