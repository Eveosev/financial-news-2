The U.K.’s health minister Andrew Lansley said he shouldn’t be moved from his job before his
National Health Service reforms are fully implemented, the
London-based Times newspaper reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Lansley said it would
be absurd to replace him before the reforms are in place, which
won’t be completed by the end of this year, the Times reported.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  is planning to reshuffle his
ministers later this year, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
