KBC Groep NV (KBC)  plans to create a
single board of directors for its bank and insurance units to
reduce costs, De Tijd  said , citing KBC spokesman Stef Leunens.  KBC would cut the cost of holding board meetings by 40
percent by holding them on the same day and paying board members
for attending one, the newspaper said. KBC didnâ€™t give an
estimate for the savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
