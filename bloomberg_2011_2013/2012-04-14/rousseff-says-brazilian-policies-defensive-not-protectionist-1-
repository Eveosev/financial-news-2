Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
denied her government was undertaking protectionist policies and
called on the developed world to boost investment, rather than
relying on monetary stimulus to fuel demand.  Europe ’s monetary policy in response to its sovereign debt
crisis is flooding  emerging markets  with money, overvaluing
their exchange rates and threatening local industry, Rousseff
said in a speech in Cartagena,  Colombia  today.  “It’s clear that we have to take measures to defend
ourselves,” Rousseff said. “I said defend, not protect. To
defend is different, defend means to perceive that we cannot
leave our manufacturing sector be cannibalized.”  Since August, Brazilian central bank president Alexandre Tombini has reduced the benchmark Selic rate five times as the
priority to revive economic growth outweighed concern inflation
would remain above target. Rousseff has also increased import
tariffs and three weeks ago ordered tax cuts and other stimulus
measures worth about 65 billion reais ($35.4 billion), as she
seeks to protect domestic manufacturers from what she called
“predatory” competition from rich nations.  Euro zone monetary expansion is “provoking a real monetary
tsunami,” Rousseff said today. “This is affecting us by
causing our currencies to appreciate, an obstacle for the trade
in goods and services and transforms our economies in easy prey
for deindustrialization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
