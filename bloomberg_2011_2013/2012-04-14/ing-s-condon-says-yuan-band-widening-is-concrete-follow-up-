Tim Condon , chief Asia economist at
ING Financial Markets, comments on the widening of the yuan’s
trading band by the People’s Bank of  China .  “The move represents a concrete follow-up to the recent
rhetorical change in the official line that the RMB exchange
rate is close to an equilibrium level.  “By reducing the RMB’s attractiveness to hot money,
greater two-way exchange rate risk makes possible capital
account opening, which would be a logical next step.  “If so, we are in the early stage of what will be as
momentous for China as WTO accession in 2001.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
