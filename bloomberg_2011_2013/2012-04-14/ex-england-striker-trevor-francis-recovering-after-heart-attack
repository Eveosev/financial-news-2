Francis is “recovering well” after suffering a heart attack

million) player when he joined Nottingham Forest from Birmingham
in 1979. He scored the goal in a 1-0 win over Malmo in the
European Cup final in his first season with Forest.  Francis played 52 times for England, including at the 1982
 World Cup , scoring 12 times. He also managed Birmingham and
Crystal Palace, along with player-manager spells at Queens Park
Rangers and Sheffield Wednesday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
