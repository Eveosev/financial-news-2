Israeli stocks traded in New York
had the biggest weekly decline this year on concern slower
growth in  China  and the U.S. will erode earnings for technology
companies  Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE)  and  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT)   Nice, a maker of analytical telecommunications software,
slid 2.3 percent to $38.30 in New York last week, widening the
 discount  to its  Tel Aviv  shares to the most among dually traded
shares. Allot rose 1.6 percent to 89.49 shekels today, or the
equivalent of $23.88, after dropping 2.4 percent for the week in
New York to $23.73, and further narrowing its premium to 15
cents. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  had the largest
weekly decline since Nov. 25, dropping 2.3 percent last week to
87.53. Nice shares fell 3.1 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Tel Aviv today.  The highest valuations in at least eight months are
spurring investors to sell Israeli technology stocks after China
posted the smallest economic growth in almost three years and
U.S. consumer confidence weakened, according to Chardan Capital
Markets LLC. Allot  sold  about 35 percent of its products in Asia
and the U.S. in 2010, while 63 percent of Nice’s revenue is
derived from companies in the Americas.  “Any kind of data that suggests a slowdown globally,
especially in China, where so much of the tech products are
getting sold into or manufactured from, brings a lot of
nervousness,”  Jay Srivatsa , the managing director of equity
research at Chardan, said by phone last week. “We still don’t
know if the recovery in the U.S. market is for real or not.”  Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot’s U.S. stock is valued at
64 times  reported earnings , about four times the 17.7 ratio for
shares on the  Nasdaq Composite Index. (CCMP)  The company’s valuation
has fallen from a multiple of 66 on April 9, the highest level
since Aug 1.  EZchip Drops  Nice’s Tel Aviv shares declined to 141.70 shekels today,
the equivalent of $37.81, or 42 times reported profit.  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) , the Yokneam, Israel-based
manufacturer of network processors, rose 1.2 percent today to
164 shekels, or the equivalent of $43.76. The shares in New York
fell 0.6 percent last week to $43.41, paring its valuation to 68
times earnings.  U.S. stocks posted their largest weekly loss this year. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid 2 percent in the week and the
Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent.  Israel ’s benchmark  TA-25
index (TA-25)  slid 0.9 percent to 1,121.29 after a 1.2 percent decline
last week in trading shortened by the Passover holiday. The
gauge dropped 1.8 percent today to 1,110.48.  Allot, which Chardan rates a buy, derived 13 percent of its
sales from U.S. customers in 2010 and 22 percent from Asia and
Oceania.  The company will get “multi-million dollar revenues” from
U.S. carriers in 2012, Rami Hadar, Allot’s chief executive
officer, said on a Feb. 7 conference call with analysts.  ClickSoftware Falls Short  EZchip got 40 percent of its 2011  revenue  from China and
 Hong Kong  and 19 percent from  North America .  ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW)  slid 17 percent last week
to $10.46, the worst performance since October 2009. The Petach
Tikva, Israel-based maker of order-tracking software said first
quarter revenue will be about $21.6 million, falling short of
the $22.5 million median of four analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg before the company’s announcement.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  rose 0.7 percent in Tel Aviv
today to 153.30 shekels, or the equivalent of $40.91. The 59-
cent  premium  afforded the stock last week in New York was the
largest among the biggest dual-listed Israeli companies.  Mellanox, which developed a technology used to transfer and
store data, will probably say on April 18 that first-quarter
adjusted net income rose 39 percent to 33 cents a share,
according to the median  estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Microsoft Boost  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest software maker, and
 Intel Corp. (INTC) , the largest semiconductor company, are scheduled to
announce earnings this week.  While analysts expect Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
to report that fiscal third-quarter sales rose at a slower pace
than the previous year and that Santa Clara, California-based
Intel will say revenue fell in the first quarter, the companies
may indicate positive outlooks, providing a boost for technology
stocks, Chardan’s Srivatsa said.  “We’re going to need to wait to see how Intel and
Microsoft and those guys come out,” he said. “My sense is that
the first quarter for the most part appears to be bottom for a
lot of the tech names.”  Microsoft’s sales gained 4.4 percent in the first three
months of the year, according to 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, compared with 13 percent growth last year. Intel will
probably say that revenue fell 0.2 percent to $12.8 billion,
according to the median of 40 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  LivePerson CEO  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after
China. The nation is also home to more startup firms per capita
than the U.S.  LivePerson Inc. (LPSN) , a maker of software that can track and
communicate with consumers surfing websites, will boost revenue
growth as companies seek out more data on their customers, Chief
Executive Officer Robert Locascio said in an interview at
LivePerson’s New York headquarters on April 11.  Shares of the company, which has about 50 percent of its
staff in Ra’anana, Israel, advanced 0.5 percent to 58.74 shekels
today, or the equivalent of $15.67, after New York shares fell
5.8 percent to $15.54 last week.  SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , an Airport City, Israel-
based manufacturer of machines for making soda at home, gained 3
percent to $35.62 on April 13, boosting its weekly gain to 6.9
percent.  “SodaStream’s technology, product portfolio, customer
relationships, and execution capabilities have helped position
it as the global leader in home beverage carbonation,” Jon Andersen, an analyst at William Blair & Co., wrote in an e-
mailed note on April 13 titled “10 reasons we continue to like
the SodaStream story.” Anderson maintained an outperform rating
on the stock, indicating he expects it to rise more than the
overall market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
