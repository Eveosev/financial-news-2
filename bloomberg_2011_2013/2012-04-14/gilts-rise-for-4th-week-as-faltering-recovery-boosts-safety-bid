U.K. gilts advanced for a fourth
week as signs the global economic recovery is faltering and
 Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening fueled demand for the safest
fixed-income assets.  Ten-year  bond  yields dropped to the lowest since February
after a U.S. report showed more Americans filed for jobless
benefits than economists forecast. Gilts rose yesterday as data
showed Spanish banks’ borrowings from the  European Central Bank 
jumped by almost 50 percent in March, fueling speculation the
regional debt crisis is getting worse. The pound weakened
against the yen.  “ Risk aversion  has clearly picked up and fears about the
fiscal position in Spain have been rekindled,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks. “Until we see signs of either an
improvement in the fiscal position in Europe or we start to see
growth picking up, then investors are going to remain wary. As a
result safe-haven flows will persist for gilts near term.”  The yield on the  benchmark  10-year gilt fell 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point this week, to 2.04 percent at
5 p.m. London time yesterday. The 4 percent bond due in March
2022 gained 1.1, or 11 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,598) face
amount, to 117.46. The four weeks of price gains is the longest
since the period through Dec. 30.  China Slows  China’s economic growth slowed to 8.1 percent in the first
quarter, the least since the middle of 2009, the National Bureau
of Statistics said in Beijing yesterday. A U.S. report on April
6 showed payrolls increased by the smallest amount in five
months in March.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points this week
to 5.98 percent.  Average net borrowings  from the ECB by Spanish
banks climbed to 227.6 billion euros ($298 billion) last month
from 152.4 billion euros in February, the  Bank of Spain  said.  Economist predict a U.K. report on April 17 will show
consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in March from a year earlier,
staying above the central bank’s 2 percent target.  Gilts have returned 1 percent this month, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose 0.5 percent, and
Spanish bonds dropped 2.5 percent.  The pound dropped 0.9 percent against  Japan ’s currency this
week to 128.35 yen. Sterling declined 0.1 percent to $1.5854,
and was little changed at 83.51 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
