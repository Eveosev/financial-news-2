The United Nations  Security Council 
today authorized the deployment of observers to  Syria  to monitor
a cease-fire that is being tested by nationwide protests against
President Bashar al-Assad.  The 15-member body voted 15-0 to pass a resolution that
“calls upon the Syrian government to implement visibly its
commitments in their entirety,” in accordance to a six-point
plan laid out by UN special envoy  Kofi Annan . An advance team of
as many as 30 unarmed military observers will go to Syria, 
followed by a bigger mission if conditions on the ground allow it.  This is the first time the UN’s most powerful body has
succeeded in passing a binding measure on Syria. Russia vetoed in
October and February two draft resolutions seeking to hold Assad
accountable.  The council also “expresses its intention to assess the
implementation of this resolution and to consider further steps
as appropriate.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
