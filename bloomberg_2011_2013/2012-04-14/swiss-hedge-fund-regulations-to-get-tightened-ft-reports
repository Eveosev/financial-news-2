The Swiss government is preparing
to tighten regulations on  hedge funds , a move that may make it
into one of the most “exacting” jurisdictions in the world for
money managers, the Financial Times said.  The regulations were proposed by the Federal Council and
must be voted on by the country’s parliament, the newspaper
reported. The proposed laws, which haven’t yet been translated
into English, are intended to bring the country into line with
the European Union’s own policies, and exceed them in some key
areas, the FT said.  Under the new proposal, any overseas investment fund that
takes money from a Swiss institution will have to comply with
requirements laid out by Finma, the Swiss financial supervisory
authority, and also must have a permanent representative based
in  Switzerland , according to the report. Finma’s requirements
may include demands for tax and asset transparency as well as
minimum standards of governance, according to the FT.  Wealthy individuals would also be stripped of their
automatic status as “qualified investors” permitted to deposit
money with hedge funds directly, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
