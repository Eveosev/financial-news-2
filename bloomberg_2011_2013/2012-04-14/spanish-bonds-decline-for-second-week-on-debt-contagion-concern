Spanish bonds fell for a second
week on concern  European Central Bank  measures to boost
liquidity are proving insufficient to prevent the euro-region
debt crisis from spreading.  Ten-year Spanish  yields  climbed to the highest since the
ECB started allocating three-year loans in December even as the
government passed new measures to crack down on  tax fraud .
Italian bonds slid for a fifth week after borrowing costs jumped
at an auction. German note yields dropped to record lows.  “The same concern that people have about Spain or Italy
haven’t gone away, but they just resurfaced after recent poor
auctions,” said Mohit Kumar, head of European fixed-income
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “Yields may have room
to rise further but I see this as a correction following a rapid
move down, and not a turn in sentiment.”  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield climbed 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, this week to 5.98 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. The 5.85 percent bond maturing in January 2022
dropped 1.385, or 13.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,308) face
amount, to 99.05.  Similar-maturity Italian yields increased seven basis
points this week to 5.52 percent, while Portuguese yields
climbed 32 basis points to 12.56 percent.  Spain’s government securities slid yesterday as data showed
the nation’s banks increased borrowings from the ECB by almost
50 percent in March, reaching the most on record. Average net
borrowings by the companies climbed to 227.6 billion euros from
152.4 billion euros in February, the Bank of Spain said.  Italy Auction  Italy ’s cost of borrowing for three years rose 1.1
percentage points from a month earlier when it auctioned notes
on April 12. The Treasury sold 2.88 billion euros ($3.78
billion) of the securities at 3.89 percent, up from 2.76 percent
on March 14.  “A good part of the current turbulence” in debt markets
“is due to Spanish contagion,” Maria Cannata, head of Italy’s
debt agency, told reporters in  Rome  on April 11. Italy’s  two-
year yield  has increased more than 150 basis points during the
past six weeks.  The yield on Germany’s 10-year bund was little changed this
week at 1.74 percent. The  two-year yield  dropped one basis point
to 0.13 percent after declining to 0.091 percent on April 10,
the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling data on the
securities in 1990.  Germany  will sell two-year notes on April 18, while Spain
is scheduled to auction two- and 10-year debt on April 19.
 France  plans to sell two-, three- and five-year notes and
inflation-linked bonds on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
