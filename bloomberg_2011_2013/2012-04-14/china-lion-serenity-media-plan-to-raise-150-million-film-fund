Serenity Media Group and China Lion
Culture Media Co. plan to raise at least $150 million to finance
U.S.-Chinese co-productions.  The companies intend to finance two to four movies a year,
Serenity, based in Beverly Hills,  California , and Beijing-based
China Lion said in an e-mailed statement.  Hollywood studios are trying to increase ties with  Chinese
film production and finance companies. DreamWorks Animation SKG
in February announced a venture, Oriental DreamWorks, with two
Chinese state-owned companies to develop projects including
theme parks and live entertainment.  China Lion Culture Media is affiliated with China Lion Film
Distribution Inc., a distributor of Chinese films to U.S.
cinemas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
