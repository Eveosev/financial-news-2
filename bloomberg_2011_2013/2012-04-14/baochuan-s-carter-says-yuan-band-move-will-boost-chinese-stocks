Kevin Carter , co-founder and chief
executive officer at Baochuan Capital Management LLC, speaks
about China’s decision to widen the yuan’s trading band for the
first time since 2007.  He spoke by telephone from Walnut Creek, California:  “China is continuing to take many steps toward opening and
liberalizing its markets and economy. It’s very clear that
China’s ultimate long-term goal is to have a reserve currency
and the yuan needs to trade according to market-driven
mechanisms to allow that to happen. It’s another step on a path
that they planned out a long time ago.”  “The G-20 and IMF meetings are coming up and China was
going to get pressure from other economies to let the currency
appreciate. It might take a little of the pressure off to make
this gesture. This is a choreographed move to damp some of the
pressure they were going to get.”  “While it’s more of a gesture than a real move with
impact, it’s a small piece of a bigger long-term goal to open up
 China ’s markets and currency.”  Impact on stock markets:  “The market, for the most part, has been reacting better
this year to news out of China than last year. This could
certainly be another positive thing for Chinese stocks.  “The market response will be that this is China opening up
long-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
