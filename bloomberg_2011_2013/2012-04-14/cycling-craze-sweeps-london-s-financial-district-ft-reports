A wave of enthusiasm for cycling is
sweeping through  London ’s financial district as people swap
Porsches for Pinarellos, the Financial Times reported.  Bike shops are springing up around the capital and cycling
trips have increased by 81 percent since 2000, the newspaper
said, citing data from Transport for London. Big institutions
are responding by providing more bike storage. HSBC Holdings Plc
last year doubled cycle-rack capacity at its Canary Wharf
headquarters to 400, the Financial Times said.  A top-flight bike from makers such as Parlee of the U.S. or
 Italy ’s Pinarello can cost more than $10,000, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
