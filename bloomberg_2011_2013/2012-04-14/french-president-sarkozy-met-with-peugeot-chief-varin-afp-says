French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
met with PSA Peugeot Citroen’s Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin for almost an hour today, Agence France-Presse reported,
citing the president’s office.  Sarkozy promised yesterday on French television to do all
he could to save Peugeot’s Aulnay factory.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-largest carmaker, said in
September that it would review the Aulnay factory because of a
lack of competitiveness. The plant employs about 3,300 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
