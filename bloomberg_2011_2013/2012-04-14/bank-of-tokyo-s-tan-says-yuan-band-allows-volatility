Cliff Tan, East Asia head of global
currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in  Hong Kong ,
comments on the widening of the yuan’s trading band by the
People’s Bank of  China :  “It happened a quarter earlier than I have expected. I
expected it to be at the second half of the year.  ‘‘It’s very in line with what (PBOC Governor) Zhou
Xiaochuan has been saying that they feel like in the next phrase
in the exchange rate reform for the market forces to play a
bigger role.  ‘‘They are quite serious about letting market forces play a
bigger role so that the exchange rate could be the shock
absorber for the current account. The key is not where the
theoretical trading range is, but the actual trading range that
addresses the demand and supply.  ‘‘This is a statement about volatility not the level. The
 exchange rate  should be moving faster to its equilibrium, but it
still depends on how China manages it. It’ll take a few months
to see, under the new regime, how the exchange rate moves with a
wider band.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
