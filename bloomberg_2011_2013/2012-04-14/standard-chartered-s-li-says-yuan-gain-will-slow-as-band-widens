Li Wei , a Shanghai-based economist
at Standard Chartered Plc. comments on the widening of the
yuan’s trading band by the People’s Bank of China.  “The move is expected and there should be less yuan
appreciation, but more volatility going forward.  ‘‘The macroeconomic case for new yuan gains has weakened
given the narrowing of China’s external surpluses, subdued
inflationary pressures and clouds over China’s export prospects.  ‘‘It also seems likely that the yuan valuation issue has
slipped down the international policy agenda given China’s
status as a potential provider of new financing for the
 International Monetary Fund  and Europe.  ‘‘Chinese officials have signaled that they see the yuan’s
current valuation as approaching equilibrium and plan to give
market forces a bigger role.’’  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
