An explosion hit the Mozdok-
Gazimagomed pipeline carrying natural gas from  Azerbaijan  to
southern  Russia , causing a fire.  The blast late yesterday in Azerbaijanâ€™s Shamakhi District
section of the pipeline resulted from a gas leak, the state gas
distribution company, Azariqaz, said on its website. No
casualties were reported, and the fire has been extinguished,
the company said.  Nizamaddin Quliyev, a spokesman for State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, or Socar, said that gas supplies to Russia were not
affected.  The explosion was powerful enough to be heard in
neighboring districts, the private ANS television channel said,
citing its reporter in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
