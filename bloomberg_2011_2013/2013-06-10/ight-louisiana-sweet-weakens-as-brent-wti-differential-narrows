Light crude in the U.S. Gulf of
 Mexico  weakened on the  spot market  as Brentâ€™s premium to West
Texas Intermediate shrunk after the Buzzard oil field in the
 North Sea  returned to full production.  Buzzard production returned to approximately full pumping
rates over the weekend, two people with knowledge of the matter
said. The oil field is now pumping about 208,000 barrels a day,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Buzzard is the largest contributor to the Forties crude
grade, which typically sets the price of the Dated Brent
benchmark. The Brent-WTI spread narrowed 35 cents to $8.18 a
barrel. U.S. Gulf Coast crudes compete against foreign oils
priced against Brent for space in coastal refineries.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark light oil on the Gulf,
weakened by 25 cents to a $9.25-a-barrel premium to WTI in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 2:06 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Mars Blend, a medium sour crude from the Gulf, also
weakened by 25 cents to a $4.25-a-barrel premium to WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 15 cents to $9.75 a
barrel more than WTI. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon
strengthened 10 cents to a $2.50-a-barrel premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
