The  Federal Reserve  will probably
reduce its bond-buying program in December rather than in
September as current Treasury yield levels indicate, according
to Morgan Stanley’s Matthew Hornbach.  “December is a more likely time for tapering to begin,”
according to a June 7 note written by Hornbach, the head of U.S.
interest-rate strategy at the bank, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade directly with the Fed.  An increase in Treasury yields to 2.25 percent from 2.17
percent today would be an opportunity to increase portfolio
duration, New York-based Hornbach wrote. Such a yield would
represent forecasts for a reduction in July or sooner, which
would be unlikely, the report said. Duration is a measure of a
bond’s sensitivity to changes in yield, and a longer duration
indicates a more bullish position.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed today as of
12:38 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May 2023 was 96
9/32.  Treasuries have fallen for six weeks, the longest streak in
four years. U.S. payrolls advanced while the jobless rate rose
in May, the Labor Department reported on June 7, supporting
speculation the Fed will reduce its monetary stimulus.  Policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will trim
their so-called quantitative easing program to $65 billion a
month at the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee , from the current level of $85 billion, according to
the median estimate in the survey of 59 economists last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
