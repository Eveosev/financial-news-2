Natural gas futures rose a second
day in New York amid an outlook for hotter weather that may spur
demand from power plants.  Gas gained as much as 0.9 percent as above-normal
temperatures may descend across most of the lower 48 dates
through June 24, with lower readings in the Northeast, according
to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Prices
dropped 3.9 percent last week as mild weather cut fuel use and a
government report showed a larger-than-forecast supply increase.  “With the hotter temperatures coming in we are going to
get cooling demand,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “The bearish factor is the fact that
the U.S. is a prolific producer of natural gas and demand hasn’t
caught up to the supply side.”  Natural gas for July delivery increased 2.7 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.855 per million British thermal units at 10:13
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 8.6
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. The
futures are up 15 percent this year.  The discount of July to October futures narrowed 0.2 cent
to 3.6 cents from June 7.  July $3.80 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading. They fell 1.5 cents to 6.5 cents per million Btu on
volume of 504 at 10:15 a.m. The second-most-active options were
August $4.30 calls, which dropped 0.1 cent to 0.6 cent on volume
of 128. Puts accounted for 64 percent of trading volume. Implied
volatility for at-the-money options expiring in July was 29.13
percent at 10 a.m., up from 27.51 percent on June 7.  Texas Heat  The high temperature in Houston on June 14 may be 96
degrees Fahrenheit (36 Celsius), 6 above normal, while New
York’s reading may be 1 degree higher than average at 80,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  Power plants, the largest U.S. consumer of natural gas,
will account for 32 percent of demand in 2013, Energy
Information Administration data show.  Gas stockpiles expanded by 111 billion cubic feet to 2.252
trillion in the week ended May 31, above the five-year gain of
92 billion for the period, the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said last week.  U.S. inventories were 3 percent below the five-year average
for the week, the  smallest deficit  to the average since March
29. A  deficit  to year-earlier levels narrowed for the eighth
straight week, reaching 21.5 percent from 23.7 percent.  Gas supplies may climb to 3.78 trillion cubic feet by Nov.
1 as production continues to grow while higher gas prices prompt
some electricity generators to use coal instead, Bill Herbert,
an analyst with Simmons & Co., said in a note to client today.  The EIA estimates that U.S. marketed gas production in 2013
will set a record for the sixth straight year, climbing 1
percent to 69.9 billion cubic feet a day, according to its May 7
 Short-Term Energy Outlook .  To contact the reporter on this story:
