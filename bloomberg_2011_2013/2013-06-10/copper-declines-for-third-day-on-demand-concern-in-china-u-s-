Copper slumped for a third day as
 China ’s trade and industrial production in May trailed estimates
and on prospects that the  Federal Reserve  will scale back
stimulus. China and the U.S. are the top consumers of metals.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to $7,151.25 a metric ton,
the lowest price since May 16, and was at $7,157.25 at 10:24
a.m. in  Tokyo . Prices lost 1.1 percent last week. Futures for
delivery in July on the Comex slid 1.1 percent to $3.2325 per
pound.  China’s industrial output rose a less-than-forecast 9.2
percent in May from a year earlier and factory-gate prices fell
for a 15th month, while export gains were at a 10-month low and
imports dropped, data released over the weekend show. American
employers took on 175,000 workers in May, beating the 163,000
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, data showed on June 7.  “China’s data over the weekend stoked concern over demand
in China, depressing the metals markets,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .
Better-than-expected U.S. jobs data fueled debate over whether
the Fed will reduce bond purchases, he said.  Unwrought copper and copper products imports by China were
358.672 tons in May, the customs agency said on June 8. That
compared with 295,799 tons in April and 419,741 tons a year ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Futures
Exchange is closed today through June 12 for the Dragon Boat
Festival holiday.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
