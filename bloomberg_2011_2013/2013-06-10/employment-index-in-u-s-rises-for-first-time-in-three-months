A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. climbed in May for the first time in three months,
indicating bigger job gains will be slow to develop in the
second half of the year.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index rose 0.6
percent to 111.76, the highest reading since June 2008, the New
York-based research group said today. The measure was up 3
percent from May 2012.  The index “is suggesting that a significant improvement in
employment growth is unlikely this summer,”  Gad Levanon ,
director of macroeconomic research at the Conference Board, said
in a statement. “Growth in the ETI has remained weak.”  Today’s report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed U.S. employers added more workers than forecast in May.
Payrolls rose by 175,000 workers after a 149,000 increase in
April. The unemployment rate climbed to 7.6 percent from 7.5
percent as the number of people entering the workforce swamped
the number of positions available.  Improvements in seven of the Conference Board index’s eight
components contributed to the gain, today’s report showed. These
included a jump in hiring of temporary workers, more job
openings and an increase in the share of employers saying jobs
were difficult to fill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
