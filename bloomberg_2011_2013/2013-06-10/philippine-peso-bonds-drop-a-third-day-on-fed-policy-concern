The Philippine peso fell for a third
day and government bonds declined after U.S. data spurred
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will rein in monetary stimulus
that has bolstered demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on Philippine bonds due 2037 was near a four-month high after U.S. payrolls rose 175,000 in May, exceeding
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a gain of 163,000,
official data showed on June 7. The U.S. jobless rate rose to
7.6 percent last month. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said in May that the central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases may be scaled back if the U.S. employment outlook
shows sustainable improvement.  “All eyes are focused on what the Fed’s going to do,”
said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage
the equivalent of $18 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc in
 Manila . The U.S. data supported “the belief that the U.S. is on
its way to a recovery,” he said.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent, the most this month, to
42.495 per dollar as of 11:08 a.m. in Manila, according to
prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency touched 42.625 on
May 30, the lowest level since June 25, 2012. The currency has
lost 3.5 percent this year.  The yield on the 6.125 percent  government bonds  due
November 2037 advanced 10 basis points to 4.95 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate
reached 5 percent on June 7, the highest level since Feb. 11.  Overseas funds  sold  $200 million more Philippine stocks
than they bought last week, reducing net purchases for the year
to $1.54 billion, exchange data show.  Policy Meeting  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its benchmark
overnight borrowing rate at a record-low 3.5 percent when policy
makers meet on June 13, all 18 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey predict.  The monetary authority cut the rate it pays on special
deposit accounts on April 25 for the third time this year to
curb capital inflows that were spurring peso gains. The currency
strengthened 6.8 percent in 2012 and touched 40.55 per dollar on
Jan. 14, the strongest level since March 2008.  “ Monetary policy  is accommodative without the currency
being subject to a one-way risk,”  Tim Condon , head of Asia
research in  Singapore  at ING Groep NV, wrote in a report today.
He said there was no market pressure for the central bank to
reduce the SDA rate.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined 39 basis
points, or 0.39 percentage point, today to 6.11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
