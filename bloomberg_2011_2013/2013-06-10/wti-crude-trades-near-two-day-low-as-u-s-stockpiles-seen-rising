West Texas Intermediate declined for
a second day before a report forecast to show crude stockpiles
increased last week in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of
the commodity.  Futures declined as much as 1.3 percent in  New York . U.S.
crude inventories probably rose by  550,000 barrels  to 391.8
million last week, and U.S. gasoline supplies by  500,000 barrels 
to 219.3 million, according to a Bloomberg News survey before a
report tomorrow from the Energy Information Administration. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised crude
output in May to the highest level in six months while keeping
its demand forecast for 2013 unchanged.  “Fundamentals are still skewed towards oversupply, though
there are some minor clouds on the horizon,” Michael Poulsen,
an analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,  Denmark .  WTI for July delivery fell by as much as $1.27 to $94.50 a
barrel and was at $94.62 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 1:08 p.m. London time. The volume of
all futures traded was 34 percent below the 100-day average. The
contract settled at $95.77 a barrel yesterday, the lowest close
since June 6.  Brent for July settlement decreased $1.43 to $102.52 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI shrank to as little as
$7.74 a barrel today, the narrowest gap since May 22.  Fuel Supplies  Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, probably increased by 900,000 barrels to 124.2
million, according to Bloomberg’s survey of estimates for the
EIA data survey.  Refinery utilization  rates in the U.S. climbed 0.3
percentage points to 88.7 percent, the highest since the seven
days ended Jan. 4, the survey of analysts shows. The Memorial
Day holiday on May 27 marks the start of the nation’s peak
driving period, and plants typically boost output this time of
year to meet summer demand for motor fuel.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  is
scheduled to release separate stockpile data today. The API
collects the information on a voluntary basis from operators of
refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The government
requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, for its weekly survey.  Global resources of oil and natural gas from shale
formations are greater than previously estimated, the EIA said
yesterday in an assessment. Shale gas estimates increased by 10
percent from 2011 to 7,299 trillion cubic feet. Resources of
tight oil, which wasn’t assessed in 2011, may be 345 billion
barrels, the EIA said in the report.  OPEC Production  OPEC increased production by 106,000 barrels a day to 30.57
million a day last month, led by gains in  Saudi Arabia , the
group said today in its monthly market report, citing secondary
sources. Global oil demand will increase by 780,000 barrels a
day, or 0.9 percent, this year to 89.7 million a day, in line
with estimates in the previous report.  The  International Energy Agency , an adviser to oil-consuming nations, will publish its monthly estimates of supply
and demand tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
