Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained,
signaling the first advance for equities in three days, as U.S.
and Japanese data boosted confidence in the global economy.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery climbed 0.9
percent to 5,935 at 10:05 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index dropped 0.7 percent to 5,881 on June 7. The S&P BSE
Sensex slid 0.5 percent to 19,429.23. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares rose 0.3 percent.  Data on June 7 showed American employers took on 175,000
workers in May, beating the 163,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. The U.S. accounted for 11 percent of India’s
exports in the fiscal year ended March 2012.  Japan ’s gross
domestic product expanded an annualized 4.1 percent in the first
quarter, compared with a preliminary calculation of 3.5 percent,
the nation’s government reported today.  Steelmakers may be active after the rupee completed its
fifth weekly decline against the dollar amid concern the U.S.
Federal Reserve may scale back debt purchases that have fueled
fund flows to emerging markets. The Indian currency’s tumble to
its weakest level versus the dollar in almost a year increases
the value of overseas steel sales.  The Sensex has slumped 4.2 percent since climbing to its
highest level since January 2011 on May 17. The gauge is valued
at 13.4 times  projected 12-month profits , compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10 times.  Overseas investors sold a net $39.7 million of Indian
stocks on June 6, paring this year’s inflows to $15.2 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
