Russian shares climbed for a second
day as crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner, traded near
the highest level in more than two weeks. Bank Rossii holds a
meeting to review rates today.  The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.2 percent to 1,346.58
by 10:23 a.m. in Moscow after losing 0.5 percent last week. VTB
Group, Russia’s second-biggest lender, increased 1.8 percent to
4.84 kopeks. OAO Severstal, Russia’s second-largest steelmaker,
added 1.3 percent to 240.50 rubles.  Crude, which together with natural gas contributes 50
percent of Russia’s budget revenue, traded at $96.07 amid
speculation demand will improve in the U.S. as data showed U.S.
employers added more workers than expected to payrolls in May.
Central bank chairman Sergey Ignatiev, who presides today over
his last policy meeting after leading the regulator for more
than a decade, has signaled that he will leave the first
reductions to Russia’s main lending rates since 2011 to his
successor,  Elvira Nabiullina , who becomes chairman June 24.  “We will likely see only medium-term rates cut, similar to
the previous two meetings, although the importance of such a
step for the money market would increase this time,” VTB
Capital analysts led by Maxim Oreshkin, said in an e-mailed
note.  The dollar-denominated RTS  index , which last week entered a
bear market, was steady at 1,314.98. On the Micex, 31 stocks
increased while ten dropped and nine were little changed.  The volume of shares traded on the gauge was 20 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings subsided to
20.584.  Inflation Quickens  Bank Rossii will hold the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent
for a ninth month, according to 22 of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Four forecast a quarter-point cut. Inflation
in  Russia  accelerated for a second month in May to the fastest
pace in 21 months, limiting the central bank’s scope to cut
interest rates, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said on
June 4.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke suggested the
central bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market
improves in a “real and sustainable way.” The Fed buys $85
billion of debt a month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on interest rates.  Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of nine
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 2.5
percent projection a month earlier. The Economy Ministry lowered
this year’s growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 3.6 percent in
April while the central bank kept its refinancing  rate  on hold
for an eighth month in May.  Cheapest Valuations  Urals crude , Russia’s major export blend, increased 1
percent to $104.13. The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of
commodities lost 0.2 percent. Brent oil was little changed at
$104.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5
times its 12-month estimated earnings, having lost 8.6 percent
this year, compared with a multiple of 10 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which is down 7.3 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index surged 7.6 percent to 27.24.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. increased 1.5 percent to 87.14 on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
