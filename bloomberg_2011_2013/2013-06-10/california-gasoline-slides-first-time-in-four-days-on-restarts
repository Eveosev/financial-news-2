Spot gasoline in  California  tumbled
against futures for the first time in four days after  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Torrance refinery restored operations following
maintenance and a  power failure .  Exxon’s 150,000-barrel-a-day plant reported planned flaring
through yesterday and was running normally today, Gesuina Paras,
a company spokeswoman in Torrance, said by e-mail. The refinery
had been restarting units after a turnaround that began May 3
and a power failure May 30.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  said June 7 that its 266,000-barrel-a-day
Carson plant, the second-largest in California, was running at
“planned rates.” The refinery reported scheduled flaring
through tomorrow and was expected to shut a coker this month for
work, two people with knowledge of the schedule said May 15.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles  slid
