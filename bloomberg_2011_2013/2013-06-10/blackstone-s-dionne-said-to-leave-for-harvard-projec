Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s John Dionne, a
partner responsible for relations with private-equity investors,
is leaving the firm to pursue a project at  Harvard Business
School , according to a person familiar with the matter.  Dionne will become a senior adviser to New York-based
Blackstone, said the person, who requested anonymity because the
move wasn’t announced publicly. Dionne was a senior managing
director and a member of the private-equity business’s
investment committee, according to a biography on Blackstone’s
website.  Christine Anderson , a spokeswoman for Blackstone, declined
to comment. Jim Aisner, a spokesman for Harvard Business School,
didn’t immediately return a request for comment.  Blackstone counts many of the biggest institutional
investors among its clients, including the California Public
Employees’ Retirement System, the California State Teachers’
Retirement System and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.
The firm finished raising its latest flagship buyout fund with
$15.2 billion in 2011, following a $21 billion pool in 2005.  Dionne joined Blackstone in 2005 from Bennett Restructuring
Funds, a $1 billion hedge fund. Blackstone, the world’s largest
private-equity firm by assets, oversees more than $218 billion
invested in buyouts, real estate, credit, hedge funds and other
strategies.  Dionne’s move was reported earlier today by Fortune
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
