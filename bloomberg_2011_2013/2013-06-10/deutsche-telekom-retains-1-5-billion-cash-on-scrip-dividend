Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany ’s
largest phone company, will be able to retain 1.13 billion euros
($1.5 billion) from this year’s dividend as some investors chose
to receive shares instead of cash.  Shareholders owning about 1.62 billion shares, equivalent
to 38 percent of the dividend-entitled equity capital, opted for
equity at a ratio of one new share for every 12.5 held, the
Bonn-based carrier said today in a statement. That means the
company will issue 130 million new shares and pay a cash
 dividend  of 1.87 billion euros.  The vote bolsters Deutsche Telekom’s cash pile as the
company seeks to catch up with network speeds offered by cable
operators  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8)  and  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) 
The carrier announced plans in December to spend almost 30
billion euros over a three-year period to upgrade its wireless
and fixed lines from Europe to the U.S.  “This is surprising and brings considerable savings,”
said Heinz Steffen, an analyst at Fairesearch GmbH in Kronberg,
Germany, who recommends investors add shares of Germany’s former
phone monopoly. “I would have expected investors to say ‘cash
is king’” particularly as an offer ratio of 10 to 1 would have
been fairer, he said.  Deutsche Telekom was among the top five gainers today in
Germany’s 30-member benchmark DAX Index,  adding  as much as 2.1
percent to 9.03 euros. The stock rose 1.8 percent as of 12:41
p.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the carrier at 38.9 billion euros.  ‘Great Trust’  Germany’s finance ministry, which holds 15 percent of the
stock, said last week it would take its dividend in cash this
year, while state-owned lender KfW, with a 17 percent stake,
said it would participate in the share dividend program.  “This shows the great trust our owners have in the
strategy of Deutsche Telekom,” Timotheus Hoettges, the
company’s chief financial officer, said in the statement.  Deutsche Telekom plans to reduce its dividend per share to
50 euro cents next year from 70 cents that it paid for the years
2010 through 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
