A tornado watch has been issued
along the U.S. East Coast from southern New Jersey to South
Carolina, including Washington, Philadelphia and Baltimore.  The watch, which means the deadly storms may form, is in
effect until 10 p.m. New York time, according to the  National
Weather Service . Flood warnings and watches have been posted
from  Maine  to South Carolina, as the storms are expected to
bring heavy rain.  “River and stream levels remain high as a result of
Friday’s heavy rainfall” caused by Tropical Storm Andrea, the
agency said in a watch issued for New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Delaware. “There is heightened potential for flooding in the
region.”  Severe thunderstorms and the tornadoes that sometimes
accompany them caused $15 billion in insured losses in 2012 and
$25 billion in 2011, according to the  Insurance Information
Institute  in New York.  From 1992 to 2011, thunderstorms and tornadoes accounted
for the second-highest amount of catastrophic loss in the U.S.,
$130.2 billion, topped only by hurricanes and tropical storms
with $161.3 billion, the institute said.  There’s a 30 percent chance high winds from severe storms
will strike from central  Virginia  to South Carolina, according
to the  U.S. Storm Prediction Center  in Norman,  Oklahoma . There’s
a 15 percent chance those storms will produce damaging gusts
from Trenton, New Jersey, to Augusta,  Georgia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
