Sweden’s krona weakened to its
lowest level against the euro in almost five months in  Stockholm 
trading after industrial production unexpectedly declined in
April, putting pressure on the Riksbank to cut rates in July.  The krona weakened as much as 0.44 percent to 8.7078 per
euro, the lowest since Jan. 24, and traded at 8.7001 as of 10:35
a.m. local time. It slid 0.6 percent against the  U.S. dollar .  The Riksbank has kept its benchmark rate unchanged at its
two latest meetings, in part because of concerns over household
debt growth. While Sweden’s gross domestic product expanded
twice as fast as economists had projected at 0.6 percent in the
first quarter, Swedish business and  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly slumped last month.  “Today’s figures suggest that the manufacturing sector is
still struggling with weak external demand,”  Andreas Jonsson ,
an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Stockholm, wore in a note today.  Industrial production fell an annual 0.8 percent after
sliding a revised 0.1 percent the previous month, Statistics
Sweden said today. Production was estimated to rise 0.7 percent,
according to the median forecast in a survey of four economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
