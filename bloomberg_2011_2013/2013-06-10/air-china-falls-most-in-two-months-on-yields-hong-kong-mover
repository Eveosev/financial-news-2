Air China Ltd. (753) , the nation’s biggest
carrier by market value, fell the most in two months in  Hong
Kong  trading after declining yields prompted UBS AG to cut its
earnings forecast for the airline.  The Beijing-based carrier  fell  6.4 percent, the biggest
drop since April 5, to close at HK$5.70 in Hong Kong trading.
 China Eastern Airlines Corp (670) , based in Shanghai, dropped 3.7
percent to HK$2.35. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose
0.2 percent.  Air China’s passenger yields, a measure of the average
price travelers pay, fell 7 percent in April even as traffic
rose 9.6 percent, UBS analysts led by Richard Wei wrote in a
note today, citing the company’s management. UBS cut its 2013
earnings estimate for the carrier by 30 percent, citing sluggish
business travel and international passenger traffic to Europe.  “This is mainly due to industry oversupply,” the analysts
said in the note. “We are concerned about the weak business
traffic, which has not shown a material pick up due to the
slower-than-expected economic recovery in China.”  Air China (601111)  and unit Shenzhen Airlines ordered 100 Airbus
A320 planes last month.  UBS lowered Air China’s  rating  to sell from buy and reduced
its share-price estimate to HK$5.37 from HK$8.10 as the analysts
estimated the carrier’s passenger yields may drop 1.4 percent
this year, compared with an earlier forecast for 1.6 percent
growth. Earnings per share may be 0.29  yuan , compared with a
previous forecast of 0.41 yuan, UBS said.  The slowdown of business traffic is likely to continue and
may affect industry growth, Citigroup Inc. analysts led by
Vivian Tao said in a  note  on June 7.  China’s industrial production rose by a less-than-forecast
9.2 percent from a year earlier in May, and factory-gate prices
fell for a 15th month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed
yesterday. Export gains were at a 10-month low, and imports
dropped after a crackdown on fake trade invoices.  Air  China  and China Eastern’s domestic shares are closed
for trading today as China’s financial markets are closed
through June 12 for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
