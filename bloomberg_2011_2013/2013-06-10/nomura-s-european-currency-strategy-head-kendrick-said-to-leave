Geoffrey Kendrick, the London-based
head of European currency strategy at Nomura International Plc,
has left the company, according to three people with knowledge
of the matter.  A London-based spokeswoman for Nomura, who asked not to be
named in line with company policy, declined to comment on
Kendrick’s position when contacted today by telephone.  The former UBS AG strategist’s mobile phone didn’t connect
and he didn’t immediately respond to a message to his  LinkedIn
Corp. (LNKD)  account.  The people asked not to be named because they’re not
authorized to speak about it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
