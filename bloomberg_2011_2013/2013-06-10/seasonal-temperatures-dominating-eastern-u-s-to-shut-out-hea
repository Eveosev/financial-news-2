Seasonal temperatures may dominate
the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, keeping an energy-boosting heat
wave at bay, until at least the last full week of June, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  From Chicago to Boston and south to Richmond, Virginia,
temperatures are expected to remain near normal until June 24,
Rogers said in a forecast from his office in Bethesda, Maryland.
Those conditions are expected to prevail across southern Ontario
and Quebec as well.  “Instead, we watch the heat ridge focus on the south-central U.S. with some reach into the Southeast and interior
West, and sometimes up into the southern or western edges of the
Midwest,” Rogers said.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
of the East and Midwest can spur natural gas demand as more
people turn to air conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will
account for 32 percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy
Information Administration data show.  Temperatures in Texas,  New Mexico , Kansas, Oklahoma and
Colorado are expected to remain about 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8
Celsius) above normal from now until June 24, Rogers said. Those
areas may also experience temperatures reaching 8 degrees above
normal at times.  The normal average temperature on June 16 in  New York  City
is about 72 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 68; in Chicago, 70; in
Houston, 83; in  St. Louis , 77; and in Burbank, California, 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
