Southwest  Georgia  Ethanol LLC plans
to restart production at its distillery in Camilla, Georgia,
this week as cheaper manufacturing costs have made the fuel more
profitable to produce.  The company will be making the biofuel by the end of this
week at the plant, which has a capacity of 100 million gallons a
year, Murray Campbell, the company’s president, said today in a
telephone interview.  Corn for July delivery fell 16.25 cents to $6.50 a bushel
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. The corn crush spread, or
the cost difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn
needed to make it, was 12 cents today, compared to minus 35
cents on Dec. 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We watch and see what the market’s telling us,” Campbell
said today.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 2.7 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.479 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
