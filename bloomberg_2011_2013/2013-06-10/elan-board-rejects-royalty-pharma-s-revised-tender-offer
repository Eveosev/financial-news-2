Elan Corp.’s board unanimously
rejected Royalty Pharma’s takeover offer days after it was
raised to $6.7 billion, the second increase in its attempt to
take over the Irish biotechnology company.  The latest offer “continues to grossly undervalue” Elan,
the Dublin-based company said in a statement today. The board
recommended that shareholders take no action on the offer and
that they vote in favor of the four transactions previously
announced by Elan when the June 17 shareholder meeting takes
place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
