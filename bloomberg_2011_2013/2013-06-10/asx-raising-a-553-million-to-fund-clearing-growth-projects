ASX Ltd. (ASX) , the operator of
 Australia ’s main stock exchange, is raising A$553 million ($523
million) to expand its clearing facility and fund future
projects.  ASX plans to sell fully underwritten new shares at A$30
each to retail and institutional investors, according to a
statement. The company will use A$200 million to contribute
additional equity to ASX Clear (Futures), the exchange’s
clearing facility and central counterparty for securities listed
on the ASX Trade platform. Unit ASX Clearing Corp.’s A$250
million of unsecured debt will be replaced with equity capital
and the remaining funds used for future projects, the statement
said.  ASX Chief Executive Officer Elmer Funke Kupper this year
successfully won a battle to keep the exchange’s monopoly in the
clearing and settlement of equity trades, is expanding its over-the-counter clearing service for  interest-rate swaps  and has cut
fees to fend off competition in  stock trading  from Chi-X
Australia Pty and dark-pool operators.  “ASX is one of the leading exchanges in the world and is
making significant investments in Australia’s financial market
infrastructure,” said Funke Kupper in the statement. “These
investments support our ambition to be globally competitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
