Gold futures rose from the lowest in
almost two weeks on bets that demand for the precious metal as a
store of value will increase in  Asia , the world’s top consumer.  China approved two domestic exchange-traded products backed
by the metal, and Deutsche Bank AG started a gold-storage
facility in  Singapore  with a capacity to hold as much as 200
metric tons, its largest vault outside  London . The dollar pared
gains of as much as 0.5 percent against a basket of major
currencies to trade little changed.  “People expect physical demand to remain strong at current
levels” for gold, Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at
R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “There is some safe-haven buying.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $1,386 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price touched $1,375.10, the lowest for a most-active contract since May 28. Trading was 43 percent below the
average in the past 100 days for this time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold has tumbled 17 percent this year as an improving U.S.
economy increased speculation the  Federal Reserve  may scale back
debt purchases. On June 7, the price dropped 2.3 percent, the
most since April 15, as U.S. payrolls in May increased more than
forecast by analysts.  Last week, Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold
producer, said it will write down the value of its assets by as
much as A$6 billion ($5.7 billion) after the price slump.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$21.925 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price touched
$21.33, the lowest since May 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,506.90 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery advanced 1.1 percent to $769.40
an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $771.60, the highest since
April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
