Brazil  economists increased their
benchmark  interest rate  forecast for this year and next and
lowered their growth estimate for both years, as the central
bank steps up efforts to control inflation.  The economists predicted that the Selic rate will be 8.75
percent at year-end 2013 and 2014, compared with the previous
week’s forecasts of 8.50 percent, according to a June 7 survey
of about 100 economists published today. Analysts also cut their
2013 economic growth forecast to 2.53 percent from 2.77 percent
and their 2014 estimate to 3.20 percent from 3.40 percent.  Brazil’s central bank accelerated last month the pace of
interest rate increases, raising the Selic by 50 basis points to
8 percent as inflation persisted near the upper limit of the its
target range. Growth in the world’s second-largest emerging
market unexpectedly slowed during the first quarter as
consumption eased. The combination of slow growth and faster
inflation is damaging President  Dilma Rousseff ’s popularity
before elections next year, according to the latest Datafohla
poll.  Swap rates on the January 2015 contract, the most traded in
Sao Paulo, rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
9.28 percent at 9:35 a.m. local time. The real fell 0.52 percent
to 2.1430 per dollar.  Consumer prices rose at a 6.5 percent annualized rate  in
May , compared to 6.49 percent in April, the national statistics
agency said last week. Brazil’s central bank targets inflation
at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Latin America ’s largest economy  expanded  0.55 percent in
the first three months of the year, lower than economists’
estimates of 0.9 percent. It was the fifth consecutive quarter
of slower-than-expected expansion. The central bank predicts
growth of 3.1 percent this year.  Rousseff’s popularity dropped this month for the first time
since she took office in January 2011, Datafolha said. The
president’s support is at 57 percent, eight percentage points
lower than in March, according to the survey published June 9 by
Folha de  Sao Paulo  newspaper. Datafolha polled 3,758 people in
180 municipalities between June 6 and June 7. The poll had a
margin of error of two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
