European coal for 2014 dropped to
record as Credit Suisse AG analysts cut their price forecasts
for the fuel and the region’s electricity costs.  European power will average 37.5 euros per megawatt-hour in
2016, down from 46.60 euros forecast in December, Zoltan Fekete
and Vincent Gilles said in a research note today. They cut their
outlook amid expectations that stagnant power demand won’t be
matched by reduced capacity, and on lowered price forecasts for
carbon emission permits and coal.  “At that anticipated level, gas plants will continue to
lose vast amounts of money while coal spreads will come down to
break-even levels by the end of the decade,” the analysts said.  The price of coal for 2014 delivery to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp declined as much as 1 percent to $88 a metric ton, the
lowest level since the contract started trading in January 2010,
broker data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  European coal will average $85 a ton this year compared
with a previous forecast of $108.20, the bank said. In 2014, the
cost will average $92 a ton from $114.10 predicted in December.  The German clean-dark spread, a measure of the profit from
burning coal to generate electricity, fell as much as 4 percent
to 7.40 euros a megawatt-hour, the biggest decline in three
weeks, broker data on Bloomberg showed.  EU carbon will average 3 euros a ton this year compared
with a previous forecast of 7.4 euros, the analysts said.
Contracts for delivery in December were trading at 4.02 euros a
ton at 3:30 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
