UEFA, European soccer’s governing
body, will open disciplinary proceedings against Turkish teams
Besiktas and Fenerbahce after allegations of match-fixing.  A case was opened against Besiktas and two club officials
“in relation to match-fixing activities alleged to have taken
place around the 2011 Turkish Cup final,” the Nyon,
Switzerland-based body said today in a statement on its website.
It didn’t identify the two officials.  The case will be heard by the Control and Disciplinary Body
on June 21, UEFA said.  The disciplinary inspector also asked for a case to be
opened against Fenerbahce and five officials, UEFA said in the
statement. A hearing will take place June 22.  Earlier today, Fenerbahce said in a filing to Borsa
Istanbul that the executives accused of offenses include
Chairman  Aziz Yildirim .  The report lacks evidence and “was based on claims from
various sources,” the club said. According to the filing, the
UEFA inspector alleged that Fenerbahce directly or indirectly
influenced match results and demands Fenerbahce be banned from
UEFA games for the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
