Nigeria ’s “good monetary policy”
has helped to stabilize the  exchange rate  and curb inflation in
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.  An increase in foreign-currency reserves is acting as a
buffer for the currency, Okonjo-Iweala said today at a
conference in Abuja, the capital.  “Reserves are what’s going to help to make the exchange
rate stable,” she said. “When your reserves are going down,
that’s when you experience instability and people can come and
attack your currency.”  The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a
record high of 12 percent since October 2011 to bolster the
naira. Reserves increased 28 percent to $48.4 billion in the
year through June 6, according to  data  from the central bank.
The  inflation  rate reached 9.1 percent in April, meeting the
central bank’s target of less than 10 percent for the fourth
consecutive month.  Nigeria needs annual economic growth of 13 percent “in
order for us to solve the unemployment and other problems that
we have” by the year 2020, Okonjo-Iweala said. The economy is
forecast by the government to expand 6.5 percent this year.  The minister had said on May 20 the nation needs lower
 interest rates  to help boost investment and economic growth.  The naira has weakened 1.8 percent against the dollar this
year to 159 as of 3:32 p.m. in the  interbank market  in Lagos,
the commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
