The  Topix index  surged by the most
in two years, after a three-week, $600 billion rout, as the yen
weakened and shares advanced across the board. Stocks also
gained after the government pension fund said it will sell bonds
to buy more equities.  All the  Topix (TPX) ’s 33 industry groups advanced, led by
carmakers, steel producers and tiremakers. Toyota Motor Corp.
jumped 8.6 percent, the most since March 2011. Sharp Corp.
surged 15 percent after Qualcomm Inc. agreed to a second share
purchase. Machinery maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., one
of only three shares on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average that fell
today, lost 5.8 percent.  The Topix increased 5.2 percent to 1,111.97 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , its biggest gain since March 16, 2011, and the
17th-biggest advance since 1950, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Just 40 shares fell on the 1,709-member gauge, the
 fewest  since October 2008. The measure plunged 6.9 percent last
week, its third weekly decline. It’s the first time since at
least 2000 the gauge has dropped more than 4 percent for three
straight weeks. The yen weakened against the dollar after
better-than-estimated U.S. jobs data last week.  “Last week’s decline was huge, so investors are going to
be buying on dips,” said  Norihiro Fujito , a senior investment
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., the
brokerage unit of  Japan ’s biggest financial group. “While the
U.S. jobs market is improving, it’s not enough to exit monetary
easing.”  Nikkei Surges  The Nikkei 225 added 4.9 percent to 13,514.20, with volume
27 percent below the 30-day average at the close. The equity
gauge lost about 18 percent from a May 22 high through June 7
amid concern the biggest Japanese share rally in a quarter
century had advanced too far, too fast.  The Topix has swung an average of 3.8 percent daily since
May 22.  Historic volatility  is at levels not seen since the 2011
earthquake and nuclear disaster.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge climbed 1.3 percent on June 7 after a U.S.
Labor Department report showed payrolls rose 175,000 last month
from a revised 149,000 increase in April, topping the 163,000
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  suggested the central bank could curtail its $85
billion monthly bond purchases if the job market improved in a
“real and sustainable way.”  Car and electronics makers provided the biggest boost to
the Topix, after the yen weakened to 98.38 per dollar, compared
with 96.79 at the close of Tokyo stock trading on June 7.  Currency Watching  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, advanced 8.6 percent
to 5,950 yen. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which gets 47 percent
of its revenue from  North America , soared 13 percent to 2,291
yen. Bridgestone Corp.,  Asia ’s No. 1 tiremaker, jumped 7.5
percent to 3,285 yen.  “The stock market is carefully watching the  currency
market ,” said  Masayuki Kubota , who oversees the equivalent of
$1.7 billion at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “But both
the markets have been so volatile recently it’s hard to know
what the appropriate levels are.”  Shares also rose today after the government said the
Japanese economy grew more in the first quarter than the
government initially forecast. Gross domestic product expanded
an annualized 4.1 percent, compared with a preliminary
calculation of 3.5 percent, the Cabinet Office said.  More Shares  In another boost to the market, the Government Pension
Investment Fund, the world’s biggest manager of retirement
savings with about 112 trillion yen ($1.15 trillion) in assets,
said on June 7 it will cut local bond holdings to 60 percent
from 67 percent. The fund will boost its allocation to domestic
shares and overseas shares to 12 percent each from 11 percent
and 9 percent, respectively. Holdings of foreign bonds will be
raised to 11 percent from 8 percent.  “The announcement that the GPIF has reviewed its
investment policy is going to give the market a sense of
security,” wrote Kenji Abe, an equity strategist at Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc., in a report.“Only increasing
domestic stocks by 1 percent may be less than the market
expected. Increasing overseas stocks and bonds is going to be a
reason for a weaker yen, and that’s positive for Japanese
shares.”  Among other shares that rose, Sharp surged 15 percent to
462 yen, the  biggest gain  on the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Qualcomm will buy 6
billion yen of Sharp shares to complete the second part of a
capital alliance to develop displays, the unprofitable Osaka-based TV maker said in a statement.  Mitsubishi Heavy  Among stocks that fell, Mitsubishi Heavy dropped 5.8
percent to 549 yen. Edison International, a Californian utility,
may recover some costs related to the shutdown of the San Onofre
nuclear plant made by Mitsubishi Heavy, its chief executive
officer said on June 7.  After rallying about 50 percent this year through their
highs on May 22, Japan’s main equity gauges plunged and entered
corrections on May 30. Almost $600 billion has been  wiped  from
the value of Japanese equities in the last three weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index of smaller companies
jumped 12 percent today after plunging 24 percent last week, its
biggest weekly drop since May 2000. The Jasdaq Index of start-up
companies rose 5.5 percent after its 10 percent decline last
week, while the TSE Second Section Price Index climbed 4.2
percent.  Best Performers  Even after the correction the Topix and Nikkei 225 have
climbed nearly 30 percent this year, making the country the
world’s best-performing major market, on optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  can lift the country out of 15
years of deflation.  Among measures to boost the economy, Abe intends to
implement tax breaks to urge corporate investment in facilities
and business reorganization, the Nikkei newspaper reported on
June 8, citing an interview with the prime minister.  The BOJ started a two-day policy meeting today. At issue is
whether to double the maturity of loans extended to banks to two
years to quell bond-market volatility. The board is divided over
authorizing the measure, according to people familiar with the
discussions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
