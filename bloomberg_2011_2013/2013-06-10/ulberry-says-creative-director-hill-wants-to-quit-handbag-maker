Mulberry Group Plc (MUL)  said creative
director Emma Hill wants to leave the British luxury-goods maker
after six years, sending the shares down the most in more than
two months.  The timing of Hill’s departure is under discussion and has
yet to be finalized, Somerset, England-based Mulberry said today
in a statement. No reason was given for why the designer wishes
to quit the maker of 2,500-pound ($3,880) ostrich leather bags.  Mulberry fell 8.2 percent to 980 pence today in London
trading,  the steepest intraday drop  since March 22.  Hill’s departure “will hang over the shares because of
what she had done in terms of designs,” said John Cummins, an
analyst at W.H. Ireland in  London , citing the popularity of the
Alexa and Del Rey handbags. “The importance of getting must-have bags out there is clearly key to the story.”  The announcement is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Mulberry, which said in March that reduced tourist spending in
London would cause full-year sales and profit to miss estimates.
The luxury-goods maker is experiencing a period of consolidation
while it lays the foundations for future growth, Chief Executive
Officer Bruno Guillon said at the time.  Hill, 42, joined Mulberry in 2007. Her spring-summer 2014
collection has been completed and she continues to work in the
business finalizing the London Fashion Week collection which
will be unveiled on Sept. 15, Mulberry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
