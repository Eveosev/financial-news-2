Exuberant drag queens and Cyndi
Lauper pop tunes prevailed at the Tony Awards, as “Kinky
Boots” was named the best new Broadway musical.  Christopher Durang’s bittersweet Chekhov-inspired comedy
“Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” won for best play.
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” was named best revival of a
play and the circus-themed “Pippin” was best revival of a
musical.  To contact the reporter on this story:
