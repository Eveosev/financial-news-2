Palm oil  stockpiles in  Malaysia , the
world’s second-largest producer, fell for a fifth straight month
in May to the lowest level in 11 months as production growth
slowed, according to official data.  Inventories dropped 5.1 percent to 1.82 million metric tons
from a revised 1.91 million tons in April, the lowest level
since June 2012, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today. That
was less than the median estimate of 1.86 million tons in a
Bloomberg survey. Output climbed 1.3 percent to 1.38 million
tons, while  exports  fell 3 percent to 1.41 million tons, the
board said.  Futures have climbed for five straight weeks on speculation
that a pick up in demand for the commodity used in everything
from biofuels to noodles ahead of the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan in July may trim stockpiles. Prices will resume a
decline as output climbs and reserves rebound, according to
Dorab Mistry, a director at Godrej International Ltd., who’s
traded the commodity for more than 30 years.  “Prices will trade higher because of the strong export
numbers for the first 10 days of this month,” said Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “That
should keep the positive sentiment going with more conviction
that perhaps we could see another month of flat-to-lower
stocks.”  Shipments from Malaysia gained 10 percent to 419,035 tons
in the first 10 days of June from 380,047 tons in the same
period last month, Intertek said today.  Palm oil for August delivery climbed as much as 0.5 percent
to 2,470 ringgit ($790) ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives,
and ended the morning session little changed at 2,458 ringgit
before the release of the data. Prices closed at 2,457 ringgit
on June 7, the highest settlement level for the most-active
futures since March 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
