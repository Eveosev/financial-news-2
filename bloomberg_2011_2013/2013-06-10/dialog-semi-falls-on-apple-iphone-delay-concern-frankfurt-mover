Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , whose
biggest client is  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , fell the most since April as peer
 AMS AG (AMS)  forecast a profit drop for the year, fueling speculation
that Apple’s new iPhone may be released later than expected.  The shares fell as much as 7.6 percent to 10.77 euros, the
biggest intraday decline since April 25. AMS dropped as much as
23 percent after the Austrian company said second-half sales
will be weaker than expected because production for some devices
using its chips will ramp up late this year or early next year.  “AMS’s warning could be the first hint that the launch of
Apple’s new iPhones will be postponed further into late third-quarter or even fourth-quarter 2013, which would have a severe
adverse impact on the entire supply chain,” Bernd Laux, an
analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, wrote in a note today.  Dialog Semiconductor shares traded 2.9 percent lower as of
12:08 a.m. in  Frankfurt , bringing the decline this year to 15
percent. The Kirchheim, German-based company  relies on Apple  for
33 percent of its revenue, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Laux said he’s keeping his buy recommendation on Dialog as
some issues specific to its Austrian competitor, such as a
change in management, don’t apply to the market in general.  To contact the reporter on this story:
