Just  9.8%  of chief executives can be categorized as highly risk-averse, compared with  64%  of the (similarly aged) general population, according to a survey of about 1,000 top leaders in the U.S. by John R. Graham, Campbell R. Harvey, and Manju Puri of Duke University. Moreover,  80%  of CEOs are very optimistic, well above the mean. CEOs are also much more optimistic than CFOs; only  65%  of CFOs can be classified as very optimistic.
