Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, plans to have found a replacement for
Finance Director Chris Lucas by the end of the year, Chairman
David Walker said.  “We are working now on our shortlist,” Walker said in an
interview on the sidelines of the Conference of Montreal today.
“I’d be very disappointed if the new person isn’t in place by
the end of the year.”  Barclays began a search to replace Lucas, 52, in February
when it announced his retirement plans and those of General
Counsel Mark Harding. Lucas was one of four past and present
employees investigated by the Financial Services Authority about
whether the bank adequately disclosed fees paid to the Qatar
Investment Authority when it raised money from the sovereign-wealth fund during the banking crisis.  Separately, Walker also said he didn’t foresee that
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ’s decision to cut its stake
in Barclays would trigger sales by other shareholders. The
banking unit of  Japan ’s second-largest financial group by market
value last week sold 84.5 million shares in Barclays at 308.5
pence apiece.  “For a long time Sumitomo had indicated that it was their
intention at the right time to reduce their stake,” said
Walker. “I don’t think it has any implications for anyone
else.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
