Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil ’s biggest water provider, has won a one-year extension to propose a new fee structure for consumers.  Agencia Reguladora de Saneamento e Energia do Estado de  Sao
Paulo , Sao Paulo state’s water and energy regulator, granted the
utility’s request to push back the date on tariffs for
municipal, industrial and household clients to April 30, the Sao
Paulo-based company said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the
water regulator didn’t respond to calls seeking details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
