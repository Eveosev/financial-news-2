Hong Kong police investigating the
failure of the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange charged a Malaysian
man with possessing a fake statement of funds for $516 million.  Ong Shen Kuo, 59, was remanded to police custody after a
hearing in Eastern Magistrates’ Court this morning, according to
a court document. Ong is the seventh person arrested in the
case, according to the police public relations branch.  HKMEx, as the exchange is known, surrendered its trading
license last month after failing to attract sufficient revenue
to support its operations. The Securities and Futures Commission
said on May 21 it found “serious” suspected irregularities in
the exchange’s financial affairs and referred the case to the
police.  Barry Cheung , chairman and largest shareholder of the
bourse operator, resigned from all public service positions,
including the city’s executive council, because he’s under
police investigation, the government said in a statement May 24.  Three men arrested as part of a probe into the failed Hong
Kong Mercantile Exchange were charged May 24 in Kowloon City
Magistrates’ Court with having false documents including letters
related to a $460 million check and $11 million of funds. Cheung
said the three aren’t current or former employees of HKMEx.  To contact the reporters on this story:
