Gemfields Plc (GEM) , the biggest emerald
producer, postponed an auction of Zambian stones in Singapore
after the southern African nation barred exports of the gems.  The company is seeking clarification from Zambia’s Ministry
of Mines, Energy and Water Development on the restrictions,
Gemfields said today in a statement. The London-based producer
had intended to hold the auction from today to June 14.  Zambia said in April it wanted all its gemstones to be
auctioned in the country and any exports should first be sold
within its borders. That may curb revenue from Gemfields’ Kagem
emerald mine, the world’s largest, as the company has previously
been able to sell the stones in India and  Singapore .  Gemfields fell 3.6 percent to 23.25 pence by the close in
London trading, the biggest one-day decline since May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
