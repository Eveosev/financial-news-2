ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , which owns a
majority stake in a Japanese discount carrier set up in
partnership with  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , said it is considering dissolving
the tie-up as it aims to improve sales at the unit.  Ending the partnership in the venture,  AirAsia Japan Co. ,
is one option and no final decision has been made, Megumi Tezuka, a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based ANA, said by phone today.
AirAsia Group chief Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  said by e-mail that he would comment “in due course.”  ANA would continue operating the business as a low-cost
carrier from Narita airport even if the partnership with AirAsia
is dissolved, Tezuka said. AirAsia Japan has struggled to fill
as many seats as low-cost carriers Peach Aviation Ltd., partly
owned by ANA, and  Jetstar Japan Co. , which also began flights in
Japan last year.  “ANA should be able to turn around the carrier,” said
 Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Barclays Securities Japan Ltd.
“They’ve already shown they can be successful with Peach.
AirAsia may have discovered the difficulties of flying from
Narita,” rather than Japan’s downtown Haneda airport, he said.  The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today that ANA will
acquire AirAsia’s stake in AirAsia Japan, without saying where
it got the information.  33 Percent Stake  ANA, which owns 67 percent of AirAsia Japan, may buy out
AirAsia’s stake in the venture, Tezuka said.  Narita, Japan-based AirAsia Japan filled  67.6 percent  of
seats on its domestic flights during Japan’s Golden Week holiday
period from April 26 to May 6, the company said in a statement
last month. In comparison Peach, which flies from Kansai airport
in  Osaka , Japan, filled 91.3 percent of its domestic seats,
according to the company.  Jetstar Japan, which only flies within the country and is
also based in Narita, filled 78.8 percent of seats, according to
the company.  ANA has said that it aims to fill 80 percent or more of its
seats on low-cost carrier operations.  AirAsia Japan, which began operations in August, has five
domestic services and also flies to Seoul and Busan in  South
Korea . The carrier will add flights to Taiwan next month and is
considering another overseas flight before the end of March as
it more than doubles its fleet to nine planes from four,
Yoshinori Odagiri, chief executive officer of the carrier, said
last week.  ANA rose 3.6 percent to 204 yen at the close of trading in
 Tokyo  and is up 13 percent this year. AirAsia, based in Sepang
Selangor, Malaysia, rose 0.6 percent to close at 3.35 ringgit in
 Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporters on this story:
