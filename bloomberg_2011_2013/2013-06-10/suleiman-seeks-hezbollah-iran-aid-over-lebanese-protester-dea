Lebanon’s President Michel Suleiman
appealed to the militant Hezbollah group and its patron,  Iran ,
to help his government investigate the death of an anti-Hezbollah demonstrator in  Beirut .  Suleiman discussed the death of Hashem Salman in a meeting
today with Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Ghazanfar Roknabadi,
the official National News Agency said. Salman was shot to death
outside the Iranian embassy yesterday while protesting the
Lebanese Hezbollah’s involvement in Syria’s civil war.  Suleiman “stressed the need for citizens and parties in
the area, especially Hezbollah and the Iranian Embassy, to
facilitate the mission of the relevant agencies in uncovering
the details and circumstances” surrounding Salman’s death, NNA
said.  Salman was among a group of protesters from the  Lebanese
Option Party  attacked with sticks and guns when they arrived in
the vicinity of the embassy. Party leader Ahmed al-Asaad told
Lebanon’s An-Nahar newspaper that the attackers, who wore black
shirts with yellow armbands, were from Hezbollah.  Tensions have soared in Lebanon this year after Hezbollah
openly joined forces with  Syria ’s President Bashar al-Assad,
raising concern the country would be dragged deeper into its
neighbor’s war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
