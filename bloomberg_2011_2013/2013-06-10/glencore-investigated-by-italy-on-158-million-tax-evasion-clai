Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the world’s
largest exporter of power station coal, is being investigated by
Italian tax police, which accused the group of evading more than
120 million euros ($158 million) in taxes.  The authorities are reviewing some transactions between its
Portovesme unit, a zinc and lead smelter on the island of
Sardinia, and the larger group, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “All transactions were conducted in accordance with
applicable Italian tax laws and on an arm’s length basis between
Portovesme and the Glencore group,” it said. “Portovesme
continues to engage with the tax authorities to ensure a swift
conclusion to the review.”  The company allegedly hid profits by paying other units of
the Swiss company above-market prices for raw materials, the
Rome financial police said in a separate e-mailed statement that
gave the amount under investigation, without naming the company.  “The attention of the financial police was aroused because
the company was created through an extraordinary operation and
since its creation has never declared profit, only fiscal
losses, a situation that seemed strange given the important
international role it had taken on and given the profits
registered by the Swiss company that it belonged to,” the
police said in the statement.  Glencore Xstrata is the world’s fourth-biggest mining
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
