Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold $85
million of notes tied to the  Topix index  of Japanese stocks, the
largest such offering since December 2010, after increasing the
size twice.  The six-month securities, $15 million of which were most
recently issued on June 4, yield the gains and losses of the
benchmark with all capital at risk, according to a  prospectus 
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New
York-based bank sold the first $50 million offering on March 21
and $20 million more on May 31.  Japan’s stocks have gained the most among developed markets
this year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat
deflation and the Bank of Japan embarked on unprecedented
stimulus measures. The central bank plans to buy more than 7
trillion yen ($71 billion) of bonds a month to increase
inflation to 2 percent within two years.  “As  Japan  continues to pursue these policies, it is
helping to bolster domestic and foreign interest in their stock
market,” said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist in
New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  The Topix, as the Tokyo Price Index is known, climbed 29
percent to 1,111.97 this year as of the close of trading on June
10. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the most common equity
benchmark tied to U.S. structured notes, rose 15 percent to
1,642.81 during the same period.  The bank estimated the value of the original offering as
98.9 cents on the dollar, a  prospectus  filed with the SEC shows.  Bigger Offerings  There have been two larger offerings tied to the Topix
index since 2010, when Bloomberg started collecting
comprehensive data on structured notes. The biggest, $174.2
million of 16-month notes, was issued by the Scandinavian lender
Eksportfinans ASA on Dec. 8, 2010.  Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
