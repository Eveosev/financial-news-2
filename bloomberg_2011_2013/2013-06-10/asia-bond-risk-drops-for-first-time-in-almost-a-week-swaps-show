The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against non-payment in  Asia  declined for the first time in
almost a week, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 5.5 basis points to 94.5
basis points as of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge is poised to fall for the first time since June
4, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 5 basis points to 126 as of
8:39 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The measure, which last declined on June 4, is set for its
biggest one-day drop since May 6, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  Markets in  Australia  are closed for a public holiday today.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
