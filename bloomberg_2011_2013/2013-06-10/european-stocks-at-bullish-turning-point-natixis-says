European stocks may advance about 5
percent by the end of June, after the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index rebounded to a key support level on June 7, according to a
technical analyst at Natixis SA.  The equity gauge may reach an inflection point in the next
two to three weeks, after holding above the support of 290 last
week, signaling a medium-term bullish channel, Ouri Mimran said
by telephone from Paris today. If the index breaches the next
short-term resistance levels of 299, then 303.24, it could climb
to 311.07, implying a 5.3 percent rise from the close on June 7.  The Stoxx 600 posted its  third weekly drop  last week amid
concern that the  Federal Reserve  may reduce bond buying as soon
as September and as the  European Central Bank  refrained from
announcing new stimulus measures. The index fell to 291.69 on
June 6. Still, it climbed 1.3 percent to 295.4 on June 7 as a
U.S. report showed employers in the world’s largest economy
added more workers last month than forecast.  “Against this backdrop, a resumption of the bullish trend
is possible, but the scenario of a continuing uptrend would only
be confirmed in the event that the index breaks through the
short-term resistance level of 299 points,” Mimran said.
“Momentums are still bearish at this level because we’ve only
seen one session of rebound, but we’re seeing good potential
turning points, even if the momentum is still negative.”  A fall below 290 points would invalidate this scenario and
extend the correction towards the next medium-term support at
281.43, representing a drop of about 4.7 percent. The Stoxx 600
lost 0.2 percent to 294.85 at 3:19 p.m. in  London  today.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index. Analysts identify resistance levels, or
ceilings limiting further gains, and supports, which act as
floors in a declining market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
