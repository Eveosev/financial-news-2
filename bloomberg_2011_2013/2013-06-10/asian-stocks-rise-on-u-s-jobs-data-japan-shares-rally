Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index heading for the biggest rally in more than a
week, after a report showed the U.S. added more workers than
expected. Japanese shares surged after a three-week, $600
billion rout.  Japan’s  Topix index  jumped 5.2 percent, the most since
March 2011, after the Government Pension Investment Fund, the
world’s biggest manager of retirement savings, said on June 7 it
will sell bonds to buy more equities. Toyota Motor Corp., the
No. 1 global carmaker, gained 8.6 percent.  Yue Yuen Industrial

the unprofitable Japanese TV maker’s shares.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 1.2 percent to 131.97 as
of 7:54 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest gain since May 30. About
three stocks gained for each that fell. Stocks also rose after
Japan revised up its first-quarter growth and Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe yesterday said the government will unveil its second
growth strategy after the upper house election next month.  “The U.S. jobs data is giving the biggest boost to the
market as it was strong, but not too good to stoke concern about
scaling back stimulus,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.,  Japan ’s
second-largest brokerage. “Abe is reviving market optimism that
we will have another big rally after the election.”  Fed Expectations  Asia’s equity benchmark fell to 129.87 earlier, extending
its drop from this year’s high on May 20 to 10 percent. Shares
have fallen on speculation that improvement in the U.S. economy
will lead the Federal Reserve to scale back record stimulus.  The measure on June 7  traded  at 12.7 times average
estimated earnings, compared with 14.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of consumer discretionary companies in the Asia-Pacific index led gains this year as Japanese shares rallied on
a weaker yen and the promise of policies to end deflation.
Energy companies had the biggest declines amid concern that
 China ’s fuel demand will drop as growth slows.  The Topix is down 13 percent from a near five-year high on
May 22. It’s still up 29 percent this year. The Bank of Japan,
which announced unprecedented monetary easing in April, is to
end a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.  Pension Fund  Japan’s GPIF, which had 112 trillion yen ($1.14 trillion)
under management as of Dec. 31, said it will cut its holdings of
local bonds and buy more equities. The proportion of Japanese
shares will increase to 12 percent from 11 percent, the Health,
Labour & Welfare Ministry said.  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.8 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.5 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose
0.8 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index added 0.6 percent.
Markets in Australia and China are shut for holidays.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent. A gauge of
 mainland Chinese  companies capped its longest losing streak
since March last year after data over the weekend underscored
concern about the pace of growth in the world’s No. 2 economy.  Industrial production rose a less-than-forecast 9.2 percent
from a year earlier and factory-gate prices fell. Export gains
were at a 10-month low and imports dropped after a crackdown on
fake trade invoices, while fixed-asset investment growth slowed
and new  yuan  loans declined.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the S&P 500 Index added 0.4 percent today after
the benchmark gained 1.3 percent on June 7, the biggest daily
advance since April. U.S. employers took on 175,000 workers in
May, the Labor Department reported on June 7. That was more than
the 163,000 estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has suggested the
central bank could curtail its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases if the job market improved in a “real and sustainable
way.”  Companies that do business in the U.S. rallied. Yue Yuen
rose 2.7 percent to HK$20.65.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys
and clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., added
1.3 percent to HK$11.24.  Japanese exporters to America also advanced as the yen’s
drop boosted their earnings prospects. Toyota climbed 8.6
percent to 5,950 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a carmaker that gets
about 29 percent of its revenue in North America, soared 11
percent to 379 yen.  Sharp jumped 15 percent to 462 yen. The TV maker will sell
