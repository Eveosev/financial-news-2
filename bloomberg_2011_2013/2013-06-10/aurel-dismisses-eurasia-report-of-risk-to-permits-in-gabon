Etablissements Maurel & Prom (MAU) , a
French oil and gas explorer, denied speculation by consulting
firm Eurasia Group that it may be the next target of a
government crackdown in  Gabon  over production contracts.  Maurel “is not the subject of any tax litigation in
Gabon,” the Paris-based company said today in a statement,
adding that it “largely exceeds” contractual commitments in
terms of exploration spending, production investment, use of
local labor and support to regional development.  Gabon’s oil ministry plans to seize an oil field from China
Petrochemical Corp.’s Addax Petroleum as a dispute over
production contracts worsens. Gabonese Oil Minister Etienne Ngoubou will not renew Addax’s license at the Tsiengui field
because it had breached the law, a ministry official said June
6. Two other companies face similar actions, the official said,
declining to name them.  Maurel is one of two companies that “may also be in the
crosshairs of a selective crackdown on what the government sees
as the starkest cases of  tax avoidance  and breach of contract,”
Philippe de Pontet, Africa director at Eurasia, wrote in an
emailed report on June 6.  Founded in 1998, New York-based Eurasia offers worldwide
research on political risk, according to its website.  Maurel “categorically denies the remarks” made by de
Pontet, the French explorer said.  De Pontet couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
