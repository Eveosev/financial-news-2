Dong Energy  A/S’s 3010 hybrid bond
sank to its lowest price on record in Copenhagen trading after
the Danish utility said it will ask holders to swap into a new
security at less than last week’s closing price.  The yield on the 7.75 percent junior subordinated 700
million euro ($924 million) note jumped to 7.45 percent as of
11:17 a.m. in Copenhagen, compared with 7.06 percent on June 7,
according to composite Bloomberg bond-trader prices. The price
fell to 103.97, its lowest on record, based on closing prices.
The bond traded at 109.84 at the end of last week.  Dong Energy’s move follows an April decision by  Standard &
Poor’s  to categorize the 3010 bond’s equity content as zero
compared with 100 percent before the rating company revised its
criteria. The Skaerbaek, Denmark-based company, which is calling
the bond at 104 percent, had the option of early redemption at
101 percent in case of a “ratings event,” according to the
note’s prospectus.  “There’s still some uncertainty as to what the final call
will be, but it makes sense that the price on the bond is now
moving down to 104,” Jens H. Thomsen, a credit analyst at Jyske
Bank A/S in Silkeborg,  Denmark , said by phone.  Investors have the option of exchanging the note into a new
500 million euro note at 104 percent of par, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. The first call date is set for June
2023, it said.  Market Standard  Terms of the new bond will be “in line with the prevailing
market standard,” Dong said.  The new note will have 50 percent equity content at  Fitch
Ratings , Moody’s Investors Service and S&P, Dong said.  S&P said today it was affirming Dong Energy at BBB+, with a
negative outlook, after the company announced its planned bond
exchange.  “We believe that the proposed hybrid capital would largely
mitigate the negative impact on Dong Energy’s credit measures
following our re-evaluation of the equity content in the
existing hybrid instrument,” S&P said. “The negative outlook
reflects our view that Dong Energy could find it difficult to
improve its financial risk profile to a level commensurate with
the current rating over the next 12-18 months.”  Dong plans to announce the minimum size of the new issue’s
spread on June 13, it said. The exchange offer opens today and
closes on June 18, Dong said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
