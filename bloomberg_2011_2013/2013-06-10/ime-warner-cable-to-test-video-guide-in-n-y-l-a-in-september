Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  the second-largest U.S. cable provider, will test its cloud-based video
guide in New York City, Los Angeles and Syracuse, New York,
starting in September, Chief Operating Officer Rob Marcus said.  The Internet-connected video guide, which will give
customers a faster and easier way to search for programming,
will be rolled out officially to many of Time Warner Cable’s
markets by the end of the year, Marcus said in an interview
yesterday. A new set-top box will first be offered to Signature
Home customers and new customers, he said.  Time Warner Cable is following  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest
cable operator, in releasing an Internet-connected set-top box.
Comcast began installing its X1 guide last year to mimic the
search functionality and personalization of online video
platforms such as  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and mobile applications such as
HBO Go.  Time Warner Cable’s Signature Home  subscribers  pay about
$200 a month for premium  customer service  along with high-speed
Internet, multiroom digital video recorder and unlimited
landline telephone service. Time Warner Cable has about 12
million video subscribers, trailing Comcast’s 22 million.  The company’s shares rose 0.9 percent to $95.74 yesterday
at the New York close. They have fallen 1.5 percent this year,
compared with a 15 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
