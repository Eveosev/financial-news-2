Mexico ’s IPC stock index rose the
most among major equity benchmarks in the Americas and  Europe 
amid speculation that improving economic data will fuel a
rebound from the lowest valuations in 11 months.  The IPC  rose  1.2 percent to 40,721.35 at the close in
Mexico City trading, after prices fell to 17.4 times trailing
earnings last week, the  lowest ratio  since June 28, 2012. Lender
 Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO)  advanced 3.1 percent, while
steelmaker  Industrias CH SAB (ICHB)  climbed 3.3 percent and miner
Industrias Penoles SAB added 5.4 percent.  A report tomorrow is projected to show Mexico’s industrial
production climbed 5.3 percent in April, according to the median
estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The 4.9 percent
industrial output contraction in March was the steepest decline
since October 2009. The IPC had  retreated  8 percent this year
through last week.  “Mexico has gotten very inexpensive,” Arturo Espinosa, a
strategist with Santander Mexico, said in a telephone interview
from Mexico City. “The market today could be anticipating a
good report” on industrial production tomorrow.  The  iShares MSCI Mexico Capped Investable Market Index
Fund (EWW) , a dollar-denominated proxy for the country’s stock market,
rebounded after entering an oversold condition last week, based
on a technical indicator called the relative strength index, or
RSI.  The fund’s  RSI fell  to 27.3 on June 5, the lowest level
since May 2012. An RSI reading below 30 on a range from zero to
100 signals to some technical analysts that a stock has fallen
too quickly and is likely to recover. Late last week, the fund’s
RSI jumped back above 30 and stood at 34.7 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
