Maurice Cheeks was hired as coach of
the  Detroit Pistons  after spending the past four seasons as an
assistant with the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Cheeks, 56, was previously the coach of the Philadelphia
76ers and Portland Trail Blazers from 2001-08, compiling a
284-286 record with three playoff appearances. Cheeks played 15
seasons in the  National Basketball Association , making four All-Star appearances, and was a member of the 76ers’ 1983
championship team.  “The leadership and player development qualities he brings
as a former player and coach blends nicely with the roster we
are building,” Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars said. “He’s won an NBA championship, coached in two NBA
Finals as an assistant coach and mentored some of the top young
players in the NBA.”  Cheeks succeeds Lawrence Frank, who was fired in April
after the team finished 29-53, nine games outside a playoff spot
in the Eastern Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
