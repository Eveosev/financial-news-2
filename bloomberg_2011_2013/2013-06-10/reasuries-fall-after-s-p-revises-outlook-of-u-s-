Treasuries fell, pushing  30-year (USGG30YR) 
bond yields to the highest in more than a year, after  Standard &
Poor’s  boosted its outlook for the U.S. to stable from negative,
adding to bets the  Federal Reserve  may slow monetary stimulus.  Central-bank policy makers meet next week. Treasuries slid
last week as data showed U.S. payrolls rose while the jobless
rate increased. Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
said inflation below the central bank’s target warrants keeping
up $85 billion in monthly bond buying even as the labor market
improves. The government will sell $66 billion in notes and
bonds this week.  S&P’s statement “is a positive outlook on the economy, and
it helps stocks and hurts bonds a little,” said  Thomas Roth ,
senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc. “The risk for the market is there’s tons of structural
longs that have been riding the Fed coattails. That’s been a
good trade, and I think it’s coming to an end.” A long position
is a bet an asset will increase in value.  The 30-year yield increased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.37 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 3.38
percent, the highest since April 4, 2012. The price of the 2.875
percent security due in May 2043 dropped 5/8, or $6.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 90 23/32.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes added four basis points
to 2.21 percent. They touched 2.23 percent, almost the highest
since April 2012.  Volatility, Volume  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index increased to 84.75 today, matching June
6’s level, the highest in almost a year. It has averaged 62.4
over the past 12 months.  Trading  volume  handled by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell 23 percent to $358
billion, from $464 billion on June 7. Volume surged to $662
billion on May 22, the highest level in data going back to 2004,
according to ICAP. The average daily volume over the past year
is $265 billion.  Treasuries declined after S&P said in a statement the U.S.
has a less than one-in-three likelihood of a downgrade of its
AA+ credit rating in the “near term” with the revision. The
New York-based company said it sees “tentative improvements,”
such as the deal U.S. lawmakers reached to resolve what became
known as the fiscal cliff.  Weakening Effectiveness  S&P cut the U.S. ranking from AAA in August 2011, citing
the government’s lack of a plan to rein in its debt load and
weakening “effectiveness, stability, and predictability of
American policy making and political institutions.” Treasuries
rallied as investors sought the safest and most liquid
securities. The  10-year (USGG10YR)  yield plunged to 2.06 percent from 2.56
percent in the two weeks after the move.  Treasuries  fell  for the past six weeks, their longest run
of weekly losses since May 2009, amid speculation the central
bank will taper its bond buying. Yields have risen from 1.61
percent on May 1, the lowest this year.  The Fed is purchasing $45 billion of Treasuries and $40
billion of mortgage securities each month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of quantitative-easing stimulus since 2008. It bought $1.38 billion of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities today maturing from February 2041
to February 2043.  The central bank will reduce its purchases to $65 billion a
month at its October meeting, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of economists last week.  Debt Supply  The U.S. is scheduled to auction $32 billion in three-year
debt tomorrow, $21 billion in 10-year notes the next day and $13
billion in 30-year bonds on June 13.  Demand for Treasuries at auction has slackened amid signs
of improvement with the  U.S. economy . Investors have bid $2.98
for each dollar of debt sold at the U.S. government’s $905
billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction this year
compared with of $3.15 set in 2012, according to Treasury data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The measure of demand, known as the bid-to-cover ratio, is
still the fourth-highest since at least 1994, following a 3.04
ratio in 2011 and a 2.99 ratio in 2010. It was 2.50 in 2009.  The Fed’s Bullard said U.S. inflation “has surprised to
the downside.” Price gains as measured by the personal
consumption expenditures price index rose 0.7 percent in April
from a year earlier, below the central bank’s 2 percent goal.  ‘Surprisingly Low’  While “labor market conditions have improved since last
summer,” Bullard said in remarks prepared for a panel
discussion in  Montreal , “surprisingly low inflation readings
may mean the committee can maintain its aggressive program over
a longer time frame.”  The yield difference between 10-year inflation-linked
Treasuries and comparable non-indexed notes showed investors
have cut their expectations for consumer price increases to the
lowest level since July. The gap, known as the 10-year  break-even  rate, touched 2.1 percentage points. It reached 2.08
percentage points on June 6.  San Francisco Fed President  John Williams  said last week a
“modest adjustment downward” in the buying is possible as
“early as this summer.” Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart 
said “very mixed” economic data makes him “more cautious”
about a near-term reduction in purchases.  The FOMC said May 1 it will continue buying bonds “until
the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially.”  U.S. employers boosted payrolls by 175,000 jobs in May
after a revised 149,000 gain in April, the Labor Department said
June 7. A Bloomberg survey forecast an increase of 163,000. The
jobless rate rose to 7.6 percent, from a four-year low of 7.5
percent.  “It’s not about whether the Fed will taper; it is about
when and how much, and that’s what the market will be
analyzing,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of
Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “We’ll
have a bit of a price discovery as we go into supply.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
