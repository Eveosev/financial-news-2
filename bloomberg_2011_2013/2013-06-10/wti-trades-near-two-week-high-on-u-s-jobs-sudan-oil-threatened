West Texas Intermediate declined
from the highest closing price in more than two weeks as Chinese
economic data trailed estimates and the North Sea Buzzard oil
field resumed.  WTI dropped as much as 0.7 percent, halting a three-day
advance. China’s industrial output rose a less-than-forecast 9.2
percent last month, while export gains were at a 10-month low
and imports dropped, weekend data show. Production at the
Buzzard field, the largest contributor to the benchmark Forties
crude grade, returned to approximately full pumping rates over
the past two days, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be identified.  “Weakness across commodity markets is taking oil prices
lower after China report weaker-than-expected growth in trade
and industrial output,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior
broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London.  WTI for July delivery was at $95.39 a barrel, down 64
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
at 12:41 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded was
16 percent below the 100-day average. Prices advanced $1.27, or
1.3 percent, to $96.03 a barrel on June 7, the highest close
since May 21.  Brent for July settlement dropped 71 cents to $103.85 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade’s  premium to WTI  was at $8.47 a barrel,
compared with $8.53 on June 7.  Disappointing Demand  The Buzzard field is back to pumping 208,000 barrels a day
following a halt on June 6 because of an equipment failure, the
people said. Forties blend sets the value of Dated Brent, the
benchmark used to price more than half of the world’s crude.  Nordea Bank AG trimmed estimates for Brent crude in 2013 to
$109 a barrel from $111, and in 2014 to $111 from $115, because
of disappointing demand and expanding supplies outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to an
e-mailed report from the Oslo-based company.  Sudan  said it will stop South Sudanese exports within 60
days unless the neighboring state ends support for rebel groups.
Sudan has evidence that South Sudan is backing renegade fighters
opposed to the rule of Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir,
Information Minister Ahmed Bilal Osman told reporters yesterday
in Khartoum.  Landlocked South Sudan exports all of its crude via
pipelines that traverse Sudan to Port Sudan on the Red Sea.
South Sudan seceded in July 2011 and took three-quarters of the
formerly united country’s crude output of 490,000 barrels a day.
A dispute last year over payment for the transport resulted in
South Sudanese production being shut for 15 months before it
resumed in April.  China Imports  China , the world’s second-biggest crude consumer, had net
imports of 5.64 million barrels a day in May, the most since
January and 0.4 percent higher than April, data from the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs showed June 8.
Oil- refining  dropped 1.4 percent from the prior month to 9.24
million barrels a day, according to figures from the National
Bureau of Statistics June 9.  The nation’s industrial production increased 9.2 percent in
May from a year earlier, below the 9.4 percent median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and factory-gate prices
fell for a 15th month, the government data also showed. Exports
grew 1 percent, the slowest rate in 10 months.  Money managers, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, cut bets on rising WTI prices in the
seven days ended June 4, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Net-long positions dropped by 5,404 futures
and options combined, or 2.5 percent, to 212,127, the CFTC said
in its June 7 Commitments of Traders report.  Hedge funds and other money managers raised bullish bets on
Brent crude for a sixth week to the highest level in more than
three months, data from ICE Futures Europe show.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 164,904 lots in
the week ended June 4, the exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. The increase of 3,354 contracts,
or 2.1 percent, brings net-longs to their highest since Feb. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
