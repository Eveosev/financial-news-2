Doughty Hanson  & Co., a London-based
private-equity firm, said it will reap more than double its
initial investment from the sale of European cinema chain Vue.  Omers Private Equity, the investment arm of the Ontario
Municipal Employees Retirement System, and the Alberta
Investment Management Corporation, agreed to buy the cinemas for
about 935 million pounds ($1.4 billion), Doughty Hanson said in
a  statement  today.  Doughty bought Vue from fellow private-equity firm Caird
Capital in December 2010 for 450 million pounds. The firm has
since doubled the number of cinemas Vue operates to 147 and
acquired competitors including Apollo Cinemas in Britain and
 Poland ’s Multikino.  The disposal is the second from its Doughty Hanson V fund
after the sale of Norit, a maker of water-purification systems,
the company said. The firm is in the process of raising about 2
billion euros ($2.6 billion) for its sixth buyout fund, Doughty
Hanson VI. It will be the firm’s first fundraising since the
death of co-founder Nigel Doughty in February 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
