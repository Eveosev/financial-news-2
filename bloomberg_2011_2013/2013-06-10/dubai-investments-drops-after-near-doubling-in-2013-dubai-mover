Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC)  fell the most
in more than a year on bets a rally that almost doubled the
investment company’s shares in 2013 was overdone.  The Dubai-based company, which holds interests in dairy
farms, publishers, real estate developers and pharmaceuticals,
dropped 5.1 percent, the biggest decrease since May 2012, to
1.49 dirhams at the close in the emirate. The stock was the
second-largest decliner on the benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) ,
which lost 2.3 percent. About 65 million Dubai Investments
shares traded, or 1.8 times the three-month daily average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Dubai Investments shares surged 85 percent in 2013 to the
strongest level in more than four years on June 5, taking the
stock’s price-to-earnings  ratio  to 13.3 times, the highest this
year. The MSCI  Emerging Markets /Financials Index trades at an
average of 9.9 times earnings.  Dubai Investments “was up almost a 100 percent this year a
few days ago,” said Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director at Shuaa
Asset Management. Today’s “fall would be very normal profit
booking,” he said.  The stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  climbed above 70
this month, a level that indicates to some investors that a
security is poised to decline. It rose as high as 81 on June 5
before dropping to 64 today.  Dubai Investments, which almost doubled first-quarter
profit, said last month it was “actively working on certain
divestments which are expected to contribute significant returns
going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
