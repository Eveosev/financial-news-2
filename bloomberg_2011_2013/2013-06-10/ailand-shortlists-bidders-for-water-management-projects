Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD)  is the
leading bidder for 110 billion baht ($3.6 billion) of water-management projects planned in the Southeast Asian nation after
the worst flooding in 70 years.  Thailand ’s biggest construction company by sales received
the highest technical marks for the five projects and offered
pricing that didn’t exceed the ceiling, said Tongthong Chandransu, permanent secretary in the prime minister’s office.  The projects, to be built in five years, include contracts
to build reservoirs in the Chao Phraya basin, a command center
for water management and other structures to control
floodwaters.  Korea Water Resources Corp. and a group led by Bangkok-based  Loxley Pcl (LOXLEY)  may also win projects, Chandransu said.  The government plans to spend as much as 350 billion baht
on efforts to prevent a repeat of the 2011 damage when
floodwaters inundated parts of the capital Bangkok, shuttered
more than 800 factories and disrupted global supply chains.  The cabinet will approve the winners shortly because loans
to finance the projects must be completed by the end of this
month, said Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, minister to the prime
minister’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
