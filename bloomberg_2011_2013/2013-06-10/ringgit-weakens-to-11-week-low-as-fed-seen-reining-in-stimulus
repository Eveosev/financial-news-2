Malaysia’s ringgit dropped to an 11-week low after U.S. jobs data boosted speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce stimulus that has increased the flow of
funds to emerging markets.  Government bonds  declined.  U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 175,000 in May, more than the
163,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey, a June 7 report showed.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month $85 billion of
monthly bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, could be
scaled back if there are signs of sustained improvement in the
labor market. Industrial production and exports in China,
Malaysia’s No. 2 overseas market, trailed estimates last month,
figures released over the weekend show.  “We know the Fed is watching the labor market very closely
and the data could be a trigger that they will eventually taper
down QE3,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The China data continue to point
towards weaker global growth.”  The ringgit weakened 1 percent, the most since May 29, to
3.1270 per dollar as of 4:22 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.1312, the weakest level
since March 20, and was the third-worst performer among Asia’s
11 most-traded currencies today after the Philippine peso and
India’s rupee.  Asian currencies “will stay weak for some days,” Societe
Generale strategist Wee-Khoon Chong said in a research note
today, adding that the ringgit, rupee and Indonesian rupiah are
most at risk. “More unwinding is likely and also expect further
rise in currency volatility.”  Exports Shrink  Malaysia ’s overseas shipments contracted 3.3 percent in
April from a year earlier, the third monthly decline and less
than the 0.4 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
according to official figures released June 7.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, surged
128 basis points, or 1.28 percentage points, to 8.95 percent,
the highest in almost a year.  The yield on the 3.26 percent government bonds due March
2018 climbed three basis points to 3.20 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
