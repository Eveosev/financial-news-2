India ’s bonds fell for a fourth day
on concern the rupee’s slump to a record low will fan inflation
by making imports more expensive, reducing the scope for the
central bank to cut  interest rates  further.  The currency touched an all-time low of 57.5450 per dollar
today, increasing the oil bill for the nation that ships in
about 80 percent of its crude needs. The  Reserve Bank of India ,
which has cut the repurchase rate by 75 basis points this year
to 7.25 percent, next reviews monetary policy on June 17.  “Bonds will remain subdued as the currency’s sharp fall is
likely to pressure inflation and make the central bank focus on
external stability,” said Arvind Chari, a Mumbai-based senior
 fund manager  at Quantum Asset Management Co. “We may see a
status quo on interest rates for some time.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent government securities due May
2023 rose two basis points to 7.26 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
yield on the 8.15 percent note due June 2022 rose six basis
points to 7.47 percent.  The nation’s balance of payments is under stress and retail
 inflation  is still high,  Reserve Bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
said last week.  Consumer prices  probably rose 9 percent in May, according
to a Bloomberg survey of economists before the data is published
on June 12. The gauge has held above 9 percent in the previous
14 months.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivatives contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three
basis points to 7.22 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
