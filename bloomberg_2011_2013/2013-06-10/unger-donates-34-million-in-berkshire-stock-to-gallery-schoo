Charles Munger, the vice chairman at
 Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , donated about $34
million in the company’s stock to two organizations last month
as the investor passes on his wealth.  Munger donated 189 Class A shares to the Henry E.
Huntington Library and Art Gallery in San Marino, California,
and 11 shares to Los Angeles’s Marlborough School, both on May
29, he said in a regulatory filing today. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company closed at $169,402 that day. The Huntington
donation will help fund the new Education and Visitor Center,
the organization said on its website.  Munger, 89, in April pledged $110 million of securities to
the  University of Michigan  to fund fellowships and a graduate-student residence. Buffett, the world’s third-richest man, said
at the company’s annual meeting in May that he was giving away
about 1 percent of Berkshire’s  total stock count  every year, and
described that sum as insignificant, based on the trading volume
of shares.  “There’s nothing as insignificant as an extra $2 billion
to an old man,” Munger said in response to the remark from
Buffett, 82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
