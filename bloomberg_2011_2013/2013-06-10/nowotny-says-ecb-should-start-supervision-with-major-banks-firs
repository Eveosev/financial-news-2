The  European Central Bank  should
consider focusing only on major lenders when it starts taking on
supervision of European banks and only gradually widen the
scope, Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said.  “Taking up such a huge responsibility for European banking
supervision needs careful preparation, quality being at least as
important as speed,” Nowotny said in a speech in Vienna today.
“It may make sense to follow the advice of some of our German
colleagues to start with a smaller number of the major European
banks to allow for a staggered approach.”  The ECB is due to take responsibility of banking
supervision in the euro area and other European countries next
year in a first step toward a banking union. It will be
overseeing roughly 130 banks with combined total assets of more
than 25 trillion euros ($33 billion), Nowotny said.  “With regard to the financial system, a fair amount of
stabilization has been achieved,” he said. “But we still see
major challenges for the banking sector, and -- especially in
 Europe  -- we still see a struggling economy and overstretched
public finances. This is why an accommodative monetary policy
stance is still needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
