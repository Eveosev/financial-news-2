FastJet Plc (FJET) , the African discount-airline startup, said Executive Chairman David Lenigas has
stepped down with immediate effect and that Chief Executive
Officer Ed Winter will replace him on an interim basis.  FastJet’s board will recruit a non-executive chairman to
fill the role and an announcement will be made in due course,
the London-based company said today after markets closed.  Lenigas has left to focus on “other business ventures” in
the light of last month’s agreement by FS Africa to buy Lonrho
Plc, the biggest investor in FastJet, he said in the statement.
The 52-year-old is a former executive chairman of the hotels,
ports and agribusiness group, which he quit last September.  “I see a very bright future for a low-cost airline on the
continent of  Africa ,” Lenigas said in today’s statement.
“FastJet has the right model to succeed.”  FS Africa has agreed to purchase Lonrho for 10.25 pence a
share or about 175 million pounds, the companies said May 15. FS
is a bid vehicle set up to make the purchase and controlled by
Swiss investors Rainer-Marc Frey, founder of hedge-fund group
Horizon21, and Thomas Schmidheiny, a former director of Swissair
and one-time chairman of cement maker Holcim Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
