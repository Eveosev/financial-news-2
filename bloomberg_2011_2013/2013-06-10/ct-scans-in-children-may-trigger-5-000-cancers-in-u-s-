The radiation from 4 million annual
computerized tomography scans in U.S. children younger than 15
may lead to almost 5,000 cancers each year in the future, a
study found.  The use of  CT scans  of the head, abdomen or pelvis, chest
or spine in children 14 years and younger more than doubled from
1996 to 2007 before beginning to decline through 2010, according
to research released today by  JAMA Pediatrics . Those at greater
risk for cancer were younger patients, girls, and those who
underwent CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis or the spine rather
than other areas of the body, the researchers said.  Today’s study adds to previous research in adults that has
shown a three-fold increase in the number of CT tests in the
U.S. from 1996 to 2010. A 2009 study in JAMA Internal Medicine
estimated that about 29,000 future cancers would occur in the
U.S. because of CT scans done in 2007. More studies are needed
to understand when a CT scan might benefit a patient and when it
won’t, said Rita Redberg, editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, who
wrote an accompanying editorial.  “There’s a lot more tendency to order imaging tests these
days than we did 20 years ago for the same symptoms,”  Redberg, 
a professor of medicine at the  University of California ,  San
Francisco , said today in a telephone interview. “There’s
something in our culture at this point about ordering more
tests, particularly high-tech tests. I don’t think people think
about the radiation.”  More Procedures  About  7 million  CT tests are performed in children each
year in the U.S. and the number is rising about 10 percent
annually, according to the Image Gently Campaign and the
Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging, which is
funded by the Society for Pediatric Radiology, the American
College of Radiology and other organizations to push for lower
radiation doses in children.  Researchers in the study used data from seven U.S. health-care systems to look at CT scan use in children. They also
calculated the  radiation exposure  and projected the future
cancer risk to those patients.  The use of CT scans in children younger than 5 years old
almost doubled to 20 scans per 1,000 children in 2005-2007 from
1996, before declining to 15.8 scans per 1,000 in 2010. The
research showed that for children ages 5 to 14, the use of CT
tests almost tripled to 27 scans per 1,000 children in 2005-2007
from 1996, before dropping to 23.9 scans per 1,000 in 2010.  Cancer Estimate  The researchers estimated that 4,870 future cancers may
occur each year in the future from the 4 million annual
pediatric CT scans of the head, abdomen/pelvis, chest or spine.  The findings also suggest that reducing the highest doses
of radiation from CT scans to the middle dose may prevent 43
percent of these cancers.  Parents should question whether CT scans are necessary and
if they are, whether doctors will use the lowest radiation dose
possible to get the images they need, said  Diana Miglioretti ,
the study’s lead author, a professor of biostatistics at the
University of  California , Davis, and a senior investigator at
Group Health Research Institute in  Seattle .  Currently, she said, it’s impossible to tell if a cancer
someone gets is related to radiation from CT tests earlier in
life. She said she is seeking funding to follow the children in
the study to see whether they get cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
