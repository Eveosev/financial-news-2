India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. said
that a statement today announcing an agreement to purchase part
of a gas field in Mozambique from Videocon Industries Ltd. was
“inadvertently issued” before a deal was completed.  The state-owned company withdrew the press release, which
said ONGC and partner  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  would pay $2.5 billion for
a 10 percent stake in the Rovuma-1 offshore gas project.  The announcement was “premature” because discussions with
Videocon are ongoing and no final deal has been struck, ONGC
Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said by phone. Videocon Chairman
Venugopal Dhoot didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  The Indian group was the leading bidder in an auction for
gas assets in  Mozambique  owned by Videocon and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said last
month. The East African country has become a prominent
destination for energy investment, especially by Asian
companies, as it looks to develop the largest natural-gas find
in a decade.  Anadarko and  Eni SpA (ENI)  are leading a plan to convert gas from
the Indian Ocean fields in Mozambique to liquid and transport it
to countries including India. Liquefied natural gas plants need
billions of dollars in investment to chill the gas to a liquid
and ship it using tankers.  At a planned capacity of 20 million tons annually, the
Mozambique project could be the world’s second-largest LNG
export site, after Ras Laffan in  Qatar , where Exxon Mobil Corp.
is a partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
