A  Detroit  investment adviser will pay $3.1 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that he stole money from a police pension fund to finance the purchase of two California strip malls.  Chauncey C. Mayfield, 57, and his firm, MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, were accused of siphoning money from the Detroit Police and Fire Retirement System in 2008, the agency said in a complaint filed in federal court in  Michigan . Four other MayfieldGentry executives were accused of trying to cover up the theft, the agency said in a statement.  “Mayfield stole pension money from Detroit’s retired police officers, firefighters, and surviving spouses and children to buy strip malls” Andrew Ceresney, the SEC’s co-director of enforcement, said in the agency’s statement. “To make matters worse, other senior officers at the firm joined together with him to cover up his deceitful and grave betrayal of trust, all for the purpose of keeping the client.”  The MayfieldGentry executives, who became aware of the misappropriation by May 2011, covered it up for another year, the SEC said. They informed the pension fund the evening before the agency filed a complaint in May 2012 accusing them of participating in a “pay-to-play” scheme involving former Detroit Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick.  Mayfield and the firm resolved the SEC claims without admitting or denying wrongdoing.  Without Permission  According to the SEC complaint, Mayfield took the money from a pension fund trust account without permission and used it to buy strip malls in the California cities of Carmichael and  Santa Rosa . Chief Financial Officer Blair D. Ackman, 42; Chief Operating Officer Marsha Bass, 59; Chief Investment Officer W. Emery Matthews, 40; and Alicia M. Diaz, 50, were the other executives named in the complaint.  Those four defendants haven’t settled with the SEC. Attorneys for Ackman, Bass and Matthews didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. Terence H. Campbell, a Chicago-based attorney for Diaz, said his client shouldn’t be included in the SEC’s case.  “We are disappointed that the SEC chose to name Ms. Diaz in this lawsuit because we do not think the facts support the claim made against her,” Campbell said in an e-mailed statement.  Mayfield is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in February to paying bribes to former Detroit Treasurer Jeffrey Beasley to influence Beasley’s decisions as a trustee of the pension fund. He faces a maximum five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.  The firm previously oversaw more than $200 million in real estate assets for the pension fund, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the eastern district of Michigan, which prosecuted Mayfield on the criminal charge. The Detroit pension fund owns assets valued at $3.33 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
