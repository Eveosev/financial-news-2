The  New York Jets  hired former
 Arizona  Cardinals General Manager Rod Graves, the newest
executive to join the National Football League team in its front
office overhaul.  Graves will join the Jets as senior director of football
administration, team spokesman  Bruce Speight  said today in an e-mail. He will work under the team’s new general manager John Idzik, who previously worked with Graves in Arizona.  Idzik this offseason replaced former general manager Mike
Tannenbaum, fired in December after the team finished the season
6-10 and missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season.
Last month JoJo Wooden, the team’s assistant director of player
personnel, left to take a similar front-office job with the  San
Diego Chargers , and a week later the team decided not to renew
the contract of assistant general manager Scott Cohen.  The Cardinals fired Graves this offseason after the team
finished 5-11, losing 11 of its final 12 games. Arizona was a
combined 45-51 with two playoff appearances in Graves’s six-year
tenure as general manager.  Graves has a background in scouting, which contrasts with
Idzik, who is known primarily as a contract negotiator who
handles the salary cap, according to the Star-Ledger newspaper
of Newark said.  The team also promoted Matt Bazirgan to assistant director
of pro personnel from personnel scout, the newspaper said.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
