New World Development Co. (17) , the Hong
Kong builder controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , started
gauging demand for an initial public offering of its local
hotels, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  NW Hotel Investments is seeking about $700 million in the
IPO and plans to start trading on July 9, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is private.
The trust, based in Hong Kong, plans to start taking orders for
shares in the week of June 24, they said.  The initial portfolio of NW Hotel Investments includes the
Renaissance Harbour View and Grand Hyatt in Wan Chai, and the
Hyatt Regency in Tsim Sha Tsui, according to a  filing  to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today. Cheng ranks No. 41 on the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index  of the worldâ€™s richest people with
a fortune of $16.6 billion.  A spokeswoman for New World had no immediate comment on the
NW Hotel IPO. Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan
Chase & Co., BOC International Holdings Ltd. and Standard
Chartered Plc are arranging the sale, the people said.  New World had planned to seek as much as $1 billion from
the offering, two people with knowledge of the matter said in
March. Langham Hospitality Investments Ltd., a trust backed by
Great Eagle Holdings Ltd. hotels in Hong Kong, raised $549
million last month. The trust had fallen 12 percent since it
started trading on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
