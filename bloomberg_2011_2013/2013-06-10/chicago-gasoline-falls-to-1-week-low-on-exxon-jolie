Chicago  gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in a week versus  New York  futures as  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  completed maintenance at a Joliet, Illinois, refinery.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago fell
10 cents to a premium of  50 cents  a gallon above futures traded
the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 4:15 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the  smallest differential 
since May 30.  The spread narrowed for a fifth consecutive day after Exxon
said it completed a refinery-wide turnaround at the  238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant , the fifth-largest in the U.S.
Midwest. The work, which began April 14, shut all operating
units.  “That’s what has us coming off today,” Steve Mosby, vice
president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC in Kansas City,
Missouri, said in a phone interview. “Exxon isn’t out there
buying, so we seem to be cooling off. Joliet is also a large
plant and it’s going to put a lot of material out there.”  Gasoline inventories  in the U.S. Midwest, or PADD 2, were
48.4 million barrels in the week ended May 31, after falling to
4.76, the the lowest level since Nov. 30, earlier in the month,
according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.  It may take awhile for Joliet’s output to reach the market,
Mosby said.  BP Plc (BP/)  said on June 6 that it plans to restart this
month its Whiting, Indiana, refinery’s largest crude unit.  Chicago-Gulf  The return of oil refineries in the Midwest may also spur
exports of gasoline and diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast,
according to Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at
Morgan Stanley. Plant restarts will boost Midwest capacity by
more than 300,000 barrels a day, he said in an e-mailed report.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West  Texas  Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped $3.05 to $40.87 a barrel.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast strengthened  3.5 cents  to a discount of 11.75 cents a
gallon versus Nymex futures at 3:59 p.m., the strongest level
since Feb. 27. Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, advanced 1.5
cents to 1.5 cents a gallon above futures.  The differentials widened after  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) 
said a fluid catalytic cracker remained shut at its 81,500-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, refinery following a leak on
June 7. Crude units were brought back online at the plant over
the weekend, said Jamal Kheiry, a company spokesman.  Hydrocracker work at  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery also continued today, said Bill Day, a company
spokesman based in San Antonio.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, based on WTI, gained 39
cents to  $21.24 a barrel , while the same spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet oil increased 69 cents to $12.04 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
