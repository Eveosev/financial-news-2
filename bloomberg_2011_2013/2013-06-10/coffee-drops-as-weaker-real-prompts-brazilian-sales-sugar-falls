Arabica coffee fell for a second day
in  New York  as the harvest advanced in  Brazil , the world’s
leading producer, and a weaker local currency prompted growers
to sell more in the futures market. Raw sugar declined.  Dry weather allowed growers to accelerate pickings in
Brazil, Rio de Janeiro-based broker Flavour Coffee said in a
report e-mailed on June 6. Dryness came after “abnormal rain”
in the beginning of this month, according to Sao Paulo-based
weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia. The Brazilian real slid
6.2 percent against the dollar over the past month, making sales
priced in the U.S. currency more attractive.  “A common theme aligning coffee and sugar is not just
heavy surpluses, but also the start of the large Brazilian
harvests and more recently, the weakening Brazilian currency,”
 Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, said
in a report e-mailed today. A weaker real “may encourage
further selling in coming weeks,” she said.  Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1.266
a pound by 7:12 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
slid 1.9 percent in the previous trading session. Robusta coffee
for delivery in the same month retreated 0.2 percent to $1,844 a
metric ton in London.  Brazil is harvesting its 2013-14 crop and production will
be a record for a year in which trees enter the lower-yielding
half of a two-year cycle, the government estimates. Output will
be 48.6 million bags, crop-forecasting agency known as Conab
said on May 14. A bag of coffee usually weighs 132 pounds.  Robusta coffee has fallen 9.3 percent in the past month as
supplies improved. Prices in  Vietnam , the main grower of the
variety used in instant drinks and espresso, fell to 39,200 dong
($1.87) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) today, the lowest since Jan. 30,
 data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  Robusta Supplies  “In robusta, supplies are improving, with Vietnamese
growers likely to be scale-down sellers as Indonesian new crop
arrivals start picking up,” Macquarie’s Haque said.  Raw sugar for delivery in July was down 0.1 percent at
16.42 cents a pound in New York. White, or refined, sugar for
delivery in August was little changed at $481.30 a ton in
London.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $2,355 a ton on
ICE. Cocoa for delivery in July declined 0.3 percent to 1,559
pounds ($2,423) a ton on NSYE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
