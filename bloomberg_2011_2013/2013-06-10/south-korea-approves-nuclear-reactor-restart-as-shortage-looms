South Korea , facing its worst power
shortage, approved the resumption of a nuclear reactor shut down
for almost eight months due to faulty safety equipment.  The Hanbit No. 3 reactor, on South Korea’s west coast, will
restart today and reach its full 1,000-megawatt capacity by June
13, Chang Won, deputy director at the country’s Nuclear Safety
and Security Commission, said by phone. The reactor has been
offline since October after cracks were found in a control rod,
Chang said.  The world’s fourth-biggest nuclear power producer last year
may face “unprecedented” power shortages this summer after
shutting down two reactors and delaying the start of operations
at another last month, according to Vice Minister for Energy Han
Jin Hyun. The restart of Hanbit No. 3 will mean 14 of the
country’s 23 reactors are in operation.  The Shin-Kori No. 2 and Shin-Wolsong No. 1 reactors will be
offline for about four months to replace control cables supplied
under fake quality warranties, the Energy Ministry said on May
28. The government also ordered the replacement of cables at the
Shin-Kori No. 1 reactor, which is shut for regular maintenance,
and at the new Shin-Wolsong No. 2 plant, which is in review
before commencing operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
