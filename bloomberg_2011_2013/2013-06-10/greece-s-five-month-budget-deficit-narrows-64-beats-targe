Greece ’s budget deficit narrowed 64
percent in the first five months of the year, beating a target
set for the period as reduced spending offset lower revenue.  The central government’s deficit for January to May, which
excludes spending by state-controlled enterprises, shrank to 3.9
billion euros ($5.2 billion) from 10.9 billion euros a year
earlier, according to preliminary data from the Athens-based
Finance Ministry. The target was for a 7.1 billion-euro deficit.
The primary deficit, which excludes debt service payments,
declined to 984 million euros from 2.3 billion euros a year
earlier.  Net revenue dropped 2.5 percent to 19.2 billion euros in
the January to May period, exceeding a target of 18.7 billion
euros. Spending dropped to 23 billion euros from 30.5 billion
euros compared with a target of 25.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
