President  Barack Obama  marked the
50th anniversary of Equal Pay Act that was supposed to abolish
wage disparity based on sex by saying the gains made by women
haven’t completely closed the gap on wages.  As more women become the main earner in households, the
disparity in wages compared with men is putting more pressure on
middle-income families, Obama said at a White House ceremony
marking the occasion.  “And as I said in my inaugural address this year, our
journey to equality is not complete until our wives, our
mothers, our daughters can earn a living equal to their
efforts,” he said.  The law signed by President  John F. Kennedy  was aimed at
assuring women of paychecks equal to those of men doing the same
work. In 1963, women earned about 59 cents to every man’s dollar
for the same job.  Comparing the median weekly full-time earnings in 2012,
women earned 80.9 percent of men, according to the  Institute for
Women’s Policy Research , a Washington-based research group,
citing figures from the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .  On an annual basis, the earnings disparity was 77 percent
in 2011, the last data available, the group said, citing BLS
data.  U.S. Representative  Rosa DeLauro , a Connecticut Democrat,
has introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act 16 times in eight
consecutive congresses. The bill’s designed to close loopholes
in current law, including a requirement that employers prove
that pay disparities stem from seniority, productivity, or merit
and not sex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
