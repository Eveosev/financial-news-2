Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, is one of three lenders providing long term
financing for a C$300 million ($294 million) wind farm that’s
under construction in  Quebec .  KfW Group also participated with Caisse de Depot et
Placement du Quebec, project sponsor Eolectric Inc. said today
in a statement that didn’t disclose terms. Caisse, an
institutional  fund manager , is loaning C$50 million, it said in
a separate statement.  The loans are in the “vicinity” of about 75 percent of
the project cost, with a term longer than 15 years, Hugo Bouchard, chief investment officer of Eolectric Management, said
today by telephone. He wouldn’t provide exact terms.  The Vents du Kempt project will consist of 43 Enercon GmbH
2.35-megawatt wind turbines and is expected to enter operation
Dec. 1, 2014, Eolectric said. Hydro-Quebec will purchase the
electricity for 20 years for about 10 Canadian cents a kilowatt-hour, Bouchard said.  A fund backed by Brossard, Quebec-based Eolectric owns a 51
percent stake in the project, the company said. The remainder is
owned by a Fiera Axium Infrastructure Inc. fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
