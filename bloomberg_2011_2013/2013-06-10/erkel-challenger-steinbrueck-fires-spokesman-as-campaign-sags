German Social Democratic chancellor candidate Peer Steinbrueck fired his chief spokesman following a succession of campaign gaffes as his bid to unseat  Angela Merkel  in Sept. 22 elections fails to gain traction.  Steinbrueck announced his “very difficult” decision to dismiss Michael Donnermeyer today in Berlin, replacing him with Rolf Kleine, a former reporter for Germany’s best-selling  Bild  newspaper. The SPD candidate said that Donnermeyer “knows the business of politics,” and declined to blame him for any mistakes made.  “I don’t see that anybody else is responsible,” Steinbrueck told reporters at SPD headquarters in Berlin after being asked whether Donnermeyer was partly at fault for the campaign’s performance. “If there is any responsibility for mistakes, then I take it myself.”  Steinbrueck, Merkel’s first-term finance minister from 2005-2009, has failed to gain ground on the chancellor with a campaign focused on social justice as a series of missteps shifted attention away from SPD policy themes. Those include revelations about speaking fees Steinbrueck accepted from banks after leaving government in 2009 and his claim that the chancellor’s annual 220,000 euro ($290,000) salary isn’t enough.  As Merkel embarked on her third tour in a week of regions in  Germany  devastated by flooding, Steinbrueck has been left in her slipstream. Even a political scandal over drones involving a Merkel confidant has failed to yield any benefit for the SPD.  Latest Polls  Steinbrueck’s SPD trailed Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc by  26 percent to 41 percent , a widening of the gap by one percentage point, according to a weekly Emnid poll published yesterday. Emnid polled 1,951 voters on May 31 to June 5. No margin of error was given.  Responding to queries on why he hadn’t emulated Merkel and traveled to the flood zones, Steinbrueck said such trips were about political symbolism and not about help for those affected.  “Right now it’s about people’s belongings, partly about people’s health and everything else they need, not political tourism,” Steinbrueck said. “They need the military right now, they need technical relief, the fire department -- but they don’t need  Peer Steinbrueck .”  To contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Donahue in Berlin at  pdonahue1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at  jhertling@bloomberg.net
