Egyptian shares fell to the lowest
in more than 10 months on investor concern anti-government
protests will gain momentum as President Mohamed Mursi marks the
first anniversary of his election.  The benchmark EGX 30 Index lost 2.9 percent to 4,775.92,
the lowest level since July 30, at the close in Cairo. The gauge
tumbled 12 percent in the last seven days, the longest losing
streak since November 2011. Commercial International Bank  Egypt 
SAE, the country’s biggest publicly traded lender, fell 4.1
percent and EFG-Hermes Holding SAE plunged to the lowest in
eight years. Benchmark dollar bonds dropped.  A group of mostly secular activists calling for the
resignation of Mursi said it collected 13 million petitions for
the cause, Al Arabiya.net said. The group known as Tamarrod, the
Arabic word for rebellion, is vowing nationwide demonstrations
on June 30, the one-year anniversary of Mursi taking office,
setting up a possible confrontation with his Islamist backers.  “There’s more noise around the demonstrations this time
and growing opposition to the government,” Hassan Kenawi,
equities trader at Cairo-based HC Brokerage, said by phone. “We
expect the sell-off to continue until there’s news to act as a
positive catalyst for the market.”  The yield on the government’s $1 billion of 5.75 percent
Eurobonds due in 2020 increased 12 basis points, or 0.12 of a
percentage point, to 8.55 percent at 4:11 p.m. in Cairo, the
highest level on a closing basis in more than two months.  Commercial International declined to 31.02 Egyptian pounds.
EFG-Hermes, the country’s biggest investment bank, plunged 6.3
percent to 7.33 pounds, the lowest since May 2005.  Tamarrod posters bearing a red X on a picture of Mursi have
grown increasingly visible around Cairo. The posters ask people
to participate in the protests to “topple the Brotherhood
rule,” referring to the country’s biggest Islamist organization
from which Mursi hails.  The pound was little changed at 6.9908 a dollar after the
central bank sold $38.8 million at a currency auction to local
lenders. The currency has lost 11 percent since the start of the
dollar sales in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
