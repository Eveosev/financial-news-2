Poets and philosophers have debated the value of a good man for ages. Insure.com quantifies it and the number is $23,344. The website produces an annual index which uses average wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the value of traditional tasks that dads do at home. “Dads benefited from wage increases for drivers, teachers, coaches and plumbers,” said Amy Danise, editorial director for Insure.com, in a press release about the report. The website's annual  Father’s Day Index  says the 2013 value of Dad is up 15 percent from last year's figure of $20,248, thanks to increases in average wages for certain “dad jobs.” Are there such things anymore, beyond controlling the TV remote? When asked about their favorite jobs around the house, fathers pointed to barbecuing/cooking and pest removal (really? Did these dads see "Annie Hall"?). Here's the rundown: * Barbecuing/cooking: 22 percent * Helping with homework: 17 percent * Driving: 14 percent * Coaching a team: 9 percent * Assembly of toys, bookshelves, etc.: 9 percent * Fixing broken things around the house: 6 percent * Mowing the lawn, landscaping, snow removal: 5 percent * Doing family finances: 5 percent * Car maintenance; 4 percent * Being a scout leader: 3 percent * Pest removal (spiders, gross bugs): 3 percent * Fixing plumbing: 2 percent * Moving furniture: 2 percent One item left off the list that Dads who've spent weekends trying to assemble furniture from an unnamed retailer with a foreign-sounding name may think belongs there: smashing "ready to assemble" furniture to bits in frustration. And Moms? They're still worth more (no surprise here, is there?). The 2013 market value of Mom is $59,862, according to Insure.com.
