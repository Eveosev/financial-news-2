The rand fell for a second day,
tracking commodity prices lower as China’s industrial production
trailed estimates. Bond yields rose to the highest in a year.  China’s manufacturing and trade expanded less than
estimated last month. The world’s second-biggest economy is the
biggest buyer of South African raw materials, including  iron ore 
and coal. U.S. non-farm payrolls rose more than economists
forecast in May, a June 7 report showed, two weeks after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases may be reined in if there is sustained improvement in
the jobs market.  “While the U.S. data has been too strong for comfort,
Chinese figures have been too weak,”  John Cairns , a currency
strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “The net result of the U.S. and Chinese data
has been to put the high-yielding commodity currencies under
pressure.”  South Africa’s currency slumped 2.2 percent to 10.1780 per
dollar as of 10:20 a.m. in Johannesburg, the worst performance
out of 24 emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg.
Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 jumped
for a fourth day, rising 22 basis points to 8.18 percent, the
highest since June 14, 2012.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (SPGSCI)  of raw materials declined
for the first time in six days as prices of metals including
copper, nickel and platinum fell. Metals and other mining
commodities account for more than 50 percent of South Africa’s
exports, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
