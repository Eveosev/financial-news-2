Euro-area investor confidence rose
in June on increased optimism that the economy will return to
growth this year and turbulence in the sovereign debt crisis has
been overcome for now, the Sentix research institute said.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro area rose to minus
11.6 from minus 15.6 in May, the Limburg, Germany-based
institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists had
predicted an increase to minus 11.3, according to the median of
16 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . A gauge of economic
expectations jumped to 7.3 from 2.8, while a measure of current
conditions rose to minus 28.8 from minus 32.3.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on June 6 said
the 17-nation bloc’s economy, which is struggling to emerge from
the longest-ever recession, will return to growth by the end of
this year.  The index’s improvement last month was thanks to “Draghi,
who gave an important impulse with the latest ECB rate cut,”
said  Sebastian Wanke , an economist at Sentix.  The Frankfurt-based ECB last week left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged after cutting it to a record low of 0.5
percent in May.  Confidence in  Germany  rose to 16.2 in June from 15.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
