New York Mets first baseman  Ike
Davis  was demoted to the minor leagues to try to rebound from a
slump that’s dropped his batting average to .161.  Davis, 26, has five home runs and 16 runs batted in over 55
games after leading the Mets with 32 homers last season. He has
66 strikeouts in 186 at-bats.  “At some point you just have to say to yourself, ’This is
not in his best interest,’” Mets General Manager  Sandy Alderson 
said. “I was one of his biggest supporters and I just felt that
at some point we’ve got to get him out of here.”  Davis, who has one home run since April 25, will join the
Mets’ Triple-A affiliate in  Las Vegas .  “He’s had a lot of people in his ear talking about his
swing and talking about what he needs to get to do to get back
to where he was,” Alderson told reporters after Davis went 0-for-3 in yesterday’s 8-4 loss to the Miami Marlins. “The first
thing is he needs to get into a different environment; he needs
to get his confidence back and to hear fewer voices.”  New York also sent outfielder Mike Baxter and pitcher
Robert Carson to Las Vegas while recalling infielder Josh Satin,
outfielder Collin Cowgill and pitcher Josh Edgin. The Mets’
23-35 record this season is the third-worst in  Major League
Baseball  behind the Miami Marlins and  Houston Astros .  To contact the reporter on this story:
