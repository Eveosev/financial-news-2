Gold’s recovery to a three-week high
last week is over and prices that entered a  bear market  in April
may fall another 5.5 percent to about $1,303 an ounce, according
to  technical analysis  by UBS AG.  The $1,303 level would be the 50 percent retracement of
bullion’s rally from October 2008 to its record in 2011, one of
the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis. A
“cross lower” in Stochastic momentum indicators would be a
bearish signal, UBS said in a report June 7, when prices dropped
the most in three weeks.  “This would suggest the recent recovery is over,”  Richard Adcock , a technical strategist at UBS in  London , wrote in the
report. “The next leg of the bear trend is to be seen down to
the long-term 50 percent retracement point at $1,303, which we
would set as our objective.”  Gold slid 18 percent this year as an improving U.S. economy
increased speculation the  Federal Reserve  may scale back
quantitative-easing measures that helped bullion cap a 12-year
bull run in 2012. Prices are now 28 percent below the $1,921.15
record set in September 2011 and investors are holding the least
metal through exchange-traded products in more than two years.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,379.32 by 11:17
a.m. in London, after dropping 2.2 percent on June 7. It had
reached $1,423.90 the day before, the highest since May 15. If
gold were to fall below $1,350, there may be “nothing” to
support prices between there and the $1,200 to $1,225 area,
economist  Dennis Gartman  wrote today in his daily report.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low. Stochastics, technical analysis tools
based on momentum measures, are often used to identify whether a
security’s price is overbought or oversold.  To contact the reporter for this story:
