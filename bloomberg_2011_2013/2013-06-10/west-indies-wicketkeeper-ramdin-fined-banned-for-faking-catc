West Indies wicketkeeper Denesh
Ramdin was fined his game fee and suspended for two matches
after faking a catch in a ICC Champions Trophy cricket match
with  Pakistan , the  International Cricket Council  said.  Ramdin dropped a shot from Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq
as he fell to the ground and didn’t alert the umpires, who had
ruled it a catch. A video review by the third umpire found
Misbah wasn’t out, and the Pakistan batsman finished an unbeaten
96 in the West Indies’s two-wicket victory in the June 7 one-day
international.  Ramdin was found guilty of “conduct contrary to the spirit
of the game” during a hearing today, the ICC said in an e-mailed statement.  “This is regarded as a serious offence as it is the
responsibility of all players to act in the spirit of the
game,” umpire Chris Broad, who adjudicated the case, said in
the statement. “I hope Mr. Ramdin has learned his lesson from
this incident and that we will not see such behaviour by him or
any player in the future.”  Ramdin can appeal the decision.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
