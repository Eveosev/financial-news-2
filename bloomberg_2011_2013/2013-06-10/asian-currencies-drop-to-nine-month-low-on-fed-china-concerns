Asian currencies fell to the lowest
level in nine months after U.S. jobs data fanned speculation the
Federal Reserve will rein in stimulus and as signs of a slowdown
in  China  dimmed the outlook for regional trade.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped as much as
0.4 percent to 116.52, the lowest level since Sept. 14.  India ’s
 rupee  slumped 1.1 percent to 57.72 per dollar as of 11:55 a.m.
in  Mumbai , earlier touching a record low of 57.775, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 1 percent
to 3.1269, South Korea’s won fell 1 percent to 1127.47 and the
Philippine peso dropped 0.8 percent to 42.607.  U.S. non-farm payrolls rose more than economists forecast
in May, a June 7 report showed, two weeks after Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke said $85 billion of monthly bond purchases may be
reined in if there is sustained improvement in the jobs market.
China’s manufacturing and trade expanded less than estimated
last month and Barclays Plc cut its 2013 growth forecast for
Asia’s biggest economy to 7.4 percent from 7.9 percent.  “We know the Fed is watching the labor market very closely
and the data could be a trigger that they will eventually taper
down QE3,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “The China data continue to point
towards weaker global growth.”  China’s industrial output climbed 9.2 percent from a year
earlier in May, less than the 9.4 percent growth forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists, exports rose the least in 10
months and factory-gate prices fell for a 15th month, weekend
reports showed. Malaysia’s overseas shipments contracted 3.3
percent in April, a third straight decline, according to
official figures released June 7.  Fund Flows  Global funds pulled $3.1 billion last week from equities in
Indonesia, the  Philippines , South Korea,  Taiwan  and  Thailand ,
exchange data show. The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, slid 1.3
percent in the past month.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah declined
2.6 percent to 10,388 per dollar, the weakest level since August
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were at a 5.6
percent discount to the exchange rate quoted by banks in
 Indonesia , the biggest gap since September 2011. The spot rate
fell 0.1 percent to 9,810 in Jakarta, according to prices from
local lenders.  Indonesia has recorded six consecutive quarterly current-account deficits and it is becoming difficult to get the
greenback onshore, according to Herdi Wibowo, head of fixed
income at PT BCA Sekuritas.  “It’s all about the supply of U.S. dollars,” Jakarta-based Wibowo said today. “Bank Indonesia is keeping the spot
rate from breaching the 10,000 level for now.”  India’s Outlook  India’s rupee dropped the most in seven months as the
Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies
of six major trading partners, rose for a second day. The
shortfall in the nation’s current account, the broadest measure
of trade, widened to an unprecedented 5 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, the government
estimates.  “We seem to be set for a weakening rupee all this week,”
said Nick Verdi, a strategist at Barclays in Singapore. “One
reason is the strengthening dollar and the other is India’s
fundamentals.”  Elsewhere, the Thai baht fell 0.4 percent to 30.74 per
dollar and  Vietnam ’s dong was steady at 21,018. China’s
financial markets were shut today through June 12 for the Dragon
Boat Festival Holiday. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the  yuan 
fell 0.14 percent to 6.1477 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
