Increases in Chilean  home prices 
will fall short of last year’s record growth amid a tempered
economic outlook,  Paz Corp SA (PAZ)  Chief Executive Officer Ariel Magendzo said in an interview.  “Economic expectations are starting to moderate, and that
may make people less anxious to rush out and buy a house,”
Magendzo said in an interview in his office in Santiago.  Paz, Chile’s second-largest publicly traded homebuilder,
has  tumbled  15 percent this year after rising 69 percent in
2012. Shares fell 4.9 percent to 290 pesos today, the biggest
drop since October 2011 on a closing basis.  Home prices in Santiago rose 8.6 percent last year,
matching a 2011 growth rate that was the highest on record
stretching back to 2004, according to  Chilean Construction
Chamber . In March, annual price growth slowed to 6.5 percent,
based on the chamber’s latest monthly reading.  Chile ’s economy  expanded  by 4.1 percent in the first
quarter from the year earlier, the slowest pace since the three
months through September 2011. Growth is projected to average
4.9 percent in 2013 and 4.7 percent in 2014, based on the
average estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The country’s economy has expanded by at least 5.5 percent
in each of the past three  years .  To contact the reporter on this story:
