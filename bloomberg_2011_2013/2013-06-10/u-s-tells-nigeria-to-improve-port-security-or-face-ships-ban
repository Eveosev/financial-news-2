The U.S. may ban ships from entering
 Nigeria  to protest insecurity in the ports and waterways of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy.  U.S authorities gave Nigeria a 90-day ultimatum to improve
security, Leke Oyewole, special adviser on maritime affairs to
President  Goodluck Jonathan , said at a conference today in
Lagos, the commercial capital, citing a letter from the U.S.
government. The deadline expires in 45 days, he said.  Nigeria will “revive” its implementation of the
International Ship and Port Facility Security code by August to
secure ports and waterways against terrorism, piracy, smuggling
and bunkering, Oyewole said. The country “is bound to act on
the U.S. concerns to protect its source of revenue,” he said.  Economic growth in Africa’s largest oil producer slowed to
6.6 percent in the first quarter from 7 percent in the prior
three months, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said on May 16.
Total government revenue fell 2.4 percent to 2.4 trillion naira
($15 billion) in the period, compared with the previous three
months, according to the statistics agency.  Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Abuja, the capital, said by phone he’s aware of the letter
though he hasn’t seen it.  The West African nation will automate controls on people
moving inside the ports and enhance the exchange of data among
regulatory and security agencies involved in maritime industries
to address the concerns of the U.S., Oyewole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
