Apple Inc. (AAPL)  introduced a new version of its Mac operating system called Mavericks, aimed at delivering tighter integration with iPhones and iPads.  The software lets users’ appointments, password, map directions and other information follow them between devices, Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, said at the company’s 24th annual developers conference in San Francisco today.  Mavericks is designed to run on less energy than prior versions, conserving battery life, and also includes features for using multiple screens, Federighi said. Apple also unveiled a new Mac Pro desktop computer, with advanced power and memory features for high-end users.  Apple hasn’t introduced a new device since October, marking one of the company’s longest product gaps in more than a decade.
