Sweden ’s industrial production
unexpectedly fell in April as domestic demand faltered.  Industrial production  fell an annual 0.8 percent after
sliding a revised 0.1 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said today. Production was  estimated  to
rise 0.7 percent, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of four economists. Output fell a  monthly  0.5
percent after rising a revised 0.6 percent the previous month.  Industrial orders rose an  annual  1.7 percent in April and
plunged a  monthly  10.3 percent, Statistics Sweden said. Domestic
orders slid 4.6 percent in the year while export orders rose 6.5
percent.  Sweden’s  exports , which account for about half of the
country’s output, fell 5.5 percent in the first quarter from the
same period last year as countries in  Europe  cut spending to
reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
