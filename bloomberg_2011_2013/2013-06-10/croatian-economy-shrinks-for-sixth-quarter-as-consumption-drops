Croatia’s economy contracted on an
annual basis for a sixth quarter as investments and personal
consumption declined.  Gross domestic product shrank 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, the  statistics office  in Zagreb said today, matching
its May 29 preliminary estimate.  The Adriatic nation, which will become the European Union’s
28th member on July 1, hasn’t posted economic growth since 2008,
with foreign direct investment plummeting last year. Retail
sales have declined for 14 consecutive months.  “The most important contributing factor to a drop comes
from a decline in personal consumption, which is a result of
rising unemployment and a decline in net wages,” Zdeslav Santic, the chief economist at Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d., said
by phone before the release.  Croatia stands to receive about 10 billion euros ($13
billion) in EU grants through 2020. The  government  on Feb. 20
reduced its 2013 growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.8
percent, citing low foreign investment. The European Commission
predicts the economy will contract 1 percent this year before
resuming growth in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
