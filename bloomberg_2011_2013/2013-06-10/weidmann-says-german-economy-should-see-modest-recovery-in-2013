Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the German economy has mostly overcome its phase of
weakness and should see moderate growth this year.  “A modest upward trend could now take hold,” Weidmann
said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. “Despite a few setbacks,
the brightening company expectations speak for that. The world
economy should in the course of the year also get back up to
speed.”  The Bundesbank last week cut its forecast for growth in
 Europe ’s largest economy this year to 0.3 percent from 0.4
percent predicted in December, citing a longer-than-expected
winter and the effects of a flare-up in the sovereign debt
crisis. Weidmann said  Germany ’s recovery relies to a large part
on an easing of the situation in Europe.  “Much will depend on whether the economic situation in the
crisis countries in the euro area stabilizes, and that the
growth-driving factors gradually win the upper hand,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
