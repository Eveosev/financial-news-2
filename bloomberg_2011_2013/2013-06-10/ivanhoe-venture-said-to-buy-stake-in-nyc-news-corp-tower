Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate
unit of  Canada ’s largest pension-fund manager, and a partner
agreed to buy a stake in 1211 Avenue of the Americas, a
 Manhattan  skyscraper that houses the headquarters of  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., a person with knowledge of the deal said.  Ivanhoe Cambridge teamed with Chicago-based Callahan
 Capital Partners  on the deal for the 49 percent stake, which
values the building at $1.75 billion, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the details are private. The 45-story
tower was acquired by a group led by Beacon Capital Partners
Inc. in 2006 for $1.52 billion, according to Real Capital
Analytics Inc., a New York-based research firm that tracks
commercial-property sales.  Recent deals for  midtown Manhattan  skyscrapers have
approached or exceeded  peak  levels reached in 2007, before the
credit crisis caused values to plummet. In the past two weeks,
buyers agreed to pay about $2,100 a square foot, a record, for
650 Madison Ave., and a 40 percent stake in the General Motors
Building was acquired at about $1,700 a square foot. RXR Realty
agreed to buy a 49 percent share of Worldwide Plaza for $660
million, more than its owners paid for the entire tower in 2009,
two people briefed on the deal said last week.  The deal for 1211 Avenue of the Americas was brokered by
Eastdil Secured LLC’s Doug Harmon and Adam Spies, who also led
the transactions for 650 Madison and Worldwide Plaza. Martha
Wallau, an Eastdil spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a
phone call seeking comment on the pending  News Corp. (NWSA)  building
transaction, which was reported earlier today on the website of
the Wall Street Journal.  Rockefeller Center  Alex McCallum, a spokesman for Boston-based Beacon Capital,
and Sebastien Theberge, an Ivanhoe Cambridge spokesman, declined
to comment. The company, based in  Montreal , is a unit of Caisse
de Depot et Placement du Quebec.  The 1.94 million-square-foot (180,000-square-meter) tower,
which sits diagonally across from Rockefeller Center, has about
$950 million of debt on it, the person with knowledge of the
deal said. In late 2011, Beacon pulled the property off the
market after bids came in below a targeted $1.9 billion, three
people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. A partial-interest sale was among alternatives the closely-held investment
fund was considering, those people said.  Ivanhoe Cambridge last week said it purchased Seattle’s
Wells Fargo Center for $390 million, and in November, it paid
more than $360 million for a 49.9 percent stake in 1411
Broadway, a 40-story  office tower  in Manhattan. In March it
bought 73 office buildings in  California ’s Silicon Valley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
