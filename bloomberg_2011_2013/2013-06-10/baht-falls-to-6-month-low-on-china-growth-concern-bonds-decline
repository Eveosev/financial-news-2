Thailand ’s baht dropped to a seven-month low and government bonds fell on concerns an economic
slowdown in  China  will hurt Asian exports.  China’s industrial  output  climbed 9.2 percent last month,
slowing from 9.3 percent in April, and factory-gate prices fell
for a 15th month, official data showed yesterday. The world’s
second-largest economy is Thailand’s biggest overseas market,
accounting for 12 percent of exports in the first four months of
2013. All of Asia’s major currencies slid after data on June 7
showed U.S. payrolls gained more than economists estimated in
May, fueling speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper debt
purchases that have boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  “Weak data out of China raises concerns about the region’s
exports as Asia’s economy depends a lot on sales to China,”
said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging markets  at
Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “There’s also
lingering speculation about the Fed. I expect downward pressure
on Asian currencies to continue for a while.”  The baht depreciated 0.5 percent to 30.79 per dollar as of
3:25 p.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.86 earlier, the weakest
level since Nov. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 6.77 percent.  China’s exports rose 1 percent in May after an increase of
14.7 percent the previous month, official data show. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain of 7.4 percent.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 175,000 in May, beating the
163,000 gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The  Federal Open
Market Committee  pledged last month to maintain the stimulus
until the labor market shows signs of sustained improvement.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 jumped
seven basis points to 3.70 percent, the highest level since
January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
