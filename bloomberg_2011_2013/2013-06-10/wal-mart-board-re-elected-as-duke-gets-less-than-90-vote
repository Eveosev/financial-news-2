Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Chief Executive
Officer  Mike Duke  and two other board members received less than
90 percent of shareholders’ votes at last week’s annual meeting
amid probes of allegations of bribery abroad.  Duke received 87.9 percent of votes for re-election,
Chairman Rob Walton got 89.9 percent and audit committee
Chairman  Chris Williams  got 87.8 percent, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based company said today in a statement.  Wal-Mart, along with the U.S. Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, is probing allegations that
executives in Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to
speed its expansion there and also is investigating operations
in Brazil, India and China. While the percentage of votes in
favor of Duke, Walton and Williams were higher than at the
previous annual meeting, all three had received 99 percent or
more of the vote before last year, when the bribery allegations
came to light.  Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co. and ISS had
recommended voting against some Wal-Mart directors, citing
concerns about the bribery allegations.  Wal-Mart also said today that four shareholder proposals,
including one to require an independent chairman and another to
require the company to disclose when it uses its clawback
provision, were defeated. The board had recommended voting
against all four.  Wal-Mart shares fell 0.2 percent to $76.18 at 9:57 a.m. in
 New York . The shares had gained 12 percent through June 7,
compared with a 16 percent gain for the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average. (INDU)   To contact the reporter on this story:
