Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, said Michael Gallagher will
help manage its European real estate securities as the firm
builds operations outside the U.S.  Gallagher, named a director and portfolio manager, will
help run the Prudential Global Real Estate Fund, the Newark, New
Jersey-based insurer said today in a statement. He joined the
company last year from  Aviva Plc (AV/)  as an associate portfolio
manager for European real estate securities. John Chartier, a
Prudential spokesman, declined to comment.  Prudential has been adding staff to bolster real estate
operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America. It managed about
$36 billion in net real estate assets as of Dec. 31, according
to the statement.  “Michael has extensive experience working for a number of
institutions in European real estate securities and knows that
market extremely well,” Marc Halle, managing director and
senior portfolio manager, said in a telephone interview. “There
are definitely opportunities in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
