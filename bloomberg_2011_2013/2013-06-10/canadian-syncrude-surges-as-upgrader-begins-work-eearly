Canadian synthetic oil surged on the
 spot market  to the highest level in almost nine months as an
oil-sands upgrader began maintenance earlier than expected.  The 350,000-barrel-a-day Syncrude  project  began a work on a
coker that had been scheduled for the second half of the year,
 Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the projectâ€™s largest owner, said in a
statement.  Syncrude, a light crude from oil-sands bitumen processed in
an upgrader, surged by $8.25 a barrel, the largest one-day jump
since March 14, 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The grade traded $11.75 a barrel above U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate oil as of 11:34 a.m.  New York  time, the biggest
premium since Sept. 19.  The maintenance has been moved up because there was reduced
output at the plant after a boiler was shut down for unplanned
repairs in May, the company said. The coker turnaround is
expected to last 50 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
