Yuan forwards in Hong Kong slid to a
two-month low as  China ’s manufacturing and trade data for May
trailed economists’ estimates and signaled weaker growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Industrial output  rose a less-than-forecast 9.2 percent
from a year earlier and factory-gate prices fell for a 15th
month, official data showed yesterday. The gain in production
compared with the 9.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 39 economists.  Exports (CNFREXPY)  were at a 10-month low.
Barclays cut China’s growth forecast for this year and the next
to 7.4 percent, from 7.9 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively,
according to a June 9 note. China’s markets are shut today
through June 12 for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.  “Data related to growth all disappointed,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB,
wrote in a note today. “We continue to expect modest fiscal
easing and no monetary easing, but there now is a small risk of
a rate cut. The  yuan  should come under downward pressure.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.22 percent
to 6.2740 per dollar as of 9:56 a.m. in Hong Kong, the lowest
level since April 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contracts were at a 2.2 percent  discount  to the spot rate in
Shanghai, which closed at 6.1335 on June 7. That’s the deepest
since March 2009. The offshore yuan fell 0.16 percent to 6.15
per dollar.  Cash Squeeze  The  offshore one-year swap  contract, which exchanges fixed
payments for the floating seven-day repurchase rate, halted an
eight-day advance today. The gauge fell one basis point to 3.53
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
China’s lenders charge each other on overnight loans  jumped  the
most in almost two years in  Shanghai  on June 7 as shrinking
capital inflows led to a cash squeeze before the three-day
holiday. The  seven-day repo fixing  rose 208 basis points to 6.88
percent in the week through June 9 in China.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.85
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
