Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the worldâ€™s largest
online retailer, is expanding its grocery and fresh-produce
delivery business to  Los Angeles .  The AmazonFresh service, available in Seattle since 2007,
will operate on a trial basis free to members of its Prime
service in several ZIP codes in the California city, according
to an e-mailed statement today.  Los Angeles Spotlight will hand-pick local businesses to
sell products through AmazonFresh, including fresh meat, cheese,
spices, produce, cupcakes and chocolates, as well as ready-to-eat meals, according to the statement. Current offerings include
fresh seafood from Santa Monica Seafood and aged cheese from The
Cheese Store of Beverly Hills.  Customers can order from more than 500,000 Amazon items for
same-day and early morning delivery, including fresh groceries
and local products, electronics and toys, according to the
statement. Orders placed by 10 a.m. will be delivered by
dinnertime, the Seattle-based company said. Orders made at 10
p.m. will be received by breakfast the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
