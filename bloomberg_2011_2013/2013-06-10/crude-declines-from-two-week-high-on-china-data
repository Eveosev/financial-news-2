West  Texas  Intermediate crude slid
from a two-week high after industrial production slowed in
 China , the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming country.  Prices fell 0.3 percent as Chinese output grew 9.2 percent
in May, compared with 9.3 percent in April, the National Bureau
of Statistics said yesterday. Futures, which gained 2.9 percent
in the previous three sessions, also decreased as production
resumed at the  North Sea ’s Buzzard oilfield. Gasoline demand was
at a 12-year seasonal low, according to a U.S. report.  “The Chinese economic news is bearish,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “With the run-up we had, people are
just feeling that maybe it’s a little too much given the
economic situation especially in China.”  WTI for July delivery slipped 26 cents to settle at $95.77
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all
futures traded was 6.5 percent below the 100-day average for the
time of day at 3:44 p.m. Prices advanced $1.27 to $96.03 a
barrel on June 7, the highest close since May 21.  Brent for July settlement dropped 61 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $103.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 9 percent below the 100-day average for the
time of day. Brent’s premium to WTI shrank 35 cents to $8.18,
the narrowest level since May 21.  Chinese Inventories  Chinese industrial output grew at a slower pace than the
9.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 39
economists.  China’s commercial crude inventories climbed to a three-month high of 28.68 million metric tons (210.2 million barrels)
in April, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data
released by the China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter,
published by the official Xinhua News Agency.  The country used 9.76 million barrels a day, or 11 percent,
of the world’s oil in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy. That made China the second-biggest user
of oil after the U.S.  The Buzzard field in the North Sea returned to
approximately full pumping rates of about 208,000 barrels a day
during the past two days after a halt June 6 because of an
equipment failure, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be identified.  Buzzard is the largest contributor to the Forties crude
grade, which sets the value of Dated Brent, the benchmark used
to price more than half of the world’s crude.  “There are a lot of supplies out there, and demand is
relatively subdued,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market
strategist and founder of commodities trading firm Iitrader.com
in  Chicago .  U.S. Supplies  U.S. crude  stockpiles  reached an 82-year high of 397.6
million barrels in the week ended May 24 before dropping 1.6
percent the following week, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
Production  climbed  to 7.3 million, the highest level since April
1992. Output jumped 19 percent in 2012.  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota ,  Oklahoma  and Texas.
The surge in output of oil and gas helped the U.S. meet 88
percent of its energy needs in February, the highest monthly
level since April 1986, EIA data show.  Shale Resources  Global resources of oil and gas from shale formations are
greater than previously estimated as more nations join efforts
to explore for deposits following a burst of production in the
U.S., the EIA said in an assessment of worldwide shale
resources, released today.  “This is not a  bull market ,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “We need to
see demand growth.”  Gasoline  demand  averaged 8.73 million a day in the four
weeks ended May 31, the lowest level for this time of the year
since 2001, EIA data showed.  Gasoline futures for July delivery declined 0.8 percent to
settle at $2.8481 a gallon. Futures dropped amid speculation
that Midwest supplies will increase as refineries return from
maintenance and as BP Plc completes work on the largest crude
unit at its Indiana refinery this month.  Oil also followed broad declines in commodities. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities dropped 0.7
percent, down for the first time in six days.  Bullish Bets  Money managers, including  hedge funds , commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, cut bets on rising WTI prices in the
seven days ended June 4, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Net-long positions dropped by 5,404 futures
and options combined, or 2.5 percent, to 212,127, the CFTC said
in its June 7 Commitments of Traders report.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 20.1 percent, compared with 20.9 percent on June 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 490,101
contracts as of 3:44 p.m. It totaled 871,598 contracts June 7,
45 percent higher than three-month average. Open interest was a
record 1.8 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
