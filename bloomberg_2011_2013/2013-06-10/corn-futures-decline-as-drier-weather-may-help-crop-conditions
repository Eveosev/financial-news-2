Corn fell the most in five weeks and
soybeans dropped on speculation that hot, dry weather in the
U.S. Midwest will improve crop prospects after heavy rains
delayed spring planting. Wheat also declined.  Rain missed the central Midwest over the weekend, allowing
fields to dry enough for farmers to speed seeding, Commodity
Weather Group said today in a report. About 91 percent of corn
and 57 percent of soybeans were  sown  in the main growing regions
as of June 2, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Hot
weather also will aid early plant growth, CWG said.  “The way the weather is shaping up, we’re going to get
some heat,” Jason Britt, the president of brokerage Central
States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri, said by
telephone. “It looks like yields that were diminishing are
going to stabilize, if not see some improvement.”  Corn futures for December delivery plunged 2.2 percent to
settle at $5.46 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since May 6. The price is down 22
percent this year.  Soybean futures for delivery in November, after the
harvest, fell 0.8 percent to $13.19 a bushel in  Chicago . The
July contract, which was the most-active contract through last
week, dropped 1.1 percent to $15.1175.  Wheat futures for delivery in July slid 0.9 percent to
$6.8975 a bushel, the fourth straight drop. The grain is down 11
percent in 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
