Palm oil  imports by  India , the
world’s largest buyer, probably jumped to the highest in three
months in May as local supplies fell amid expanding demand.  Purchases increased 9.3 percent to 750,000 metric tons last
month from 685,877 tons a year earlier, according to the median
of estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the most since 785,915 tons bought in
February, according to data from the  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India , which will release the data this week.
Total cooking oil imports, including for industrial use, gained
1.5 percent to 910,000 tons, the survey showed.  Palm oil rallied to a two-month high in Kuala Lumpur last
week on speculation that a pick up in demand for the commodity
used in everything from biofuels to noodles ahead of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan in July may help trim stockpiles in
 Malaysia . India’s imports may be sustained at about 725,000 tons
this month and next to meet festival demand, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based Sunvin Group.  “Local crushing of rapeseed and soybean has declined as
farmers are holding back the crops on expectation of higher
prices,” Ashok Sethia, executive director at Sethia Oils Ltd.,
said by phone from Kolkata. “This reduced oil supplies. In
April, imports were down, so that was compensated for in May.”  Palm oil shipments in April declined 5 percent, while total
cooking oil imports slumped 29 percent, according to data from
the extractors’ association. The decline cut inventories,
including those at ports and in the pipeline, to an estimated
1.4 million tons at the start of June from 1.8 million tons in
May, Sethia said.  Indonesia, Malaysia  India, the world’s biggest cooking oil consumer after
 China , meets more than half of its demand through imports. It
buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soybean oil from
the U.S.,  Brazil  and Argentina.  Palm oil for delivery in August ended 0.2 percent lower at
2,453 ringgit ($781) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
yesterday. Futures reached 2,471 ringgit on June 7, the highest
price since March 25.  “Palm oil imports will remain around 725,000 tons levels
in June and July each as traders stock up before the festival
season in August,” Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of
Mumbai-based Sunvin Group, said by phone. India’s festival
season runs from August to November.  Crude soybean oil  imports probably climbed to 70,000 tons
in May from 62,500 tons a year earlier, while  sunflower oil 
purchases may have declined 44 percent to 70,000 tons from
125,200 tons, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
