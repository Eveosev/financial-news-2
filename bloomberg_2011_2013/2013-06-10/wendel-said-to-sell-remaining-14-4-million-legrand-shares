Wendel (MF) , Franceâ€™s largest publicly
traded investment firm, is selling the remaining 14.4 million
shares it holds in  Legrand SA (LR) , the firm said yesterday.  Wendel offered the shares at between 35.90 euros apiece and
the market price, according to a person familiar with the
matter. At that price range, the company would raise at least
517 million euros ($614 million) at the low end.  Wendel is selling the shares in an accelerated bookbuild to
institutional investors, the company said in a statement.
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is managing the sale and acting as sole
bookrunner.  Legrand shares fell 0.4 percent to trade at 37.12 euros at
