Glenn Rufrano resigned as Cushman &
Wakefield’s chief executive officer after three years in the
position, and will be temporarily replaced by Carlo Barel di Sant’Albano, chairman of the real estate brokerage.  Rufrano will remain with the company for a transition
period, according to a statement today from New York-based
Cushman, the world’s largest closely held commercial-property
firm. He joined Cushman in February 2010 after being CEO of
 Centro Properties Group , which was then  Australia ’s second-biggest retail real estate investment trust.  The change was a “mutual, amicable departure,” with the
timing “fairly natural,” Sant’Albano said in a telephone
interview. “Both he and I and the board felt this actually was
a natural time for this change. It’s a good time for a new
leader to come on board and move us to the next phase.”  Cushman’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization grew to $128 million last year from $93 million in
2010, the company said. Rufrano made a “valuable contribution
in stabilizing the company following the recession,” John Elkann, chairman and CEO of  Exor SpA (EXO) , Cushman’s majority
shareholder, said in today’s statement.  Sant’Albano will serve as interim CEO role while remaining
chairman of Cushman and CEO of the company’s European, Middle
Eastern and African operations. He has been on the firm’s board
since 2007 and chairman since March 2011, and was previously at
Exor, where he helped with the acquisition of its majority stake
in Cushman six years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
