South African police are
investigating the murder of an employee of  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the
world’s third-biggest platinum producer, following the killing
of two other workers near its mines in the last month.  “The case is not linked to recently reported cases of
murder whereby labor union officials were involved, although the
victim is an employee of Lonmin,” Sabata Mokgwabone, a South
African Police Service spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.
The 32-year-old man was shot dead on the street next to a tavern
at Nkaneng shanty town, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of
Lonmin’s Marikana mine, he said.  At least one member each from the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union, the biggest representative
of lower-skilled employees at Lonmin, and its rival  National
Union of Mineworkers  have been killed in the Rustenburg area 116
kilometers northwest of Johannesburg in the last month. Lonmin
has upgraded security at its mines and on June 6 asked for
increased police presence around its Marikana operations to help
relieve tensions.  Violence has surrounded competition between the NUM, an
ally of the ruling  African National Congress , and the AMCU,
which is now the biggest representative of employees at the
world’s three biggest platinum companies, all of which have the
bulk of their operations in  South Africa . Unrest at Marikana in
August that stemmed from a pay dispute left at least 44 dead,
including 34 protesters shot by police in a single day.  “The victim was allegedly running behind his friends when
gun shots were heard, and it was later realized that he had been
shot several times,” Mokgwabone said. “Suspects in this case
are unknown, and no arrest has been made at this stage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
