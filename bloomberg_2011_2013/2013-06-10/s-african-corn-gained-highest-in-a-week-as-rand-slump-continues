South African white corn rose to the
highest level in more than one week as the rand continues to
drop, making imports of the grain more expensive.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
increased by 2 percent to 2,355 rand a metric ton, the highest
since May 31, by the midday close in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month gained 2.2 percent to
2,333 rand a ton.  The rand, which has fallen about 20 percent against the
dollar this year, declined for a second consecutive day as
China’s manufacturing and trade expanded less than estimated
last month. The nation is the biggest buyer of South African raw
materials, including  iron ore  and coal.  “The main reason for today’s high prices is the terrible
performance by the rand,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty)
Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food while yellow is
mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July rose 0.4 percent to close at
3,631 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
