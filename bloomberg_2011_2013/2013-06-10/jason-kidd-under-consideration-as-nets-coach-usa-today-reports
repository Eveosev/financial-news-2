Jason Kidd  is being considered for
the Brooklyn Nets’ coaching vacancy after ending his 19-year
National Basketball Association playing career, USA Today said,
citing an unidentified person with  knowledge  of the search.  Kidd, 40, retired from the NBA last week with the second-most assists and steals in league history. He spent 6 1/2 of his
seasons with the Nets from 2001-08, helping lead the team to the
NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.  In addition to Kidd, the Nets are considering Memphis
Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins and Indiana Pacers associate
coach Brian Shaw as candidates to replace interim coach P.J. Carlesimo, the  New York  Times said. Carlesimo took over when
 Avery Johnson  was fired in December following a 3-10 skid that
dropped the Nets’ record to 14-14.  “When you’ve played in the league as long as Jason has and
played for a number of coaches, he’s pretty much seen everything
that the NBA can offer,” Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich  said at a
news conference before Game 2 of the NBA Finals. “So he does
have experience. If he’s crazy enough to want to be a head coach
in the league, I wish him all the best.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
