The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
consider reviving a $185 million award won by  BG Group Plc (BG/)  in a
dispute with Argentina over that country’s 2002 cap on natural
gas prices.  The high court today said it will hear an appeal by the
U.K. oil and gas company of a federal appeals court decision
that threw out an arbitration award in BG’s favor.  The lower court said the arbitration panel in Washington
lacked power to take up the dispute. The appeals court pointed
to a U.K.-Argentine treaty that requires disputes to be
submitted to a court in Argentina for 18 months before
arbitration can begin.  In its Supreme Court appeal, BG argues that the arbitrator,
rather than the appeals court, should have been the one to
determine whether arbitration would go forward.  BG says the price freeze caused the bankruptcy of Metrogas
SA, an Argentine gas distributor it previously controlled. BG
says that, had it filed suit, it would have been punished under
Argentine law and excluded from negotiations designed to
mitigate the effects of the price cap.  The Obama administration urged the high court to reject the
BG appeal, saying the appeals court reached the right decision.  The court will hear arguments during the nine-month term
that starts in October. The case is BG Group v. Argentina,
12-138.  To contact the reporter on this story:
