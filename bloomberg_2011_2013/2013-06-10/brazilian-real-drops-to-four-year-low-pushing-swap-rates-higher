Brazil ’s real declined to its
weakest level in four years, adding to speculation that the
central bank will sustain the pace of increases in borrowing
costs to curb inflation.  The currency dropped for a fifth day, depreciating 0.9
percent to 2.1505 per  U.S. dollar  at 10:13 a.m. in Sao Paulo,
its weakest level on a closing basis since May 2009. Swap rates
on contracts due in January 2016 rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 9.86 percent, the highest since April 2012.  Policy makers will raise the target lending rate to 8.75
percent by the end of the year, according to the median forecast
of about 100 economists surveyed by the central bank. Last week
they predicted an increase to 8.50 percent.  “There is a fear that the government has agreed to allow
for higher  interest rates  in exchange for a weaker real to help
industry,” Flavio Serrano, the chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo de Investimento in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone
interview.  Inflation has prompted policy makers to boost the  target
lending rate  by 0.75 percentage point this year to 8 percent
after they lowered it by 5.25 percentage points in cuts that
began in August 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
