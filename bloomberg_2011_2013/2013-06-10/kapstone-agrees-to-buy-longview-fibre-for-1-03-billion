KapStone Paper and Packaging Corp. 
agreed to buy Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging Inc., a maker
of paper used for shipping containers, from a fund managed by
 Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  for $1.03 billion in cash.  The transaction will add to KapStone’s profitability
immediately, the Northbrook, Illinois-based company said in a
statement today. KapStone has committed financing from Bank of
America Corp., Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. for the deal,
which is expected to close this summer.  “This acquisition will increase our exposure to the highly
desirable containerboard segment,” KapStone Chief Executive
Officer Roger Stone said in the statement. “It also broadens
our Kraft paper line and makes KapStone a global producer of
high performance extensible multiwall paper, a grade which is
growing at about 4 percent per year.”  Longview, which operates a mill in Longview,  Washington ,
generated $831 million in net sales and $118 million of earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year,
according to the statement. In the first quarter of this year,
Longview’s net sales were $217 million, generating $42 million
of Ebitda, KapStone said in the statement.  KapStone rose 18 percent to $35.04 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
