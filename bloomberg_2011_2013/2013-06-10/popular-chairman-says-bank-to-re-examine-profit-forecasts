Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , a Spanish
lender, is reviewing the profit forecasts it gave in October to
back a 2.5 billion-euro ($3.3 billion) capital increase,
Chairman Angel Ron said.  “We are re-examining them and when we have reached a
conclusion we will communicate it in an opportune way,” Ron
told reporters in  Madrid  today after  the bank’s  annual
shareholders’ meeting, adding that economic forecasts for Spain
had worsened. “Everything is re-examined as conditions
evolve.”  Popular completed a share sale in November to help cover a
capital shortfall uncovered in stress tests of Spanish banks and
fund a clean-up of its balance sheet that produced a 2.46
billion-euro net loss for 2012. As part of a business plan
announced to justify the capital increase, the bank said it was
seeking profit of about 500 million euros this year and 1.4
billion euros in 2014.  Popular,  Spain ’s sixth biggest bank by assets, will decide
in the second half of this year whether to restore the  dividend 
it suspended in October, Ron told shareholders today.  The shares pared gains of as much as 2.1 percent and were
up 0.3 percent to 62.8 euro-cents at 3:55 p.m. in Madrid
trading. They have declined 93 percent since their peak in April
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
