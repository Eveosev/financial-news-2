Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude for a sixth week to the
highest level in more than three months, according to data from
ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 164,904 lots in
the week ended June 4, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The increase of 3,354
contracts, or 2.1 percent, brings net-longs to their highest
since Feb. 19.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 379,012 lots,
rising 5.6 percent from the previous week to the highest since
at least January 2011, the starting point for the data.  Brent fell 0.9 percent in the week to June 4 to $103.24,
and traded at $104.21 a barrel as of 12:12 p.m. London time.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 257,259 lots, up 6 percent from
a week earlier. That’s the highest since May 14.  Money managers extended  net-short bets  on European gasoil
to 8,365 lots, the biggest net-short position since May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
