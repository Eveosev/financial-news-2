U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said the government wants to take additional steps to boost
access to credit for small businesses that have faced “acute
challenges” getting funding since the global financial crisis.  “When credit-worthy companies cannot get capital, it is a
damper on  job creation  and economic growth,” Lew said in the
text of remarks at a conference today at the Treasury’s
headquarters in  Washington . “So we want to do more to knock
down barriers to financing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
