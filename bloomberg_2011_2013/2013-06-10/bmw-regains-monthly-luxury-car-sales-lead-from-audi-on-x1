Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
namesake brand regained the monthly sales crown from  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s  Audi (NSU)  division as the small X1 sport-utility vehicle and new
3-Series sedan won customers.  BMW’s global deliveries in May rose 7.8 percent from a year
earlier to 139,161 cars and SUVs, the Munich-based company said
in a statement today. Demand at Audi in May rose 6.4 percent to
137,200 units. Third-ranked  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz division
boosted sales 7.3 percent to 121,360 cars and SUVs.  Audi’s deliveries beat BMW’s in April as the three German
competitors pushed outside of  Europe  to escape the effects of
their home region’s sixth annual auto-market decline. In
contrast to capacity cutbacks at European volume carmakers, BMW,
Ingolstadt-based Audi and Stuttgart-based Mercedes are
maintaining production in July and August to meet demand from
abroad, rather than shutting plants for summer vacations.  “Exports of the German manufacturers to the U.S. and  China 
are generally still going well,” said  Juergen Pieper , a
Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. “The German
luxury carmakers are selling well over 50 percent outside
Europe, and they are faring better in Europe than their mass-market competitors.”  BMW rose as much as 0.8 percent to 72.80 euros and was
trading up 0.7 percent at 1:31 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock has
declined 0.6 percent this year, outpacing VW’s 2.5 percent fall.
Daimler shares have gained 19 percent since the beginning of the
year.  Competitors’ Goals  Audi and Mercedes have each outlined plans to overtake BMW
as the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars by the end of this
decade at the latest, and the VW unit also outsold BMW in
January. Five-month sales at BMW climbed 7.2 percent to 651,168
cars and SUVs. BMW sold 11,000 more vehicles than Audi in the
period, and 88,000 more than Mercedes.  X1 sales in May jumped 29 percent, while deliveries of the
3-Series, which was introduced in early 2012, increased 28
percent, BMW said. Group sales, including the Mini small-car
brand, increased 13 percent in Asia, propelled by gains of 16
percent in Japan and 15 percent in mainland China, it said.  “Our vehicle portfolio continues to be in strong demand
and once again our sales volume rose to an all-time high last
month,” said  Ian Robertson , head of sales and marketing, in a
statement today. “We expect further successful months ahead,”
helped by a 3-Series Gran Turismo version.  BMW will also introduce the 4-Series coupe, a derivative of
the mid-sized 3-Series, and launch a new generation of the
Spartanburg-built X5 SUV later this year.  China Growth  Audi can rely on gains in China, the brand’s biggest
national market. Deliveries in China were up 16 percent in May
and 14 percent in the first five months of the year.  Global deliveries through May increased 6.7 percent to
640,200 vehicles.  Mercedes five-month sales advanced 5.9 percent to 562,824
cars and SUVs. The manufacturer is counting on the revamped E-Class, the new CLA compact coupe and the new generation of the
high-end S-Class for a further sales improvement in the second
half of the year.  The success of luxury carmakers contrasts with mass-market
manufacturers hurt by weak European demand that is heading
toward a 20-year low as the sovereign debt crisis and government
austerity measures depress  consumer spending .  Ford Motor Co. (F)  is shutting a factory in Belgium and two
sites in the U.K. while  Peugeot (UG)  plans to eliminate 17 percent of
its French workforce by the end of 2014 and close a 2,500-employee assembly plant near Paris next year to trim excess
capacity.  Workers at a plant in Bochum, Germany, owned by  General
Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel unit, are holding a rally today to discuss the
company’s plans to close the factory by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
