Middle East  bond prices will
probably drop 3 percent to 4 percent in the second half of this
year on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut asset
purchases,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s  wealth unit said.  Yields on a typical five-year bond in the region will rise
50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points, to 75 basis points as
the Fed tapers its so-called quantitative easing program, Gary
Dugan, chief investment officer for  Asia  and the Middle East at
Coutts & Co. said at a news conference in Dubai today.  “One of the fears for the  bond market  is that just the
chatter around when the quantitative easing is going to come off
is going to be so disruptive that money is going to start to
disappear from the bond market,” Dugan said. “Even if they
don’t change quantitative easing you could see a selloff.”  U.S. policy makers led by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
trim the quantitative easing program to $65 billion a month at
the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee ,
from the current level of $85 billion, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Under the program,
the central bank buys Treasuries and mortgage securities in a
bid to push borrowing costs lower.  Middle East bonds have lost 1 percent so far this year,
which would be their first annual loss after four years of
gains, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai Middle East US Dollar
Sukuk/Bond Index. Bonds returned 12 percent last year, 7 percent
in 2011 and 11 percent in 2010, the data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
