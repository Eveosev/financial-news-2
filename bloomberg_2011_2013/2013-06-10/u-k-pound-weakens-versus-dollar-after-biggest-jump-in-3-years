U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
 10-year yields  to the highest level in three months, before the
nation sells 6 billion pounds ($9.32 billion) of the securities
at auctions this week starting tomorrow  Benchmark gilts declined for the third day, underperforming
their German and U.S. equivalents, as the prospect of additional
supply reduced demand for existing securities. The pound was
little changed against the dollar and euro before a government
report tomorrow that economists said will show Britain’s
manufacturing production contracted in April for the first time
in three months.  “Gilts are lagging both  U.S. Treasuries  and bunds,” said
Henry Skeoch, an inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Plc in
 London . “The 10-year sector is leading the market down ahead of
the auction of a new 2023 gilt tomorrow.”  The yield on the benchmark  10-year gilt  rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 4:26 p.m.
London time after climbing to 2.14 percent, the highest level
since Feb. 25. The 1.75 percent security due in September 2022
fell 0.5, or 5 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.825.  The U.K. will auction 3.75 billion pounds of a new
benchmark 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 tomorrow.
The nation last sold 10-year securities on April 9 at an average
yield of 1.734 percent. The government will sell 2.25 billion
pounds of gilts due in June 2032 on June 13.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened two basis
points to 54 basis points. The  spread  of Treasuries over gilts
narrowed three basis points to seven basis points.  Gilts Decline  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this year
through June 7, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 0.9 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined
1.3 percent.  The pound traded at $1.5557 after strengthening 2.4 percent
last week, the biggest gain since October 2009. It climbed to
$1.5684 on June 6, the highest level since Feb. 13. The U.K.
currency was little changed at 84.971 pence per euro.  “There might be some underlying caution about going full
steam ahead on sterling,” said  Simon Smith , chief economist at
FxPro Group Ltd. in London. “Last week was dominated by the
dollar and there weren’t very many independent winds behind the
pound. We might get a little bit of a reversal of what we saw
last week, keeping sterling off the highs it reached then.”  U.K.  manufacturing  output shrank 0.2 percent in April from
the previous month when it expanded 1.1 percent, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before the  Office for
National Statistics  releases the figures tomorrow. A separate
report will show  industrial production  stalled, after increasing
0.7 percent in March, another Bloomberg survey showed.  Sterling has appreciated 5.4 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.6 percent and the euro rose 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
