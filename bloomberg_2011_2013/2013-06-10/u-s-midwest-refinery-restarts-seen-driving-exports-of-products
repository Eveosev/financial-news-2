Increased production at oil
refineries in the U.S. Midwest may spur Gulf Coast fuel exports
and signal a rebound for tankers,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said.  Restarting of plants in the region will increase capacity
by more than 300,000 barrels a day, potentially boosting fuel
exports via the Gulf Coast, Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based
analyst at the bank, said in an e-mailed report today. He was
referring to PADD 2, one of five U.S. Energy Department
districts covering the nation.  Returns for Medium Range tankers that haul 315,000 barrels
of cargo each are in a “seasonal decline,” sliding 8 percent
from a week earlier to $12,000 a day, according to the report.
Still, the ships are earning 23 percent more than last year,
according to Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
