Singapore  bonds slumped, pushing 10-year yields to a 22-month high, after better-than-forecast U.S.
jobs growth kept alive speculation the Federal Reserve will cut
back on monetary stimulus.  The price of Singapore’s 3.125 percent note due in
September 2022 tumbled to S$110.42 as of 2:41 p.m. local time
from S$110.98 June 7, based on data compiled by Bloomberg and
supplied by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The yield rose
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.89 percent. It
was the highest level since Aug. 2, 2011, based on the  MAS data .  Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries have advanced for six
weeks, the longest stretch in four years. They climbed 10 basis
points on June 7 as the Labor Department reported U.S payrolls
swelled by 175,000 in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey was for 163,000. The unemployment rate rose to 7.6
percent from 7.5 percent.  “Singapore bonds slavishly track Treasury yield movements,
which is responsible for what’s happening today,” said Tim Condon, the head of Asia research at ING Groep NV in Singapore.
“The end-game is considerably higher 10-year Treasury note
 yields (USGG10YR) , and Friday’s numbers reinforce that this is happening.”  Treasury 10-year yields may climb to 2.50 percent in 2015
from 2.16 percent today, Condon said.  “If the 10-year yield in the U.S. is going up by about 30
basis points, then it’ll be 20 basis points on the Singapore 10-year,” Condon said.  The Singapore dollar fell 0.7 percent to S$1.2580, headed
for a second straight loss.  U.S. central bank policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will probably trim their so-called quantitative easing
program to $65 billion a month at the Oct. 29-30 meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee, from the current level of $85
billion, according to the median estimate in the survey of 59
economists last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
