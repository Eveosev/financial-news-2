On each trip, do an activity you've never done before. Doing something for the first time not only seals a destination in a child's memory but also leaves the child with a feeling of accomplishment that lasts long after the trip is over. Surfing in Hawaii, snuba diving (halfway between snorkeling and scuba) in Honduras,  zip-lining in St. Martin , climbing a castle in Spain, eating bugs in New Orleans (at its Insectarium), and, of course, riding camels in Egypt are all experiences that my kids remember vividly and have ended up writing school reports about.
