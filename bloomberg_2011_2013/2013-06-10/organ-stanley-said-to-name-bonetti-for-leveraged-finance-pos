Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, promoted Jim Bonetti to head its U.S.
leveraged finance syndicate team, two people briefed on the
decision said.  Bonetti will report to Dan Toscano, the New York-based
firm’s head of acquisition and leveraged finance, said the
people, who asked to remain anonymous because the promotion
hadn’t been made public.  Leveraged lending helps borrowers and buyout firms use
high-yield debt to support acquisitions, dividend deals and
refinancings. The technique has gained favor as investors search
for yield amid low  interest rates , with new-issue leveraged
loans jumping 59 percent this year through May 22. Morgan
Stanley ranks ninth in the field among underwriters, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syndicate desks sell off pieces of the loans to
institutional investors, or non-bank lenders, and help structure
collateralized loan obligations to spread risk.  Bonetti joined Morgan Stanley in 2005 after attending
 Harvard Business School  and previously working at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., according to employment records with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. He was named a managing director
at the firm this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
