The elimination of fuel subsidies in
 Ghana  will result in credit-positive fiscal savings,  Moody’s
analyst Edward Al-Hussainy said.  The assistance accounted for 4.15 percent of government
spending last year as the West African nation struggled to
narrow a budget gap that soared to 12.1 percent of gross
domestic product by the end of 2012 following a presidential
election, according to the e-mailed report.  Ghana’s national petroleum company raised fuel prices on
June 1, completing a fuel subsidy reform that began in February.
Gasoline prices have increased by more than 24 percent this
year, according to the report.  At the same time, Moody’s expects the budget deficit to
remain elevated at 10 percent of GDP this year due to high wage
and interest costs. The wage bill may reach 9 percent of GDP,
down from 9.3 percent in 2012, the report said. Interest
payments are forecast to rise to about 3.6 percent of GDP from
3.4 percent in 2012.  Finance Minister Seth Terkper said in an interview last
month the government wants to reduce the wage bill to between 30
percent and 35 percent of tax revenue by 2015. Salaries
accounted for 72 percent last year, according to budget data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
