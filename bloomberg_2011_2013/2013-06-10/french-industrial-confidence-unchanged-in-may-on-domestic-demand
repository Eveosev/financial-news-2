French industrial confidence was
unchanged in May as President  Francois Hollande  struggled to
revive growth in  Europe ’s second-largest economy.  An index of sentiment among factory managers was unchanged
at 94, while an index of service companies fell to 88 from 89,
the Bank of France said in an e-mailed statement. Economists
expected an increase in confidence among factory managers,
according to the median of five estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  The figures suggest gross domestic product in Europe’s
second-largest economy will expand 0.1 percent in the second
quarter, the Bank of France said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
