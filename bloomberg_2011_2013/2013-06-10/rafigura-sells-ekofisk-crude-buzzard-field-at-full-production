Trafigura Beheer BV sold a cargo of
North Sea Ekofisk crude at a smaller differential than the
previous offer. Total SA, BP Plc and Trafigura all failed to
sell Forties.  The Buzzard oil field returned to full production over the
past two days, according to two people with direct knowledge of
the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information is
confidential.  North Sea  Total bought Ekofisk cargo C11387 for loading June 24 to
June 26 at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That compares with an offer on June 5 at a $1
premium.  Total offered Forties crude at 35 cents less than Dated
Brent for loading June 23 to June 25 without finding a buyer,
the survey showed. That’s the lowest since May 13, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trafigura was unsuccessful with its offer at plus 15 cents
while BP failed to sell Forties at 10 cents less than the
benchmark and Ekofisk at 95 cents more than Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 1 cent to 4 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $104.08 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $104.36 in the previous session. The August contract was at
$104.02 at the same time today, a discount of 6 cents to July.  Norne crude exports for July are set to be three cargoes of
600,000 barrels each, Njord loadings are comprised of one lot of
320,000 barrels and another of 500,000 and shipments of Heidrun
blend will total two 600,000-barrel lots and one of 750,000,
according to three separate loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea oil exports to South Korea are “likely to be
maintained at around half the 110,000 barrel a day level seen
during the whole of 2012,” Vienna-based analysts JBC Energy
GmbH said today in a report.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total bid unsuccessfully for 80,000 metric tons of Urals
for June 26 to June 30 loading at 70 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta in  Italy , the survey
showed. That compares with a June 6 trade at minus 35 cents.  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 27 cents to a discount
of 77 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the widest since April 4,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. In northwest Europe, the
 discount  was 54 cents to the benchmark, versus minus 15 cents in
the previous session. That’s the lowest since May 17.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 1 cent to a
premium of $2.20 a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
