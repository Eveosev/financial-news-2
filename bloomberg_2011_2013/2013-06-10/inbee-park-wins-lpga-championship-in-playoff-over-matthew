Inbee Park of  South Korea  solidified
her hold on the No. 1 ranking in women’s golf for a ninth
straight week with a playoff win at the LPGA Championship, her
second major tournament title and fourth victory overall this
season.  Park, 24, won with a birdie on the third hole of her
sudden-death playoff with Catriona Matthew of  Scotland  yesterday
at Locust Hill Country Club in Pittsford,  New York .  Park has won four titles in 10 LPGA Tour starts this
season. She also won the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the first
of the LPGA Tour’s five major titles, in April and received
$337,500 for her latest victory.  “I just love playing in major championships,” said Park,
who in 2008 won the U.S. Women’s Open and last year won the
Evian Masters, which this year was added as a fifth major.  Park and Matthew finished the four-round tournament tied at
5-under-par 283, one shot better than Suzann Pettersen of  Norway 
and American Morgan Pressel. Park shot a 3-over 75 during the
final round while Matthew had a bogey-free 68.  “I was actually really lucky to get in the playoff,” Park
said at a news conference. “The amount of fairways I was
missing today it’s almost a miracle that I won. I think I got a
little lucky there, too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
