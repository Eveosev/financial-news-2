Deloitte LLP purchased McColl
Partners LLC, the investment bank founded by former  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl,
to boost the buyer’s middle-market mergers advisory unit.  About 70 employees will join Deloitte, the company said
today in a  statement , and McColl will be retained as an adviser.
He founded his Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm in 2001
after leaving Bank of America, which has its headquarters in the
same city. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  McColl transformed Bank of America’s predecessor from a
regional bank into one of the biggest in the country. His
largest deal came in 1998 when San Francisco-based BankAmerica
Corp. joined with NationsBank. Bank of America is now the
second-biggest U.S. bank by  assets , after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
