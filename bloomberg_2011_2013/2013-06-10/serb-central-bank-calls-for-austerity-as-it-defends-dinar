Serbia ’s  central bank,  which sold
euros today to prop up the slumping dinar, urged the government
to adopt an austerity program quickly to narrow the budget gap
and regain the confidence of investors.  Cost savings are “essential” after the  International
Monetary Fund  warned last month the Balkan nation’s deficit will
account for 8 percent of gross domestic product this year unless
it implements measures, central bank Governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic told reporters in Belgrade. The bank sold 10 million
euros ($13.2 million) today to slow dinar drop, intervening for
eighth consecutive session, she said.  The state should target “subsidies that have been around
for too long without visible effect” and avoid cuts in public
wages and pensions that would affect trade, Tabakovic said.
“The government must be ready to undertake difficult
measures,” including an end to state financing of unprofitable
public companies, she said.  Serbia aims to cut spending by about $1.3 billion to bring
this year’s shortfall to 4.6 percent of GDP, Finance and Economy
Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said on June 7, after  Standard & Poor’s 
said the country may face a downgrade without spending cuts.  Signals about a potential downgrade made some investors
exit Serbian securities and “it’s very easy to affect the dinar
because the market is shallow,” said Tabakovic, who is a member
of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party.  The dinar traded at 114.69 per euro at 4:03 p.m. in
Belgrade after falling to 114.74, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
