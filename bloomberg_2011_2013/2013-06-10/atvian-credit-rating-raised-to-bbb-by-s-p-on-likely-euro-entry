Latvia ’s credit rating was raised
one level by  Standard & Poor’s  after the Baltic nation moved
closer to adopting the euro following a positive convergence
report from the European Commission last week.  S&P increased Latvia’s long-term government bond rating to
BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade, on par with Ireland and
Kazakhstan. The ratings company lowered the outlook to stable
from positive.  The nation of 2.1 million won European Union endorsement on
June 5 to switch to the euro in 2014, with a final decision by
European finance ministers due on July 9. Latvia, the EU’s
fastest-growing economy last year, would become the 18th member
of the currency bloc and the second former Soviet republic to
adopt the euro following Estonia’s entry in 2011.  “Euro-zone membership would have a positive impact on the
government’s creditworthiness by mitigating foreign-exchange
risks and providing the Latvian banking system with access to
the  European Central Bank  as a lender of last resort and general
provider of liquidity,” S&P said in an e-mailed statement from
 London . “Converting the lat to euro would eliminate the
currency mismatch that exists in the Latvian banking system --
most lending is already in euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
