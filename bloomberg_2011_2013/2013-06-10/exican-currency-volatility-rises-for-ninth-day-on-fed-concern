Mexican peso volatility climbed for
a ninth day on concern the  Federal Reserve  will curtail a
stimulus program that has buoyed emerging-market assets.  Three-month historical volatility, a measure of the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations during the period, rose to
an eight-month high of 10.42 percent at 10:12 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
slumped 0.9 percent today, erasing its rally for 2013.  Demand for Mexican local-currency assets has fallen as
better-than-forecast U.S. economic data fueled speculation that
the Fed will scale back unprecedented asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing or QE.  “If the U.S. really tapers off QE, the peso is going to be
hit,”   Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America economist
at 4Cast, said in a telephone interview. “So everybody says,
‘I’d better cover my back.’ And that’s why the peso is weak.”  Futures traders  cut net bets on a peso advance against the
dollar to 82,871 last week, the lowest since August 2012, data
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on June 7.  The yields on benchmark government peso bonds maturing in
2024 climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
5.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
fell 0.51 centavo to 138.88 centavos per peso.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year Mexican
peso bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose today toward a four-month high reached on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
