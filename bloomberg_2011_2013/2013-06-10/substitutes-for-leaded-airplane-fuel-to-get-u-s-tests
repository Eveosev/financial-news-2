Aviation regulators will begin
testing, as soon as next year, unleaded substitutes for aviation
gasoline that remains the largest source of U.S. airborne lead.  The Federal Aviation Administration invited fuel
manufacturers to submit proposals for unleaded formulations, it
said in a statement  posted  on its website today. The agency
pledged last year to find a replacement by 2018 for leaded
aviation gasoline, which has been linked in health studies to
elevated levels of the toxic metal in children who live near
general-aviation airports.  “We need to work with industry to develop an unleaded fuel
that advances aviation safety and improves the environment,”
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in the statement.  Lead was banned 17 years ago in gasoline for motor vehicles
because of its health risks. It remains in the high-octane fuel
that powers most piston-engine airplanes used by private pilots,
and accounted for 56.9 percent of U.S. lead emissions in 2008,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Friends of the Earth, an environmental group based in San
Francisco and  Washington , filed suit last year seeking to force
the U.S. government to regulate leaded fuel.  Since 2003  The agency, while deserving praise for moving ahead, could
do more to encourage pilots to use existing unleaded aviation
fuels, Marcie Keever, the group’s West Coast legal director,
said in an interview.  “Any unleaded fuel should be encouraged,” Keever said.
More than 80 percent of piston-powered planes can use high-octane automotive gasoline, she said. The group has been pushing
the EPA, which shares regulation over aviation fuel with the
FAA, to act since 2003.  The FAA said fuel producers can submit possible replacement
fuels to the agency by July 1, 2014. The agency will then test
as many as 10 fuels, according to the release. President  Barack Obama ’s proposed 2014 budget includes $5.6 million for the
testing.  The General Aviation Avgas Coalition, which represents
fuel- and aviation-industry groups, said it approved of the FAA
decision. The coalition’s comments were released by one of its
members, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a
Washington-based trade group.  Finding a substitute fuel may require design changes and
recertification of some high-performance planes, the group said
in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
