“Motown,” an audience favorite that didn’t win any Tony Awards, and “Kinky Boots,” which snapped up six, including for best musical and for Cyndi Lauper’s pop score, had their bestselling week at the Broadway box office.  In the seven days ending on Sunday, Tony night, each sold $1.4 million, according to the trade association the Broadway League. “Kinky Boots” forecasts it will add about $1 million to its advance sale today, spokesman Rick Miramontez said.  Miramontez didn’t disclose the total “Kinky” advance.  Sales for “Matilda,” an acclaimed British import beaten by “Kinky Boots” for top musical, declined 2 percent to $1.1 million. A production spokesman, Jackie Green, said Monday that its $21 million advance saw a “bump from last night” after cast members performed early in the CBS telecast.  All three shows are playing to capacity. The average ticket price is $99 for “Matilda,” $115 for “Motown” and $123 for “Kinky Boots.”  A revival of “Annie,” with  Jane Lynch  from television’s “Glee” as Miss Hannigan, had its best week in two months, not counting Memorial Day weekend. Sales rose 12 percent to $893,000.  “Pippin,” which won four Tonys, including for musical revival and its director, Diane Paulus, saw sales jump 5 percent to $931,000. Likewise, “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” rose 5 percent to $553,000.  Julie White replaces  Sigourney Weaver  in the role of Masha on July 30. The comedy is by Christopher Durang, whom Tony host Neil Patrick Harris, in a reference to Broadway embracing the 1980s, called “Durang Durang.”  Muse highlights include  Scott Reyburn  on the art market and  Philip Boroff  on Broadway box office.
