The European Financial Stability
Facility must be operational as soon as possible in order to
complete the reform of European governance,  Bank of Italy 
Director General Fabrizio Saccomanni said.  A “strong reaction from the European Union would have a
soothing effect on the markets at a global level,” Saccomanni
said, according to the e-mailed text of a speech to be delivered
at about 9:30 p.m. at Milan’s Bocconi University. “We must be
aware that we can escape the crisis, if we want.”  European policy makers are debating how to magnify the
firepower of the EFSF,  Europe ’s rescue fund. While one route
would be for the facility to operate like a bank and borrow from
the  European Central Bank , using bonds it purchases as
collateral, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said yesterday
that leverage wasn’t appropriate.  “Government authorities and the central banks of the main
countries must use all the instruments available,” Saccomanni
said, adding that the market’s reaction to signs of weaknesses
and incoherence can be “quick and drastic.”  Saccomanni is one of the leading candidates to replace
 Mario Draghi  as the head of the Bank of Italy. Draghi will take
over from Trichet as ECB president on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
