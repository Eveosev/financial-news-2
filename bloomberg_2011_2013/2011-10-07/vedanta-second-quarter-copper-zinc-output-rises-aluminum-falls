Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the largest
copper producer in  India , said fiscal second-quarter output at
its Tuticorin smelter advanced 28 percent while aluminum
production fell.  Tuticorin’s copper-cathode output jumped to 87,000 metric
tons in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 68,000 tons a year
earlier, London-based Vedanta said today in a statement. Mined
zinc metal production rose 2 percent to 210,000 tons, while
aluminum output dropped 8 percent to 149,000 tons.  Vedanta, seeking to expand into the oil and gas industry,
is in the final stages of purchasing a majority stake in Cairn
India Ltd., which will give it access to India’s biggest onshore
oil deposit. Cairn India shareholders and Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., its oilfield partner, have approved Vedanta’s
acquisition, the company said.  “With deal closure, envisaged by the end of the month,
Vedanta will reach a key landmark in delivering transformational
earnings to drive rapid deleveraging,” Liberum Capital Ltd.
said today in a note.  Vedanta advanced 47 pence, or 4.2 percent, to 1,160 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the highest in a week.  Iron-ore production declined 61 percent to 1.12 million
tons in the quarter after India’s Karnataka state imposed an
export ban to curb price increases for local steel producers.
Vedanta’s sales of the steelmaking material shrank to 1.55
million tons from 1.82 million tons, it said.  Production of copper cathode in Zambia declined 10 percent
to 52,000 tons, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
