Germany  should seek a collateral deal
modeled on the Finnish agreement in exchange for aid to debt-
strapped Greece, junior lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition parties told  Bild  newspaper.  If Greece doesn’t sell government property, pledging it as
collateral for guarantees should be considered, Oliver Luksic, a
member of parliament for Merkel’s Free Democratic Party
coalition partner, was quoted as saying. The government should
“definitely” check whether it is possible to demand collateral
from Greece, Christian Hirte, a lawmaker from Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union , told Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
