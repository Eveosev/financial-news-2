 Fitch Ratings downgraded today Anglo
Irish Mortgage Bank’s outstanding 2.2 billion euro mortgage
covered securities to ‘BBB’ from ’BBB+’.  The agency has also maintained the outstanding covered
bonds on Rating Watch Negative.  “The downgrade is driven mainly by a review of the
decreased likelihood of refinancing a pool of Irish commercial
mortgage loans and UK commercial mortgage loans,” Fitch said in
statement. “The agency believes, in a stressed market, Irish
and non-standard UK commercial assets will have limited
refinancing options.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
