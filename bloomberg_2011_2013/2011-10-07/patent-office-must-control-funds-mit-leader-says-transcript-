Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
President Susan Hockfield said during a panel discussion in
Washington that Congress must keep its pledge to let U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office, or PTO, have control over all the fees it
collects to promote innovation and spur  job creation . The Oct. 5
event, sponsored by  Harvard University  and the  Business
Roundtable  and hosted by Bloomberg News, centered on ways to
spur innovation.  Participants included Drew Gilpin Faust, president of
Harvard University; former Michigan Governor John Engler,
president of the Business Roundtable; Albert R. Hunt, an
executive editor at Bloomberg; Bill Green, chairman of
consulting firm Accenture Plc; Tim Solso, CEO of diesel truck-
engine maker Cummins Inc.; Susan Hockfield, president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Sally Mason, president of
the University of Iowa, Ellen Kullman, CEO of DuPont Co.; James
Goodnight, CEO of SAS Institute Inc.; Freeman Hrabowski,
president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; John
Hennessy, president of  Stanford University ; Linda Katehi,
chancellor of the University of California-Davis; John
Lechleiter, CEO of drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co., and Teresa
Sullivan, president of the  University of Virginia . Following is
a transcript of the session on patents, moderated by Susan
Goldberg, an executive editor at Bloomberg.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  SUSAN GOLDBERG: I’d love to get started on the third leg of
this stool. It’s been a fascinating discussion so far and I hope
everybody’s still up to talk about more.  So we’ve talked a little bit about getting the right people
to help with innovation. We’ve talked about investing in the
tools. Now, I’d like to take a step back from that and talk
about the ideas that are going to bring on jobs in the first
place.  This morning, Dave Kappos from the Patent Office talked
about the new law and how he felt it put the  United States 
clearly in the forefront of innovation and that we had
leapfrogged over other countries and that we were the only
country with the 21st Century patent law.  Although the law was passed with overwhelming support and
we were talking, John, earlier about how it’s one of the few
areas where there did seem to be a lot of agreement at least in
the political community.  I know in the VC community, the law did stir up quite a bit
of debate. So I wanted to ask John Hennessy to start with, you
know, coming from the land of startups in the garage and the
ethos of individual entrepreneurs, is the change from first to
invent to first to file, could that possibly hurt individual
inventors?  What do you think about that?  JOHN HENNESSY: You know, I think on the margin you could
see some individuals who might claim they’d be hurt by that, but
I think the important thing about patent reform was the overall
advantage that it brought to the entire community.  It was -- it was a great example of working together, the
I.T. industry, working with pharma, working with the
universities to get everybody on the same page.  Everybody made
some compromises in this process.  Nobody got the bill that was
perfectly ideal for them, right?  Some people wanted prior-user rights, some people didn’t.
The universities were concerned about first to file versus first
to invent -  GOLDBERG: Right.  HENNESSY: but we all said in the end that this is an
important bill for economic growth in the country. Aren’t there
places we can all give a little in terms of making a big step
forward and undoing 30 years of deadlock around patent reform?  So that’s a great accomplishment and that’s how we should
be thinking about our other challenges whether it’s the
country’s federal R & D investment or Visa reform or things like
that.  How do we get something that really works.  GOLDBERG: Yes, please, Susan.  SUSAN HOCKFIELD: So I agree with John and John and I had
many conversations about what kind of compromises the
universities were willing to make in order to, you know, get
this new patent legislation done.  And I think it could be an advance, but it will only be
advance if there is funding that comes with it. And so one of
the great impediments to an effective PTO is the funding to just
get the people power in place to move stuff through the system.
We have had a massive acceleration in the amount of work we send
to these people and, you know, they are just tied up in knots,
you know, trying to develop the systems to make the processing
of these patents and, you know, other things that come through
the office efficient.  And so, you know, I just can’t strongly enough, you know,
say, “Got to get the funding (inaudible). Get the funding in
place.” Reliably and consistently, this is the message of this
morning is, you know, things have to be reliable, they have to
be consistent so that the Patent and Trademark Office can, you
know, really accelerate and hopefully, at least, catch up with
if not leapfrogging these activities in other countries.  GOLDBERG:  Well, Jim, do you agree with that?  JAMES GOODNIGHT: Well, the funding, I think, has been taken
care of by the new Patent Act because they are now are going to
allow the Patent Office to keep all the money -  GOLDBERG: Maybe.  GOODNIGHT: that they charge for patents. Well, they claim
it’s some kind of a lockbox, but I don’t know how that -- I
don’t know how that really works.  (CROSSTALK)  GOODNIGHT: But as it -- as it was for many years, the
Patent Office only got, like, $300 a patent even though they
were collecting $1,500 to spend and they sure had produced a lot
of garbage patents in the past few years. And it just -- and
just about anything that would go through there would be stamped
and patented and it was up to corporations like us to have to
defend our prior art that we had already in place.  GOLDBERG: Well, actually, that raises one of the good
questions. A lot of people thought that this new  patent law  did
a lot on the -- on the front end, you know, changing the system
of filing and cleaning up that, but not that much on the back
end to deal with these lawsuits and litigation.  What do you all think about that? Is that -- is that really
hurting this process?  GOODNIGHT: Well, actually, the joinder reform was
absolutely incredible for us. This prevents a patent troll from
just simply filing a lawsuit against a half a dozen companies
and thereby being able to hold that to trial in East Texas.  What the -- what the joinder reform actually gave us was it
prevents someone who’s bringing a patent suit from filing a --
they can only file against one company.  And under -- and that’s
very important because under current rules of the court system,
that case has to be brought where all the evidence is.  So in other words, it has to be brought in the home state
of the corporation.  So now, we don’t have to send people down
to live in East Texas anymore. We can keep them right there in
 North Carolina . So -  HENNESSY: I think the other big thing to deal with Jim’s
junk patent problem is the post-grant review. That’s a big step
forward in terms of a way in which people can respond quickly to
patents where they simply -- where the Patent Review Office
simply didn’t know about prior art in some cases.  HENNESSY: No, I think that helps a lot. But Susan’s exactly
right. We need to get the money. I mean, the backlog is over
600,000 applications. Now, not all those patents were grant, but
that’s three years worth of patents just to put it in
perspective.  So we’ve got to invest in order to make this process work
faster and that’s an American competitiveness issue for us.  GOLDBERG: Go ahead, Freeman.  FREEMAN HRABOWSKI: Just a comment. It’s clear that when you
look at the different aspects of a reform that you heard that
the results reflected thinking of a lot of people across sectors
which is a lesson, I think, we can use in some other areas we’ve
been talking about today that if you want to get to a good
solution, it has to have some compromise and it has yet to
reflect the thinking of the broader groups involved.  And I think in each of these areas, we can see where the
hand of a number of people can be seen in a way that makes it
palatable to most of us.  JOHN LECHLEITER: The -- another feature, I think, of the
America Invents Act is that it’s partner friendly and Dave
Kappos mentioned that briefly this morning when he said this is
really a 21st Century patent bill.  The comment was made earlier that more and more of us are
doing our research and much of our work through partnerships and
the new patent legislation does not penalize partnerships by an
essence of blocking one party from filing a patent based on what
some in the past might’ve considered to be prior art on the part
of the other -- the other partner.  So I think this is a -- this is a big step forward.  I
think for every one thing you can find that where you have
questions or there might be concerns still left about some
provision of this legislation, there’s nine things to -- that we
can be happier are in there -- it’s a big step forward and I
agree, we need to look at this and say, “How did that happen?”
I can tell you because we were very involved in this from our
industry perspective.  A year ago, no one would’ve given this
thing a chance of getting through.  In this environment, man, six months ago, people -- no one
would’ve said that, but it -- but it -- why did that -- how did
that happen? Why did that happen? And I maintain part of the
reason is because there was an active coalition, there were
multiple coalitions, universities, the high-tech companies,
biotech and we got down at the -- in -- and sat down at the
table, Dave Kappos, the commerce secretary, former Secretary
Locke was involved and we worked this stuff out because we
recognize it’s in our mutual interest to do that and are there
analogies we can carry over from that?  GOLDBERG: Well, this morning we were talking about
immigration and whether I wonder if there isn’t a coalition that
could come together like that. I don’t know. John, what do you
think?  HENNESSY: Well, I think there’s a possibility. The one
thing that I think is interesting is that by in large the
agreeing got done among the groups and Senator Leahy and others,
then it accepted that. They went forward. I mean, it’s the old
you all go outside their door here and work it out and come back
when you’ve got an agreement kind of approach, almost that got
used.  And there was -- there was little left for the -- I mean,
committee and interestingly, when we got down to the -- to the
final votes, the deal was not on the content. It was on the
funding process of this, what I thought was -- we were
whispering up here earlier and I thought the -- some in the
Congress and some good friends who were saying, “Well, we need
this, to go through the appropriation process for this
oversight.”  I said, “This is the same oversight from the same budget
process you’re so critical of where we never pass a budget.
That’s when we’re going to do the oversight?” I mean, come on.  And the reality is, I think, where we came out, I do think
we have to follow-up to make sure the funding does flow, but
it’s -- but the argument and the equity where the funding does
flow is pretty compelling.  It comes from the applicants and
they all said, “Hey, we’ll pay it in order to get the
process.”  And Commerce, to their credit, at least the acting
secretary, Becky Blank, was saying that, you know -- and  Gary
Locke  was -- when he was still here was also saying, “We want
to get to the point we can say that it’s going to be from when
you file one year.”  That’s where they think they can -- that’s
where they think they can be there.  So -- and we ought to -- we ought to be encouraging that
and probably the coalition remnants of that be kept together to
kind of -- every year kind of maybe sit down and have an
evaluation of how well we’re doing and bright spots and areas
for improvement and keep the pressure on.  GOLDBERG: You know, one of the themes I keep hearing from
this morning is this notion of the competitive threat from
overseas and elsewhere.  How is this new law going to help with
that?  Do people think it will be helpful or do - what other steps
need to be taken?  I know there’s some discussion about having a
global - a global patent system sort of like the global
trademark system.  Is that the kind of thing that’s needed to really change
the landscape?  GOODNIGHT: Well, in 2009, I’ve got (inaudible) data back
then, there were actually more U.S. patent (inaudible) by people
outside the United States (inaudible).  GOLDBERG:  And that has remained true in 2010 as well?  GOODNIGHT:  So - I don’t think the particular laws has any
effect on them, but that’s the RND that’s being done overseas
where the town is. So -  ELLEN KULLMAN: I think it’s a good first step at
harmonizing the laws between us and other countries.  I think
there are further steps that can be taken because so often it’s
- we’re duplicating resources to get these same patents through
the different systems and the different countries.  And so I think more coordination there, but I think it’s a
great first step.  And, you know, we’ve been waiting for this
for a long time and I think to John’s point, the benefits of
getting this through now and really dealing with the funding
issues, dealing with the low-quality patents issues in a  - in a
real firm way that we can get that, you know, on the table, you
know?  For the process changes that are being made just are a
tremendous step in, you know, modernizing our system and making
us more competitive in the long run.  LECHLEITER: I think, Susan, it - I think we better be
careful. I mean, we’re - we’ve declared victory around America
Invents, but I think for all of us who run multinational
companies, universities that have an international view of
things, there’s still a lot of work to be done.  I think greater harmonization would be great, but I think
just basic enforcement are concerns for many of us. And is our
intellectual property, you know, being respected where we
believe we have valid patents outside the United States and do
trade agreements, for example, that are being constantly worked
on, do they reflect in those trade agreements this country’s
position on the importance of respecting intellectual property
rights.  I know for many of us who operate in  China , for example,
intellectual property protection is a significant, important
issue.  I think it’s recognized by the government, but I think
enforcement tends to be - tends to be spotty.  And then when you get to the absolute 180-degree opps of
intellectual property protection is counterfeiting and, you
know, that’s the ultimate disrespect for intellectual property
whether that’s software, whether that’s medicines.  It’s a huge,
huge global industry, if I can call it an industry, a threat and
a - and a - and a real problem that also needs to be dealt with.  So I think that, you know, I.P. more and more is going to
constitute the essence of economic growth whether it’s for us or
China and I think we need to use America Invents as sort of an
anchor point, a set point to say, OK. We think this does
represent what we believe is in the best interest of commerce,
if you want to put it like that, how do we build out from there,
but we can’t ignore these other issues.  GOLDBERG: Yes, Susan.  HOCKFIELD: (Inaudible) I can get back to your good question
of can we use this process that was used for patent reform to
other issues and, you know, bringing together what in previous
years would’ve looked like a very heterogeneous coalition around
this particular issue, I think, is a demonstration of just how
integrated the innovation system is right now and needs to be
even more so.  You know, in terms of, you know, coalitions, we talked
about immigration but frankly coalition around research funding.
Federal funding for, you know, the seedlings of our innovation
enterprise is really important.  It was an industry academy coalition that advanced America
Competes that really, you know, brought that into being whether
that will be funded at the level that the legislation requires
we will - we will see, but I think that when, you know - I had
my university colleagues go to  Capitol Hill  to advocate for what
we think are some policies for the long-term vitality of the
United States and that is research funding. It appears as though
we’re arguing for our own selfish best interests.  And, you know, I like to see research happening at MIT.
It’s true. It’s why people come to MIT and I like to be sure
that they are funded in a way that they can, you know, make the
most out of their own talents and our resources.  However, the presence of industry in that discussion is
absolutely critical and it has been critical in the past. I know
that, you know, when I go to - go to Capitol Hill, I’ve got a
list of stuff that, you know, I think is important in, you know,
each of the industry because when you go to visit Capitol Hill,
you also have a list and my guess is that funding for basic
research might not be at the very top and you might get, like,
fourth or fifth.  But I think building the kind of coalition that has been so
effective, in fact, and in the past in advancing these, you
know, policies that are just - make good sense for the nation in
the long-term is really important.  So I would encourage this group to think about coming
together around the defense of research budgets because - some -
one more little thing, you know?  If you look at our research
investments over time, the peak in the nation was in the mid-
1960s in the midst of the race to the moon, but then, you know,
over time, what’s happened is to your point Jim, you know,  Corporations have actually accelerated their investments in
R&D and the federal government has backed off, represented as
percent of GDP, but what that means is that we are, you know,
short-changing the future in exchange for funding the near - the
near future or the - or the present.  And so it’s good for everybody, obviously, if federal funds
are dependable and sufficient to make sure that the early
research enterprise is robust and is furnishing those really
good starter ideas that become the great products that the
companies put into attention.  GOLDBERG: And then the jobs which is (inaudible).  HOCKFIELD: And the jobs that, yes, they come with that.  GOLDBERG: And Freeman, you had wanted to say something
about that.  HRABOWSKI: (Inaudible) telling the stories, documenting the
stories, we have a program funded by NSF to create a cadre of
women entrepreneurs.  You’re looking up and down the
Baltimore/ Washington  (inaudible) and certain kinds of technology
comes, you just don’t see many women CEOs.  And we’ve actually educated about 80 in recent years using
technologies out of NIH, these are women with backgrounds in
entrepreneurship, giving them the business deals, focusing on
technology.  And I bring it up because as we’ve gone to tell the story
in different places to be able to show the impact of some of the
companies that these women are now CEOs of coming out of the
technologies out of NIH makes the point to everybody and all of
a sudden people are thinking about the university, they’re
thinking about the national agencies, they’re thinking about
other companies that help these companies get started and then
the impact on people.  That’s the point.  And the final point is what does all this mean to the
American public and how can we see how starting these companies
and having these range of people involved can lead to something
that’s better for the American public?  GOLDBERG:  Well - and Linda, I know you want to jump in,
but I’m just - one of the points I’d love to talk about here is
the length of time it can really take from the patent, from the
R&D process to the patent process to the actually hiring the
first person and what can be done to speed that - to speed up
that process?  LINDA KATEHI: (Inaudible) will not respond directly to your
question, but it would be relevant though. I wanted to come back
exactly to that issue about patent reform, first of all, that I
also thought that it was a major step forward. But when we speak
about the impact of these on economic development eventually,
(inaudible) critical partner in this discussion and this is the
small and medium-sized companies, the startups. They make a big
part of our economy obviously.  And there needs  - there’s a question mark that needs to be
answered on whether this patent reform went far enough to
address the cost issues that small companies and small staff
(inaudible) very early.  It’s just back to what you said
(inaudible) define and set (inaudible) in a very difficult
position when they try to claim their own IP which is so
critical at that stage.  And there is always - there has been a concern about the
cost.  That cost issue has been a problem for institutions since
- especially those that don’t have a very large research
enterprise and the ability to cover it.  And that remains to be seen. We need - really need to pay
attention to it.  But that is a component that really leads many
companies into, you know, going broke before even they make it.  GOLDBERG: Well, and other countries do more to reimburse
the inventors for the costs of filing for patents in other - in
other countries. I think that China reimburses inventors who get
patents in other - in other countries. Should the United States
do something like that?  GOODNIGHT: Well, Susan, I mean, probably the - one of the
best things that helps smaller companies - it doesn’t really
cost that much to file a patent, but when a small company gets
hit with a patent suit for supposed infringement, we should at
least, you know, some time the next time the patent law is
looked out try to add to it that the loser pays.  So if you bring a previous lawsuit and you lose, then you
pay. That would help cut out a lot of the patent trouble
lawsuits that we’re seeing right now.  But, you know, probably
another 30 years before they’ll touch this bill again.  So -  GOLDBERG:  (Inaudible).  LECHLEITER: In the meantime, the post-grant review offers
some hope that weak patents can get thrown out earlier in the
process and it’s through an administrative process, not through
the courts with a bunch of discovery and - so that part really
should dramatically decrease the cost, increase the certainty
for the inventor.  UNKNOWN: Yes.  LECHLEITER: and do it rather early on so that you haven’t
invested huge amounts of capital to find that later through the
court system your patent’s been undermined.  So there’s a degree of certainty that this new process
brings a degree of transparency and predictability that I think
ultimately is going to pay dividends for everybody and the small
inventor.  GOLDBERG:  John, were you going to -  HENNESSY: So Susan, getting back to your question, I think
of how long it takes to move from discovery to getting company
businesses created product to the marketplace, I think, is an -
is an important one that we need to look at and it’s one where
industry and universities need to collaborate to speed up that
process.  I think if you look at  information technology , that’s an
industry where it works pretty quickly. Things move very fast,
sometimes faster than even anybody would like, but the -  UNKNOWN: You don’t have to build anything.  HENNESSY: You don’t have to build anything, right? You have
to - you don’t - and more importantly, I think, you don’t have a
regulatory process there.  GOLDBERG: That’s right.  HENNESSY: And I think the regulatory process, there’s a
balancing act. Look, we all care about safety in the biomedical
sphere. It’s critically important, but that has to be balanced
about the - to the extent that which we slow down discovery and
the rate at which discoveries move out.  And getting that balance right is a hard problem. It’s a
problem that the American public needs to weigh in because
they’ve got to understand that there are risks in any medical
treatment of any sort.  So - and I think doing something to close the valley of
death from the biomedical sector is going to be in all our best
interests because we’re investing a lot in basic research. How
do we move that process along faster?  GOLDBERG: Does anybody have a sense on how that process
moves faster?  JOHN ENGLER :  Well, I had a question because I’ve often
wondered in the - in the case of approvals and we know that
other nations have other medical devices that are, what, two to
three years faster in  Europe  for approval.  I had a company CEO tell me recently even in  Japan , he
said, “Amazingly, I was approved on a product before I could
get it through the FDA here.” And he said, “That’s not an easy
feat.”  There are for - in John’s world, I mean, with treatments
and that, it does seem to me there ought to be a safe harbor
created.  We have some things for when someone’s in a stage four
of something and if there’s  - you know, where can we have
assumption of risk so that I might try this if all other, you
know, options are gone and how much more robust can that be?  Could there be approval, again, even if it’s on an
assumption of risk basis? If something’s been approved in
Europe, but not approved here, shouldn’t I be able to - if my
medical professional wants to prescribe that to be able to take
that?  I mean, those are - there’s a lot that it seems that we
could be more creative than we have been.  LECHLEITER: Yes, I think the fact is that our industry
needs to build on what John and John just talked about, the
effective patent life for biomedical innovation -  UNKNOWN: Right.  LECHLEITER: that’s been shrinking and that’s a function of
the time it takes for the regulatory review process to really
complete.  And it’s not just the approval. It’s not the one or two
years.  It’s the whole development process because you’re - the
clock’s running. It tends to - tends to run from the time that -
the 20-year clock, you know? We start that process. It’s still a
10 to 15-year cycle.  So it’s not unusual to see medicines approved these days
that have, you know, not the 14-year protection that the Hatch-
Waxman Act envisioned in the early 80s, but, you know, seven to
10 years of patent protection left. OK?  So we’re still - we’re working on that. I mean, I think we
made a step forward and the health care legislation included a
data protection for biologics. So we have a 12-and-a-half-year
period in which the data package - whether you have a patent or
not, the data package cannot be referenced by a third party
providing, I think, a good degree of assurance that an inventor
or new biologic product can get adequate head time for an
adequate return.  We don’t have the same thing on the so-called, small
molecule side because of this erosion. New patent law, you know,
has a lot to offer. It doesn’t deal with that - with that issue.
And if you’re an investor, as John was saying, you’re saying,
“Should I invest in this company.”  I mean, you’re looking at
time, the cost of money, predictability and assurance that
you’re going to have some period where you have the exclusivity
that you need to reclaim that investment and I think that’s
still an issue that we have to wrestle with.  KATEHI:  Yes.  To - this is not the buyer or it’s not the
only (inaudible) places this problem, but in the - in the
environmental area we have the same thing.  The industry - there
is industry with interest in their ideas, but there is a lot of
reluctance in investing in those because in some states like the
state of  California , for example, it may take three years to get
the permission license to build even a small manufacturing
facility that deals with products related to environmental.  HENNESSY:  And there’s a lot of - I think particularly in
the green tech sector there’s a lot of policy uncertainty.  UNKNOWN:  Yes.  HENNESSY:  What is the country going to do -  UNKNOWN:  Right.  HENNESSY: about the issues of CO2 and greenhouse gases? Are
we going to have ongoing incentives for renewable energy?  UNKNOWN: Right.  HENNESSY: And if you’re sitting there as an investor
thinking about investment in renewable energy and it makes sense
if there’s a tax credit and it doesn’t make sense that there
isn’t, what do you do?  UNKNOWN: (Inaudible).  HENNESSY: You think the tax credit’s going away. You say,
“OK. I’m not going to take the chance maybe in that
investment.”  UNKNOWN: Yes.  HENNESSY: So, again, we get back to this issue of stability
and predictability for businesses and particularly inventors and
new businesses.  GOLDBERG: So clearly this whole speed to - speed to market
is a big issue? But then there’s also the issue of well, where
are the jobs actually going to be located?  So, you know, you
can have all the patents in the world and you can do a lot to
make that process better, but what if none of those jobs or very
few of those jobs are in the United States?  KULLMAN: Well, I think an important part of the extension -  GOLDBERG: Yes.  KULLMAN: of the America Invents Act is the protection of,
you know, intellectual property. And I think that this country
has shown that it is willing to go to bat and protect.  Now, I think John makes a great point about making sure
that the right words get into the free trade agreements that
protect intellectual property, but I think that is an advantage
that the United States has a long history of being there and
helping companies, industries protect their intellectual
property.  We don’t find that everywhere in the world.  And I think to
continue to enhance that actually, you know, industrial economic
espionage that’s on the increase, the penalties for it are de
minimus. I think you can go to jail longer for stealing a car
than you can for stealing a bit of John’s or my technology.  And I think that whole area of it is the next one we really
have to deal with. If we’re going to extract the real value and
out of the research and development in the inventions that we
are doing today.  GOLDBERG: Yes.  TERESA SULLIVAN: (Inaudible), you know, another part of our
respect for intellectual property is that the universities have
an educational job to do.  With our students, it’s starting off
teaching them what intellectual property is and why you respect
it.  Later on, it becomes -  HENNESSY: Especially around music that they (inaudible).  UNKNOWN: -Yes.  SULLIVAN: And not just music, but anything else they
defined as free (inaudible).  UNKNOWN: Yes, exactly.  SULLIVAN: But, you know, later on it becomes teaching
everyone how to protect their own intellectual property which is
something that they don’t understand.  UNKNOWN: Yes.  SULLIVAN: It’s something we have to spend a lot of time
with our graduate students who may inadvertently disclose
something without realizing they’re even doing it. And then with
our own faculty inventors who often really don’t know how to go
about protecting their own intellectual property.  So universities are starting to spend a fair amount of
their resources on thinking about how we do this kind of
education and it’s pretty specialized work.  It’s not something
that we’ve always done or done well but I think you’re going to
see a lot of us doing more of it in the future.  SALLY MASON:  I think - I think that’s a great point that
Teresa just raised because one of the things that this
discussion around patent reform has done is it really has begun
to open the eyes of even more of our faculty.  There were a lot
of our faculty who were engaged in the development and the
intellectual property understood this before, but now, even more
of them are interested.  So we’re going to glut the system even worse than it’s
currently glutted and in the not too distant future just because
many more people now are beginning to say, “Oh, I can do
that.” That’s something that we can manage to do and the
universities are prepared to help me do that.  And we are. I mean, we are - I think many of us have built
our research parks, have geared up our intellectual property
offices and have - we’re ready for whatever they want to bring
to the table on this front, but too many of them have been
reluctant in the past and I think that this at least now
reengages them in the conversation.  GOLDBERG:  Susan, you had -  HOCKFIELD: I want to speak to your question of how do we
accelerate this relatively complex - we call it a pipeline, but
it’s more like a maze between an invention, you know, the  - our
discovery of the lab (inaudible), a product for the marketplace.  As you know, in June, President Obama launched the Advanced
Manufacturing Partnership. I mean, it - we don’t have easy
answers yet.  And so AMP is designed to bring together industry
leaders, university leaders, the federal agencies that fund
innovation to think about how we can kind of map out ways to
accelerate this pipeline of innovation.  And AMP has gotten started.  We hope to finish our work
before election season really gets underway, but it’s starting
awfully early.  So we hope it’ll be, you know, I think, maybe a
nine month process.  So late spring we hope to deliver some recommendations, but
the recommendations are around, you know, several, you know,
four sets of issues, but what I would call out is the
development of technology and collaboration.  So for a lot of new products and a lot of, you know  - you
know, new things, you know, I don’t think we’re going to be
working the software debate  too much, but around  - to develop
a new manufacturing system is enormously time, labor, capital
intensive.  And one question that we - we’re work - we’re talking with,
you know, again, industry and the academy, is are there some
common themes that we can develop and can we set up shared
facilities basically in the precompetitive realm that would, you
know, offload some of the responsibility from business and, you
know, bring the university, you know, a little further, you
know, along toward product development, toward manufacturing so
that we can co-invent together what this next generation is
going to be and an attempt to accelerate the development of new
manufacturing.  Yes, I think what’s happened in America, I mean, it’s
really quite fascinating. We have a manufacturing initiative
that we launched at MIT.  It’s called, Production in the
Innovation Economy, but to really study what has happened to
manufacturing - because where we are in America today is, it is
kind of a commonplace. It’s reflex that people say, “Oh, we
don’t manufacture in America anymore.  Didn’t - you know, didn’t
you get the memo?”  And, you know, we may not be the top manufacturing nation
on Earth, but if we’re not the top, we are very close second.
But the fear is that if we have a national attitude that we’d
given up on manufacturing, you know, that mythology will become
fact.  And we have to really think hard about all of the
components that drive manufacturing and understand, you know,
what is possible economically, sociologically to do in the
United States rather than assuming that as soon as you go into
manufacturing you’ve got to go, you know, to some other country.  And yes, I think this is a very important - I mean,
obviously, you know - you know, we think it’s so important that
not only am I co-chairing AMP with Andrew Liveris from Dow, we
have this study, “Production and the Innovation of the Economy
on Campus” because we don’t know what the answers are to
accelerating this path and we don’t know the answers for the
viability of 21st Century manufacturing America.  We think there are great possibilities, but until we can
actually lay out the infrastructure requirements, the human
power requirements and the policy requirements, we’re just kind
of wandering in the dark and we think we really have to make
some order - put some order into this mystery.  GOLDBERG: Yes, Freeman?  HRABOWSKI: It’s just the idea of changing the culture of
institutions because, I mean, some institutions have been known
for a long time for doing a lot in these areas and then other
universities have not been as involved.  And I do think for our
campus at UMBC, changing the culture has meant really working on
the partnerships with the corporate sector.  So our center in advanced sense of technologies works
closely with GE and has been able to make amazing progress in
some of these areas. And what it means is having the kind of
collaboration where you have these research teams across the
industry and the institution and it also (inaudible).  This is the part about looking at ourselves, making a
decision about what’s important at the university because we
have to  - Teresa said it well if you kind of cut cost or you
find ways in having (ENE), then how are you using that money?  If it’s important to do this kind of work, you have to find
a way to put some of that money into this endeavor if you’re
going to partner with other people. Now, you can have training
as a part of it, to have students too, but it does mean setting
priorities, reallocating when necessary and looking at attitudes
of everybody involved in the process.  GOLDBERG: Yes.  BILL GREEN: Yes, I - you know, when you look at other
countries, you know, you find a lot of our innovation is still a
craft skill.  And in some ways, other countries who started
later than us don’t have any baggage and they have had - been
able to industrialize their innovation in a more profound way.  And that sort of from idea to outcome and the least
possible amount of time with a focus on quality, speed, and cost
in that order, no other order, you’ve got this right, work on
speeding it, take the cost out of the process.  And so I think as we look at this and goes right through
this, you know, valley of death and it goes through this Patent
Office thing, it’s, you know, how do we industrialize
innovation, right, to get it from idea to outcome, right, with
speed and at scale?  And I think we do have a unique advantage here and I think
the work you guys are doing in manufacturing is profound. I  -
and I think if we take that approach to looking at, you know,
the manufacturing challenge, if you will, which we tend to think
of in a traditional sense, but if we think of it as part of the
supply chain from idea to outcome, I think we get a totally
different answer.  I think we have a totally different
proposition for the world when we do that.  HOCKFIELD: And Bill, there’s another little kind of cycle
inside that.  It’s the feedback from the factory floor, whatever
the factory floor looks like, you know, back to the lab bench
because that cycle has to be short and if we let the
manufacturing go someplace else, we’ve just cut ourselves out of
that, you know, cycle that allows you to innovate the next
generation.  HENNESSY: I think you’re right, Susan, and it’s a crazy
situation.  I mean, we design smart phones in this country, we
design iPads in this country and then we manufacture them in
China.  HOCKFIELD: Right.  Well -  HENNESSY: But it’s not - it’s not fundamentally about
labor.  It’s labor cost differential, right?  These are capital
intensive, these are intensive in terms of people power, you
need a lot of skills around quality assurance and manufacturing
engineers that if we’re going to be competitive, we have to
produce more people, but those are great jobs we could have in
this country.  ENGLER: One of the - one of the outer points, this is a
good - a good research project for the economics department
Teresa was mentioning their importance too and that’s saying
that we need to look at the trade deficit data and begin to
disaggregate this a little bit because just the products you
just mentioned, if you look at where the value is in there,
there’s a whole lot of it’s in the IP side.  And I actually think this would strengthen the visibility
and support of IP by - because on a trade deficit, when that
comes back, it’s the value of the product. It isn’t just
aggregated, but only part of that is really being imported.  And actually in some ways the dollar value of the import’s
less if you - if you, again, disaggregate it and looked at that,
the dollar of what you’re importing, you’re really re-importing
your own IP.  UNKNOWN: Right.  ENGLER: And so is that adding - did that add to the trade
deficit or not?  I mean, is that a - is that - are we really
getting it right?  And I think for both the president’s group,
you know, that - actually, both of the president’s groups, it’s
sort of a fundamental question because we have the sense if we
pull the energy costs out, our trade deficits - it’s a lot more
reasonable, but if you pulled some of the IP stuff out, all of a
sudden it really looks a little bit different.  And it’s just one of those things. I mean, we have a system
built up over time, but I’m not sure it measures properly what
the economic activity is. We’re still making 20 - about 21, 20
percent of the world’s manufactured goods in this country. We’re
still in first place. The problem is, as mentioned earlier, the
indicators are all - don’t bet against the countries that’s four
times larger (inaudible).  GOLDBERG: Well, Tim, I know you wanted to jump in on that.  TIM SOLSO: Yes, I think there’s another perspective though
that’s not a national one in the sense that I would argue the
advanced manufacturing U.S.’s leaders, but, you know, we have
that in a plan in the United States, but we’ll take that same
system and put it in China or India or  Brazil  or wherever we
are.  So we export that advanced manufacturing and then
associated with that is the production system that you use with
the advanced manufacturing.  Again, we standardize, you know, to
your point, as quality and as cost and as productivity.  So I don’t think it’s, in our case, it would be tied to a -
you know, a particular country.  It’s some - it’s, you know, a
global company in terms of how we would do that. But I think
also going back to the development cycle and reducing time to
market is that we now integrate the engineering and the
manufacturing almost simultaneously together so you’re not
designing something and then passing it on without the
manufacture ability, the service ability and that type of thing,
and that’s relatively new, you know, in the - I would say in the
last five or six years which, again, I tied back to advanced
manufacturing.  GOLDBERG:  I’m looking to see how all this new law is going
to play out in the next few years in development of
manufacturing and IT as well.  So John, do you want to wrap up this discussion of our
panel system?  HENNESSY:  Well, I think what we probably focused on
properly here is that the protection of intellectual property
remains a national priority, very important, but so too is the
enforcement of intellectual property rights.  In other nations around the world, I think that’s an
opportunity for the U.S. itself and the U.S. acting through
international bodies to up our game.  I think that we have -when
you had, you know, the dominant share of the intellectual
property and the dominant share of the manufacturing, it wasn’t
as relevant as it becomes as things shift around the world.  And so to be able to stop a company in  Thailand  from taking
a pharmaceutical product or a company in China from taking a  -
your software or your - you know, your chemical or whatever and
replicating it, pretty important. I think there are reasons in
addition to intellectual property. I mean, I think we’ve all
become more aware also of the things like safety on a supply
chain, too.  And in this country, the liability that attaches if the -
you know, the asbestos in the product or the - you know, the
insulation, something is wrong there. The other piece of this
that I think is pretty darn important is that the intellectual
property creation is only a piece of what is really the economic
impact and it’s having the right policies that encourage the
advanced manufacturing to come along with it.  And then just to Jim’s point, really important because what
he just described is a system where he’s got R&D process, he’s
got R&D function in Brazil, in China, everywhere there’s a
plant.  That’s all married up and that’s increasingly happening.  And so it’s not the idea that you can just have the R&D
center here or that we’re going to have the high-tech end of the
world and we can outsource this low-tech, you know, production
piece because increasingly knitting that together - and I think
from a - from a tax and a regulatory policy perspective, it
challenges whether there’s a presidential commission looking at
it or a group like the roundtable or the National Association of
Manufacturers get smart with their policy.  And states have tried to do this in their economic
development functions, but there’s no national strategy that
exists on how we are saying that we want to make sure deep into
the 21st Century the United States still place and makes a lot
of stuff.  And we recognize that making a lot of that stuff creates a
lot of wealth and a lot of jobs.  GOLDBERG: Well, ultimately, that’s what we’ve been talking
about today, making a lot of stuff. So let me turn this back
over to Al just for a few closing remarks. I want to thank
everybody for another terrific discussion.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
