Veolia Transdev and Trenitalia SpA

Francais, Le Figaro reported.  One-way fares on the 13-hour overnight voyage will range
from 35 euros ($47) to 200 euros, the newspaper said. The
partnership, called Thello, plans to open a Paris-Rome service
in mid-2012, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
