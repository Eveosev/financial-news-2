Rigs used by energy explorers in Asia
fell 10 percent in September from a year earlier as crude oil
prices declined, according to data compiled by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   There were 252 rigs operating on land and sea in the Asia-
Pacific region last month, compared with 281 a year earlier and
252 units in August, Baker Hughes, an oilfield-services company,
said on its  website .  Rig use has declined from a 26-year high of 286 in January
as oil slumped 28 percent in  New York  from this year’s peak of
$114.83 a barrel in May. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for
about 21 percent of global rig use, excluding the U.S. and
Canada.  There were 3,662 rigs operating around the world last month,
540 more than a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes. The rig
count excluding the U.S. and  Canada  stood at 1,174 last month
compared with 1,120 a year earlier, Baker Hughes said. The
figures include offshore and onshore drill sites and exclude
those in Iran and onshore in China.  Baker Hughes has published rig counts since 1944, when
Hughes Tool Co. began weekly data on U.S. and Canadian drilling,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
