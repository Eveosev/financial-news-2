European stocks gained for a third
day, posting a second weekly gain, as a report showed the  U.S.
economy  added more jobs than economists had estimated.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  led gains in
European carmakers, climbing more than 1 percent.  Rio Tinto 
Group and Xstrata Plc advanced with metal prices.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.8 percent to 231.99 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The benchmark measure posted a
weekly rally of 2.6 percent amid speculation policy makers will
agree to shield banks from the crisis and as the  Bank of England 
expanded its bond-purchase program. The gauge has still
retreated 20 percent since this year’s high on Feb. 17 and is
trading at 9.8 times its companies’ estimated earnings, near the
lowest since March 2009.  “U.S. payrolls are a very positive surprise,” said
Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf.
“The market has been oversold in the last few weeks and we have
a combination of tailwinds from the  European Central Bank ’s
comments yesterday to the payrolls today, which are the big
cherry on the cake. A recession is getting more and more
unlikely.”  European stocks gained as a U.S. report showed employers
added more jobs than forecast in September and revised up hiring
in the previous two months. The release also showed hours and
earnings increased, helping ease concerns the U.S. labor market
is deteriorating.  U.S. Payrolls, Unemployment  Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase in August that was more than originally estimated,
Labor Department data showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey called for an increase of 60,000. The gain reflected
the return to work of 45,000 telecommunications employees. The
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  The ECB said yesterday it will reintroduce yearlong loans,
giving banks access to unlimited cash through January 2013. The
central bank will also resume purchases of covered bonds to
encourage lending. At the same time, the European Commission is
pushing for a coordinated capital injection into banks and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said policy makers “shouldn’t
hesitate” if it turns out financial institutions are
undercapitalized.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 12 of the 18 western-
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index climbed 0.5 percent and
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.2 percent.  France ’s CAC 40
Index increased 0.7 percent.  Carmakers Advance  BMW and Daimler, the world’s biggest makers of luxury cars,
jumped 4.1 percent to 50.89 euros and 1.3 percent to 33.98
euros, respectively. Carmakers posted the second-largest
performance in the Stoxx 600, gaining 1.7 percent.  Continental AG (CON)  surged 4.9 percent to 46.91 euros as the
world’s fourth-largest tiremaker plans to spend more than $500
million to build a new tire factory at Sumter,  South Carolina ,
to meet increasing demand.  Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company, rose
1.2 percent to 3,164 pence, while Xstrata Plc climbed 2.7
percent to 910 pence. Copper, lead, tin and zinc all rose on the
London Metal Exchange.  Total SA, Europe’s third-largest oil producer, rose 2.9
percent to 35.33 euros as crude oil increased for a third day in
 New York .  JCDecaux SA (DEC)  rose 2.5 percent to 18.92 euros as the French
outdoor-advertising company may exceed its third-quarter
forecast for organic revenue growth, Kepler said after meeting
with the company.  RBS, Lloyds Decline  RBS and Lloyds Banking Group Plc slid 3 percent to 23.62
pence and 3.4 percent to 34.66 pence, respectively. Moody’s cut
the senior debt and deposit ratings of 12 U.K. financial
institutions as the likelihood of government support in a crisis
lessens.  Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and Co-Operative Bank Plc had their
ratings lowered one step by Moody’s, while RBS Plc and
 Nationwide Building Society  were cut two levels.  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  dropped 1.7 percent to 10.72 euros
after the world’s biggest water company was downgraded to
“sell” from “neutral” at UBS AG, which said the longer term
consensus is “overly optimistic.”  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  declined 5 percent to 51.55 Swiss francs in
Zurich trading after the cement maker said Thomas Schmidheiny’s
Schweizerische Cement-Industrie AG raised its stake in Holcim to
more than 20 percent. The shares had rallied 11 percent over the
previous four days.  Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  slumped 42 percent to 5.8 pence, the
lowest price and the largest drop since its 2004 initial public
offering. The U.K.’s biggest food manufacturer said third-
quarter sales fell “significantly below” management’s
