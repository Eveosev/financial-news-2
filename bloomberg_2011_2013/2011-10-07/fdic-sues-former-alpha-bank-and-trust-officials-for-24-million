The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
receiver for the Alpha Bank & Trust, sued former directors and
officers of the bank in an attempt to recover $24 million.  The suit, filed today in federal court in Atlanta, names as
defendants James A. Blackwell, Alpha’s former chairman; Dan E.
Burge, a former board member and chairman of a loan committee;
seven other directors; and two other officers. The $24 million
is based on losses on commercial real estate loans the bank
approved from 2006 to 2008, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit seeks to recover “damages caused by the
defendants’ failure to use ordinary care, and gross
negligence,” according to the complaint.  Alpha Bank & Trust was closed by the  Georgia  Department of
Banking and Finance in October 2008 after operating less than
2 1/2 years, according to the complaint. The estimated loss of
the bank’s failure to the FDIC insurance fund is about
$214.5 million, according to the suit.  The case is FDIC v. Blackwell, 11-03423, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
