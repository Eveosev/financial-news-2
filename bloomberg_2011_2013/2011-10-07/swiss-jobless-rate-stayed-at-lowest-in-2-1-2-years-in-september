Swiss unemployment remained at the
lowest in more 2 1/2 years in September, suggesting the labor
market is still robust even as economic growth is cooling.  The jobless rate held at 3 percent compared with August,
when adjusted for seasonal swings, the State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed statement today.
Thatâ€™s the lowest since January 2009 and in line with the median
forecast of 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The unadjusted jobless rate was at 2.8 percent, unchanged
from the previous month. The number of job openings rose by 851
to 19,435 in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
