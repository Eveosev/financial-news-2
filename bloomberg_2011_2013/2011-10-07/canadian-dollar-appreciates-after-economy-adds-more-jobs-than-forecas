Canada ’s dollar touched the strongest
level in more than a week versus its U.S. counterpart and gained
for the week after government data showed Canadian and American
payrolls climbed more than forecast.  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, rose 1 percent
this week as crude oil recovered to $84 a barrel and U.S. stocks
rebounded from the worst quarterly loss since 2008. Six
commodity-linked currencies, including the loonie, the  Mexican
peso  and the South African rand, topped the weekly performance
rankings among the greenback’s 16 most-traded peers. They pared
gains after  Fitch Ratings  downgraded Spain and Italy.  “There’s a risk relief rally in the market,” said Jose Wynne, head of North America foreign-exchange research at
Barclays Plc’s Barclays Capital unit, by phone from  New York .
“The general tone of the market has been more constructive this
week. We have to take the economic numbers as positive for the
Canadian dollar,” he said, referring to today’s jobs reports.  The Canadian currency rose to C$1.0395 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0503 on Sept. 30. It slipped 0.2
percent on the day after rising to the strongest level in more
than a week. One Canadian dollar buys 96.20 U.S. cents.  Canadian employment rose by 60,900 in September after a
decline of 5,500 in August, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.1 percent, the lowest
since December 2008. Economists in Bloomberg News surveys
projected a gain of 15,000 jobs and unemployment to remain at
August’s reading of 7.3 percent.  ‘Better Than Expected’  “The data out of Canada is better than expected, and the
macro community will like that,” said  Stephen Gallo , head of
market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in  London . “Fair
value for Canada is stronger than current levels.”  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers last month, Labor
Department data showed today in  Washington . The median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 60,000.
Revisions to previous reports added a total of 99,000 jobs to
payrolls in July and August. The August total was revised to a
gain of 57,000 from no change.  “This report drives a wedge between what’s happening in
 Europe  and what’s happening in the U.S.,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in
New York. “You’re seeing job creation in the U.S. rather than
businesses sitting and watching the crisis unfold in Europe.”  Italy , Spain Ratings  The jobs data pushed Canada’s dollar as much as 1.3 percent
higher to C$1.0235, the strongest level since Sept. 28. It
retreated as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, fluctuated
and stocks fell when Fitch cut the ratings of Spain and Italy.  Italy had its foreign and local currency long-term issuer
default ratings downgraded to A+ from AA-, while Spain had the
same set of ratings cut to AA- from AA+. Fitch’s outlook for
both was negative.  Crude for November delivery traded at $82.87 a barrel in
New York, up 0.3 percent, after rising 1.7 percent earlier to
$84, the highest level since Sept. 28, and falling as much as
1.5 percent to $81.36. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8
percent after rising 0.6 percent. It increased 2.1 percent for
the week.  Raw materials  including crude oil account for about half of
Canada’s export revenue.  Canada’s government bonds dropped, pushing the yield on the
two-year benchmark note up three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.96 percent. It touched 1.03 percent, the
highest level since Sept. 19. The 1.5 percent securities
maturing in November 2013 declined 6 cents to C$101.09.  Growth Forecast  Growth in the world’s 10th largest economy is expected by
analysts to decelerate this year and in 2012, and Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  has said there’s less need to lift
borrowing costs. The central bank kept its main  interest rate 
unchanged for an eighth meeting last month amid Europe’s
financial crisis and a slow U.S. rebound.  Economic growth is forecast to slow to 2.2 percent this
year and 2.1 percent in 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists and analysts this month. That’s 0.2 percentage point
below the August forecast for both years. The Bank of Canada
estimates economic growth will slow to 2.6 percent next year
from 2.8 percent this year.  The nation’s gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent in
July to C$1.26 trillion on a seasonally adjusted basis,
 Statistics Canada  said Sept. 30, matching the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey with 23 responses.  “We’ve now had a reasonable GDP print and a reasonably
good Canadian employment number, so that is good news for people
looking at the fundamental story for Canada,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto.  Canada’s currency reached a three-year high of 94.07 cents
in July before plunging along with other risk-related assets as
investors, concerned that a potential Greek default may spark a
run on European banks and send the global economy into another
recession, took refuge in the U.S. dollar and the yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
