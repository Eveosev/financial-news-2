Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following two months of little change, employment rose
by 61,000 in September, all in full time. This increase
pushed the unemployment rate down 0.2 percentage points to
7.1%, the lowest rate since December 2008.  Employment  In the 12 months to September, employment has grown by
1.7% (+294,000), primarily in Ontario and  Alberta . Over
this period, full-time employment rose by 2.5% (+344,000),
part-time work declined 1.5% (-50,000) and total actual
hours worked increased 2.0%.  September's employment increase was spread across a
number of industries, with gains in educational services;
professional, scientific and technical services;
accommodation and food services; natural resources; and
public administration. These gains were partially offset
by declines in finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing; manufacturing; and information, culture and
recreation.  There were notable employment increases in British
Columbia, Saskatchewan,  New Brunswick  and Prince  Edward
Island  in September.  In September, employment increased among the self-
employed and public sector employees. Compared with 12
months earlier, employment growth in the private sector
(+2.2%) was faster than that of the public sector (+1.1%),
while self-employment rose slightly (+0.6%).  Unemployment rate  Service sector leads employment gains  Employment in educational services rose by 38,000 in
September (see Note to readers). Compared with a year
earlier, employment in this industry is up 1.7% (+20,000).  The number of workers in professional, scientific and
technical services rose by 36,000 in September, continuing
an upward trend that began in the summer of 2009. Over the
past 12 months, employment in this industry has increased
by 4.1% (+53,000), one of the highest rates of growth
among all industries.  In accommodation and food services, employment was up
31,000 in September. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment increased by 7.6% (+80,000), the highest growth
rate among all industries.  Following two consecutive months of decline, employment
in natural resources increased by 17,000 in September.
This gain brings employment in this industry to the same
level as 12 months earlier.  There were also employment gains in public
administration (+14,000), bringing employment back to its
level of September 2010.  Employment fell by 35,000 in finance, insurance, real
estate and leasing. Compared with a year earlier,
employment in this industry is down by 1.4% (-15,000).  Following little change in the previous three months,
employment in manufacturing was down 24,000 in September.
This decline leaves employment slightly above its level of
September 2010 (+0.8% or +13,000).  There were also declines in information, culture and
recreation (-22,000). Despite September's decline,
employment in this industry increased by 1.5% (+12,000)
compared with 12 months earlier.  While employment in construction was little changed in
September, it was up 4.1% (+50,000) from a year earlier,
one of the highest growth rates of all industries.  Large gains in British Columbia  Employment in British Columbia rose by 32,000, all in
full-time work. This was the first notable employment gain
since July 2010. The  unemployment rate  fell by 0.8
percentage points to 6.7% in September.  In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 4,000 in
September. Employment in the province is up 0.9% compared
with 12 months earlier, lower than the national average of
1.7%.  Employment increased by 2,700 in New Brunswick. Despite
this gain, employment in the province was 0.5% lower than
12 months earlier.  While employment in Alberta was little changed in
September, over the year, employment has grown by 4.8%
(+98,000), entirely in full-time work.  Employment in  Quebec  was unchanged in September. With
fewer people searching for work, the unemployment rate
fell by 0.3 percentage points to 7.3%. Compared with
September 2010, employment increased by 0.6%.  Ontario employment was little changed for the second
consecutive month and the unemployment rate was 7.6%. Over
the past 12 months, employment increased by 2.0%
(+136,000), above the national growth rate of 1.7%.  Increases among core-aged and older workers  Employment increased among workers aged 25 to 54 in
September (+25,000), bringing growth over the previous
year to 1.2% (+146,000).  In September, employment grew by 21,000 among workers
aged 55 and over. Employment for this age group is up 2.7%
(+81,000) in the past 12 months.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 was up slightly,
bringing growth since September 2010 to 2.8% (+68,000).  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is
produced monthly in the form of three-month moving
averages. Not all estimates are seasonally adjusted;
therefore, comparisons should only be made on a year-over-
year basis.  Employment in the  Northwest Territories  rose by 1,500
(+6.7%) from the third quarter of 2010 to the same period
in 2011. Employment was little changed in both Yukon and
Nunavut.  In the third quarter of 2011, the unemployment rate was
7.4% in the Northwest Territories, 4.9% in Yukon and 17.2%
in Nunavut.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information 
(71-001-X, free).  Seasonal adjustment and educational services  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  The LFS seasonal adjustment process removes the
"average" seasonal pattern in the monthly data, according
to trends seen in the previous few years. While there have
been large movements in educational services employment in
summer months in recent years, there has not been a
consistent pattern in the direction or magnitude of these
month-to-month yearly changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
