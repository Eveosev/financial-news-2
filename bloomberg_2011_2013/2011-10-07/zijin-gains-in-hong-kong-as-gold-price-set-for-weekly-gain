Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s
biggest gold miner by market value, is set for its biggest gain
in more than two years in  Hong Kong  as the price for the
precious metal headed for its first weekly advance in five.  Zijin surged as much as 16 percent to HK$2.45, the most
since March 2009. It was at HK$2.38 at 11:22 a.m. Hong Kong time
as the benchmark index advanced 3.2 percent. The stock pared its
decline for the year to 50 percent.  “Gold prices may be supported by a rise in other metals
such as copper,” said Ka Kei Lam, associate director of Redford
Securities in Hong Kong. Zijin “is playing a bit of catch-up.”  Gold for immediate delivery gained 0.8 percent to $1,663.75
an ounce at 11:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, boosted by speculation that
policy makers in  Europe  will step up measures to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
