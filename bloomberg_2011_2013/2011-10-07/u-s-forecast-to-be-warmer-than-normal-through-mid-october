The U.S. will be dominated by a warm
pattern for the next two weeks, which may mean fewer people will
be turning up their home thermostats, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Rogers predicted the U.S. from
southern  California  to Maine to be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.6 to 2.7 Celsius) above normal.  MDA EarthSat Weather 
forecasts a similar pattern through the same Oct. 12 to Oct. 16
timeframe, while also calling for higher temperatures in the
upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions.  “We continue to see a generally warm pattern dominating
much of the nation over the next two weeks, which reduces
heating demand more than it increases cooling demand as we head
into mid- to latter October,” Rogers, based in Bethesda,
 Maryland , wrote in a note to clients today.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  New York ’s average temperatures will be in the mid-60s next
week, 5 to 7 degrees above normal, according to MDA of
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Boston will have average temperatures in
the low-60s, or about 6 to 8 degrees above normal.  Both forecasters call for the warmth to continue through
the Oct. 17 to Oct. 21 period. MDA said the area with the
highest departures from normal would be the upper Midwest, while
Rogers predicts that for  New Mexico  and west Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
