California  may limit awards from a
program that gave a $25.1 million tax break to Solyndra LLC, the
now-bankrupt solar-panel maker, or scrutinize the finances of
recipients, under recommendations to state lawmakers.  The most-populous state also should consider a way to
recoup tax breaks granted to companies that leave California or
go bankrupt, according to a report scheduled for consideration
Oct. 11 by a pair of state Senate committees.  Lawmakers are weighing changes to a 2010 program that has
 given out  about $104 million in projected tax breaks to so-
called green companies, including $32 million already used. The
state agency that runs the program, the Alternative Energy and
Advanced Transportation Financing Authority, said it may put new
awards on hold while reviewing the Solyndra affair.  “We’re just putting this out for consideration for the
Legislature, to gauge their preference,” said Joe DeAnda, a
spokesman for state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, the chairman of the
financing authority.  Solyndra received the largest exemption. The Fremont-based
manufacturer, which obtained a $535 million federal loan
guarantee in 2009, sought bankruptcy court protection Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
