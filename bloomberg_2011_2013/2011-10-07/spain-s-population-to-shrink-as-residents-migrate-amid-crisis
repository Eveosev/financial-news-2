Spain ’s population will start
shrinking this year as more people leave the country than arrive
amid a three-year slump that’s left almost half of young people
out of work.  The population, which surged 15 percent in the decade
through 2010 as immigrants flocked to work in the booming
economy, will contract 1.2 percent to 45.6 million in 2021, the
 National  Statistics Institute said in a report today. Emigrants
will outnumber immigrants each year through 2020, the Madrid-
based institute estimated, based on current trends.  Spain is failing to tame the highest  unemployment rate  in
the European Union and its export-led recovery from the worst
recession in six decades is slowing. As the economy struggles to
find industries to replace the construction boom that collapsed
in 2008, joblessness stands at 21 percent, with 46 percent of
young people out of work.  Spain created about half the jobs in the euro region in the
four years through 2006, attracting more immigrants that year
than any other euro nation as foreigners arrived to work in the
labor-intensive building industry. The Socialist government,
which gave work permits to 600,000 illegal workers in 2005, has
since toughened migration laws and encouraged foreigners who
have lost their jobs to go home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
