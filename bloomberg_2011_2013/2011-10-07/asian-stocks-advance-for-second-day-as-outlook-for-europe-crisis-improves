Asian stocks rose, sending a regional
benchmark index toward its biggest two-day gain in two years, as

debt crisis boosted the earnings outlook for lenders and
exporters.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s largest lender
to businesses, gained 3.9 percent in Sydney. Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., which owns ports in Germany and Spain, surged 10.5 percent

decline this week. The gauge tumbled 16 percent in the last

understanding the situation with the banking system and getting
more willing to recapitalize the banks,” said Belinda Allen, a
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “But
we haven’t seen that yet. I think it is a real risk until we see
an announcement.”  Capital Injection  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1 percent,

Index added 2.9 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 2.3
percent, to cap its biggest weekly gain in a year.  Hong Kong ’s
Hang Seng Index advanced 3.1 percent.  The European Commission is pushing for a coordinated
capital injection for banks to shield them from the fallout of a
potential Greek default.  Banks in Europe rallied after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB will resume purchases
of mortgage-backed securities and reintroduce yearlong loans for
banks. In  London , the Bank of England boosted its asset-purchase
program by more than a third to 275 billion pounds ($425
billion).  Banks Rise  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In  New York  yesterday, the index advanced 1.8 percent,
