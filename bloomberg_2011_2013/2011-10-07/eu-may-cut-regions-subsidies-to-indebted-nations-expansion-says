The European Commission proposed
cutting subsidies due in 2014 to regions in countries with
excessive deficits,  Expansion said,  citing a presentation from
European Union Regional Affairs Commissioner Johannes Hahn.  About 13 Spanish regions wouldnâ€™t get any funds under the
proposal, Expansion said. Andalusia ands Castilla-La Mancha
would keep as much as two thirds of the subsidies and Murcia,
would keep a smaller percentage of the subsidies, Expansion
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
