The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity shipping costs, rose to this year’s high as rents for
panamax vessels that haul minerals and grains climbed the most
in a week since May.  The index gained 1.7 percent to 2,000 as rates advanced for
all four ship types it tracks, according to the  Baltic Exchange ,
a London-based provider of freight rates. The gauge is at the
highest level since Dec. 16 and up 59 percent since Aug. 1.  Gains stemmed from a doubling of reported bookings of dry-
bulk vessels to ship thermal coal to  China , Credit Suisse Group
AG analysts led by Gregory Lewis said in an e-mailed report
today. They also cited port congestion and increased grain
shipments from the U.S.  The index jumped 50 percent in two months through September
as hire costs surged for capesize vessels, haulers of iron ore
and coal and the biggest ships in the gauge. A hundred capesizes
were reported booked last month to load  iron ore , according to
Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker. That’s the most since 104 vessels were hired in July
2009, data show.  Average rents for panamaxes, the largest ships that can
navigate the Panama Canal, rose 2.4 percent to $15,236 a day,
capping an 11 percent weekly advance. Rates gained as a weeklong
holiday in China curbed the number of Asian-controlled ships
seeking employment, shipbroker Braemar Shipping Services Plc
said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Coal Prices  Chinese demand for imported coal strengthened mainly on
lower international prices and sliding inventories at local
ports, Oslo-based invesment bank Pareto Securities AS said Oct.
3.  Ore, coking coal and steel products account for 51 percent
of dry-bulk seaborne trade, estimated at 3.56 billion metric
tons for 2011, according to  Germany ’s DVB Bank SE, which
specializes in transportation lending.  Capesize hire costs gained 2.2 percent to $27,876 a day,
leaving them 3.7 percent below the 2011 high of $28,949 reached
Sept. 26, data show. Rents are up 39 percent this year, compared
with a 53 percent drop as of July 29. Rates had plunged as the
capesize fleet expanded more quickly than demand to ship
commodities.  Daily rents for supramax ships, about 25 percent smaller
than panamaxes, gained for a 24th session, increasing 0.9
percent to $16,028. They’re at the highest level since March 30
and up 11 percent in the past month. Handysizes, the smallest
vessels in the index, rose 0.5 percent to $11,270.  To contact the reporter on this story:
