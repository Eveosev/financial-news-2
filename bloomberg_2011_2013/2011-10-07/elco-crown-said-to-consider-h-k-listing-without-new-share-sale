Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  is
considering listing its shares in  Hong Kong  without raising any
money, after volatile markets curbed demand for new equity, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The Macau casino operator, which already trades on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, may drop a plan to sell at least $300
million new shares in Hong Kong and instead opt to just list its
stock in the city, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private.  Melco Crown is considering a so-called  listing by
introduction , which involves the transfer of existing shares
from overseas, the people said. The company aims to start
trading in Hong Kong in early November, they said.  Melco International Development Ltd. (200) , which owns 33.5
percent of Melco Crown, slumped 33 percent in Hong Kong trading
in the last four weeks, while Macau rival  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  lost
18 percent, on concern slowing growth in China and falling stock
markets may sap demand for gambling.  Maggie Ma, a spokeswoman for Melco International in Hong
Kong, declined to comment on the listing plan for Melco Crown.
Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG are managing the
listing for Melco Crown, the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
