U.S. state banking regulators
shuttered lenders in  Minnesota  and Missouri, pushing this year’s
 tally of failures  to 76.  Officials closed Sun Security Bank, of Ellington, Missouri,
and Wyoming, Minnesota-based RiverBank, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said today on its  website . The two failures
drained the deposit-insurance fund of $189.7 million.  Banks are closing under stress from commercial real estate
loans, tied to property values that fell about 49 percent from
the October 2007 peak through April, according to Moody’s
Investors Service. Regulators have shuttered almost 400 lenders
since the start of 2007, FDIC data show.  Stillwater, Minnesota’s Central Bank picked up RiverBank’s
almost $380 million in deposits and more than $417 million in
assets, the FDIC said. Six branches changed hands in what was
the second bank failure in the state this year, the agency said.  Great Southern Bank of Springfield,  Missouri , acquired
about $290 million in deposits and more than $355 million in
assets from Sun Security Bank, the FDIC said. Sun Security, with
27 branches, was the first bank to fail in Missouri this year,
according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
