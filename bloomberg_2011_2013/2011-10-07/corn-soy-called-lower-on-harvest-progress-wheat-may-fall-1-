What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warm,
dry weather expected during the next three days in the U.S.
Midwest will allow farmers to accelerate harvesting, boosting
supplies,  Charlie Sernatinger , a vice president for ABN Amro
Clearing LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that U.S. farmers will have completed
almost half of this year’s harvest by the end of the weekend,
Sernatinger said.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open
steady, while heading for a fourth straight weekly decline, and
soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain forecast during the next
three days will boost soil moisture for early development of
crops in the southern Great Plains of the U.S., while Ukraine’s
vote to scrap grain-export duties may slow demand for U.S.
supplies, Sernatinger said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
