The discount buyers are demanding for
coffee from  Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of the robusta
variety, has narrowed in the past week as rains may delay the
crop started this month, traders said.  Beans from the 2011-12 season are selling at a discount of
$50 to $60 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe exchange
in  London , according to three traders who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media
and have direct knowledge of the prices. The discount was $60 to
$70 a ton last week.  The continuing rains have triggered “first talk” about
crop delays, Volcafe Ltd., the coffee unit of commodities trader
ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today.
Cherries that contain the beans are “still very green on the
trees.”  Delays to the harvest may support robusta coffee
prices “over the coming weeks,” Lysu Paez, an analyst at
Natixis SA in Paris, said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Vietnam will produce a record 22 million bags of 60-
kilograms (132 pounds) in the 2011-12 season, Volcafe estimates.
The nation’s output was 20 million bags in 2010-11, the trader
said in its latest quarterly report.  Production in the country may fall 10 percent after
rainfall in the Central Highlands resulted in cherries falling
from trees,  Luong Van Tu , chairman of Vietnam’s Coffee & Cocoa
Association, known as Vicofa, said in an interview on Sept. 27.  Robusta coffee for November delivery slid $61, or 3
percent, to $1,964 a ton at 3:177 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  Robusta beans are used in instant coffee and are grown
mainly in parts of Africa and  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
