Sudan ’s inflation rate fell to 20.7
percent in September from 21.1 percent in August, the Khartoum-
based Central Bureau of Statistics said in a statement today.  The decline in the  consumer price index  was largely due to
a drop in the price of food and drinks, the biggest component in
the index, said the agency, which monitors inflation in Sudan’s
northern states.  The bureau, which didn’t provide further details, is
scheduled to provide an update on inflation on Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
