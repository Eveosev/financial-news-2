Investor confidence in U.S. corporate
creditworthiness improved for the fourth day after larger-than-
forecast growth in U.S. jobs tempered concern that the world’s
biggest economy was slowing.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 1.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 137.6 basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in  Washington . The
credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has decreased from 150.1
basis points on Oct. 3 as investor speculation grew that
 Europe ’s leaders are making progress in stemming the region’s
debt crisis.  “September’s payrolls data is a light in the middle of the
tunnel for the credit markets,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. “It’s not enough to ease investor anxiety
permanently, but it should provide a catalyst for some relief to
these wider spreads.”  The measure this week reached the highest level in more
than two years.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
