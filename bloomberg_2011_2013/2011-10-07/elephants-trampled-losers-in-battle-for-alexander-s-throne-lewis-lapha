The death of the 32-year-old
Alexander the Great in 323 B.C.E. took the world by surprise.
Even as his corpse remained in the throne room near Babylon,
battles for succession erupted among his top generals.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  With a mentally damaged brother and a posthumously born son
as the prime candidates for the crown, power would fall to the
officer who seized the day. Meleager led the infantry in revolt
and marched against Perdiccas, who fled the palace only to
regroup with the cavalry.  To avoid outright civil war, the two sides agreed to a
joint kingship between the heirs apparent. Perdiccas ordered a
post-mutiny lustration, a cleansing rite where the infantry in
full armor marches between two halves of a sacrificial dog
placed on the far sides of a field.  Waiting outside the city walls with the cavalry, Perdiccas
demanded that the mutineers be handed over. As the foot soldiers
looked on, 30 top officers were bound and thrown to be trampled
by a herd of military elephants.  Meleager escaped the lustration, only to be killed as he
took refuge in a temple.  I spoke with James Romm, author of “Ghost on the Throne,”
on the following topics:  1. Throne of the World  2. Dead Young Emperor  3. Succession Bloodbaths  4. Army Logistics  5. Tomb of Alexander’s Son  To buy this book in North America click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
