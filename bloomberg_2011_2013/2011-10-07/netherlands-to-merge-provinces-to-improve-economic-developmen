The Netherlands, the fifth-largest
economy in the euro zone, plans to merge three of its 12
provinces to boost development in the northwestern economic
heartland around the capital, Amsterdam.  “The merger of the provinces Noord-Holland, Utrecht and
Flevoland is necessary to maintain the strength of the
Randstad” region, Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Verhagen told
reporters in The Hague today.  The three provinces, the oldest formed in  1814 , account for
more than a quarter of the population and almost 30 percent of
gross domestic product, according to the national statistics
agency CBS. The government expects to submit a plan for the
measure to parliament in the coming days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
