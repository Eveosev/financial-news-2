A Greek default or a collapse of the
financial system would be a disaster for everyone, French Prime
Minister  Francois Fillon  said.  “If European solidarity is broken, then the crisis will
spread to everyone,” Fillon said in a speech to a defense
college in Paris, referring to  Greece .  “I reject these populists who demagogically oppose efforts
to support the financial system,” he said. “A financial
disaster would produce an economic and social debacle.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
