Canadian crudes weakened after an
explosion yesterday at Consumers Co-Operative Refineries Ltd.
refinery and upgrader complex in Regina, Saskatchewan.  Thirteen people were injured and treated at area hospitals
and two remain in the hospital today, Vic Huard, a spokesman for
Saskatoon-based Federated Co-operatives Ltd., which owns
Consumers, said. Gasoline production has been curtailed by 50
percent and diesel output by 20 percent at the complex, he said.  Syncrude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate weakened

synthetic oil derived from the tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 40 cents to
$9.90 a barrel.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI narrowed 10 cents to $26.40 a barrel while Light Louisiana
