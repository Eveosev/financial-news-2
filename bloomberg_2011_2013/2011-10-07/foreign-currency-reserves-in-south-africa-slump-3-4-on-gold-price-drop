South African gold and foreign
currency reserves fell 3.4 percent in September, the biggest
decline in almost three years, as bullion slumped and a stronger
dollar cut the value of holdings of euros and pounds.  Gross reserves dropped to $49.7 billion, the Pretoria-based
 Reserve Bank  said on its  website  today, lower than the $51
billion median estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Net reserves fell to $47.9 billion from $49.1 billion in
August.  “A lower  U.S. dollar  gold price at month-end resulted in a
significant decrease in the value of  gold reserves , while the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies
led to a sizable downward valuation adjustment in foreign
exchange reserves,” the Reserve Bank said.  Gold dropped 11 percent in September, falling from a record
$1,900.23 an ounce on Sept. 5, as concern mounted the global
economy may fall into recession because of weakening demand in
the U.S. and a debt crisis in  Europe . The Reserve Bank may slow
the pace of dollar purchases as a sell-off in global financial
markets caused the rand to slump the most in three years last
month.  The rand gained 0.3 percent to 7.9497 against the dollar as
of 9:13 a.m. in Johannesburg, paring its decline this year to 17
percent.  Gold reserves slipped 11.3 percent to $6.5 billion in
September from the previous month, the central bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
