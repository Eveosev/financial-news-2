Thai Finance Minister Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala comments on the  central bank ’s interest-rate
policies. He spoke to reporters in Bangkok today.  The Bank of  Thailand  raised its benchmark rate in nine
steps to 3.5 percent by Aug. 24, from 1.25 percent at the start
of July 2010. Policy makers next meet to decide borrowing costs
on Oct. 19.  The central bank’s rate increases had the effect of
“stepping on the break on the economy,” Thirachai said. “It’s
too soon and too much.”  “They use only statistics without looking at the facts.
They should be more forward looking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
