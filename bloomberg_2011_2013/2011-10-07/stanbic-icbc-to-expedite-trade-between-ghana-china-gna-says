Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd. and the
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  have signed two agreements
that will boost trade between the West African country and
China, the  Ghana News Agency  reported, citing Stanbic spokesman
Bennet Frimpong.  Stanbic, a unit of Africa’s largest bank, Standard Bank
Group Ltd., sees “growth opportunities in the trade and cash
management sector” and the precious metals business, the Accra-
based  news agency  said, citing Craig Bond, chief executive of
Standard Bank China. By working with ICBC, Stanbic will be able
to sell the Chinese yuan to the business community in Ghana,
Bond said, according to the news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
