Peru ’s sol headed for its biggest
weekly advance in more than four months as copper prices climbed
amid optimism Europe and the U.S. will avoid recession.  The sol strengthened 0.4 percent to 2.7394 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:34 a.m.  New York  time, bringing its advance this week to
1.2 percent. That’s the sol’s strongest rise since the week
ending May 13.  Copper rose for the third straight day in New York, heading
for its biggest weekly gain in three months, after a report
showing larger-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs eased concern
that the economy was slowing. Speculation European policy makers
may help contain the euro region’s debt crisis also boosted the
metal.  “The macro data was positive” and spurred local demand
for soles, said Antonio Diaz, a currency trader at Banco
International del Peru in  Lima . “The sol’s rally was a bit
unexpected given that the underlying issue hasn’t been resolved.
We’ve had a few bullish days but the global situation remains
very uncertain.”  Peru is the world’s third-largest copper producer after
Chile and China.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, this week to 5.78 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield was down three basis points
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
