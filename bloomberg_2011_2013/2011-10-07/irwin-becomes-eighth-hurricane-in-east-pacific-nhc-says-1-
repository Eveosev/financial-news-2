Weather system Irwin has become the
eighth hurricane of the eastern Pacific season, according to the
National Hurricane Center.  Irwin, a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
is located 910 miles (1,460 kilometers) southwest of the
southern tip of Baja,  California , and is moving west-northwest
at almost 10 miles per hour with 80 mph winds, the center said
in an  advisory  at 2 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. “A turn toward
the northwest and north-northwest with a significant decrease in
forward speed is expected today and tonight,” the NHC said.  “Additional strengthening is forecast during the next
couple of days,” the center said.  Tropical Storm Jova, 520 miles southwest of Manzanillo,
 Mexico , could grow into a hurricane by tomorrow, the center said
in a separate  advisory . The system is moving west-northwest at
12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.  In the Atlantic, Philippe, a category one hurricane,
continued on a northerly course into the Atlantic between  Europe 
and  North America , according to the center. It is moving east-
northeast about 17 mph with top winds at 90 mph, from 85 mph
earlier. The system is located 535 miles east-southeast of
Bermuda. “Some gradual weakening should begin today and
Phillipe is forecast to become post-tropical in a day or two,”
the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
