German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler and  Greek Economy  Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis signed a
memorandum of understanding aimed at creating a Greek
development bank to unlock and channel European Union funds.  The accord, signed today in Athens and comprising a three-
point plan to help the Greek economy, will commit  Germany ’s KfW
Group development bank to helping  Greece  set up the institution,
which will also draw on European Investment Bank expertise,
Roesler told reporters in the Greek capital.  Roesler said the purpose of the two-day trip to Athens was
to “demonstrate Germany’s commitment to keeping all of the
members of the euro” in the currency area. “We’re prepared to
fight for the euro.”  As well as addressing EU investment finance, the MOU’s
scope includes proposals to cut bureaucracy and improve legal
security for foreign investors, Roesler said. Greece pledged to
address German concerns about outstanding disputes with Greek
companies “within days.”  Roesler also met Prime Minister  George Papandreou  and
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos on the two-day trip.  To contact the reporters on this story:
