The number of workers employed by
local governments in the U.S. fell to the lowest since November
2005 as teachers and other public employees lost their jobs.  Local government payrolls, adjusted for seasonal swings,
dropped 35,000 in September to 14 million, the Labor Department
reported today. The loss was driven by education payrolls, which
slipped 24,400 to a more than six-year low of 7.8 million.  The declines are in contrast to the overall  U.S. economy ,
where payrolls rose by 103,000, easing concern about a resurgent
recession. Cities, counties and school districts have been
squeezed by diminished tax collections brought on by tumbling
 home prices , as well as cutbacks in aid from state governments
coping with their own budget shortfalls.  Property-tax collections have slipped during the past three
quarters, according to the Census Bureau. Most municipal
officials said their finances were worse off this year than
last, a report last month by the National League of Cities
found.  “This confirms for us in real hard numbers the impact of
the budget reductions at the local level, both last year and
this year,” Chris Mauro, a municipal-debt strategist at  RBC
Capital Markets  in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
