Malaysia ’s sales of local-currency
 government bonds  will rise 49 percent this year to 90.2 billion
ringgit ($28.5 billion) to finance development spending and to
fund the  budget deficit , according to an annual report.  Offerings so far this year amount to 75 billion ringgit,
data from Bank Negara Malaysia show. The treasury plans to raise
15.2 billion ringgit from five remaining debt auctions scheduled
for this year, based on the finance ministry’s sale calendar.
Total sales were 60.5 billion ringgit in 2010, the  government 
said in its 2011-2012 Economic Report released in Kuala Lumpur
today, which didn’t provide an estimate for 2012 issuance.  Prime Minister Najib Razak is aiming to trim the budget
shortfall to 5.4 percent of gross domestic product this year and
4.7 percent in 2012, according to the report. The deficit
reached a 22-year high of 7 percent in 2009. The government is
spending $444 billion over the next decade to builds railways,
roads and power plants.  “Fiscal policy in 2012 will remain prudent and supportive
of economic growth,” the report said. “Revenue is expected to
increase 1.9 percent to 186.9 billion ringgit, providing a
strong impetus for the government to further consolidate its
fiscal position.”  The economy will expand by as much 5.5 percent in 2011, the
ministry predicts, within the central bank’s March forecast for
5 percent to 6 percent. The government estimates GDP will
increase between 5 percent and 6 percent in 2012, according to
today’s report.  The yield on Malaysia’s 4.262 percent government bonds
maturing in September 2016 dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.34 percent this week, according to prices
from Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
