Following is a table compiled
from the Monster Employment index that ranks online job
availability by industry:  NOTE: The Monster Employment Index was created in Oct. 2003 with
a base value of 100 over the first six months of the index.
With the October 2004 release, Monster Worldwide re-scaled
the index using the first 12 months as a new baseline.
The index is not seasonally adjusted.
