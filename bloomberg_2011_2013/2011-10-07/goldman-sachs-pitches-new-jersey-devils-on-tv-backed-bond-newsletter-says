Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is trying to
persuade the National Hockey League’s New Jersey Devils to sell
bonds backed by the team’s future television revenue, newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The sale, which Goldman Sachs bankers proposed to the team
this week, could raise between $75 million and $100 million, the
report said today. The team’s officials are reviewing the pitch,
according to the newsletter.  A sale may depend on whether Jeff Vanderbeek, the former
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. executive who owns 47 percent of
the team, can buy the stake held by co-owner Ray Chambers, the
report said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
New York, declined to comment. Vanderbeek didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
