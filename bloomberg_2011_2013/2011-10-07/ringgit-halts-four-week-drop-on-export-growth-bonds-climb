Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a four-
week loss as the nation’s export growth quickened, while bonds
rose before Premier Najib Razak started his budget speech.  Exports rose 10.9 percent in August from a year earlier
after having increased 7.1 percent in July, the trade ministry
said today. The median estimate of 16 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 7.9 percent gain. In a statement
yesterday, Najib said he will announce policies to help citizens
cope with rising living costs, while remaining “fiscally
responsible.” European officials detailed plans yesterday to
contain the sovereign debt crisis, helping boost demand for
emerging-market assets.  “The focus will be on the budget and if the country’s
budget deficit is below 5 percent, it will be positive for the
ringgit in the short term,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a
currency strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur . “It will also take some of the external headwind
pressure off the domestic economy.”  The ringgit gained 0.6 percent today and 1.1 percent this
week to 3.1705 per dollar as of 4:16 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency slumped
7.2 percent in the previous four weeks.  Prime Minister Najib, who is also the finance minister, may
present a 2012 budget plan for government spending of 230.8
billion ringgit ($73 billion), 0.5 percent larger than this
year’s outlay, according to the Ministry of Finance’s 2011-2012
economic report today. Gross domestic product may expand 5
percent to 6 percent next year after growing as much as 5.5
percent in 2011. The  budget deficit  is forecast to narrow to 4.7
percent of GDP from 5.4 percent.  Government bonds  rose even as the treasury prepares to sell
more August 2014 bonds later this month, according to its sale
calendar. The yield on the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014
fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.10 percent
today, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
