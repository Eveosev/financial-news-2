Italy and  Spain  had their long-term
issuer default ratings cut by  Fitch Ratings , which cited factors
including their vulnerability to the “Euro zone crisis.”  Italy had its foreign and local currency long-term issuer
default ratings cut to ‘A+’ from ‘AA-,’ while Spain had the same
set of ratings cut to ‘AA-’ from ‘AA+.’ The outlook for both is
negative.  Fitch also said it was cutting its estimate of Spain’s
medium-term growth.  The ratings company maintained a rating watch negative on
 Portugal , indicating the nation may still be cut. Portugal’s
foreign and local currency long-term issuer default ratings are
‘BBB-.’ Fitch said it still intends to complete its review in
the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
