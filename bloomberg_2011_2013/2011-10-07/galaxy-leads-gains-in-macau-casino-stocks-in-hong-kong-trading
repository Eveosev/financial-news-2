Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  rose
the most in more than 2 1/2 years in Hong Kong trading, leading
gains in Macau casino stocks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
it is positive about growth prospects in high-stakes gambling.  Galaxy soared 18 percent, the most since January 2009, to
HK$12.40 at the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong after Goldman upgraded
the shares to “buy” from “neutral.” The company’s value
“has emerged after its 45 percent share price correction in the
last two months,” analysts including Simon Cheung at Goldman,
wrote in a note to investors.  Macau casinos soared for a second day, erasing most of a
decline from last week that was fueled by concern cooler
economic growth in  China  would damp demand and rising interest
rates would choke credit to gamblers visiting on junkets. Gaming
revenue for the first nine months of the year in the former
Portuguese colony exceeded the total amount for 2010, data
published Oct. 4 by the government showed.  “We remain positive on the long-term growth potential of
the VIP segment, which our analysis shows is not saturated,”
wrote Cheung. “Regarding credit supply, there are no noticeable
signs of bad debt in the junket system yet.”  Melco International Development Ltd. climbed 9 percent to
HK$5.47.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , controlled by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, rose 5 percent.  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , the biggest casino
operator in Asia, advanced 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
