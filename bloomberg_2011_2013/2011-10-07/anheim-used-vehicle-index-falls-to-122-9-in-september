The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index
fell for the fourth-consecutive month and may slide further to
the lowest in a year, the consultant’s economist said.  Manheim, whose index is determined through more than 5
million annual U.S. sales, said the measure dropped to 122.9 in
September. After reaching a record high in May, wholesale prices
dropped 2.5 percent during the third quarter, the most since
2008’s fourth quarter, the Marshall, Virginia-based company
 said .  “I fully expect that the Manheim index will show further
easing in the near term,” Tom Webb, Manheim’s chief economist,
said today on a conference call with analysts and reporters. “I
wouldn’t be surprised if the overall Manheim index tests the 120
level. I would be surprised if it tests the 115 level.”  The Japan tsunami in March that disrupted production led to
shortages of new vehicles and combined with higher gasoline
prices in contributing to a “sharp run-up” in used-vehicle
prices, especially compact cars, Webb said. Wholesale vehicle
prices are still 3.4 percent higher than a year earlier, Manheim
says.  Manheim’s index reached 127.8 in May, the highest in its
16-year history.  “What we have seen since May of this year is a clearing
out of some excesses,” Webb said on the conference call.  The Manheim index has exceeded 120 since October 2010 and
has stayed above 115 since July 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
