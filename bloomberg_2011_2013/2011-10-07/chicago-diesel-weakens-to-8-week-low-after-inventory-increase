Chicago  diesel slipped to an eight-
week low after inventories of the fuel gained during the demand
season for farming.  The ultra-low-sulfur grade in the Midwest rose 193,000
barrels to 26.8 million barrels last week, the Energy Department
reported. Diesel fuel use typically increases in the region
during the fall harvest season.  “You can’t really hold diesel, you’ve got to get rid of it
now,” said Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in Kansas City, Missouri. Additional supplies
may have been delivered off of the Explorer pipeline, which runs
from  Lake Charles , Louisiana, through Tulsa, Oklahoma, to
Hammond, Indiana, Mosby said.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago sank
2.25 cents to 0.25 cent a gallon versus heating oil futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:34 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
2.52 cents to $2.8609.  Jet fuel in the region gained 286,000 barrels to 8.49
million last week, the department said Oct. 5.  The premium versus heating oil for the fuel fell 1 cent to
5.25 cents. Prompt delivery slipped 1.27 cents to $2.9109 a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
