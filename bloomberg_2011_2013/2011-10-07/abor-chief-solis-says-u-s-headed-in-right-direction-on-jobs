U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said
a government report showing employers adding 103,000 jobs in
September “is a good indication that we’re going in the right
direction.”  “We need to do more,” Solis said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. The package of tax cuts and spending that
President  Barack Obama  proposed last month “will create,
hopefully, at least another 1 million jobs,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
