German stocks advanced, extending the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX) ’s rally to a third day, after a report
showed U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast in
September.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the luxury carmaker, jumped 4
percent. Tiremaker  Continental AG (CON)  increased 5.2 percent after
saying it plans to build a new factory in the U.S. to meet
higher demand.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
airline, rose 2 percent after Weser Kurier newspaper reported
Germany’s air travel tax may fall.  The DAX Index gained 1 percent to 5,701.79 at 3:28 p.m. in
 Frankfurt  after earlier falling as much as 0.7 percent. The
gauge jumped 8.2 percent in the past two days as investors
speculated European policy makers are working on measures to
shield banks from the debt crisis. The broader HDAX Index also
climbed 1.1 percent today.  “With the job creation numbers beyond expectations, these
figures will reassure the financial community that has been
totally depressed by the problems in the euro area,”  said John Plassard, director at Louis Capital Markets in Geneva.
“However, we must put these numbers into context and remember
that they may be dependent on seasonality. We will await
confirmation of these figures next month to begin to claim
victory.”  Economic Data  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised
57,000 increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of 60,000.
The gain reflected the return to work of 45,000
telecommunications employees. The jobless rate held at 9.1
percent.  Industrial production in  Germany  declined less than
economists forecast in August after surging in the previous
month. Output fell 1 percent from July, when it jumped 3.9

forecast a 2 percent decline, according to the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the year, production
rose 7.7 percent when adjusted for working days.  BMW rallied 4 percent to 50.84 euros as a gauge of European
automobile companies was among the best performers in the Stoxx
600.  Daimler AG (DAI)  gained 2.4 percent to 34.34 euros while
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  increased 1.8 percent to 101.35 euros.  Continental, the world’s fourth-biggest tiremaker, advanced
5.2 percent to 47.07 euros. The company said in a statement it
plans to spend more than $500 million to build a new tire
factory at Sumter,  South Carolina , to meet increasing demand.  Lufthansa, Germany’s flag-carrier, rose 2 percent to 9.74
euros after Bremen-based newspaper Weser Kurier reported German
