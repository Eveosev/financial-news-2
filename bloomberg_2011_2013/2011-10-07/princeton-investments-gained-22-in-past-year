Princeton University’s investments
returned 22 percent in the past fiscal year, matching the
performance of  Yale University , the top-performing Ivy League
school so far this year.  The endowment was valued at $17.1 billion as of June 30,
the Princeton,  New Jersey , school said today on its website.  Endowments at the richest U.S. universities have risen for
two consecutive years, following record losses in the aftermath
of the September 2008  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  bankruptcy.
The fund at Yale, in New Haven, Connecticut, gained 22 percent,
while investments at Harvard University, the world’s richest
school, increased 21 percent.  Over the past decade, Princeton’s investments generated an
average annual gain of 9.8 percent, compared with the 10 percent
increase of Yale, the 9.4 percent return of Harvard and the 9.3
percent increase of  Stanford University  near Palo Alto,
California.  Yale and Princeton are leading the Ivy League schools that
have reported results so far. The group consists of eight
selective private schools in the northeastern U.S.  The  University of Pennsylvania  in Philadelphia said Sept.
15 its $6.58 billion fund gained 19 percent, helped by rising
stock markets. Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said
Sept. 28 that its $5.35 billion fund climbed 20 percent.  Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, is the worst
performer so far in the  Ivy League . The university said Sept. 28
that investments rose 18 percent for the year ended June 30,
boosted by stocks and venture capital and gains across asset
classes. Investment returns helped increase the endowment to
$3.41 billion, after more than $40 million in new gifts and
transfers, partly offset by distributions, Dartmouth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
