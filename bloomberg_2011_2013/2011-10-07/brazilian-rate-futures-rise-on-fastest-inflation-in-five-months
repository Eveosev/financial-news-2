Brazil ’s real gained this week the
most since 2008 as larger-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs
fueled demand for higher-yielding assets and prompted bets the
central bank will let the currency rise to slow inflation.  The real climbed 0.5 percent to 1.7715 per dollar today,
from 1.7811 yesterday. The currency advanced 6.1 percent this
week, the most since the five-day period ended Nov. 28, 2008.  A government report showed U.S. employers added 103,000
jobs last month, compared with the median forecast of 60,000 in
a Bloomberg survey of economists. Brazil’s inflation accelerated
for a third straight month in September, limiting room for
policy makers to speed up the pace of interest-rate cuts.  A weaker currency “could hurt inflation” further, said
 Newton Rosa , an economist with Sul America Investimentos in  Sao
Paulo .  Yields on the interest rate futures contract due in January
2013 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.43
percent.  Brazil’s consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index,
rose 0.53 percent in September from the previous month, the
national statistics agency said today. Prices rose to a six-year
high of 7.31 percent from a year ago, while the central bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage
points.  Rate Cut  The central bank cut its benchmark Selic rate a half-point
to 12 percent in August, surprising all 62 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg who had expected policy makers to keep the rate
steady.  Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut
borrowing costs by 0.5 or 0.75 percentage point at their Oct.
18-19 policy meeting. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini
said yesterday that “moderate” cuts in  interest rates  will
help shield the economy from the European debt crisis and won’t
prevent inflation from slowing to the 4.5 percent target next
year.  The IPCA figures “limit the thesis of a 75 basis-point
cut” at the next monetary policy meeting, Alessandra Ribeiro,
an economist with Tendencias Consultoria Integrada, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Brazil will miss its inflation target this year for the
first time since 2003, according to a Sept. 30 central bank
survey. Consumer prices will rise 6.52 percent this year, and
5.53 percent in 2012, the survey found.  To contact the reporters on this story:
