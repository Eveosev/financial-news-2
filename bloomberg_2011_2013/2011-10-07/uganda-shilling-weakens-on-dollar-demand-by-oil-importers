Uganda ’s shilling weakened, extending
its decline against the U.S. currency this week, driven by
demand for dollars by oil importers.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 2,877.05, and traded 0.4
percent weaker at 2,870 by 12:11 p.m. in the capital, Kampala,
taking its decline this week to 0.7 percent.  “Dollar demand is coming in, especially from the energy
sector, which sought substantial amounts,” Ahmed Kalule, the
head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by
phone from Kampala. “A new month has just started and people
are seeking foreign currency for imports.”  Demand for the U.S. currency was boosted by the increase in
money supply today after the overnight borrowing rate in the
 interbank market  eased to 15 percent, he said. The average rate
was 19.67 percent in September, the central bank said on Oct. 4.  The shilling remains under pressure as importers seek the
greenback to bring in goods for sale during the Christmas
season, Kalule said. It may weaken to 2,895 by the end of next
week, he said.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 on Sept. 23, the weakest
since June 1993, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weaken
riskier assets further, increasing demand for dollars as a safe-
haven investment.  The currency has slipped 19.5 percent this year to the
dollar, making it the second-worst performer after  Kenya ’s
shilling. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 28.3 percent this month from 21.4
percent in August, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
