Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) ’s shareholders
Demetrio Carceller, Juan Abello and a group of Spanish banks are
asking Chairman Luis Del Rivero to consider selling assets to
repay debt, Cinco Dias reported, citing unidentified people
close to the builders’ board of directors.  The sale of assets will help to reduce a 4.9 billion euro
($6.5 billion) loan used to buy a stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , said
Cinco Dias. The loan matures in December and the builder is
seeking to refinance the transaction, Cinco Dias said.  Banks holding about two thirds of the loan would be willing
to continue as lenders in the transaction, the newspaper said.
Carceller has 12.1 percent of Sacyr, Abello 9.62 percent and the
group of banks, including Bankia and Novacaixagalicia, hold a
12.1 percent stake in the builder, Cinco Dias reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
