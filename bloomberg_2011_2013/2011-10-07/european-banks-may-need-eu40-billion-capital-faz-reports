European Union banks may need as much
as 40 billion euros ($53.7 billion) in fresh capital should they
write down the value of debt issued by some European countries,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing calculations by JP
Morgan.  The scenario is based on banks writing down the value of
their Greek government bond holdings by 60 percent, Portuguese
and Irish bonds by 40 percent and Italian and Spanish bonds by
20 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
