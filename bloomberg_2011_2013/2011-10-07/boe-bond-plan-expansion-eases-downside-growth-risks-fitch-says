The Bank of England’s expansion of
its bond-purchase plan yesterday by 75 billion pounds “is a
mitigant to the downside risks in the agency’s U.K. growth
forecast, rather than a reason to revise it upwards at this
stage,” the rating company said in a statement.  Earlier this month, Fitch cut its forecast for U.K. growth
in 2012 to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
