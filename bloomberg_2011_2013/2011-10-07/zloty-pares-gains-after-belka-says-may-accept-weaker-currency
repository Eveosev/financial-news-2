The Polish zloty pared gains versus
the euro after central bank Governor Marek Belka was quoted as
saying that the central bank may have to accept further currency
depreciations as foreign investors pull out from emerging
markets.  The zloty gained 0.5 percent to 4.3640 per euro as of 4:06
p.m. in Warsaw after earlier appreciating to as strong as 4.3509
before Belka’s comments were published on the central bank’s
Obserwatorfinansowy.pl website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
