Czech central bank board member  Eva Zamrazilova  said she is against a further reduction in the
bankâ€™s benchmark interest rate from the record low of 0.75
percent, Dow Jones reported.  Zamrazilova, who had voted for higher borrowing costs for a
year before the last policy meeting Sept. 22, prefers a wait-
and-see monetary approach, Dow Jones reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
