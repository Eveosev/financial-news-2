Speeding up the implementation of
 Europe ’s permanent rescue facility, the European Stability
Mechanism, could allow it to run along side with the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility, European Union Economic
Commissioner Olli Rehn said in comments to reporters in Helsinki
today.   “Discussions on speeding up the implementation of the
permanent stability mechanism are ongoing and my view and the
Commission’s view is that it would be good to speed it up from
summer 2013 to summer or some part of 2012,” Rehn said. “This
in part would add capacity and firepower for Europe in the
continued market turbulence and it would for its part help
increase confidence, especially since it would work in parallel
with the EFSF. This is why this is a sensible goal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
