Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, is set to receive 115 million pounds ($178
million) by Oct. 11 from ZF Friedrichshafen AG for its stake in
 Hansen Transmissions International NV. (HSN)   ZF, a German manufacturer of auto-parts and agricultural
machinery, said that all conditions of its 444.7 million pound,
or 66 pence a share, cash offer for Hansen have been satisfied
and declared unconditional, according to a  statement  on its
website.  Shareholders of Hansen, which makes gears for wind
turbines, will be paid for their stakes on or before Oct. 11, it
said. Suzlon’s AE-Rotor Holding BV unit holds 26.06 percent of
Hansen.  Suzlon, controlled by billionaire Tulsi Tanti, needs funds
to buy out minority stockholders that own 4.8 percent in its
German unit,  Repower Systems AG. (RPW)  The Indian company also needs
cash for next year, when loan repayments start and $389 million
in convertible bonds mature.  The Ahmedabad-based company got 224 million pounds in
November 2009 by selling a 35 percent stake in Hansen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
