The citrus crop in the Mediterranean
basin is forecast to be little changed in the 2011-12 season as
bigger harvests in Italy and  Turkey  make up for fewer oranges in
Spain, the European Fresh Produce Organization said.  Citrus production in the region may slip to 18.48 million
metric tons from 18.54 million tons in 2010-11, the Brussels-
based industry lobby, known as Freshfel, said in a  report  on its
website dated yesterday.  The Mediterranean Sea countries grow about 14 percent of
the world’s oranges, based on  data  from the  United Nations ’  Food
and Agriculture Organization . The region’s combined output
exceeds that of the U.S., the world’s second-biggest grower
after  Brazil , U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Spain as a leading producing country will experience a
production decrease by 11 percent after the peak level reached
last year,” Freshfel said. “Southern Mediterranean countries
are heading for a production increase.”  The region’s orange production is forecast to climb 1.8
percent to 9.74 million tons from 9.56 million tons, the group
said. That compares with U.S. production of 7.96 million tons in
2010-11, based on September  estimates  by the USDA.  Spain ’s orange crop, the biggest in the Mediterranean, is
forecast to fall 10 percent to 2.69 million tons, according to
Freshfel. Italy’s 2011-12 orange harvest will rise 18 percent to
2.3 million tons, the report showed.  Turkey will lift orange production by 10 percent to 1.39
million tons and  Egypt ’s orange crop is forecast to be little
changed at 1.7 million tons, Freshfel said. Greek orange output
will slide 23 percent to 525,000 tons, it said.  The region’s production of “easy peelers,” which includes
clementines, mandarins and tangelos, will slump 8.4 percent to
4.97 million tons, Freshfel forecast. The lemon harvest in the
Mediterranean basin will increase 5.9 percent to 3.1 million
tons and grapefruit production will rise 24 percent to 665,200
tons, according to the outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
