India ’s food inflation accelerated to
a three-week high, maintaining pressure on the central bank to
raise  interest rates  further.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products gained 9.41 percent in the week ended Sept. 24 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement in  New
Delhi  today. It rose 9.13 percent the previous week.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has to
weigh the risks to economic growth posed by  Europe ’s sovereign-
debt crisis and a faltering recovery in the U.S. when he
announces the next rate decision on Oct. 25. Higher food costs
have contributed in keeping India’s benchmark wholesale-price
inflation at more than 9 percent since the start of December.  “Inflationary pressures in India have refused to abate,”
 Anubhuti Sahay , a Mumbai-based economist at Standard Chartered
Plc, said before the report. She expects the central bank to
boost its repurchase rate by a quarter of a percentage point to
8.5 percent this month.  The yield on the 8.08 percent securities due August 2022
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.68
percent as of 12:32 p.m. in Mumbai. The Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index increased 3.3 percent, and the rupee
strengthened 0.5 percent to 49.12 against the dollar.  Food inflation gained as prices of vegetables rose 14.9
percent in the week to Sept. 24 from a year earlier, today’s
report showed. It rose 12 percent the previous week. Prices of
eggs, meat and fish advanced 10.3 percent and milk costs jumped
10.4 percent, according to the report.  Subbarao has increased the central bank’s repurchase rate
12 times since mid-March 2010 by a total of 350 basis points,
the fastest round of increases since the  Reserve Bank  was
established in 1935, Bloomberg data show.  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August. The inflation rate
remains above the level the central bank deems acceptable,
Subbarao said Sept. 26, underscoring that pressure remains for
monetary tightening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
