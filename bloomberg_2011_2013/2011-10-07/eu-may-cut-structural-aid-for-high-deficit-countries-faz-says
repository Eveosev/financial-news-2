The European Commission proposed
cutting countries’ access to structural aid funds if they
repeatedly breach the region’s Stability and Growth Pact, the
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing a presentation
by European Regional Affairs Commissioner Johannes Hahn.  The Commission plans to make concrete proposals to
governments whose budgets violate the region’s deficit and debt
limits on how to use structural aid to generate growth, FAZ
said. If countries don’t fall in line, aid payments will be
partially or completely cut, according to a commission proposal
for structural policy between 2014 and 2020, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
