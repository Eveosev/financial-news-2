Decisions on whether to inject
capital into domestic banks are up to governments in the
European Union, Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the European
Commission said today.  “The decision to refinance banks is a decision that has to
be taken by member states on the basis of national supervisors’
assessments” coordinated with the European Banking Authority,
said Bailly. The Commission will soon propose ways to coodinate
possible recapitalizations, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
