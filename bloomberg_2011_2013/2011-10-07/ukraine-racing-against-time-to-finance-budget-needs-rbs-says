Ukraine is “racing against time” to
cope with an “acutely challenging balance-of-payments
position” and raise sufficient funds to cover the budget,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Budget financing “looks strained to year-end, and it is
difficult to see how the government will be able to cover budget
financing needs, with likely limited  market access  and given the
likely demands of pre-election spending,” Tim Ash, head of
emerging-market strategy at RBS in  London , said in an e-mailed
report today following meetings in Kiev with bankers, diplomats
and central bank and government officials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
