Air Canada (AC/A)  passengers at Toronto’s
Pearson International Airport are experiencing flight delays of
as long as two hours because of a job action by workers who
handle security screening at checkpoints.  Employees of  Garda World Security Corp. (GW) , a subcontractor
for the  Canadian Air Transport Security Authority , are involved
in a “go-slow” work action, the Toronto Star reported. Backups
at the checkpoints are forcing Air Canada to postpone some
departures, said Peter Fitzpatrick, an airline spokesman.  “This disruption is having a significant negative
effect,” Fitzpatrick said today in a telephone interview.  International and trans-border flights face the longest
delays, although some domestic flights have also been affected,
Fitzpatrick said. He said about 100,000 people are flying from
Pearson today, an increased volume because of the Canadian long
weekend for Thanksgiving.  Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for Montreal-based Garda, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
