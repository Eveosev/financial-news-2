American Welding & Tank LLC was fined
$3.88 million for manufacturing and selling flawed tanks
designed to carry a hazardous farm chemical, anhydrous ammonia,
the U.S. Transportation Department said.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration sanctioned
the Fremont, Ohio-based company after an investigation turned up
“a clear pattern of AWT failing to manufacture, maintain,
repair and sell” tanks that meet federal hazardous-materials
standards, the agency said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  “When cargo-tank manufacturers are not living up to
federal safety standards, we will take action,” said FMCSA
Administrator Anne Ferro.  American Welding & Tank  has always met federal guidelines
for its tanks and isn’t aware of any incidence of injury or
property damage from a pinhole defect in the anhydrous ammonia
tanks it manufactures, said Tom Becker, a company spokesman.  The company “will vigorously oppose any attempt by the
Department of Transportation to impose a fine,” Becker said in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
