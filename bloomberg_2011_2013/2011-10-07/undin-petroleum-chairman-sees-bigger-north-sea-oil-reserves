Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE)  may
“significantly” raise estimated reserves from the biggest oil
discovery in  Norway  in 20 years, Chairman Lukas Lundin said.  The offshore fields of Avaldsnes and nearby Aldous Major
South may contain an estimated 1.2 billion to 2.6 billion
barrels of recoverable oil, up from a previous estimate of a
combined 500 million to 1.2 billion, Lundin Petroleum said in a
statement last month.  “It’s going to be bigger than we think it is,” and will
help lift shares of the Stockholm-based  oil company , Lundin said
yesterday in an interview at his office in downtown Vancouver.
“This is going to produce oil for 40 years.”  Lundin Petroleum and partner  Statoil ASA (STL)  are continuing to
drill near the discoveries and may begin studying later this
year how to best develop the finds. Lundin Petroleum has the
greatest potential among Lundin Group’s publicly traded
companies to outstrip investor expectations in the next year,
Lundin said in the interview.  Statoil operates the Aldous Major North and South
exploration license, in which Petoro AS holds 30 percent,  Det
Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR)  20 percent and Lundin 10 percent. Lundin
holds 40 percent in the Avaldsnes license, in which Maersk Oil
owns 20 percent and Statoil 40 percent.  “You need one big asset that drives the company through
good and bad times and this is that kind of asset,” he said.  Lundin Petroleum fell 2 kronor, or 1.6 percent, to 127
kronor in Stockholm Stock Exchange trading at 5:29 p.m local
time.  Statoil rose 1.7 kroner, or 1.3 percent, to 130.20 kroner
in Oslo Stock Exchange trading at 5:25 p.m local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
