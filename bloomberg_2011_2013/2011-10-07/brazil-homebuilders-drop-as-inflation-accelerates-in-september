Brazilian homebuilders slumped as
traders pared bets for further interest-rate cuts after
inflation accelerated for a third straight month during
September in  Latin America ’s largest economy.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) , Brazil’s sixth-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, declined 2.7 percent to 9.09 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo . Rival PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes fell 4.3 percent to 6.25 reais, while MRV
Engenharia & Participacoes SA dropped 1.4 percent to 10.10
reais. The benchmark Bovespa index slumped 2 percent.  “There is a big fear on the investors’ side that inflation
will compromise people’s income,” Armando Halfeld, an analyst
at brokerage Ativa SA, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de
Janeiro . “That could make people take on fewer loans” to
purchase new homes, he said.  Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts
maturing in January 2012 or later rose. The contract maturing in
January 2013 advanced seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 10.43 percent.  Consumer prices in  Brazil , as measured by the IPCA index,
rose 0.53 percent in September from the previous month, the
national statistics agency said today, the fastest increase
since April. That was in line with analyst expectations for a
0.54 percent rise, according to the median estimate of 51
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose 7.31 percent from a
year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
