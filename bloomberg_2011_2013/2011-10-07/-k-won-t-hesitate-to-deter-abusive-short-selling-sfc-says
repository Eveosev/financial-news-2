Commission “will not hesitate to take immediate action to deter
any manipulative or abusive short selling practices,” Ashley
Alder, chief executive officer of the regulator, said in a
website statement today.  “There has to date been no indication that recent declines
in the Hong Kong stock market have been caused by short selling
activities,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
