Brazil ’s inflation accelerated for
the third straight month, limiting room for the central bank to
speed up the pace of interest-rate cuts.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index, rose 0.53
percent in September from the previous month, the national
 statistics agency  said today, the fastest increase since April.
That was in line with analyst expectations for a 0.54 percent
rise, according to the median estimate of 51 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Prices rose 7.31 percent from a year ago.  Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut
borrowing costs by 0.5 or 0.75 percentage point at their Oct.
18-19 policy meeting. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini
said yesterday that “moderate” cuts in  interest rates  will
help shield the economy from the European debt crisis and won’t
prevent inflation from slowing to the 4.5 percent target next
year.  The central bank surprised economists by cutting its
benchmark Selic rate a half-point to 12 percent in August.  Price increases for food, transport, fuel and residential
rents contributed to the acceleration in inflation last month,
the agency said.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2013 rose five basis points to 10.41 percent at 8:11 a.m. New
York time. The real was little changed at 1.7807 per  U.S. dollar 
after strengthening 2.8 percent yesterday.  Brazil will miss its inflation target this year for the
first time since 2003, according to a Sept. 30 central bank
survey. Consumer prices will rise 6.52 percent this year, and
5.53 percent in 2012, the survey found.  Brazil targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Editors: Harry Maurer,  To contact the reporters on this story:
