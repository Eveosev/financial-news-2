Credit Suisse Group AG maintained its
forecast for  Thailand ’s economic growth this year, though said
flooding across much of the nation could trim gross domestic
product by as much as 0.3 percentage point.  “The final impact will depend on how much the governments
spend on reconstruction and how soon production activities can
resume,” Credit Suisse wrote today in a report.  Credit Suisse expects Thailand’s economy to grow 3.5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
