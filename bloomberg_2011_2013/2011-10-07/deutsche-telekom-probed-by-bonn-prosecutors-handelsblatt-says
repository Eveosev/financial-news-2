Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is being
investigated by prosecutors in Bonn on the ground that it may
have charged too much for supplying directory assistance
information to rivals,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Friedrich Apostel, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office.  Deutsche Telekom denied any wrongdoing, the newspaper said,
citing a spokesperson it didn’t identify.  Telephone calls to Apostel and to Deutsche Telekom’s press
office outside normal business hours weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
