British American Investment Co.,
which started trading on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  on Sept. 8,
fell for the first day in four as investors took “short-term
gains,” an analyst said.  Shares in the diversified financial services group fell 4.8
percent to 5.90 shillings as of 1:29 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, the lowest level since Oct. 4.  “The previous week it was among the top gainers,” Renaldo D’souza, an analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd. said
in a phone interview today. “We are seeing people who got in
around 5.85 shillings taking short-term gains, that’s why
sustaining the price gains is difficult”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
