Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  won European Union
approval to buy Skype Technologies SA in an $8.5 billion deal
adding the world’s most popular Web-calling service to the
biggest software maker.  The deal won’t harm competition in the region, partly
because of the presence of rivals such as Google Inc., the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The investigation found that the parties’ activities
mainly overlap for video communications, where Microsoft is
active through its Windows Live Messenger,” the commission
said. “However, the commission considers that there are no
competition concerns in this growing market where numerous
players, including Google, are present.”  Microsoft agreed in May to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype,
with 170 million active users, from investors led by private
equity firm  Silver Lake . The acquisition, Microsoft’s largest,
is also the biggest Internet takeover in more than a decade.
