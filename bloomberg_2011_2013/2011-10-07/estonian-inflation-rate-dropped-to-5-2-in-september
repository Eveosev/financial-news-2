Estonian consumer-price growth slowed
in September from the previous month as food prices and
communication costs declined.  Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 5.5 percent increase in August, the fastest
increase in six months, the Tallinn-based statistics office said
today on its website. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of three analysts was 4.9 percent. Prices rose 0.5 percent from
the previous month.  Confidence of Estonian consumers fell in September to the
lowest level in 17 months on a worsening outlook for personal
and state finances, according to European Commission data.  Inflation will probably slow “gradually” in coming
months, the  Finance Ministry  said last month. Still, it raised
its forecast for average annual inflation to 4.9 percent this
year from April forecast of 4.5 percent due to higher raw
material costs and growing prices of services. The ministry
expects consumer price growth to slow to 2.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
