The ruble weakened against the
currencies of its major trading partners in September, stripping
out the effect of inflation, the central bank said.  The so-called real effective ruble rate fell 3.3 percent
last month after losing 3.6 percent in August, the bank said on
its website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
