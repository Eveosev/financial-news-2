lender, pared losses and the forint gained after larger-than-
forecast growth in U.S. jobs tempered concern that the world’s
largest economy was slowing.  OTP’s shares erased losses of as much as 3.4 percent to
trade down 0.3 percent at 3,260 forint at 2:46 p.m. in Budapest.
The benchmark BUX index slumped 1.1 percent, paring a slide of
as much as 2.8 percent. Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.4
percent to 295.64 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
