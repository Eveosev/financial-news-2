Plans to stockpile coffee in  Vietnam ,
the world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, may limit
exports early in the season, according to Morgan Stanley.  Exporters in the Southeast Asian nation agreed to stockpile
420,000 metric tons of beans in 2011-12,  Luong Van Tu , chairman
of the country’s Coffee & Cocoa Association, said Sept. 27.
Vietnam will produce 1.25 million tons in the season that
started this month, Nicolas Tamari, managing director at
Sucafina SA, a Geneva-based green-coffee trader with offices in
Vietnam, said in a Sept. 30 interview.  “The government plans to stockpile coffee beans to prevent
a repeat of last year’s stock-out could reduce early season
exports,”  Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research at
Morgan Stanley in  New York , said in a report e-mailed today.  Prospects for the crop are “generally favorable on good
weather and a larger cultivated area,” he said.  Robusta coffee for November delivery rose $8, or 0.4
percent, to $2,033 a ton by 9:13 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London,
reducing this year’s drop to 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
