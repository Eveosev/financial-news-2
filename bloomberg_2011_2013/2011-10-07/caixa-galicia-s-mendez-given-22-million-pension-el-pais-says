Jose Luis Mendez, who led  Spain ’s
Caixa Galicia before it was merged and seized by regulators, got
16.5 million euros ($22.2 million) in severance and pension pay,
a record among the nation’s savings banks, El Pais reported.  The money brings to 40 million euros the total disclosed
for executives who retired from savings banks in Spain’s Galicia
region that were merged into Novacaixagalicia, the  newspaper 
said, without citing a source. A Novacaixagalicia spokeswoman
said the bank wouldn’t comment on the report.  The 11.2 million-euro after-tax amount for Mendez, the ex-
general manager who led Caixa Galicia for 29 years, was first
disclosed by news website El Confidencial yesterday, the same
day the new bank told unions it can no longer contribute money
to charities, El Pais said.  The merged savings banks became a commercial lender last
month and then were taken over by the Bank of Spain on Sept. 30
after failing to meet a capital deadline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
