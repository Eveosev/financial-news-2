An unidentified man threw two smoke
bombs at the main entrance of  Bulgaria ’s Parliament while 240
lawmakers inside were querying Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  and
seven ministers.  Police detained a man estimated to be aged between 35 and
40, who refused to give his name and did not have identification
documents with him, Hristo Kraevski, head of the assembly’s
press office, told reporters in Sofia today. There were no
casualties or damages.  Bulgaria’s Parliament was last attacked in 1997, when
hundreds of protesters demanding the resignation of then
Socialist Prime Minister Zhan Videnov besieged the assembly and
broke into the building during a night session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
