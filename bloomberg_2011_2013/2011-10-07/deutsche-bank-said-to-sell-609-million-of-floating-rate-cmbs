Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  sold $609 million in
bonds backed by commercial property loans in the first offering
of its type since 2007.  The securities carrying top grades and maturing in 4.21
years yield 2.85 percent more than the London interbank offered
rate, according to a person familiar with the offering. Bonds
with the lowest investment-grade yield 8 percent over the
lending benchmark, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t public.  The transaction is the first so-caller floater to bundle
debt from multiple borrowers since the commercial-mortgage  bond
market  slammed shut in 2008 as losses on home-loan debt spread
through the financial system and froze credit markets. The deal
contains 7 loans on 52 properties, including $225 million in
debt on the Hotel Del Coronado in  San Diego .  Wall Street banks are offloading loans made before  Europe ’s
crisis of confidence shook debt markets in August and September
causing investors to shy away from all but the safest
securities. The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds instead of Treasuries jumped to 323
basis points, or 3.23 percentage points on Oct. 4, the most
since February 2010, according to Barclays Capital index data.
Spreads on the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super Duper Index have
widened from 178 on April 26, the index data show.  Floating-rate loans, which are short-term and give property
owners more flexibility to pay off the debt early, are often
taken out when owners are anticipating a significant boost in
income from the properties, and can be riskier for investors.  Lenders have issued about $25.6 billion in commercial-
mortgage backed securities this year, compared with about $11.5
billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales plummeted to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with a record
$234 billion in 2007, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
