Taiwan paid 47 percent more to import
liquefied natural gas in September while purchases rose 2
percent from a year earlier, according to data from the
 Directorate General of Customs.   Asia ’s third-biggest LNG buyer imported about 1.06 million
metric tons of the fuel last month and paid an average $765 a
ton, according to the data on the customs website. That is
equivalent to about $14.7 per million British thermal units, or
four times the U.S. benchmark gas price.  Taiwan bought five spot cargoes from Nigeria,  Egypt , Norway
and  Equatorial Guinea  for an average price of $825 a ton,
according to the data. That’s about $5.6 per million Btu higher
than the front month U.K. contract used to price spot supplies
to Asia, according to calculations based on Bloomberg data.  Taiwan purchased six spot shipments, including one from
Oman, in September 2010 for an average $465 a ton, according to
customs data.  Term supplies, typically indexed to crude-oil prices, from
Malaysia last month were the most expensive at about $1,076 a
ton, according to customs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
