Australia ’s Greens party withheld its
support for the government’s A$300 million steel-transformation
program that formed part of the carbon-tax proposal, the
Australian newspaper reported, citing the party’s deputy leader,
 Christine Milne .  The minority Labor government’s proposal to assist the
industry was designed to combat higher production costs and a
stronger Australian dollar, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
