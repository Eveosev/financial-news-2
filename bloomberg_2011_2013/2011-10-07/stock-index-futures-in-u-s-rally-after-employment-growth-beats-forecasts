U.S. stock-index futures and
commodities rallied, erasing earlier losses, while Treasuries
and the dollar tumbled after larger-than-forecast growth in jobs
tempered concern that the economy was slowing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 1.1 percent to 1,170.8 at 8:40 a.m. in  New
York , after losing as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The S&P GSCI
Index of 24 commodities rose 0.8 percent, extending its three-
day advance to 6.2 percent for the best rally over a similar
time period since 2009. Ten-year Treasury yields climbed 12
basis points to 2.11 percent and the Dollar Index lost 0.5
percent. European equities reversed earlier declines.  Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month, Labor Department data showed. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of
60,000. The gain including the return to work of 45,000 striking
telecommunications employees. The jobless rate held at 9.1
percent.  "We’re not going into a recession," Nick Sargen, chief
investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in
Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
more than $38 billion. "The market likes the report because the
expectations were so much lower. People were overly
pessimistic."  U.S. stocks rallied for a third day yesterday, extending
the  S&P 500 ’s rebound from a one-year intraday low on Oct. 4 to
8.4 percent, as European officials detailed plans to tame the
sovereign debt crisis and reports on retail sales and jobless
claims tempered concern that the economy would relapse into a
recession.  Fourth Quarter Predictions  Wall Street strategists say the S&P 500 will post the
biggest fourth-quarter rally in 13 years even after they cut
forecasts at a rate exceeded only during the credit crisis.  The benchmark index for U.S. stocks will climb 15 percent
in the fourth quarter to end 2011 at 1,300, according to the
average estimate of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
last time they were this bullish in October was 2008, when the
group predicted a 27 percent gain and the index lost 18 percent.  The S&P 500 sank 14 percent in the third quarter and this
week came within 1 percent of extending its decline from its
April peak to 20 percent on a closing basis, the common
definition of a  bear market . The slump pushed the index to 12
times reported earnings, the cheapest valuation level since
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
