Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Alan Greenspan  said “at 2,000 basis points over bunds, the
interest rates for  Greece  are not sustainable.”  “Are they broke? Yeah, I think they’re broke,” he said in
an interview on CNBC television today. “Are they going to
resolve the situation in and of themselves? I can’t see how.”  “There is no credible scenario of which I’m aware in which
they can get by without very significant haircuts in their
sovereign debt,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
