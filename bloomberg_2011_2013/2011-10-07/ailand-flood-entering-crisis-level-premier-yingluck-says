Thailand ’s worst floods in more than
half a century are at a “crisis level” and may soon threaten
the capital, Bangkok, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said.  “This will have a direct impact on Bangkok,” Yingluck
said today in a televised address. “We have to admit that this
is more serious than in the past.”  Seasonal flooding over the past two months has killed 252
people and displaced millions more in 59 of Thailand’s 77
provinces, Yingluck said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
