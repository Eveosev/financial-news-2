Mexican consumer prices rose less
than economists expected in September, pushing the annual rate
of inflation to its second-lowest level in five years.  Consumer prices rose 0.25 percent in September from the
previous month, below expectations for a 0.29 percent increase
according to the median estimate of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Prices rose 3.14 percent from a year ago, the national
statistics agency said today on its website.  Mexicans paid 0.6 percent more for electricity and 0.94
percent extra for gasoline last month, while prices for fruit
and vegetables declined 1.5 percent, the report showed.  Core
inflation , excluding items such as energy and food, rose 0.27
percent, the agency said.  “We don’t think inflation will be a relevant topic in the
short term,” Julian Cubero Calvo, a BBVA Bancomer SA economist
in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview before the report.
Cubero’s 0.20 percent forecast for monthly inflation was the
lowest of the 19 estimates. Education costs jumped 2 percent
last month as students returned to classes.  The September result was the lowest since a 3.04 percent
reading in March and the second-lowest since July, 2006.
Mexico’s central bank targets inflation of 3 percent plus or
minus a percentage point.  Economists surveyed by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit have
tempered their inflation forecasts in recent weeks. In the most
recent bi-weekly survey published Oct. 4, economists saw
inflation ending this year at 3.4 percent, compared with 3.43
percent on Sept. 20, and 3.5 percent on Sept. 6.  Growth  “The balance of risks in  Mexico  still calls for a
relatively neutral monetary policy, which is precisely where we
stand today,” central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said at
the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in  New York  on Sept. 15. “There
may be circumstances in the future that call for lower rates.”  Mexico’s economy grew 3.74 percent in July from a year
earlier. Mexico’s economic growth is slowing this year from 5.4
percent in 2010 as a global economic slowdown reduces sales to
the U.S., the market for 80 percent of the country’s exports.  The central bank, which on Aug. 10 cut this year’s forecast
for growth to between 3.8 percent and 4.8 percent from between 4
percent and 5 percent, said Aug. 26 it would consider cutting
 interest rates  if the economic outlook worsened.  The central bank’s five-member board next meets on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
