Widowers of state workers in
 Mauritania  will be able to receive their wives’ pensions,
reversing a rule that only allowed women who outlived their
public-employee husbands to receive benefits, Agence
Mauritanienne d’Information reported.  Children will also receive pensions in both cases, the
state-owned  news agency  said, citing a weekly government
meeting in Nouakchott, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
