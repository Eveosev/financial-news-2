Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s
government may consider amnesties on such things as  tax evasion 
or illegal construction as part of an “historic” effort to cut
 debt, a lawmaker with the ruling coalition said.  “We may consider all the measures of fiscal nature, plus
amnesties, real-estate sales provided that they are part of an
historic effort and they are not one-time measures,” Maurizio
Gasparri, a lawmaker with Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party,
said at a conference near Siena, Italy, today.  Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  has opposed new amnesties
on tax evasion that have been used in the past to raise funds
while encouraging Italians to declare assets hidden abroad.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
