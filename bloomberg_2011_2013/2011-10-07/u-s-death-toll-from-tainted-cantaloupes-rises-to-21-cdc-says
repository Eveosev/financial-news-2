The U.S. listeria outbreak linked to
contaminated cantaloupes has expanded to 24 states including  New
York  and has now killed 21 people, the  Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention  said.  The deadliest U.S. foodborne illness outbreak in more than
a decade has sickened 109 people and has been linked to one
miscarriage, the CDC said today in an  update  on its website. The
agency earlier  reported  that as of Oct. 3, laboratory tests had
confirmed that 100 people in 20 states had fallen ill from the
tainted melons, and 18 died.  New York,  Iowa ,  Oregon  and South Dakota are the states
newly identified as being part of the outbreak, with one case
each, the agency said. The New York resident sickened by the
melons is among the 21 people in 11 states who have died.  The listeria outbreak is the first-ever tied to cantaloupe.
Jensen Farms of Granada,  Colorado , recalled the contaminated
fruit on Sept. 14. The  Food and Drug Administration  is working
with Colorado health officials to learn how the contamination
occurred.  Listeria, a bacterium often found in soil and water,
sickens about 1,600 people and kills about 260 in the U.S. each
year, according to the CDC.  Animals  can carry and transmit the
germ without appearing ill. Pregnant women, the elderly and
those with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk from
listeria infections. Symptoms include fever and diarrhea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
