Soares da Costa SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s
third-biggest publicly traded builder, said it plans to continue
expanding abroad while cutting jobs at home, where it faces a
slump in government infrastructure spending.  The Oporto-based builder began a legal process in April to
dismiss workers by “mutual consent,” it said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. That process has so far resulted in
about 250 job cuts, the company said.  In a “worst-case scenario,” Soares da Costa will cut as
many as 900 jobs, said a company spokeswoman, who declined to be
named, citing company policy. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Castro Henriques said Sept. 2 the company was looking to acquire
a “medium-sized” company in  Brazil  next year.  Soares da Costa cut its full-year revenue forecast to 925
million euros ($1.2 billion) from 1 billion euros on Aug. 31,
citing a “serious crisis” in demand in Portugal, where the
economy is expected to contract 2.2 percent this year and
between 2.2 percent and 2.3 percent in 2012, according to
government estimates.  Mota Engil SGPS SA is Portugal’s biggest publicly traded
builder in terms of market value and Teixeira Duarte SA is the
second biggest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
