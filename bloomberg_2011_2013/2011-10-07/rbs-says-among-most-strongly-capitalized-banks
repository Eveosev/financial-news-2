Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  said
it is one of the most strongly capitalized banks in Europe
following a newspaper report saying it might need extra capital
after a new round of European Union stress tests.  “The design of any new application of the EU stress tests
is completely up in the air,” RBS said in an e-mailed statement
following the story in the Financial Times. “Any analysis of
how any bank will be affected is nothing more than
speculation.”  European lenders may need as much as 200 billion
euros ($269 billion) of additional capital, according to the
International Monetary Fund’s European head Antonio Borges.  “RBS reported an 11.1 percent Core Tier 1 capital ratio as
at 30 June 2011, which places us among the strongest capitalized
banks in  Europe ,” the bank said.  Moody’s Investors Service today cut the senior debt and
deposit ratings of 12 U.K. financial institutions including RBS,
concluding the government would be less likely to provide
support for them if they became financially troubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
