Russian  consumer confidence  rose in
the third quarter as the inflation rate declined to the lowest
level in a year, boosting household purchasing power.  Confidence in the economy improved 2 points to minus 7,
matching the highest level since the April-June period of last
year, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Twenty-one percent of Russians expect the economy to
improve in the next 12 months, down from 22 percent in the
second quarter, while 20 percent predict a deterioration,
unchanged from the previous three months, the report said.  The annual rate of inflation slowed to 7.2 percent in
September from 8.2 percent a month earlier, boosting domestic
demand and allowing households to sustain spending. The central
bank is targeting a year-end rate of 6 percent to 7 percent,
which would be the lowest since the collapse of the  Soviet Union 
in 1991.  Retail sales surged the most in a year in August as
unemployment dropped to 6.1 percent from 6.5 percent in July,
matching the lowest level since August 2008.  Russian consumer confidence fell to as low as minus 35 in
the first quarter of 2009. The index has only been positive
three times since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
