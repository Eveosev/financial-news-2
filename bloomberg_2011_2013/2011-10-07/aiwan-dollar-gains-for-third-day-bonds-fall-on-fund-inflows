Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to its
strongest level this week and bonds fell as international funds
boosted holdings of local stocks on optimism the island’s
economy will withstand the fallout of slowing global growth.  Overseas funds bought $249 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold yesterday, the most in three weeks, and added
another $92.7 million today, according to exchange data. The
island’s exports rose 9.9 percent in September from a year
earlier, following a 7.2 percent increase in August, the
government reported toward the end of  currency trading .  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to NT$30.493
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$30.460
earlier, its strongest level this week. It was little changed
from a week ago. Local financial markets will be closed for the
National Day holiday on Oct. 10.  “Looks like Taiwan’s economy is still doing fine, and
investors are also hoping  Europe ’s crisis won’t get any worse,”
said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay
United Bank Co. “Trading volume is thin before the long
weekend.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due
September 2021 rose three basis points today and two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week to 1.295 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.395 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
