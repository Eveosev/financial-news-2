Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
 United Russia  party rose in polls following a congress where he
was backed for a return to the presidency.  United Russia’s approval rating advanced 4 percentage
points to 45 percent in the week after the party’s congress, the
Moscow-based All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion,
known as VTsIOM, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
Communist Party, with the second-biggest following, was
unchanged at 13 percent.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  said at the Sept. 24 meeting that
United Russia should support Putin to return as president next
year. Putin said Medvedev may take his place as prime minister.
Neither politician is officially a member of the party, which
backs policies shared by the so-called ruling tandem.  The next president is a choice “made by the people,”
Medvedev said in an interview with federal television channels
last month. “Any public figure can let an election slip away,
together with his political movement.”  The poll, conducted Oct. 1-2, included 1,600 people in 46
regions across  Russia  and had a margin of error of 3.4
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
