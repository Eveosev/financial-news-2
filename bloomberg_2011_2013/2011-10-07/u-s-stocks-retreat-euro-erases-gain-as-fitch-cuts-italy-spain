U.S. stocks fell, halting a three-day
rally, and the euro erased earlier gains versus the dollar after
 Fitch Ratings  downgraded the government debt of Spain and Italy.
Treasuries retreated, pushing 10-year note yields toward their
biggest weekly increase since July.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.7 percent to
1,157.36 at 12:34 p.m. in  New York  after climbing 6 percent in
the previous three sessions. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to
$1.3429 after climbing as much as 0.7 percent. The 10-year note
yield increased nine basis points to 2.08 percent and has
climbed 16 points in five days.  Faster-than-forecast growth in U.S. employment was
overshadowed by concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen. Italy
had its foreign and local currency long-term issuer default
ratings cut to ‘A+’ from ’AA-,’ while  Spain  had the same
set of ratings cut to ‘AA-’ from ‘AA+.’ The outlook for both is
negative.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
