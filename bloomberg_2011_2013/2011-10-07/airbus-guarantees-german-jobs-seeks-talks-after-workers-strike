Airbus SAS said it offered to secure
jobs in  Germany  until the end of 2020 as management seeks to
resume contract negotiations after a work stoppage today at four
sites making aircraft and components.  Airbus employees in Hamburg and three other German
production locations left work for several hours and gathered
for rallies. Labor union leaders had called for the action to
protest management demands for productivity increases.  About 2,500 workers left their positions in Hamburg, said
Florian Seidel, a spokesman for Airbus Germany. He didn’t have
an immediate estimate for turnout in Bremen, Stade, and
Buxtehude, which have smaller workforces.  Workers and management have been tussling over a new accord
that will run through 2020. Management has offered job
guarantees and is seeking 8 percent productivity increases.
Workers say that’s too much and are seeing 2 percent
productivity gains instead.  “We think the way is now clear for negotiators on both
sides to get back to the table for constructive talks,” Seidel
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
