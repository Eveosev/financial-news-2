Manila Electric Co. (MER) , the  Philippines ’
largest power retailer, said the Energy Regulatory Commission
ordered a reduction in its distribution rate, limiting an
increase in total electricity costs this month.  The Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the company, also
known as Meralco, to cut its maximum average distribution rate
to 1.6012 pesos per kilowatthour from 1.6464 pesos, the
Philippines’ largest power retailer said in a disclosure to the
stock exchange. This distribution charge will be in effect at
least until June 2012.  “The reduction in Meralco charges under performance-based
regulation will mitigate the impact of a higher generation this
October,” it said. The average increase of its private power
suppliers’ rates was 31.6 centavos per kilowatthour and caused
by more expensive liquid fuel, lower dispatch and the peso’s
depreciation, Manila Electric said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
