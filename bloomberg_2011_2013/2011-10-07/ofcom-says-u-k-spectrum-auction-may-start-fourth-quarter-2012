A U.K. auction of mobile-phone
frequencies for high-speed networks will be delayed to at least
the fourth quarter of 2012 after operators including  Telefonica
SA (TEF)  and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  objected to the auction design.  The spectrum sale, which may raise as much 2.6 billion
pounds ($4.1 billion), was intended for the first quarter of
next year after more than two years of delays. Regulator Ofcom
will consult further with the operators, according to a
 statement  on its website.  The auction rules “are likely to shape the future of the
mobile sector in the U.K. for next decade or more,” Ofcom said.  The frequencies to be sold are equivalent to three-quarters
of the spectrum currently being used by operators. Carriers need
the bandwidth to cope with surging data demand as users watch
films and surf the Web on smartphones including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone and handsets using Google Inc.’s Android system.  Ofcom has said it wants to maintain at least four national
carriers and would impose limits on the minimum and maximum
amounts of frequencies.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) ’s 3 unit, the
smallest of the four operators, said previously it may be forced
out if it fails to gain enough spectrum.  Telefonica, the second-largest operator in the U.K. with
its O2 brand, said in June that the auction design favors rivals
and may be considered improper state aid. Vodafone said
regulators and governments ought not to determine the number of
operators in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
