Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.06 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.12 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.068 percent.  The central bank is scheduled to acquire Treasuries
maturing from November 2021 to February 2031 today. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program of replacing
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to purchase $1.5 billion to
$2 billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
