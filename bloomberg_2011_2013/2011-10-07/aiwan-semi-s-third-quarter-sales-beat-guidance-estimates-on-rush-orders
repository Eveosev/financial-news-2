Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, posted
third-quarter revenue that beat its own guidance and analyst
estimates because of rush orders.  September consolidated revenue was NT$33.4 billion, the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. That
takes sales for the quarter to NT $106.5 billion, surpassing the
NT$105.8 billion average of 20 analyst estimates, according to
Bloomberg data.  TSMC’s sales for the period would probably exceed its
original NT$102 billion to NT$104 billion forecast because of
rush orders, it said Sept. 9 without naming the client.  Broadcom
Corp. (BRCM) , which designs chips used cellphones, is a likely
candidate for those orders ahead of the release this month of
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s next iPhone, Bloomberg supply chain analyst Richard
Davenport wrote in a report last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
