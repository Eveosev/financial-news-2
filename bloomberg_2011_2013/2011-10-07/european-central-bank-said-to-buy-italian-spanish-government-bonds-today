The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian government bonds today as it seeks to ease tension in
the regionâ€™s bond markets, according to four people familiar
with the transactions.  The central bank also bought Spanish debt, said three of
the people, who declined to be identified because the trades are
confidential.  A spokesman for the ECB in  Frankfurt  declined to comment
when contacted today by phone. The central bank publishes weekly
data on settled government bond purchases, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
