Vallourec SA (VK) , a French producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, declined the most in
more than a month in Paris after cutting its forecast for
second-half profit.  Vallourec fell as much as 10 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since Aug. 18.  Second-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be at a similar level to the first six months
of the year, the company said today in a statement. Vallourec
forecast in July that Ebitda would be “slightly” higher in the
second half versus the first.  Valloure cited the “cautious attitude of the distributors
in non-energy markets as a consequence of economic
uncertainties” and currency movements for the forecast cut.  Boulogne Billancourt , France-based Vallourec said last
month that the cost of steelmaking ingredients such as  iron ore 
was crimping margins. High raw material costs and weak demand
are hobbling steel-product makers’ efforts to emerge from the
industry’s worst crisis in 60 years following the financial
crisis.  Vallourec traded 2.11 euros lower at 41.87 euros as of 9:30
a.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
