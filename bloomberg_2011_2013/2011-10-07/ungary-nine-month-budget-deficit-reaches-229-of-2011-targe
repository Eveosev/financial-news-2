Hungary  posted a budget deficit of
25.9 billion forint ($118 million) in September, pushing the
nine-month deficit to 1.57 trillion forint, the  Economy Ministry 
said in a statement today.  The January-September shortfall was 229 percent of the
original annual target, compared with 225 percent in the first
eight months, the ministry said. Adjusted for revenue from
pension funds and the purchase of a stake in refiner Mol Nyrt.,
the deficit was 112 percent of the modified annual target.  Hungary, which officially targeted a deficit of 2.94
percent of gross domestic product by EU standards this year,
forecasts a surplus after effectively nationalizing private
pension funds and levying extraordinary taxes on energy,
financial, retail and telecommunication companies.  Hungary can meet its budget target this year, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
