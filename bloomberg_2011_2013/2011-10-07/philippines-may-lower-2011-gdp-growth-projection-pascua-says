The  Philippines  may lower its
economic growth projection this year, Budget Undersecretary
Laura Pascua said in an interview, ahead of a meeting among
government economic managers today.  Pascua said this year’s economic growth projection of
between 5 percent and 6 percent, which the government uses for
budget-setting purposes, is “not realizable” after a “weak”
first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
