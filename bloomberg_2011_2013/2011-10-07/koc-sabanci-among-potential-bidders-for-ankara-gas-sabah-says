Turkeyâ€™s two biggest industrial
groups are among investors interested in the sale of an 80
percent stake in the natural gas distribution network in Ankara,
Sabah newspaper reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL)  and  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  have both
expressed interest in the sale, for which bids are due on Jan.
27 next year, the newspaper said. More than 10 groups have
applied for the terms of the sale and  Global Yatirim Holding AS (GLYHO) 
and  Akfen Holding AS (AKFEN)  are among those that have studied the
accounts of Baskent Dogalgaz, which retails gas in the capital,
