European Central Bank Executive Board
member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said there’s still
overcapacity in the Spanish financial industry.  “There is still an excess in the financial sector in
 Spain , a system conceived for an economy in which construction

Nacional today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
