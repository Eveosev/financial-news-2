Bangladesh Petroleum Corp.  will pay
$125 million to import furnace oil from Singapore and Maldives
to help meet local demand for power generation.  The company will buy 120,000 metric tons of  fuel oil  by
December from the Singapore unit of The Vietnam National
Petroleum Corp. and 60,000 tons from  Maldives National Oil Co. ,
Md. Muqtadir Ali, chairman of the state-run oil importer and
distributor, said today in an interview from the capital, Dhaka.  Furnace oil, a residual material obtained during refining
of  crude oil , is used to generate heat and electricity.
 Bangladesh ’s energy ministry expects demand of 852,000 tons of
furnace oil during the six months ending Dec. 31, as the country
diversifies its fuel usage for electricity generation.  The nation plans to spend $10 billion, or 11 percent of its
gross domestic product, over a decade to increase generating
capacity and attract investment from overseas. The south Asian
nation’s cabinet committee on public purchase is expected to
approve the proposals at its meeting on Sunday, Ali said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
