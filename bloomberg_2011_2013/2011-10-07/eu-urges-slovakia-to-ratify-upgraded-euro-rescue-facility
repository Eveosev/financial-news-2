Slovakia  would have to negotiate with
other euro governments over any changes to its involvement in
the debt-crisis rescue fund, the European Commission said.  “If there is a request from Slovakia to change, then this
is also to be discussed with other member states,” commission
spokesman Olivier Bailly told reporters in Brussels today.  The commission said it expects Slovakia to ratify the
upgraded rescue fund in coming days.  “What is at stake here is to ensure the financial
stability of the euro area and therefore the financial stability
of Slovakia itself,” Bailly said. “We hope that Slovakia will
remain a key actor.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
