Ed Miliband , leader of the U.K.’s
opposition Labour Party, appointed lawmakers Chuka Umunna and
Rachel Reeves to economic roles in his top team.  Umunna, 32, a former lawyer, was appointed spokesman for
business, putting him up against Business Secretary Vince Cable,
68. Reeves, 32, a former Bank of England economist, was given
the role of shadowing the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny
Alexander. Both entered Parliament for the first time last year.  “My decision to appoint half a dozen members of the 2010
intake shows the talent that Labour has and the way in which
this new generation can join us in taking Labour’s agenda
forward,” Miliband said in a  statement on his website .  Tom Watson , the Labour lawmaker who quizzed  Rupert Murdoch 
during his appearance before Parliament’s culture committee, was
appointed Labour’s deputy chairman and campaign coordinator. He
may have to step down from the committee to take up the post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
