Kenya ’s shilling fell to the lowest
in more than a week as importers demanded the dollar.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
1.3 percent to 103.28 per dollar at 12:39 p.m. in Nairobi, the
lowest intraday level since Sept. 27.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to high demand for
dollars by oil importers at a time when there is minimal inflows
creating a mismatch between demand and supply,” Chris Muiga a
senior trader at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said
by phone today.  The shilling has depreciated 22 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. The Central
Bank of Kenya raised its benchmark  interest rate  by a record 4
percentage points on Sept. 5, signalling a policy shift in a bid
to combat inflation and rescue the shilling.  Inflation accelerated for the eleventh consecutive month in
September to 17.3 percent from 16.7 percent in August, more than
triple the government’s target.  Kenya’s Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  will today release the
findings of a team convened to make reccomendations on how to
halt the depectiation of the Kenyan shilling, his office said in
an e-mailed statement.
