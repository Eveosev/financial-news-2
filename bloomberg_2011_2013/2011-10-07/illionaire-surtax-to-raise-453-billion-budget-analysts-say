A proposed surtax on millionaires
would raise $453 billion, the  Congressional Budget Office  said
in an analysis of a jobs plan Democrats aim to put to a vote
next week in the  U.S. Senate .  The measure would spend all but $6 billion of that on
spending initiatives and payroll tax cuts designed to boost the
economy, the nonpartisan agencyâ€™s report said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
