Gold will perform best among
commodities next year and may rally to a record as investors
seek to safeguard their wealth against slowing economic growth,
according to Morgan Stanley.  The 2012 forecast for bullion was increased 35 percent to
$2,200 an ounce, while a so-called bull-case target for next
year was put at $2,464, analysts including  Hussein Allidina 
wrote in a report yesterday. Silver may also gain, while
forecasts for oil and copper were cut, the report said.  Morgan Stanley joins Credit Suisse AG and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in calling for gold to extend its rally next year as
European policy makers battle a debt crisis. The metal is in the
11th year of a bull run as central banks step up purchases and
investors seek to protect their assets from weaker currencies.  “With macro headlines threatening demand across the
complex, we have become more selective about commodity
exposure,” Allidina wrote. “Gold and silver are our top
commodity picks heading into 2012.”  Spot bullion, which traded at $1,659.35 an ounce at 4:03
p.m. in  Singapore , rallied to an all-time high of $1,921.15 on
Sept. 6. The price advanced 8.2 percent in the third quarter,
the 12th consecutive three-month gain.  ‘Most Resilient’  “Gold, and silver to a much lesser extent, are viewed as
safe havens and store of value as well as the closest thing to a
global  reserve currency ,” the report said. Gold “has been the
most resilient in past recessions,” it said.  Commodities are on course for the first annual drop in
three years on concern that the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe 
may undermine global growth. Most advanced economies are lapsing
into recession while the U.S. is already contracting,  Nouriel
Roubini , the economist who predicted the bubble in U.S. housing
before the market peaked in 2006, said in  New York  last month.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, a raw material gauge,
has lost 4.1 percent this year after rising 20 percent last year
and 50 percent in 2009. The index lost 12 percent in the three
months to Sept. 30, the biggest drop since 2008.  Still, commodities may gain 20 percent over the next year
as emerging-markets growth offsets the impact of Europe’s debt
crisis and a slowdown in developed economies, Goldman analysts
led by  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in an Oct. 4 report. Goldman
reiterated a target for gold to trade at $1,860 in 12 months.  Increased investment and physical demand for gold due to
financial-market dislocation helped drive this year’s rally,
Credit Suisse AG analysts including Ric Deverell wrote in an Oct.
4 report. The bank lifted its 2011 forecast to $1,575 from
$1,480 and its 2012 estimate to $1,850 from $1,540.  Silver for immediate delivery traded at $32.0425 per ounce
today, having gained 42 percent over the past year.  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s 2012 target is $50.  To contact the reporter for this story:
