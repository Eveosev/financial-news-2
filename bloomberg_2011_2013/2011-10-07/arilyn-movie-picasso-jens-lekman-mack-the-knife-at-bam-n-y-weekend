Jens Lekman brings his charmingly
idiosyncratic brand of post-modern pop to  Music Hall  of
Williamsburg on Friday.  His lush crooner’s voice soars over deftly arranged
melodies that harken back to 70s-era love songs.  What saves Lekman from overwhelming sop is the droll
specificity of his lyrics. Every song is a story -- some are
tragic, all are sweet.  66 North 6th St.,  Brooklyn . Information: +1-718-486-5400;

Soundsuit sculptures at Jack Shainman Gallery.  These are strange creatures constructed of buttons, wire,
bugle beads, baskets and upholstery, some sporting jaunty bunny
ears, others with tuba heads.  Here the palette is mostly black, white and gray. In one
group, seven figures wear an interconnected poncho, covered with
shimmering buttons. An upbeat video shows them hopping, twirling
and dancing.  At Mary Boone, Cave’s Soundsuits erupt into color with the
addition of such found objects as sock monkeys, pipe cleaners,
recycled sweaters, dogwood twigs and lots of glitter.  “Ever-After” runs through Oct. 8 at 513 W. 20th St.
Information: +1-212-645-1701;  http://www.jackshainman.com .  “For Now” runs through Oct. 22 at 541 W. 24th St.
Information: +1-212-752-2929;  http://www.maryboonegallery.com .  Saturday Afternoon  Check out  David Smith ’s stainless steel totems at the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Bringing together 60 sculptures,
drawings, paintings and photographs, the exhibition focuses on
geometry in the artist’s work.  Smith, who died at 59 in 1965, used found and industrial
materials to stack up cubes, plates, rods and spheres into
playful abstractions.  “David Smith: Cubes and Anarchy” runs until Jan. 8 at the
Whitney, 945 Madison Ave. at 75th St. Information: +1-212-570-
3600;  http://whitney.org .  Saturday Night  To get a real taste of class warfare, go to “Threepenny
Opera” by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, first produced in 1928
Berlin.  Goes one of the lines: “Who is the greater criminal: he who
robs a bank or he who founds one?”  Robert Wilson ’s production with the Berliner Ensemble
evokes German expressionist art and sleazy Weimar night clubs.  Stefan Kurt as Macheath gets to sing the famous murder
ballad “Mack the Knife,” while Stefanie Stappenbeck does
“Pirate Jenny,” in which a lowly maid yearns for the massacre
of all the townspeople.  Brooklyn Academy of Music, Howard Gilman Opera House, 30
Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn. Information: +1718-636-4100;
 http://www.bam.org .  Then cross the street to Berlyn for some hearty fare,
beginning with a refreshing Schwartzwald Spritz, a mix of gin,
pine liquor and sekt. It’s autumn, so why not dive into the
choucroute with pork loin and bratwurst?  25 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn. Information: +1-718-222-5800.  Sunday  See Picasso’s 1901 self-portrait, power practically
streaming off his intense face and shoulders. It’s in a show of
60 drawings from his first three decades, now at the Frick
Collection.  There’s the amusing “Hercules,” drawn by the artist in
1890 when he was nine years old and preserved by his proud
parents.  You can see his quick mind exploring everything from the
1907 “Yellow Nude,” a study for “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon”
and an early cubist “Bust of a Woman” (1909) to a
consideration of African arts in “Standing Woman from the
Back.”  At 1 E. 70th St. until Jan. 8. Information: +1-212-288-
0700;  http://www.frick.org .  Sunday Afternoon  Valery Gergiev and his Mariinsky Orchestra are throwing a
mini-festival at  Carnegie Hall , part of a monthlong celebration
of Russian composers and the venue’s 120 years of musical
splendor.  Today there are two works by Tchaikovsky, the powerful
Symphony No. 5 and the playful No. 2 or “Little Russian.”  57th St. and Seventh Ave. Information: +1-212-247-7800;
 http://www.carnegiehall.org .  To continue the Russian spirit, head over to Petrossian and
feast on caviar with shots of icy vodka.  At 182 W. 58th St. Information: +1-212-245-2214.  Sunday Evening  During the filming of “The Prince and the Showgirl,”
 Marilyn Monroe  royally annoyed director and co-star Laurence Olivier.  See the fireworks in “My Week With Marilyn,” as  Michelle Williams  portrays the Hollywood diva and Kenneth Branagh takes
on the uptight, classically trained actor.  The rest of the cast is not too shabby either: Judi Dench,
 Derek Jacobi , Zoe Wanamaker, Dominic Cooper and Eddie Redmayne.  At Alice Tully Hall,  Lincoln Center . Part of the New York
Film Festival, crammed with movie-goodies, running until Oct.
16. Information: +1-212-875-5050;  http://www.filmlinc.com .  (With assistance from Lili Rosboch and Katya Kazakina.
