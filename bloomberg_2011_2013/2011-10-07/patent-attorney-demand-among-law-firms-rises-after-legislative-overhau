Patent attorneys, who typically have
degrees in fields such as engineering as well as law, are in
such demand that their specialty may account for more than 15
percent of law firm job openings while representing just 3
percent of U.S. lawyers.  Some law firms are almost doubling recruitment fees to meet
the growing demand for intellectual property specialists,
particularly in the technology sector, said  T.J. Duane , a
principal at legal recruitment firm Lateral Link.  “There is a boom in IP with many openings in what is
usually a niche practice,” Duane said in a telephone interview.  There are more than 230 open positions for patent lawyers
among the more than 1,400 nationwide for all attorneys, with the
majority in the San Francisco Bay area, home to Silicon Valley,
Duane said. About 60 posts have been open since July. Another 25
were added last month, he said.  “The quantity of qualified attorneys who can perform this
work is limited,” Duane said.  Lateral hires among law firms are on the rise after two
years of decline. They jumped 38 percent last year after
plummeting 52 percent between 2008 and 2009, according to a
report by the National Association of Law Placement. Hiring
among law school graduates continues to weaken as large law
firms filled fewer positions. The employment rate among U.S. law
school graduates fell 4.7 percent last year, NALP said.  IP Lawyer Demand  The IP lawyer demand can be attributed in part to the
America Invents Act, the biggest overhaul to the U.S. patent
system in six decades. The legislation, which changes how
patents are processed and reviewed, is spurring a race among law
firms for star talent in a small pool of patent attorneys.  About 40,000 patent attorneys and agents are registered
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, having passed a
separate patent bar examination, according to the office.  While patent agents have taken the patent exam, they aren’t
lawyers who have taken state bar tests, the patent office said
on its website. Agents can prepare patent applications and
conduct cases before the patent office, though they can’t
litigate in court or draw up contracts.  “These are hard people to find,” Barton E. Showalter,
chairman of the IP department at Baker Botts LLP in  Dallas , said
of qualified patent attorneys.  About 1.2 million lawyers are licensed in the U.S.,
according to the  American Bar Association .  Patent Act  The patent act, the culmination of more than a decade of
negotiations and lobbying, is putting a high premium on the best
patent lawyers, Showalter said.  “It’s an exceedingly complex law now with a number of new
procedures,” Showalter said. “That puts a premium on highly
technical-skilled patent lawyers.”  In addition to patent reform, law firms are being pressured
by technology clients who have expanded into new growth areas
such as cloud computing, Mark J. Itri, head of the IP practice
group at McDermott Will & Emery LLP, said in a telephone
interview from his office in  Irvine ,  California .  Some companies have also consolidated the number of patent
lawyers they work with to cut costs, Itri said.  “Near term, you’ll see a big demand to hire to meet some
of those client needs,” Itri said.  McDermott has hired 28 patent attorneys and patent agents
so far this year, adding roughly a dozen last month alone, as it
seeks to expand its patent prosecution practice. The firm plans
to hire another 20 by next spring, Itri said. Finding the right
talent for the group hasn’t always been easy, he said.  Highly Sought Degrees  The most highly sought degrees held by patent attorneys are
in electrical engineering, computer science and computer
engineering, Duane said.  The ideal candidate would hold a doctoral degree in
electrical engineering, have graduated from a top 10 law school
and have worked for four years at a strong  law firm , Duane said.  “That person could get a job anywhere,” he said.  The pool of potential hires narrows once you subtract
retirees and non-practicing lawyers from the registered patent
attorneys in the U.S., Itri said. Broken down by specialty, the
most sought-after now are those with experience in software,
telecommunications and the Internet, Itri said.  If the talent isn’t available, Duane said, “some firms may
end up closing their positions or repurposing the general
practice attorneys to focus on the nontechnical sides of these
complex cases.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
