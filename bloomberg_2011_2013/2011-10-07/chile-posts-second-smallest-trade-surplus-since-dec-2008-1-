Chile registered its second-smallest
 trade surplus  since December 2008 last month as copper exports
from the world’s largest producer of the metal fell.  The surplus narrowed to $324 million from $491 million in
August, according to data published today on the central bank’s
website. The median estimate of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a surplus of $640 million. Exports of copper
tumbled 22 percent to $3.3 billion from a year earlier.  The decline in the surplus comes after copper prices
tumbled in September and the peso weakened 11 percent against
the U.S. dollar in the past month, more than any other Latin
American currency tracked by Bloomberg. Total exports decreased
3.1 percent from last year to $6.6 billion and imports climbed
31 percent to $6.3 billion, the bank said today.  Copper was trading at $3.32 per pound at 8:40 a.m. New York
time, compared with $4.2045 at the end of August. Chile’s peso
gained 0.9 percent to 515.35 per  U.S. dollar  from 520.10
yesterday.  Chile posted a trade surplus of $10 billion in the first
nine months of this year, down from $11.4 billion in the same
period of 2010, the central bank said. The Andean country will
have a trade surplus of $12.7 billion this year as copper prices
average $4.15 a pound, the central bank said in its quarterly
monetary forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
