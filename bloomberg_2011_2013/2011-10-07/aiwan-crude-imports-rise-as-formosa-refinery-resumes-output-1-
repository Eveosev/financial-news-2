Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased more of the fuel in
September after  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  resumed production
at its refinery.  Shipments climbed 7.8 percent from a year earlier to 23.7
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s September oil bill increased 58
percent to $2.61 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded
refiner, processed an average 380,000 barrels of crude in
September, up from virtually none in August, Lin Keh-yen, a
company spokesman, said on Oct. 4. The company started the
540,000 barrel-a-day Mailiao plant in late August after shutting
it because of a fire on July 30, according to a statement filed
to the stock exchange on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
