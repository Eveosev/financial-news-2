Oil fell, trimming its first weekly
gain in three in  New York  on forecasts that a projected gain in
U.S. jobs last month was probably too small to bring down the
 unemployment rate  in the world’s largest crude user.  Futures are set for a 3.9 percent gain this week. U.S.
employment rose by 55,000 workers last month, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before data due today. Still, the jobless
rate remained at 9.1 percent for a third month. The European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday announced a
bond-purchase program to tackle the region’s debt crisis.  “We’re not very optimistic for the jobs numbers; maybe
that’s another trigger for oil to go lower,” said  Sintje Diek ,
an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in Hamburg who correctly predicted in
January that prices would fall in the second half of the year.
“Levels of around $100 for Brent are some kind of marker for
the market. If we have some kind of solution to the debt crisis,
oil could remain around here for the rest of the year.”  Crude for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 31 cents at $82.28 a barrel at 12:20 p.m.
London time after climbing as high as $83.08. The contract
yesterday gained $2.91 to $82.59, for a two-day gain of 9.1
percent, the biggest since Feb. 22 to Feb. 23.  Brent oil for November settlement fell 0.6 percent to
$105.07 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$22.79 to New York crude, compared with a record of $26.87 on
Sept. 6.  Non-Farm Payrolls  The Labor Department will release data on non-farm payrolls
at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  “If we get a good print on the jobs number, we could get a
bit of rally in oil here,” said Jeremy Friesen, a commodity
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “We expect it
to be a positive surprise versus consensus, and that should give
some life to oil.”  The Energy Department said crude inventories fell 4.7
million barrels to 336.3 million last week, the lowest since the
period ending Jan. 21. An increase of 1.5 million barrels was
expected, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Brent crude futures have slipped 8.9 percent since Sept. 15
amid concerns the debt crisis in Europe will crimp demand for
fuels. Prices have yet to find a floor because of “damage” to
consumer and business confidence, SocGen said in a report
yesterday from analyst  Michael Wittner  in New York. He
reiterated his forecast that the European benchmark will trade
between $90 and $100 a barrel for the rest of this year.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
export about 22.72 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
Oct. 22, little changed from the 22.74 million a day shipped in
the month to Sept. 24, Halifax, England-based Oil Movements said
yesterday in a report. Shipments typically rise at this time of
year as refiners prepare to boost production of winter fuels.
