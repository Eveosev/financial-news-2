Malaysia ’s Islamic banking assets
rose 15 percent to 389.3 billion ringgit ($123 billion) in the
first seven months of 2011, strengthening the country’s position
as the global hub for Shariah-compliant financing, a government
report said.  Assets that comply with Islam’s ban on interest climbed to
21 percent of Malaysia’s total banking system in July from the
same period a year earlier, according to the  Ministry of
Finance’s  2011-2012 Economic Report today. Islamic lending
increased 17 percent to 246.8 billion ringgit and made up 23
percent of total loans, while deposits grew 14 percent to 299.1
billion ringgit, the report said.  “Malaysia has the most established Shariah regulatory and
legal infrastructure” in the world, the report said. “The
Islamic  capital market  now exceeds $1 trillion and is growing as
rapidly as the conventional capital market.”  The Southeast Asian nation, where about 60 percent of the
27 million population are Muslim, has relaxed foreign-ownership
rules for Islamic institutions in the past few years to attract
investment and spur growth in the biggest market for Shariah-
compliant bonds, or sukuk. The nation has $112.3 billion of such
debt outstanding, 62.7 percent of the world’s total, the
ministry said.  ‘Risk Management’  Global sales of sukuk, which pay returns on assets to
comply with Shariah law, climbed to $18 billion this year, from
$11.8 billion in the same period of 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is outperforming bonds in
developing markets this year, with a return of 5.3 percent, the
HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index shows. Fixed-income
securities in emerging markets gained 3.4 percent, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Composite Index.  Malaysia will continue efforts to strengthen the nation’s
position as an international Islamic financial center by
developing tools to help facilitate cross-border transactions as
well as products and services, the ministry’s report said,
without providing further details.  Islamic insurance, or takaful, assets rose 17 percent to
16.3 billion ringgit at the end of July from the same period
last year, according to the report. The sector accounted for 8.7
percent of Malaysia’s total insurance industry as of July 31, up
from 8.3 percent a year earlier, the ministry said.  Takaful is based on the Koranic principle of mutual
assistance where members are the insurers as well as the insured.  The  finance ministry  said five new guidelines to further
enhance “sound risk-management practices” in Islamic insurance
were issued in the first seven months.  The worldwide Islamic finance industry has expanded 20
percent annually since 2000 and is among the fastest-growing in
global banking, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based Islamic
Financial Services Board, an international standards setting
body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
