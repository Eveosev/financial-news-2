Philippine  government bonds  rose,
headed for a weekly gain, on speculation the central bank will
refrain from raising borrowing costs after inflation was slower
than forecast. The peso advanced for a third straight day.  Consumer prices rose 4.8 percent in September from a year
earlier after having climbed 4.7 percent in August, official
data showed this week. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
predicted an increase of 4.9 percent. Inflation will remain
manageable as the impact of recent storms that lashed the nation
won’t persist, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on
Oct. 5.  “People are coming to their senses and seeing there’s
still value in our bonds,” said Ryanna Berza-Talan, a  fund
manager  at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc.’s trust group that oversees
about $16 billion of assets. “Inflation will not blow out of
hand and our fundamentals are still very strong.”  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
fell one basis point to 7.19 percent as of 3:09 p.m. in  Manila ,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate slid 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, this week.  The peso advanced 0.3 percent today and 0.4 percent from
last week to 43.545 per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The central bank held the rate it pays lenders for
overnight deposits at 4.5 percent last month after increasing it
twice earlier this year. The benchmark rate will likely stay
steady for the rest of 2011, Tetangco said last month. Policy
makers review the benchmark rate next on Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
