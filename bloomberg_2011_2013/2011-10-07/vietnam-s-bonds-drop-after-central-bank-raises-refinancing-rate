Vietnam ’s government bonds fell after
policy makers raised their lending rate to banks for the first
time since May. The dong weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam boosted the refinancing rate by 1
percentage point to 15 percent with effect from Oct. 10,
according to a statement on its website yesterday. The move is
aimed at improving “the efficiency of monetary policy” and
regulating “market interest rates,” the central bank said.  “The increase in the refinancing rate indicates that it
will be difficult for market rates to go down in the short
term,” said Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co. “Investors are reluctant to buy
bonds at this point.”  The yield on three-year  government bonds  rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.31 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.2 percent to 20,859 per dollar as of
3:10 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,653 per dollar
today, compared with 20,648 yesterday, according to its website.
That was the third adjustment this week. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  Consumer prices climbed 22.4 percent in September from a
year earlier, compared with 23 percent in August. That is still
the fastest inflation rate among 17 Asian-Pacific economies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
