The capacity of solar panels
installed at U.S. colleges has more than tripled in two years as
schools seek to cut their  carbon emissions  and energy bills.  U.S. colleges and universities have 136.8 megawatts of
solar panels now, up from 44.3 megawatts in 2009, the
 Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher
Education  said today in an e-mailed statement. There were 96.2
megawatts in use last year.  Many schools installing the panels have committed to
producing no net carbon emissions, said Paul Rowland, executive
director of the Denver-based association.  “It’s a cost savings issue for a lot of them,” Rowland
said today in an interview. “They’re trying to figure out how
to green their campuses, to become carbon neutral in the
future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
