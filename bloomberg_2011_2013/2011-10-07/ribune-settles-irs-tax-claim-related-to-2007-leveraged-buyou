Tribune Co., the biggest media
company in bankruptcy, agreed to pay the  Internal Revenue
Service  $7 million to settle allegations that the company’s 2007
leveraged buyout violated U.S. tax law.  The settlement ends a fight over whether the company must
pay $37.5 million to the IRS, which alleged that the company
owed unpaid taxes related to its almost $13 billion leveraged
buyout.  The deal “resolves a major outstanding claim against
Tribune on very favorable terms to the debtors,” the company
said in court papers filed today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, Delaware.  Tribune filed for bankruptcy in 2008, one year after
billionaire Sam Zell led a buyout that added more than
$8 billion in debt onto the Chicago-based company. Tribune owns
newspapers including the Los Angeles Times the  Chicago Tribune ,
along with television and radio stations.  Two groups of  hedge funds  are waiting for U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin J. Carey to pick one of two competing plans to
reorganize the company so it can leave bankruptcy.  The IRS claim was related to the structure of the deal,
which was designed to avoid some federal taxes.  The bankruptcy case is In re Tribune Co., 08-bk-13141, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
