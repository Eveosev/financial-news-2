John Paulson , the billionaire who is
betting on an economic recovery by the end of 2012, has lost 47
percent this year in his largest hedge fund, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Paulson’s Advantage Plus Fund, which seeks to profit from
corporate events such as takeovers and bankruptcies, uses
leverage to amplify returns. The fund’s gold share class
declined 32 percent this year through the end of September, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the fund is
private.  Paulson, 55, would have to return about 89 percent in the
remainder of the year to break even in the Advantage Plus Fund.
Paulson & Co., which is based in New York and manages $30
billion, has lost money this year on investments including
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Sino-Forest Corp.  Hedge funds  slumped 3.2 percent in September, according to
the Bloomberg hedge-fund aggregate index. It was their worst
performance in more than a year, as global stocks tumbled amid a
worsening European debt crisis and the threat of a U.S.
recession.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson, declined to comment
on the returns.  To contact the reporters on this story:
