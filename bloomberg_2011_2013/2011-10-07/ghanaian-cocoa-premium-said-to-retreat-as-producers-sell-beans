The premium buyers are willing to pay
for cocoa from  Ghana , the second-largest producer, fell in the
past two weeks as growers sold, three people in the trade said.  Ghanaian beans from the 2011-12 crop started this month
traded in  Europe  at 90 pounds ($141) to 100 pounds a metric ton
above the futures price on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London ,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
they aren’t authorized to speak to the media. That compares with
100 pounds on Sept. 21, three traders said at the time.  Producer selling was pressuring the cocoa market in London,
Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in London,
wrote in an e-mailed report today.  The cocoa crop in West Africa for the 2011-12 season may be
similar to the 2010-11 harvest as favorable weather helps
yields, reversing earlier forecasts for a smaller crop,
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report dated yesterday.  “The market is fundamentally a lot less bullish than
previously thought and the threat of large arrivals of West
African crops could keep funds happily maintaining a net short
position,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at the bank, wrote in the
report. Short positions are bets that prices will fall.  Ivorian beans in Europe were at 40 pounds to 70 pounds a
ton above prices on NYSE Liffe, the people said. That compares
with 40 pounds to 60 pounds on Sept. 21.  Ivory Coast  is the
world’s largest producer of cocoa.  European cocoa butter, used to make chocolate, was at a
ratio of 1 to 1.05 times the price on NYSE Liffe, the traders
said. Cocoa butter accounts for as much as 20 percent of the
weight of a chocolate bar, according to Commodities Risk
Analysis LC, a cocoa research company based in  New York .  Cocoa for December delivery fell 10 pounds, or 0.6 percent,
to 1,711 pounds a ton at 3:39 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
