Royal Dutch Shell Plc extended its
gasoline cargo purchases in  Singapore , where its biggest
refinery remains shut after a Sept. 28 fire. Gasoil’s crack
spread narrowed, signaling reduced profit for refiners.  Light Distillates  Shell bought gasoline for a fourth day in Singapore, the
region’s largest oil-trading center, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
 Europe ’s biggest oil company paid $124.80 a barrel to BP Plc for
50,000 barrels of 97-RON grade.  Glencore International AG sold naphtha for first-half
December for a second day, the survey showed. The world’s
largest commodities trader received $871 a metric ton from Vitol
Group and $873 a ton from BP.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
climbed $7.53 to $77.71 a ton at 5:15 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of processing profit, is down 39 percent so far this
week.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought three 100,000-barrel cargoes
of  jet fuel  in Singapore, the Bloomberg survey showed. Singapore
Petroleum Co., Glencore and Chevron Corp. each received 10 cents
a barrel above benchmark quotes from the closely held Singapore
trader. A transaction yesterday was at a 20-cent discount.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or diesel, rose 10 cents to
$2.60 a barrel at 2:07 p.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This regrade is up 53
percent this week and headed for the biggest weekly gain since
January 2010. This means it is profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell $1.17
to $15.97 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread was the
narrowest since Sept. 15.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened $1.15 to $4.46 a
barrel at 2:07 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. The gap
has increased 64 percent this week, after narrowing 62 percent
over the previous four weeks, indicating refiners’ losses from
turning crude into residual products are growing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade declined 25 cents to $7.75 a ton, based on PVM data. This
viscosity spread widened 11 percent so far this week, set for
the first gain in five weeks, signaling higher-quality fuel oil
has decreased more than bunker, or marine fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
