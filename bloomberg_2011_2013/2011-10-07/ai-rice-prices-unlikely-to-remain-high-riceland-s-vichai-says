Thailand ’s efforts to boost rice
prices through direct purchases from farmers will probably fail
to support rates over the longer term because of ample supply.
said Vichai Sriprasert, president of Riceland International Ltd.  Export prices at $800 per metric ton are unsustainable
because of the global economic slowdown and rising supply from
countries including  India , Vichai said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview from Bangkok. Vichai is a former president
of the Thai Rice Exporters’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
