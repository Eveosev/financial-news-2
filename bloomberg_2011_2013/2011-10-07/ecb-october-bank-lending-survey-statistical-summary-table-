Following is a summary of the ECB
bank lending survey from the ECB in Frankfurt:  NOTE: Participants were asked: "Over the past three months, how have your 
bankâ€™s credit standards as applied to the approval of loans or credit 
lines to enterprises changed?"
The net percentage is the difference between the sum of
the percentages for "tightened considerably" and "tightened somewhat"
and the sum of the percentages for "eased somewhat" and "eased
considerably".          
A positive net-percentage indicates a tightening of the credit conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
