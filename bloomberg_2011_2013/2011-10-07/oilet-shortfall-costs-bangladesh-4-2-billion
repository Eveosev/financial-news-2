A toilet shortfall in  Bangladesh  that
enables diarrheal and other disease-causing germs to spread
costs the nation about  $4.2 billion  annually, a study found.  Economic losses tied to inadequate sanitation amounted to
6.3 percent of Bangladesh’s gross domestic product in 2007,
highlighting an urgent need to invest in better hygiene, a
report by the  World Bank ’s  Water and Sanitation Program  said.  Premature death and the ill effects of poor sanitation
contributed 84 percent of the total cost. Children under 5 years
suffer the most, accounting for 95 percent of the premature
deaths, the Washington-based bank said in e-mail yesterday.  “The total amount of these losses is five times higher
than the national health budget and three times higher than the
national education budget in 2007,” the report said. Efforts to
improve sanitation could yield about $2.26 billion in economic
gains, it said.  Diarrhea results in the biggest health-related economic
impact from poor sanitation, accounting for two-thirds of the
total cost, the report said. Acute lower respiratory infections
account for about 15 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
