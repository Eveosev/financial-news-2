The ruble climbed for a third day
against the dollar after increased confidence in the global
economy spurred a recovery in Urals crude,  Russia ’s main oil
export earner.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 32.20 per
barrel as of 10:20 a.m. in Moscow, its strongest intraday
position since Sept. 30. A close at that level would mean a
weekly advance of 0.1 percent, the first since Aug. 28. The
ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 43.24 per euro, leaving it up
0.4 percent at 37.168 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket.  Urals crude was poised for its first weekly gain in three
after the  European Central Bank  announced a bond-purchase
program to tackle the debt crisis yesterday and before an
employment report today forecast to show the U.S. gained jobs
last month. The oil blend jumped 3.2 percent to $104.69 a barrel
at the close yesterday.  Investors pared bets the ruble will depreciate further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 32.6668
per dollar in three months, compared with 32.8645 yesterday.
