Canadian natural gas fell as storage
levels approached a record high with more than a month to go
before winter heating demand usually begins to cut inventories.  Prices declined 4.7 percent after Canadian supplies rose
19.6 billion cubic feet, or 3.2 percent, to 640.3 billion in the
week ended Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Canadian Enerdata Ltd. It was the most since the week ended Dec.
3 after stockpiles peaked at 680.2 billion on Nov. 19.
Inventories have declined starting in mid-November for the last
four years.  “The economy is giving that sinking feeling and we’re just
building stocks easily on both sides of the border,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc. in
 St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone interview. “The
weather is so warm, even up in  Canada , we’re not using much
supply.”  Alberta  gas for November delivery fell 15.25 cents to
C$3.11 per gigajoule ($2.85 per million Btu) as of 12:15 p.m.
New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market.
December gas dropped 11 cents to C$3.425. Gas traded on the
exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the U.S. and is
priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 9.4 cents to $3.504 per million Btu at 12:19 p.m.  U.S. Storage Gains  The U.S. Energy Department said yesterday gas stockpiles
rose 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 30 to 3.409
trillion cubic feet. The five-year average change for the week
is an increase of 74 billion, department data show. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg expected a gain of 98 billion.  The high in  Minneapolis  today may reach 83 degrees (28
Celsius), 21 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 988 million above target, as of noon New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.6 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 713 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.38 billion cubic feet today, about 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.1 billion.  Volume on  Spectra Energy ’s system, which gathers the fuel
in northeastern British Columbia for delivery to Vancouver and
the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.85 billion cubic feet at 11:05
a.m.  Spectra said on its website that shippers are being asked
to trend accounts slowly toward zero until after Oct. 10 to
avoid higher-than-ideal linepack for an outage on the Gordondale
pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
