The  European Covered Bond Council  is
working on a quality assurance label that will set minimum
issuance standards for the loan-backed securities.  The ECBC, which represents 95 percent of covered bond
issuers, is seeking to improve the transparency and amount of
information on the collateral backing the debt, the Brussels-
based lobby group said in a statement today. The implementation
plan for the label will be presented early next year.  “The covered bond label is a key priority for the ECBC,
which is developing the initiative in co-operation with issuers,
investors and regulators with the aim of ensuring that the views
of all stakeholders are incorporated,” the industry group said
in the statement.  Covered bonds eligible for the label should be backed by
mortgages, public sector loans or assets of similar quality,
according to the ECBC. The collateral information will be
provided by the issuer on a voluntary basis, the trade group
said.  Covered bonds, pioneered in 18th century Prussia, typically
get the highest ratings because of the assets backing the
securities and a guarantee by the issuer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
