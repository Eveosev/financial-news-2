Tiger Woods shot a 3-under 68 in the
second round of the Frys.com Open and was seven shots off the
lead in the second event of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Fall Series.  Woods was tied for 86th place a day earlier after shooting
a 2-over 73 in the first round at the CordeValle Golf Club in
San Martin,  California , and was at risk of missing the cut.  He had six birdies and three bogeys in yesterday’s round,
giving him a two-round total of 1-under 141, leaving him seven
shots behind leader  Paul Casey  of England. The second round
could not be completed last night because of darkness. The cut
for the final two rounds is projected at 1 over.  Woods, who has a 23-month winless streak, is playing in
his first event since missing the cut for weekend play at the
 PGA Championship  in August and failing to qualify for the PGA
Tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs.  Woods, 35, is working with caddie Joe LaCava for the first
time at the Frys.com Open, having split in July with Steve Williams, with whom he won 13 of 14 major championships and 72
tournaments worldwide. LaCava spent 20 years as Fred Couples’s
caddie and briefly carried Dustin Johnson’s bag earlier this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
