Mexichem SAB, the Latin American
chemical producer that bought more than 15 companies since 2007,
said third-quarter sales will gain 22 percent.  Mexichem will post quarterly sales of about 12.3 billion
pesos ($1 billion), the company said today in a stock exchange
statement of preliminary quarterly earnings results. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, will increase to 2.5 billion pesos, the company said.  The Tlalnepantla, Mexico-based company’s profit has almost
quadrupled in four years through acquisitions, such as last
year’s $300-million purchase of AlphaGary, a thermoplastic
compounds operation it bought in December, and purchases of
Policyd SA and plastic tube maker Plasticos Rex SA. Mexichem
aims to have annual growth of 20 percent for profit, revenue and
Ebitda, it has said in company presentations.  “Our announced plans and projects, fundamentally in  Asia ,
will help us to be better prepared for any eventuality,” Chief
Executive Officer Rafael Davalos said in today’s statement.  While acquisitions and higher prices for polyvinyl
chloride, or PVC, boosted revenue in the quarter, those gains
were offset by local currency fluctuations, the company said.  Mexichem fell 60 centavos, or 1.4 percent, to 41.83 pesos
at 1:39 p.m. in Mexico City. The stock has gained 14 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
