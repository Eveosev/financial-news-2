Banco Popolare SC (BP)  Chief Financial
Officer Maurizio Faroni indicated the lender has already
refinanced “a relevant part” of its bonds maturing next year,
according to a note from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   The firm “doesn’t need to enter the funding market until
next summer,” according to a note obtained by Bloomberg News
and e-mailed to clients by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which
hosted Faroni at a conference in  London  yesterday. “Their
funding needs were covered for 2011 since the end of June and
have already covered a relevant portion of the 5.5 billion euros
($7.4 billion) of maturities due in 2012.”  A Banco Popolare spokesman declined to comment. The Verona,
Italy-based bank plans to sell real-estate assets and cut more
than 1,000 jobs to boost capital and profit as part of its five-
year business plan. The lender sold 2 billion euros in shares
through a rights offer earlier this year before a second round
of stress tests.  Faroni reaffirmed the bank’s 2013 targets and indicated the
company is seeing a decline in gross impaired loans this year,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
