Nigeria  has banned companies that
export crude oil from buying dollars at its twice-weekly foreign
exchange auction in an attempt to curb mounting demand for the
U.S. currency and to stabilize the naira.  The companies are to utilize the foreign currency proceeds
from their exports, the Abuja-based central bank said in a
 letter  published on its website today.  “Since the bulk of dollar demand at the auction is for
petroleum importation, the ban will most likely reduce demand at
that level and help support the naira,” Babatunde Obaniyi, an
analyst at Greenwich Trust Ltd., a Lagos-based  investment
company , said today by phone. “The impact will be felt on the
market from next week, beginning with the auction on Monday.”  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. It broke that
band the second time on Oct. 5, after it failed to meet mounting
demand for dollars in 24 straight auctions.  The naira headed for its first appreciation in three days,
gaining 0.2 percent to 163.75 per dollar by 10.30 a.m. in Lagos,
after losing 0.1 percent to 164.23 in early trading, the weakest
since at least 1994, when Bloomberg started compiling the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
