Nigeria ’s naira gained the most in
two years against the dollar in interbank trading after the
central bank stopped foreign-currency purchases by oil-exporting
companies at its twice-weekly auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer strengthened
by 2.44 percent to 160.15 per dollar at 4 p.m. in Lagos, the
biggest intraday appreciation since Oct. 2, 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank yesterday banned
companies that export crude oil from the auctions, directing
them to use their export proceeds to meet their dollar needs.  “Traders speculate that dollar demand will fall next week
due to the new rule,” Babatunde Obaniyi, an analyst at
Greenwich Trust Ltd., a Lagos-based  investment company , said
today by phone.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. It broke that
band the second time on Oct. 5, after it failed to meet mounting
dollar demand for the 24th straight auction.  Before the new rule was announced yesterday, the naira
depreciated by 1.7 percent to 164.15 per dollar, the weakest
since at least 1994, when Bloomberg started compiling the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
