Tecan Group AG (TECN) , a Swiss maker of
 laboratory equipment , plans to replace Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Bachmann within a year and said it would “value”
merger-and-acquisition experience in his successor.  The board of Maennedorf-based Tecan decided to replace
Bachmann in a meeting yesterday after a yearlong discussion
about bringing “new skills and competencies” into the company,
Chairman Rolf Classon said on a teleconference with analysts
today. Tecan announced the  succession plan  today in a statement.  The manufacturer wants a candidate with “a deep, long
background in the life-science industry,” Classon said.
Experience in mergers and acquisitions “is something that we
will look at” as one of the criteria, he said, without
elaborating.  Bachmann, 52, became CEO in 2005 at a time when Tecan had
“a somewhat questionable reputation,” and has done “a very
good job leading and guiding” the company, Classon said.  Tecan fell 2.25 Swiss francs, or 3.6 percent, to 60.60
francs in Zurich trading, giving it a market value of 693.5
million francs ($757 million) and extending its decline this
year to 22 percent.  The company said on Sept. 30 that a project to develop a
diagnostics instrument was delayed, leading to higher costs. A
month earlier, Tecan raised its full-year sales forecast. The
plan to replace Bachmann wasn’t related to any event in the past
and is “no criticism” of the departing CEO, Classon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
