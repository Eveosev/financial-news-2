Don Kelly and Delmon Young hit back-
to-back homers in the first inning and the  Detroit  Tigers held
on to defeat the New York Yankees 3-2 to reach the American
League Championship Series against the Texas Rangers.  Tigers starter Doug Fister allowed one run in five innings
to get the win for Detroit, which took the best-of-five first-
round series three games to two. Jose Valverde pitched the ninth
for his second save of the series against the Yankees, who used
seven pitchers.  Texas already had earned a spot in the AL Championship
Series for the second straight season by winning a first-round
series 3-1 against the Tampa Bay Rays.  In the National League, both division series are heading to
decisive fifth games tomorrow. The Philadelphia Phillies host
the  St. Louis Cardinals  in one of those matchups, with the
 Milwaukee Brewers  playing at home against the Arizona
Diamondbacks in the other.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
