Workers at  LyondellBasell Industries
NV (LYB) ’s Berre refinery in southern France voted today to prolong a
strike until Oct. 10, according to trade unions.  LyondellBasell is preparing to shut the plant for good
after failing to find a buyer, resulting in the loss of 370
jobs. The closure is the third announced in France in 18 months
as refiners seek to cut capacity because of a drop in profits
and declining demand for fuels.  Workers went on strike after Lyondell announced the closure
on Sept. 27 and halted processing units, which haven’t been
restarted. The plant is one of four near Marseille.  Talks between management and unions will begin in Paris,
Jacques Dupoux, a spokesman for  labor organizations  at the site,
which include the CGT, said in an e-mailed statement.  Local
politicians and unions are holding talks Oct. 10 on the future
of petrochemicals in the region, according to Dupoux.  Separately,  Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s biggest refiner, will
announce an overhaul Oct. 10 that will combine crude-processing
and petrochemicals operations within the company and create a
separate fuel marketing division. The CGT union, the biggest
among refinery workers, has pledged to “mobilize” workers when
the plan is made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
