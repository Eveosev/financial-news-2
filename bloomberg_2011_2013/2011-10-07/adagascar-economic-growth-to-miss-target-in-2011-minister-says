Madagascarâ€™s economy expanded an
estimated 0.5 percent to 1 percent this year, less than the 2.8
percent previously forecast, Finance Minister Hery
Rajaonarimampianina said.  Growth was affected by an increase in food prices and
higher international fuel costs, while the suspension of aid
curbed infrastructure projects, the minister told reporters
yesterday in the capital, Antananarivo.  Donors stopped giving the Indian Ocean island nation aid
after Andry Rajoelina ousted  Marc Ravalomanana  as president with
the help of the military in 2009.     To contact the reporter on this story:
