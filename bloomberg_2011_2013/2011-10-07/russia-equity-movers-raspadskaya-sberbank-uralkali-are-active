The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rallied 2.5
percent to 1,351.42 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, after
jumping 4.2 percent yesterday. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
increased 3.2 percent to 1,311.91 rubles.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis:  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   climbed 1.7 percent to 82 rubles,
giving it the biggest two-day gain since Aug. 15. Evraz Group SA
said yesterday it discontinued talks on a potential sale of a
stake in the Russian coal producer.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX),  Russia ’s biggest lender, rose for
a third day, adding 3.7 percent to 68.18 rubles. The country’s

stronger ruble encourages Russians to keep their income in ruble
deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  OAO  Uralkali (URKA)   rallied 6.7 percent to 239.97
rubles, taking its increase in the last three days to 22

its shares and global depositary receipts. Separately, Chief
Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said in a Moscow
interview he expects spot prices for the soil nutrient to exceed
