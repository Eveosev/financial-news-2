Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, rose for a second day ahead of
the deadline for investors to buy its shares to be entitled to a
dividend of 1.50 shillings per share.  The stock jumped as much as 7.8 percent to 27.50 shillings
as of 2:51 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  “We expect demand to increase slightly because the stock
is trading cum dividend until Oct. 14,” Gregory Waweru, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said
in a phone interview. “We are also anticipating shareholders’
approval for the rights offer.”  The airline said on Sept. 20 it would seek stockholder
approval on Oct. 14 to double its share capital to 10 billion
shillings ($97.8 million) by creating 1 billion new shares.
Kenya Airways also plans to obtain permission to sell stock to
existing shareholders, the ratio of which will be determined by
the company’s directors, it said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
