Groupon Inc., the online-coupon site
that has filed for an initial public offering, said it plans to
“significantly” reduce online marketing spending over time as
such investments yield insufficient returns.  Marketing spending may become less attractive because of
“changes in subscriber economics, achievement of subscriber
saturation levels in various markets or a determination that
subscriber growth objectives can be satisfied though alternative
means,” Chicago-based Groupon said in a  regulatory filing  today.
The reduction won’t adversely impact business with existing
customers or subscribers, the company said.  Until now, Groupon has had to boost spending to add users
to its e-mail list, weighing on its profitability. That trend
could be worrisome to investors, according to Mark Fickes, a
partner at law firm  BraunHagey & Borden LLP  in  San Francisco ,
who spoke before the filing.  Groupon has drawn criticism for unusual accounting
practices, rising marketing costs and the loss of two chief
operating officers in six months. The startup has already
postponed its IPO and pushed back meetings with investors due to
stock-market swings, people familiar with the matter said last
month.  The company makes money by selling discounts -- known as
 Groupons  -- from businesses such as restaurants and nail salons.
It then splits the revenue with the businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
