Canada ’s economy added the most jobs
in eight months in September, led by hiring at schools, bringing
the country’s jobless rate to its lowest since 2008 and adding
to evidence the country is averting a new recession.  Employment rose by 60,900 after a decline of 5,500 in
August, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The unemployment
rate fell to 7.1 percent, its lowest since December 2008.
Bloomberg News surveys called for a job gain of 15,000 and
unemployment to remain at 7.3 percent.  The rise marks a recovery for the country’s labor market
after the economy added a net 1,600 workers in the previous two
months, bringing the average monthly gain in the third quarter
to 20,833. The world’s 10th-largest economy shrank in the second
quarter, two years after its last recession.  “It helps to allay some of those fears that Canada does
get dragged down into a recession,” said  David Tulk , chief
macro strategist for Canada at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit in Toronto. “This helps to maybe force the
market to reconsider its current pricing of  Bank of Canada 
cuts.”  Two-year government bond yields rose three basis points to
0.97 percent at 4:43 p.m. in Toronto. The Canadian currency fell
0.2 percent to C$1.0392 per  U.S. dollar  from C$1.0371 yesterday.
It touched C$1.0658 on Oct. 4, the weakest level since August
2010. One Canadian dollar buys 96.23 U.S. cents.  Growth Prospects  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in an e-mailed statement
today the jobs data reflect the country’s growth prospects.  “September’s job growth shows Canada is on the right track
for steady, modest  job creation  and economic growth,” Flaherty
said in the statement. He also said the  unemployment rate  still
remains too high.  The jobs report is the last before the Bank of Canada’s
next interest-rate decision on Oct. 25. The central bank has
held its key rate at 1 percent since September 2010, and Senior
Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said in a Sept. 27 speech policy
makers would be “prudent” with interest-rate increases during
a slow economic rebound threatened by weak U.S. demand and
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Some investors are betting the central bank’s next move
will be a cut. The three-month overnight index swap rate, which
is based on what investors expect the central bank’s rate will
average during that period, rose to 0.936 percent, from 0.934
percent yesterday. That’s below the central bank’s 1 percent
target for overnight loans between banks. It traded as low as
.908 percent earlier this week.  Economic ‘Headwinds’  Today’s jobs report also highlights some of the
“headwinds” faced by the economy, Tulk said. Half of the 16
industries tracked by  Statistics Canada  recorded declines, which
were offset by boost from a “statistical quirk” in the data
for education services.  The monthly gain was led by 38,400 new jobs in education
services, and a 35,600 increase for professional and scientific
services. Public sector jobs rose 36,900, while employment in
the private sector was down 14,900.  Employers recorded the lowest quarterly job gain over the
past three months since the fourth quarter of 2010.  The report was “better than expected for sure, and I’ll
take that,” said  Stewart Hall , a currency strategist at  RBC
Dominion Securities  in Toronto. “But a game changer? I don’t
think so.”  Finance Losses  The finance, insurance, real estate and leasing industries
saw 35,300 jobs lost in the month. Construction companies added
11,600 new jobs during the month, while natural resources firms
hired 17,100 workers.  Canada’s jobless rate has been below the U.S. since October
2008. The Labor Department in  Washington  today reported payrolls
climbed by 103,000 workers in September, compared with a median
forecast of 60,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.  In Canada, full-time employment rose by 63,800 in
September, while part-time jobs fell by 2,900.  Canadian average hourly wages rose 1.5 percent in September
from a year earlier, the report said. Wages rose at a 1.4
percent pace in July and August, the slowest June 2003.  Self-employed workers rose by 38,900, while workers
classified as employees increased 22,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
