Virgin Money Ltd.,  Richard Branson ’s
U.K. banking venture, named David Clementi chairman as it bids
for part of Northern Rock Plc, the first British lender rescued
by the government in the credit crisis.  Clementi, 62, succeeds Brian Pitman, who died in March last
year, Virgin said in an e-mailed statement today. He was
chairman of insurer Prudential Plc between 2002 and 2008 and
deputy governor of the  Bank of England  before that.  Branson is seeking to expand his Virgin Money operation in
the U.K., which has about 3 million customers. He said in June
he had contemplated bidding for 632 branches being sold by
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, the country’s biggest mortgage lender.  Virgin Group failed in a bid to acquire  Northern Rock  in
2008 before the bank was nationalized. Northern Rock Plc, the
consumer bank, separated in January 2010 from Northern Rock
Asset Management Plc, which is now closed to new customers.
U.S. private-equity firm JC Flowers & Co. has also bid for
Northern Rock, which is valued at about 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion), a person with knowledge of the talks said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
