European Central Bank Executive Board
member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the bank considered
yesterday that benchmark interest rates were “sufficiently low
in the current situation.”  Leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility is
being debated, within the context of legal limits, he said in an
interview with Intereconomia radio in  Madrid  today.  “We are having that debate: how to leverage the fund with
the limits imposed by the union’s treaty and the legal limits,
among which that of a central bank not financing governments
directly,” he said.  The idea of a Greek default is still “absurd,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
