Pakistan  Gasport Ltd. is scheduled to
sign a $98 million loan agreement with Overseas Private
Investment Corp. of the U.S. to build a liquefied natural gas
terminal in Karachi.  The deal is to be signed tomorrow, Razi Ahmed, director
Pakistan Gasport, said in an e-mailed statement. The $166
million project will help power producers lower costs, according
to the statement.  Demand for energy in Pakistan exceeds supply by as much as
three times. Daily electricity outages have forced textile and
engineering factories to close and have caused riots across the
country.  The LNG will be sold to independent power producers which
are switching to gas from furnace oil to benefit from a 10
percent reduction in fuel costs, Pakistan Gasport said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
