The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for a 21st
day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.39111 percent from 0.38778 percent yesterday,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest rate since Aug. 10, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 30.51 basis points at 12:07 p.m. in London,
from 29.98 yesterday. That’s the widest on a closing-price basis
since July 23, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to
39.11 basis points after reaching 38.27 basis points yesterday,
the highest level since June 29, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
