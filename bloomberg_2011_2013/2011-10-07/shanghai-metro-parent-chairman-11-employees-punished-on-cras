Shanghai ’s state-controlled subway
operator said 12 employees, including its parent’s chairman and
president, were punished after a crash that injured 284 people
last month.  Chairman Ying Minghong, President Yu Guangyao and five
others received “demerits,” Shanghai Shentong Metro Co. said
in a  statement  on its website yesterday without elaboration.
Four workers in the dispatch department were removed from their
posts and an operations-centre general manager was lowered in
rank, it said.  The metro operator has also set up a special workforce to
help enhance safety on Line 10, where the two trains collided
Sept. 27. Investigators found that the crash happened after
train dispatchers sent wrong commands without following proper
procedures, Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.  Two phone calls to Shanghai Metro’s press office, and a
call each to Ying’s and Yu’s offices went unanswered.  China  is
observing a public holiday today.  The accident occurred two months after 40 people were
killed when a high-speed train crashed into the back of another
locomotive near the city of Wenzhou. The incidents have stoked
concerns that China’s rapid construction of new transport links
comes at the cost of safety.  To contact the reporters on this story:
