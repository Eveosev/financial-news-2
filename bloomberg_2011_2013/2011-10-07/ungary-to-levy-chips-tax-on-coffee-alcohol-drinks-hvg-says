Hungary will extend a tax imposed on
food and drinks containing “high” levels of sugar, salt and
caffeine to coffee, flavored beer and beverages that contain
alcohol, HVG  reported , citing a document it obtained.  The levy, originally called a “chips tax,” will be
equivalent to 250 forint ($1.13) per kilogram of coffee, 35
forint per liter of flavored beer and 100 forint per liter of
alcoholic beverage, the weekly newspaper said. The government
seeks to raise 30 billion forint of revenue from the tax next
year, HVG said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
