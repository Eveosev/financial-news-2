Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono plans to reshuffle the cabinet and is discussing
potential replacements for ministers with his deputy, a
spokesman said.  The president has been in “intensive” talks with Vice
President Boediono about the changes this week, Daniel Sparringa, a presidential spokesman, told reporters in Jakarta
today. Yudhoyono told reporters last month he would carry out
the reshuffle by Oct. 20. Sparringa didn’t say when the move
would occur.  Yudhoyono is struggling to recover from a drop to his
public approval amid corruption scandals affecting members of
the ruling party. The president’s popularity fell to a record
low in June, with 47.2 percent of respondents in a poll by
Indonesian Survey Circle saying they approved of his
performance.  Corruption, government inefficiency and poor infrastructure
were among reasons cited in the  World Economic Forum ’s 2011-2012
Global Competitiveness Report for  Indonesia  falling two places
to 46th out of 142 economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
