Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest listed lender, had the biggest weekly drop in eight as
traders said U.S.-based funds may be selling the stock after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the bank to its “focus sell”
list on Oct. 3.  Garanti fell 14 kurus, or 2.1 percent, to 6.52 liras at
5:30 p.m. in Istanbul, taking losses this week to 10 percent.
The share rose 16 percent last month.  “Along with the Goldman Sachs sell report, I guess one of
the big funds is massively selling,” Ata Doganoglu, a trader at
Ekspres Invest in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “I think U.S. funds are going underweight.”  Garanti has lost 30 percent since reaching a record high of
9.38 liras in November 2010.  Garanti is “exposed to deteriorating banking dynamics
should Turkish economic growth turn to a recession, an outcome
that Goldman economists are now assigning a relatively high
probability,” the e-mailed report issued by Goldman’s equity
research division said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
