The Portuguese government plans to
merge the city buses and the metropolitan system in Lisbon and
Oporto, as it seeks to cut costs to fulfil the countryâ€™s
financial aid program.  Portugal  also plans to start, this month, charging tolls on
some highways that are currently free, Economy Minister Alvaro
Santos Pereira said in parliament today. The government will
also sell assets in the public transportation sector, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
