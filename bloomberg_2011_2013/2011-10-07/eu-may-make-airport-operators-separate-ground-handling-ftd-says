The European Commission may compel
airport operators to hive off their ground handling units to
create more competition, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing a proposal by Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas that it obtained.  Proposed legislation would require at least three ground
handling services companies to operate at any airport, compared
with two at present, the newspaper said.  In a separate proposal, Kallas plans to allow airport
operators to charge airlines for reserving slots and make it
easier for them to take away slots carriers arenâ€™t using, the FT
Deutschland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
