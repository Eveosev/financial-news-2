Thailand  may cut its forecast for
economic growth this year because of damage caused by the
nation’s worst flooding in more than half a century, Deputy
Prime Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said.  “We need to prevent flooding from two key industrial parks
in Ayutthaya,” Kittiratt told reporters today in Bangkok.  Thailand’s National Economic and Social Development Board
forecasts economic growth this year of between 3.5 percent and 4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
