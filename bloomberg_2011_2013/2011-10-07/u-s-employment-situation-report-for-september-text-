Following is the text of the September
employment report from the Labor Department.  Nonfarm payroll employment edged up by 103,000 in
September, and the unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. The increase
in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of
about 45,000 telecommunications workers who had been on strike
in August. In September, job gains occurred in professional
and business services, health care, and construction.
Government employment continued to trend down.  Household Survey Data  The number of unemployed persons, at 14.0 million, was
essentially unchanged in September, and the unemployment rate
was 9.1 percent. Since April, the rate has held in a narrow
range from 9.0 to 9.2 percent.
Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men (8.8 percent), adult women (8.1 percent), teenagers
(24.6 percent), whites (8.0 percent), blacks (16.0 percent),
and Hispanics (11.3 percent) showed little or no change in
September. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.8 percent, not
seasonally adjusted.
The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks
and over) was 6.2 million in September. These individuals
accounted for 44.6 percent of the unemployed.
Both the  labor force  and employment increased in September.
However, the civilian labor force participation rate, at 64.2
percent, and the employment-population ratio, at 58.3 percent,
were little changed.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons
(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) rose
to 9.3 million in September. These individuals were working
part time because their hours had been cut back or because
they were unable to find a full-time job.
In September, about 2.5 million persons were marginally
attached to the labor force, about the same as a year earlier.
(The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were
not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,
and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They
were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched
for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 1.0 million
discouraged workers in September, down by 172,000 from a year
earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged
workers are persons not currently looking for work because
they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5
million persons marginally attached to the labor force in
September had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding
the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family
responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment edged up by 103,000 in
September. Since April, payroll employment has increased by an
average of 72,000 per month, compared with an average of
161,000 for the prior 7 months. In September, job gains
occurred in professional and business services, health care,
and construction. Government employment continued to trend
down.  Employment in professional and business services increased by
48,000 over the month and has grown by 897,000 since a recent
low in September 2009. Employment in temporary help services
edged up in September; this industry has added 53,000 jobs
over the past 3 months. In September, employment growth
continued in computer systems design and in management and
technical consulting services.  Health care employment continued to expand in September, with
an increase of 44,000. Within the industry, job gains occurred
in ambulatory health care services (+26,000) and in hospitals
(+13,000).  Construction employment increased by 26,000 over the month,
after showing little movement since February. The over-the-
month gain was due to employment increases in the
nonresidential construction industries, which includes heavy
and civil construction. Mining employment continued to trend
up in September.  Employment in information was up by 34,000 over the month due
to the return of about 45,000 telecommunications workers to
payrolls after an August strike.  Manufacturing employment changed little in September (-13,000)
and has been essentially flat for the past 2 months.  Within retail trade, employment declined in electronic and
appliance stores (-9,000) in September. Employment in
wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, financial
activities, and leisure and hospitality changed little.  Government employment continued to trend down over the month (-
34,000). The U.S. Postal Service continued to lose jobs (-
5,000). Local government employment declined by 35,000 and has
fallen by 535,000 since September 2008.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour over the month to 34.3 hours
following a decrease of 0.1 hour in August. The manufacturing
workweek edged down by 0.1 hour in September to 40.2 hours.
Factory overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The
average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees
on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours
in September.  In September, average hourly earnings for all employees on
private nonfarm payrolls increased by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $23.12. This increase followed a decline of 4 cents in
August. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have
increased by 1.9 percent. In September, average hourly
earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory
employees increased by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $19.52.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was
revised from +85,000 to +127,000, and the change for August
was revised from 0 to +57,000.  The Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be
released on Friday, November 4, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  To contact the reporter on this story:
