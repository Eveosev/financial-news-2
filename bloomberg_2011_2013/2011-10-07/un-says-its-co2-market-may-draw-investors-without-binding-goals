The United Nations carbon market may
attract investors in emission-reduction projects even if the
Kyoto Protocol goals for developed nations were to expire in
2012 without being immediately renewed, a UN official said.  “Even without binding targets there may be countries
interested in the Clean Development Mechanism,” James Grabert,
coordinator for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s
sustainable development mechanisms, told a Platts seminar in
Brussels today.  A failure to agree on new Kyoto targets would dry up the
UN’s market,  Su Wei , the lead Chinese negotiator, said yesterday
in an interview at UN-sponsored talks in Panama City. The Clean
Development Mechanism, or CDM, generates credits for investment
in emission-reduction projects in  developing countries .  The European Union, which has internal emissions-cutting
targets until 2020 and allows some UN credits for compliance,
will probably remain the CDM driving force in coming years, EU
Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
