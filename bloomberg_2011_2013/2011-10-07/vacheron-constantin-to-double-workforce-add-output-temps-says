Vacheron Constantin , a watchmaking
unit of Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, plans to double its
workforce to 1,300 by 2020 as it spends 100 million Swiss francs
($109 million) on buildings and production,  Le Temps  reported,
citing Juan-Carlos Torres, head of the brand.  Vacheron Constantin aims for all its watches to qualify for
the stamp of the seal of Geneva, a sign of craftsmanship, by
2016 compared with 70 percent currently, Torres said, according
to the newspaper. The brand plans to produce as many as 30,000
mechanical watches annually compared with 17,000 to 18,000 this
year, the newspaper said. The economic slowdown hasnâ€™t weighed
on sales, Le Temps reported, citing Torres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
