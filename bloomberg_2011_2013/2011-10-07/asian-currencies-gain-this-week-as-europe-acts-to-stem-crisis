Asian currencies completed their
first weekly advance in a month, led by Malaysia’s ringgit, as
optimism European officials will contain the region’s debt
crisis helped revive demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.5
percent this week as the  European Central Bank  outlined plans to
pump cash into the debt-ridden economy. The ringgit and Taiwan’s
dollar gained as reports yesterday showed export growth
accelerated. Global funds bought a combined $403 million more of
South Korean, Taiwanese and Thai shares than they sold on Oct. 6,
exchange data show.  “Markets appear to have taken it positively that the ECB
provided extraordinary liquidity measures at its policy
meeting,” said Nick Verdi, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at  Barclays Capital . “We have very positive
fundamental views on a number of Asian currencies. Given the
risks emanating from  Europe  which will persist in the near term,
the volatility isn’t likely to fall.”  The ringgit gained 1.1 percent this week to 3.1608 per
dollar yesterday in  Kuala Lumpur , snapping four weeks of
declines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Philippine peso  gained 0.4 percent to 43.545 and South Korea’s
won jumped 1.1 percent yesterday to 1,178.40 and was little
changed from last week.  Malaysian exports climbed 10.9 percent in August from a
year earlier, the most in four months, according to a trade
ministry statement yesterday. Shipments from Taiwan rose 9.9
percent in September, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.
That compared with a gain of 7.2 percent in the prior month and
the median estimate of 9.6 percent in a Bloomberg survey.  Unlimited Loans  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares advanced for a second
day after ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on Oct. 6 the
monetary authority would reintroduce purchases of covered bonds
and offer banks additional unlimited loans to support markets.
Europe’s policy makers left the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 1.5 percent.  Employers in the U.S. added more workers in September than
forecast, according to a Labor Department report yesterday.
Payrolls rose by 103,000 after a 57,000 gain in August. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
increase of 60,000. The jobless rate in the U.S. was 9.1 percent.  “The ECB’s plan to boost liquidity allayed concern in the
market,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in  Seoul .  The baht strengthened 0.5 percent yesterday and 0.5 percent
this week to 30.94 per dollar in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Taiwan ’s dollar increased 0.4 percent to
NT$30.49 and was little changed from last week.  Stockpile Shrank  Data this week showed currency reserves in Taiwan fell by a
record $11.2 billion last month, while Korea’s stockpile shrank
by the most in three years, indicating central banks sold
dollars to support local currencies. Indonesian holdings dropped
$10 billion last month from a record $124.6 billion in August,
the bank reported on Oct. 6.  Taiwan’s dollar had its worst month in September since 1997,
prompting central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan to say on Oct. 5
policy makers don’t favor a weaker currency.  Bank Indonesia  will continue to purchase government debt to
stabilize the rupiah, Hendar, the central bank’s director of
monetary policy who uses only one name, said in a mobile-phone
text message on Oct. 3.  Thailand ’s central bank also said this
week it entered the market to curb volatility. Policy makers
intervene by buying or selling currencies to try and influence
exchange rates.  “Some Asian central banks, not just Thailand, seem to have
been intervening and that should also support currencies in the
region,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok.  India ’s rupee gained 0.4 percent yesterday to 49.1550 per
dollar, paring its drop for the week to 0.4 percent.  Indonesia ’s
rupiah declined 0.1 percent yesterday and 1.2 percent this week
to 8,900, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. Markets in  China  are shut this week for the National
Day holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
