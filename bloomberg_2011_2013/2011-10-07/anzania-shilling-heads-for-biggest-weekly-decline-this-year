     Oct. 7 (Bloomberg)- Tanzania’s shilling is headed for the
biggest weekly drop this year as manufacturers buy dollars to
fund imports.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second biggest economy fell
1.1 percent to 1,707.50 as of 1:42 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam , the
commercial capital, bringing its weekly decline to 2.7 percent,
the most since the week ended Dec. 31. The shilling fell to
1,714.5 earlier today, its lowest level since October 1994. The
currency has declined for 12 consecutive weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There has been significant demand today from the
manufacturing sector,” said Zainul Chandoo, head of Treasury at
Stanbic Bank Tanzania Ltd., a unit of Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd., in an interview in Dar es Salaam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
