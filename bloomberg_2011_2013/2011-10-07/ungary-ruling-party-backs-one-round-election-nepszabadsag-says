Hungary ’s ruling party wants to
replace the current two-round electoral system with a single-
round system and give ethnic Hungarian citizens living abroad
partial  voting rights ,  Nepszabadsag  said, without citing anyone.  County lists would be replaced by a national list for which
voters could opt while slots on a local-district candidate list
would be reduced to between 90 and 110 from the current 176, the
daily reported. Ethnic Hungarians living abroad without
permanent residency in Hungary would be able to vote for the
national list only, Nepszabadsag said.  Political parties would need to collect 1,500
“recommendation slips” in 21 days to field a candidate in a
local district election, double the current amount, the daily
said.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s Fidesz party, which has a
two-thirds majority in Parliament, is overhauling the election
law as part of a new Constitution which will take effect in
2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
