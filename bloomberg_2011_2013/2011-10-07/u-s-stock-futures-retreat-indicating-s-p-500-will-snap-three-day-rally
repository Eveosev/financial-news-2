U.S. stock-index futures declined,
indicating that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will snap its
three-day rally, as investors awaited the Labor Department’s
jobs report.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in December declined 0.3
percent to 1,153.9 at 10:02 a.m. in  London . Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures expiring the same month slipped 33 points, or
0.3 percent, to 11,013.  The S&P 500 has climbed 6 percent over the last three days,
its biggest three-day gain since Aug. 15., as investors
speculated that European officials were making progress in
containing the region’s debt crisis. Even so, the gauge earlier
this week came within 1 percent of extending its decline from
its April peak to 20 percent, the common definition of a bear
market. Concern over Europe’s debt crisis sent the index to a
one-year low on Oct. 3, pushing it to 12.02 times reported
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
cheapest valuation level since 2009. The benchmark measure is
headed for a 3 percent gain this week.  A report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today may show that
non-farm payrolls increased in September at a pace that failed
to dent the  unemployment rate . Employment climbed by 55,000
workers after no change in August, according to the median
forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg news. The
jobless rate was 9.1 percent for a third consecutive month,
according to the forecasts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
