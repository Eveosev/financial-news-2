The lira rose in Istanbul, extending
earlier gains, after the central bank offered as much as $750 
million for liras in a daily auction as it sought to stem a 
recent decline in the currency.  The lira climbed 0.4 percent to 1.8379 per dollar at 11:04
a.m., heading for its fourth day of gains, the longest winning
streak in six months. Yields on benchmark two-year debt dropped
3 basis points to 8.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
