Press Release  Insights from Professionals Play a Role in Shaping Questions  NEW YORK --  LinkedIn , the world’s largest professional network
with more than 120 million members, is joining  Bloomberg  and  The
Washington Post  next Tuesday, October 11th at 8pm ET for the
first, and perhaps only, debate of the 2012 Republican
presidential campaign focused solely on the economy. LinkedIn
will tap into their U.S. members, compiling data and insights to
help inform questions asked at the debate.  “With over 14 million unemployed Americans, and the  unemployment
rate  averaging at 9.2 percent over the last 12 months, jobs and
restarting the economy will be the hot topics of this debate,”
said  Andrew Morse , head of U.S. television for Bloomberg. “Who
better to bring into the conversation than LinkedIn, the company
that truly has its finger on the pulse of today’s modern
workforce?”  Last week, LinkedIn gave its members an opportunity to
participate in a conversation about  job creation  and putting
America back to work during a  Town Hall with President Obama . In
the coming days, LinkedIn will leverage this platform and
community to gauge specific economic topics of interest for the
Republican candidate debate. LinkedIn members can participate
here:  http://linkd.in/GOPdebate   Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, businessman  Herman Cain , former
House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , former Utah Gov.  Jon Huntsman ,
Texas Rep.  Ron Paul , Texas Gov.  Rick Perry , former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania Sen.  Rick Santorum  will
be asked questions based exclusively on jobs, debt, deficits,
taxes, trade, and other key issues voters deem most important as
it pertains to the economy.  The debate, moderated by  Charlie Rose , alongside The Washington
Post Karen Tumulty and Bloomberg’s  Julianna Goldman , will be
broadcast live on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio and
WBIN-TV in  New Hampshire . It will also be available to viewers
