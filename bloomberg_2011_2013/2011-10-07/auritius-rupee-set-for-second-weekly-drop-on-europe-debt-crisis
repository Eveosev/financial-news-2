Mauritius’s rupee is heading for a
second week of declines versus the euro, the currency of its
main trading partner, as European leaders fail to present
definite plans to curb the sovereign debt crisis.  The currency depreciated as much as 0.8 percent, trading
0.7 percent weaker to 39.3889 per euro, by 11:58 a.m. in Port
Louis. That brings the rupee’s weekly loss to 1.2 percent,
extending last week’s 0.7 percent retreat. Versus the dollar,
the rupee declined 0.3 percent to 29.30.  Leaders of the 17-member single currency face investor
pressure to announce a rescue plans for the zone’s banks before
a Group of 20 summit in November. French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  will meet German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in two days,
their eighth in 20 months, to discuss of possibilities
surrounding a Greek default.  “The general mood remains ineluctably downbeat,” analysts
at  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the country’s largest lender by
market share, said in an e-mailed note to clients today.
“Policymakers need to come up with a short-term plan to assuage
markets, and a longer term one, aimed at fixing the structural
inefficiencies of  Europe ’s recovery as well as thinking how they
want the future Euro-zone to look.”  Europe is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main trading
partner, accounting for 62 percent of tourism arrivals in the
January to August period, according to the Mauritius Tourism
Promotion Authority. About 37 percent of Mauritius’s outstanding
central government  debt  was euro-denominated as of June 2011,
according to data from the  finance ministry .  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.2454 to 28.4159
rupees and the selling price dropped to 29.7514 compared with
29.8313 yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
