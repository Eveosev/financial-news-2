Chow Sang Sang Holdings International
Ltd. (116) , the biggest Hong Kong-listed jewelry maker and retailer,
said sales rose more than 50 percent in the first six days of
China’s Golden Week holiday, compared with the same period last
year.  “We’ve attracted a lot of gold buyers this year due to the
plunge in gold prices in late September,” Dennis Lau, the
jeweler’s director of sales operations, said in an interview
today. “A lot of people are taking advantage of this and coming
to  Hong Kong  to shop.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.46 percent to $1,659.
The precious metal plunged 8.6 percent in the week to Sept. 23
on concern that the world economy may slip into a recession.  Chow Sang Sang rose as much as 13 percent to HK$18.94
before trading at HK$18.30 as of 3:45 p.m. in Hong Kong trading.
The stock has lost 3.7 percent this year, compared with a 23
percent slide for the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
