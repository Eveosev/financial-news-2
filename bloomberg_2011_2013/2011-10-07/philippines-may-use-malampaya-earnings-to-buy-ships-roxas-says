The  Philippines  is “assessing” if
it can use some earnings from the Malampaya natural gas project
to buy vessels that will be deployed in the South China Sea,
Transportation and Communications Secretary Mar Roxas said in
 Manila  today.  The Southeast Asian nation will seek for a “clearer
presence” in the area by deploying two of the coast guard’s
four long-range ships, Roxas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
