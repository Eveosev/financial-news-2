Emerging-market stocks should rally
into the end of the year on valuations and post “big” gains
over the next year, Citigroup Inc. said.  “After their fourth-worst quarter since 1990, emerging-
market equities now price in recession, but not a return to
2008-9,” Citigroup analysts including Geoffrey Dennis wrote in
a report dated yesterday. “Further volatility is likely in the
fourth quarter as the EU debt crisis plays out and on further
global growth downgrades.”  Citigroup raised its rating on  India  to “neutral” and
said it’s staying “overweight” on  Asia  and “underweight” on
Latin America and CEEMEA, or Central Eastern Europe, Middle East
& Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
