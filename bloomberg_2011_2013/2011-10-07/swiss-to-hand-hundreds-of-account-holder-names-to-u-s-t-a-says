Swiss banks will provide U.S.
authorities with the names of hundreds of account holders with
untaxed funds, Tages-Anzeiger reported, without saying where it
got the information.  A first batch of data will be handed over in late October,
with more to follow in mid-November, the Swiss newspaper said.  The decision to pass on the information was taken last week
at a closed meeting between Swiss officials and 11 banks
including  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
