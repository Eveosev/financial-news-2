The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. public pension, paid its
investment officers $4.4 million in performance bonuses last
year, a 33 percent increase from the previous year.  The $218 billion pension system gave bonuses of $100,000 or
more to 16 employees, led by a $212,063 award to Tom McDonagh, a
senior portfolio manager in the fixed-income section, according
to data released under a public-records request. McDonagh’s
award was pro-rated for 14.5 months in his position, the records
showed.  Calpers earned 20.7 percent in the year ended June 30, its
best performance in 14 years, as stocks and private-equity
holdings rebounded from losses in 2008 and 2009. Bonuses are
based on  investment performance  over a three-year period. Last
year, Calpers handed out $3.3 million in performance awards,
according to data it released.  “It’s important to note that the Calpers board cut salary
increases for eligible staff in half, recognizing the current
fiscal environment,” said  Brad Pacheco , a pension spokesman, in
an e-mail message.  Performance awards went to 53 employees whose normal
salaries totaled $11,029,312, the records showed.  McDonagh didn’t work for the pension system in 2009, so his
bonus wasn’t depressed by Calpers’s losses that year, Pacheco
said. McDonagh didn’t respond to a request for comment made
through Pacheco.  “Certainly we’re not in the doom-and-gloom we were in, in
2009,” Girard Miller, a PFM Group senior strategist for
retirement finance and public-sector investments, said in a
telephone interview. The PFM Group is a Philadelphia-based
provider of financial-investment advisory services.  “There’s always a great deal of scrutiny and criticism of
the compensation for public-sector investment professionals,”
said Miller, who is based in  Los Angeles . “Bonuses for public-
sector investment professionals are justified. They need to be
performance-based.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
