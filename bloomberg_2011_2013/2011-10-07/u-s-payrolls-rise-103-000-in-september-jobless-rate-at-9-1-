American employers added more workers
in September than forecast and figures for the prior two months
were revised higher, easing concern the economy is tipping into
another recession.  Payrolls rose by 103,000 after a 57,000 gain in August, the
Labor Department said today in Washington. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called for an increase
of 60,000. The figures reflected the end of a strike at  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  that brought 45,000 people back to work. The
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  Treasuries fell as the report added to evidence the world’s
largest economy is maintaining its expansion. The pace of job
growth is still too slow to push down the unemployment rate as
companies hold back on hiring amid the debt crisis in  Europe ,
political gridlock in the U.S. and a decline in stock prices.  “It’s steady growth at a painfully slow pace,” said
 Michael Englund , chief economist at Action Economics LLC in
Boulder,  Colorado , who forecast a gain of 100,000 jobs. “The
economy isn’t doing well, but it didn’t lose the momentum that
the markets feared.”  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.07 percent
at 4 p.m. in  New York  from 1.99 percent late yesterday. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent to 1,155.46 at the
close in New York.  Hours and earnings both increased, the report showed, and
revisions to previous reports added a total of 99,000 jobs to
payrolls in July and August.  Week of Data  The report capped a week of data indicating the economy is
gaining strength after growing at the slowest pace in two years
in the first half of 2011.  Manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated in September,
propelled by gains in exports and production, according to
figures from the Institute for Supply Management. Construction
spending expanded in August, and orders for capital equipment
increased by the most in three months, government data showed.  “The economy is certainly not as weak as it was thought to
be over the last couple of months,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief
financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
New York.  Labor Secretary Hilda Solis used the report to push
President Barack Obama’s $447 billion jobs plan consisting of
tax cuts and infrastructure projects.  “We need to do more,” Solis said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. Obama’s plan, proposed last month, will
create between 1 million to 1.9 million jobs, she said.  Ford Motor   Ford Motor Co. (F)  is among companies planning to boost
payrolls, saying this week said it has committed to add about
12,000 hourly jobs in its U.S. manufacturing plants by 2015 as
part of an agreement with the United Auto Workers.  Ford said it will be “in-sourcing” jobs from  Mexico ,
 China  and  Japan . Ford said this will be 5,750 hourly jobs more
than a previously announced 7,000 positions to be added by the
end of 2012.  Other companies are more cautious.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the
third-biggest U.S. bank, said last month it will limit hiring to
only “critical” jobs as the economic slowdown continues and
revenue slumps.  “We are currently only filling positions we believe are
critical to the line of business or function,”  Shannon Bell , a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said in an interview
Sept. 15.  Sustained increases of around 200,000 jobs a month are
needed to reduce the jobless rate by about a percentage point
over a year, according to  Eric Green , chief market economist at
TD Securities Inc. in New York.  Bringing Down Unemployment  “This is not the kind of job growth that brings
unemployment down,”  James Glassman , senior economist at JP
Morgan Chase & Co. in New York, said in an interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Estimates of the 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for
overall payrolls ranged from a decline of 50,000 to a 115,000
increase. The  unemployment rate  was projected to hold at 9.1
percent, according to the survey median.  More Americans who would like a full-time job are settling
for part-time work instead. They are counted in the
underemployment rate, which increased to 16.5 percent, the
highest this year, from 16.2 percent. The number of people
working part-time for “economic reasons” jumped 444,000 to 9.3
million.  Unemployment has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009,
the longest stretch of such elevated joblessness since monthly
records began in 1948. Through September, the economy had
recovered about 2.09 million of the 8.75 million jobs lost as a
result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  Federal Reserve   “Economic growth remains slow,” Federal Reserve policy
makers said Sept. 21 as they announced a plan to bring down
longer-term lending rates. While officials said they “expect
some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters,” they
anticipate “the unemployment rate will decline only
gradually.”  Private payrolls, which exclude government jobs, rose
137,000 after a gain of 32,000 in the prior month, the Labor
Department said.  Factory payrolls declined 13,000 in September, the biggest
decrease since August 2010, after a 4,000 decline in August.
Employment at service-providers increased 85,000 in September,
the most since April. Construction employment climbed 26,000,
the biggest gain since February and led by a jump in non-
residential building.  Hourly Earnings  Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent to $23.12. The
average work week for all workers climbed six minutes to 34.3
hours.  Government payrolls decreased by 34,000 last month.
Employment rose by 2,000 at state governments and slumped 35,000
at the local level.  New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ’s administration this week
asked agency heads to cut spending by $2 billion over the next
18 months and freeze hiring on concern that a slowing economy
may reduce city revenue.  “We’re looking at extreme economic uncertainty, and state
and federal governments that are likely to further cut funds
they return to the city,” Caswell Holloway, deputy mayor for
operations, said in a statement. The mayor is founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
