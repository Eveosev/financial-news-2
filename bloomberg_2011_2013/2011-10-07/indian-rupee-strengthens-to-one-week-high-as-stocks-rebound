India ’s rupee rose to a one-week high
on speculation a rebound in the nation’s benchmark stock index
will lure overseas investors as Europe takes steps to resolve
its debt crisis.  The BSE Sensitive Index of shares climbed 2.8 percent after
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday the monetary authority would reintroduce purchases of
covered bonds and offer loans to banks. Falling demand for the
dollar also aided gains in the rupee, said Vikas Babu, a
currency trader in Mumbai at  Andhra Bank .  “The Sensex started positive and supported the rupee on
expectations of capital inflows,” said Babu. “The dollar had
also been overbought as investors avoided assets from countries
like India because of worries about  Europe .”  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 49.16 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 48.9950, its highest level since
Sept. 29. The currency pared its losses for the week to 0.4
percent. The nation’s financial markets were shut yesterday for
a public holiday.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency’s performance
against six major trading partners, declined for a third day.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.75 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.88 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
