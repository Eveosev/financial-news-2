Support for Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou ’s ruling party sank to the lowest level this
year after the government proposed a new property tax and cuts
to pensions and wages, according to a Public Issue poll.  Papandreou’s  Pasok  party had 22.5 percent support, a drop
of 5.5 percentage points from the month before and down from
38.5 percent in January, the poll, conducted for  Kathimerini 
newspaper and  SKAI TV , showed. Backing for the leading
opposition party  New Democracy  fell 0.5 percentage point to 31.5
percent. Smaller parties gained, as the Coalition of the Radical
Left, or  Syriza , added 0.5 percentage point to 9.5 percent and
the Democratic Left 2 percentage points to 5 percent.  Papandreou’s support is ebbing after the government,
seeking to avert a default, introduced measures to plug the
budget gap for 2011 and 2012, including a property tax approved
by parliament on Sept. 27 and deeper cuts to state pensions and
wages. The legislation, aimed at securing additional bailout
funds, came after inspectors from the  International Monetary
Fund  and European Union halted a review of Greece on Sept. 1.  Greek bonds fell as 10-year yields climbed 24 basis points,
or 0.24 percentage point, to 23.5 percent, according to generic
pricing for euro-denominated  government securities . Greece’s
4.59 percent bond due in 2016 fell 5 cents to 34.875 cents on
the euro, raising the yield to 35.6 percent. The benchmark ASE
Index rose 0.6 percent to 744.37, a third day of gains.  Early Elections  The poll of 1,015 people, conducted Sept. 29 to Oct. 4,
found 53 percent of respondents were opposed to early elections,
while 85 percent said the country is headed in the wrong
direction. The poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage
points.  “ Greece  is in a critical and difficult period but the
crisis is also an opportunity to change the economy,” Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos told reporters in  Athens  today
after a meeting with German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler.  Twenty-two percent of respondents said Papandreou, 59, was
the best choice for prime minister, down 4 percentage points,
while 28 percent picked 60-year-old New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, a gain of 6 percentage points from last month. Forty-
seven percent said neither is a good choice. Papandreou had a
negative rating of 73 percent compared with 59 percent for
Samaras.  When asked what composition the government should have, 18
percent of respondents preferred a coalition between the two
main parties, 18 percent said a broad coalition of parties and 9
percent said a  New Democracy  majority. Five percent of those
polled said they preferred a Pasok majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
