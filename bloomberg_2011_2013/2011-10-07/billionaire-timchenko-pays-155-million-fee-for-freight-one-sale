Billionaire Gennady Timchenko’s OOO
Transoil paid a 5 billion-ruble ($155 million) entry fee to bid
for a stake in state-owned OAO Russian Railways’ Freight One
cargo unit.  Transoil , which ships oil by rail, will submit its
application to bid for 75 percent minus 2 shares of Freight One
by Oct. 14, Transoil said today in an e-mailed statement.
Russian Railways plans to auction the Freight One stake on Oct.
28 with a starting price of 125.4 billion rubles and bids set to
rise in 500 million-ruble increments.  Timchenko, a co-founder of the Gunvor Group Ltd. energy
trading company, faces competition for Freight One from
steelmaking billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s UCL Holding
transportation company, which said Sept. 30 it will bid.  Globaltrans Investment Plc,  Russia ’s largest privately
owned railroad carrier, decided Sept. 27 not to participate in
the auction “due to global financial conditions.”  Timchenko may acquire the 33 percent of Transoil that he
doesn’t already own from Globaltrans’s owners, Kommersant
reported on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
