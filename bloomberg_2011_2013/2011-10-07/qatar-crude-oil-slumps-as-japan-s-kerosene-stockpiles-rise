Crude oil from  Qatar , which sold all
of its supplies last year to  Asia , slumped on signs that demand
for distillate-rich crudes may be falling as inventories rise.  Qatar Land for loading in December was at discount of 7
cents a barrel to its official selling price, up from 8 cents
below yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower
Zakum, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., remained at a 3
cents a barrel discount to its official level, Bloomberg data
showed.  Refinery demand for Qatari crude, including the Marine
grade, typically increases before winter because the type yields
large amounts of kerosene and middle distillates after basic
processing. Both Abu Dhabi National and state-owned  Qatar
Petroleum  raised their official prices last week, increasing the
perception the oil is expensive relative to others. At the same
time,  Japan ’s kerosene stockpiles last week climbed by 91,000
kiloliters to almost 3.4 million, or 21.2 million barrels, the
country’s Petroleum Association said last week.  Dubai swaps for December widened to a premium of $1.10 a
barrel today over January after reaching a two-week high
yesterday of 96 cents, according to data from London-based
brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. This is the largest price
difference between the first two months since at least June 2006.
This market situation is known as backwardation, suggesting
demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $1.70, or 1.7
percent, to $101.10 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December rose 1.7 percent to $100.52. Murban for
spot delivery climbed 1.7 percent to $105.14.  Oman futures for December delivery fell 95 cents to $101.37
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:44 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,234 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$101.61 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 10 cents to $5.05 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December rose 18 cents to $4.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
