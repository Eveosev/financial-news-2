Turkish trade minister Zafer Caglayan
said the fall in the value of the lira is no threat to  Turkey ’s
economy and the central bank is acting to limit any declines,
Hurriyet newspaper reported.  The fall stems from developments outside Turkey and
investors should “carry on watching the central bank,” which
is the best judge of where the lira ought to trade, Caglayan
said, acording to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
