Belgium’s Aa1 local- and foreign-
currency ratings were placed under review for a downgrade by
Moody’s Investors Service because of rising funding risks for
euro region nations with high levels of debt and additional bank
support measures which are likely to be needed.  The review will focus on the vulnerabilities of the Belgian
public debt in the current euro area sovereign crisis and
potential costs and contingent liabilities that the government
may incur in supporting  Dexia SA (DEXB) , Moody’s said in a statement
today. Moody’s will also assess how the risks for the growth
outlook of the economy and the government’s fiscal and economic
plans may impact the country’s debt trajectory.  The downgrade warning comes as France, Belgium and
Luxembourg seek to protect their local banking units of Dexia
from the debt crisis threatening the heart of Europe’s financial
system. Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  said he’ll do
whatever it takes to safeguard the bank in Belgium. Dexia’s
troubled assets may total as much as 190 billion euros ($256
billion).  Spain  and Italy, the euro region’s fourth- and third-
largest economies, were downgraded earlier today by  Fitch
Ratings  on concern they will struggle to improve their finances
as  Europe ’s debt crisis intensifies. Spain had its foreign and
local currency long-term issuer default ratings cut to AA- from
AA+, while Italy had the same set of ratings cut to A+ from AA-,
the company said today. The outlook for both countries is
negative. Fitch also maintained Portugal’s rating at BBB-,
saying it would complete a review of that ranking in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
