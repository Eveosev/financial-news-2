Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) , Europe’s largest
publicly traded real estate company, acquired a mall in
Barcelona for 189 million euros ($255 million) as it completed
the sale of two smaller centers in Germany and the Netherlands.  It acquired the 55,100 square-meter (593,100 square-foot)
 Splau  mall located south of the Spanish city from  Acciona SA (ANA) ,
according to a statement today. The Paris-based company also
completed the sale of a 50 percent stake in the Allee-Center in
Magdeburg to  Deutsche Euroshop AG (DEQ)  for 117 million euros, and on
Sept. 20 it raised 109 million euros from the disposal of the
Piazza Center in Eindhoven to a group of investors.  Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Poitrinal raised 1.1
billion euros in the first half by disposing of smaller centers
as he focuses the company on dominant regional malls that
attract shoppers with their big-name retail brands.  Unibail-Rodamco already owns La Maquinista and Glories
malls in  Barcelona . It’s seeking to boost occupancy at the Splau
mall, which opened 17 months ago and is almost 16 percent empty.  Unibail-Rodamco rose 2.5 euros, or 1.8 percent, to 143.5
euros at 4:20 p.m. in Paris trading. That lifted the value of
the company to 13.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
