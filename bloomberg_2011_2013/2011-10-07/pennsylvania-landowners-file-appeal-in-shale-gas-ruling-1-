A  Pennsylvania  couple has asked the
state’s  Supreme Court  to throw out a lower court’s decision
dealing with ownership of natural gas on their land.  John and Mary Butler said in a filing today that the state
Superior Court erred when it interpreted state law regarding
mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale gas field.  “The Superior Court’s ruling could have a profound impact
upon landowners and businesses in Pennsylvania,” the Butlers
said in their appeal. They asked the court to uphold a county
court verdict that gave them title to the gas.  Two other people had claimed partial ownership of the gas
beneath the Butlers’ 244 acres in Susquehanna County. The
Superior Court said Sept. 7 there was enough evidence to hold
further hearings, saying Pennsylvania law is unclear whether
shale gas is a mineral.  Under an 1882 court decision, ownership of oil and gas has
to be transferred separately from other minerals. Legal experts
said the Superior Court’s decision may cloud the title to other
gas leases in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, where
exploration companies such as  Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  and
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  have leased millions of acres.  The case is Butler v. Charles Powers Estate, 1795-mda-2010,
Superior Court of Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporters on this story:
