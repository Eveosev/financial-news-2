India ’s 11-year bonds declined for an
eighth day on speculation investors will cut holdings of
existing notes after the government raised its debt-sale plan.  The central bank sold 150 billion rupees ($3.1 billion) of
bonds due in 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2040 on behalf of the
government today, the first issuance in the fiscal second half.
The  finance ministry  will sell a record 4.7 trillion rupees of
securities in the year ending March 2012, compared with an
earlier estimate of 4.17 trillion rupees, R. Gopalan, secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, said last week.  “The heavy supply of debt is probably spurring investors
to reduce holdings,” said R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-
income and currencies in Mumbai at  State Bank  of Bikaner &
Jaipur. “People are generally bearish on bonds due to the
higher borrowing.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent securities due August 2022
rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.74
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  Primary dealers bought 1.93 billion rupees of the 2027 bond
and 7.06 billion rupees of the 2040 notes at today’s auctions,
the central bank said.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said in an interview
telecast by Bloomberg UTV on Oct. 4 that the nation may find it
hard to meet its budget-deficit target of 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product in the current fiscal year.  Food inflation accelerated to a three-week high,
maintaining pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates 
further. An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products gained 9.41 percent in the week ended Sept. 24 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement today.
It rose 9.13 percent the previous week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has increased interest rates six
times this year. The repurchase rate is 8.25 percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose five basis points to 7.94 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
