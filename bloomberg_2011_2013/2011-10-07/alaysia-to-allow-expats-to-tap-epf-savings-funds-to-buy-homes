Malaysia  will allow expatriates to
use their savings in the Employees Provident Fund to buy houses
in the country, Prime Minister Najib Razak said in his budget
speech in parliament in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  That will provide a more conducive environment for them to
continue working in Malaysia, Najib said. The number of
professional expatriates in the nation has increased to 41,000,
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
