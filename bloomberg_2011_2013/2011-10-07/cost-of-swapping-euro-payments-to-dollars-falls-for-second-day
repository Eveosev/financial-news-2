A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars declined for the second day, according to
a money markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, fell to 98 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate as of 5 p.m. in
 London , from 101 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap since Sept. 21.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Berlin on Oct. 9 to discuss
 Greece ’s debt problems as the nation edges closer to default.
Italy and  Spain  were downgraded by  Fitch Ratings , which cited
the countries’ vulnerability to the euro-area debt crisis.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was at 68 basis
points under Euribor, down from 69.5 yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 72 basis
points from 72.5 yesterday. The gauge increased to 89 basis
points on Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  Overnight Deposits  Lenders increased overnight deposits at the  European
Central Bank  to the highest in more than a year. Banks parked
229 billion euros ($308 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, up from 221 billion euros on Oct. 5. That’s the
highest since July 2010 and compares with a year-to-date average
of 56 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.566 percent from 1.556
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor rose to 1.178 percent from
1.155 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 21st day to 0.391 percent from 0.388 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 10, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was 38.6
basis points, near the biggest gap since July 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
