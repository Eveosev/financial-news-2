Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Alan Greenspan  said he’s concerned that the spread on French
bond yields over German bunds is rising.    “The markets look at  France  and, irrespective of what it
appears like, they are assessing France as a safe investment,”
Greenspan said in an interview on CNBC Television today. Still,
“yield spreads on bunds continue to edge higher, and that makes
me a little nervous.”   While the spread between French and German bond yields
shouldn’t be as wide as those on Spanish and Italian bonds, it
should probably be higher than 50 to 70 basis points, he said.  “France is borrowing from its other eurozone members,”
said Greenspan “Its current account deficit from the eurozone
is negative. It’s the only northern member in which it’s true.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
