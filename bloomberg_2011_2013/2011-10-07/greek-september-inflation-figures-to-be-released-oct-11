Greek inflation figures for September
will be released later than originally scheduled due to recent
strikes, the Hellenic Statistical Authority said.  The inflation rate calculated on European Union methods and
a separate measure using Greek methods will both be released on
Oct. 11, instead of today “due to delays in the processing of
data, on account of the recent strikes,” the agency said in an
e-mailed statement .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
