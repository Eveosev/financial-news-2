The  Philippines  said it expects 5
billion pesos in taxes from the so-called PEACe bonds, which
will mature on Oct. 18.  The Bureau of Internal Revenue confirmed that a 20 percent
final withholding tax is applicable to the “Poverty Eradication
and Alleviation Certificates” issued by the Bureau of the
Treasury in 2001, the tax agency said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, Bureau of Internal
Revenue Commissioner  Kim Henares  and Treasurer Roberto Tan met
with government securities dealers to discuss the issue today.  -- With assistance from Clarissa Batino.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
