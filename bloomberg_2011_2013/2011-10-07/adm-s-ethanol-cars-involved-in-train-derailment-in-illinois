Tanker cars involved in a train
derailment and fire today in north-central  Illinois  were
carrying ethanol for Archer Daniels Midland Co., D.H. Miller,
chief executive officer of  Iowa  Interstate Railroad Ltd., said.  “Six or seven” cars of ethanol were coming from a plant
in  Cedar Rapids , Iowa, Miller said in a telephone interview.  The  National Transportation Safety Board  sent a team to
investigate the derailment, it said in a  statement .  Residents of Tiskilwa, Illinois, were evacuated as a
precaution and were returning to their homes, Miller said.  The railroad will route some trains around the accident
site and will aim to resume regular operations by Sunday, he
said.  “There shouldn’t be any disruption,” Miller said. “It’s
an inconvenience for a day or so until we get things cleaned
up.”  ADM, based in Decatur, Illinois, is seeking information
about the incident, Jessie McKinney, a company spokeswoman,
said.  ADM declined 46 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $25.45 by 12:41
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
