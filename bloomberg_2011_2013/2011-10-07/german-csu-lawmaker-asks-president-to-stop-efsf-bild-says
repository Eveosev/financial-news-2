Peter Gauweiler, a federal lawmaker
from the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Christian Democrats, has urged German President  Christian Wulff 
to veto enhancements to the euro rescue fund that were passed in
parliament last week,  Bild  newspaper reported.  The law to strengthen the European Financial Stability
Facility is violating the German constitution, Gauweiler wrote
in a letter to Wulff, Bild said.  Gauweiler was one of 13 coalition lawmakers to vote against
the EFSF bill in parliament and was a plaintiff in a suit thrown
out by  Germany ’s top court last month that argued against German
participation in European bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
