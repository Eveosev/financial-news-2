Three of  Banco Pastor SA (PAS) ’s biggest
shareholders accepted a 1.35 billion-euro ($1.8 billion) bid
from  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , which announced more provisions
as real-estate losses continue to pummel Spain’s banks.  Investors accounting for 52.3 percent of Pastor stock
approved the bid, including apparel billionaire Amancio Ortega
and Fundacion Barrie, a charitable foundation with 42 percent of
the stock. At least 75 percent of shareholders must accept for
the deal to proceed, Popular said. Chairman Angel Ron said
Popular would take a 1.5 billion-euro provision for future
losses,valued at 1.1 billion euros after tax.  Pastor, a La Coruna, Spain-based lender with 31 billion
euros in assets that traces its roots to 1776, was among five
Spanish banks that failed stress tests in July after regulators
found it didn’t have enough capital to withstand a recession.
Spanish banks are merging to cut costs after taking 105 billion
euros of provisions since 2008 to cover impairments that soared
after the collapse of the nation’s debt-fueled property boom.  “This is a response to a crisis that is like a monster
that changes each week,” Ron told reporters in  Madrid , when
asked about the new provision. “It’s a question of trying to
take advantage of the opportunity the crisis gives us to create
a better bank and prepare.”  Popular, which has 2,222 branches and 130 billion euros in
assets, offered 1.115 new shares for each Pastor share and 30.9
new shares for each of its bonds mandatorily convertible into
stock. At today’s stock price of 3.51 euros, Popular’s offer is
valued at 3.91 euros per Pastor share. The deal represented a 31
percent premium over Pastor’s price at the levels the banks
traded at before they were suspended on Oct. 7.  Popular’s offer for Pastor is 0.75 times book value and the
deal will create a 15 percent return on investment by the third
year, Ron said. The bank is still studying how many jobs will be
lost with the merger and any cuts will be carried out via
“natural means” and early retirements, he said.  Keeping Payout  Ron also said Popular would issue 700 million euros of
bonds mandatorily convertible into shares. The deal is expected
to be completed early next year.  Shares in Banco Pastor surged as much as 29.9 percent to
3.95 euros, easing to 3.68 euros at 3:39 p.m. in Madrid.
Popular, the second-best-performing Spanish bank stock this
year, fell 1.7 percent to 3.51 euros.  The deal will add to Popular’s earnings per share from
“day one,” and the lender will maintain its payout to
shareholders, Ron said. The transaction wasn’t directed by the
Bank of  Spain , he said in response to questions from analysts.
Fundacion Barrie will own about 7 percent of the combined
lender.  Pastor’s profit fell 38 percent in the first half of the
year from the same period a year ago. The bank reported a ratio
of defaults to total loans of 5.73 percent in June compared with
0.82 percent at the end of 2007. The bad-loan ratio at Popular
was 5.58 percent in June.  The combination of the two commercial banks follows a dozen
deals among savings banks that have cut their number to about 18
from 45. Banco Sabadell SA, another commercial lender, acquired
Banco Guipuzcoano SA last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
