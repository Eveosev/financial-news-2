The European Union must be “fair”
in the future and states must pay their own debts,  Finland ’s
Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said in a statement sent by
her  Social Democratic Party  by e-mail today.  The euro area needs “disciplined” economic policy and
breaking rules must be punished, she said. The union must also
be able to create jobs and add productivity, she said according
to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
