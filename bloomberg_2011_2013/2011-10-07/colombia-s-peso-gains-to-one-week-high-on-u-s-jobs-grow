Colombia’s peso climbed to a one-week
high after larger-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs tempered
concern about an economic slowdown in the world’s biggest
economy.  The peso rose for a third day, advancing 0.6 percent to
1,934.80 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,946.80 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,921.48, its strongest level since Sept. 30. The
currency fell 0.2 percent this week and has dropped 7.5 percent
in the past month.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 in September after a
revised 57,000 increase the prior month, Labor Department data
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast among analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a rise of 60,000. The jobless rate
held at 9.1 percent.  “Better numbers are coming out of the U.S., reducing
speculation of a recession,” said Daniel Escobar, an analyst at
brokerage Global Securities in Bogota.  The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying
about 40 percent of its exports.  The yield on  Colombia ’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
7.58 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.463 centavo to 119.323
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
