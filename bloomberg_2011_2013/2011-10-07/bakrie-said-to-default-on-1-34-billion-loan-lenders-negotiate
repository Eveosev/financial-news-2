PT Bakrie & Brothers defaulted on a
$1.34 billion dollar bridge loan last week as the value of
collateral fell and share prices dropped, said a person familiar
with the matter.  Bakrie & Brothers, which signed the one-year loan this year
with Credit Suisse Group AG and a group of as many as 12
investors, breached two conditions of the loan in the past few
weeks, putting the facility into default, said the person who
asked not to be identified because the matter is private.  The loan’s so-called collateral-cover trigger was activated
on Sept. 28 after a decline in value of Bakrie & Brothers’s 47
percent stake in Bumi Plc, the person said. The share-price
trigger was also tripped around the same time, he said.  The lenders are currently in negotiations with the borrower
about options that include a combination of refinancing, asset
sale and extensions on the loan, the person said.  All investors on the loan are relationship lenders to
Bakrie & Brothers and have financed the company for more than 10
years, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
