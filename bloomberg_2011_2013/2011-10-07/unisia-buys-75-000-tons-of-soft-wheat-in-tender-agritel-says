Tunisia bought 75,000 metric tons of
soft wheat for between $263.50 and $265 a ton on a cost-and-
freight basis as part of a tender for 92,000 tons of the grain,
French farm adviser Agritel said.  The country also got offers for feed barley at $285.38 a
ton on a cost-and-freight basis, Paris-based Agritel said in a
daily comment on its website today. The higher asking price for
barley compared to wheat “is a good illustration of the tension
in the market,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
