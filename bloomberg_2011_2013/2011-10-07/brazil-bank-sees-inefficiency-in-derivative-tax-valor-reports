Brazil ’s central bank sees little
efficiency in a tax imposed by the government on some currency
derivatives to curb the real’s appreciation,  Valor Economico 
reported, citing people it didn’t identify who met with the
bank’s Director of Monetary Policy Aldo Mendes.  Mendes also told eight executives of a brokerage he met in
Sao Paulo yesterday that the central bank was slow to cut
 interest rates  during the 2008 crisis, something that is not
happening now, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.   The central bank sees a slowdown in all segments of the
economy except the labor market, which it expects to cool soon,
Mendes said, according to Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
