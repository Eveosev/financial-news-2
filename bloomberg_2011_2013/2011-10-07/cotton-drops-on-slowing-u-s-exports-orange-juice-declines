Cotton futures fell after a report
showing slower U.S. exports raised concern that a three-day
rally may have pushed prices higher than justified by current
demand.  Orange juice  also declined.  Net cotton exports fell to 88,600 bales in the week ended
Sept. 29, 60 percent lower than the figure a week earlier that
helped spark the rally, according to Department of Agriculture
data. The U.S. is the world’s largest shipper.  “The export numbers were a little disappointing,”  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta Brokerage in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “People are seeing that demand may not be
picking up as much as they thought it was, and demand is key
right now.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to $1.0198 a
pound at 2:31 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber
rose 3.5 percent in the previous three days and 1.8 percent for
the week.  A bale weighs 480 pounds (218 kilograms).  “There seems to be a point at which demand perks up, but
when prices got high enough a lot of the fundamental buying runs
away,” Louis Barbera, a broker at VIP Commodities in  New York ,
said in a telephone interview.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 0.1 percent
to $1.547 a pound in New York, snapping a four-day rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
