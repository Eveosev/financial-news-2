BAA Airports Ltd. , the owner of
 London ’s Heathrow Airport, will disclose “shortly” whether it
plans to sell Edinburgh or Glasgow airport.  BAA, which is owned by a group of investors including
Spain’s  Ferrovial SA (FER) , won the agreement of the  Competition
Commission  to bring forward the sale of one of its three
Scottish airports while it challenges a ruling to sell Stansted,
northeast of London, the company said in a statement today.  “Both Edinburgh and Glasgow are great airports with great
futures,” Chief Executive Officer Colin Matthews said in the
statement. “We will be sorry to see one of them leave BAA.”  The airport operator is seeking a judicial review of the
regulator’s 2009 decision to force the sale of Stansted, one of
London’s three airports. The regulator reaffirmed in July that
it should sell Stansted to boost competition among airport
operators. It’s already sold  London Gatwick .  The commission said in 2009 and again in July that BAA had
to sell Stansted before disposing of either Edinburgh or Glasgow
airport. BAA is being allowed to keep Aberdeen airport, in north
east Scotland.  Edinburgh, the busiest of Scotland’s airports, handles 9
million passengers a year, according to its website. Glasgow had
6.5 million passengers in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
