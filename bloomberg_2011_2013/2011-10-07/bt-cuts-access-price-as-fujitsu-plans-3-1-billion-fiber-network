BT Group Plc (BT/A)  published
“significantly lower” prices for access to its telegraph poles
and underground ducts after  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  warned it required
fairer terms to tap the U.K. network to extend fiber broadband.  BT issued revised charges after talks with U.K. regulator
Ofcom, as Fujitsu said it planned to build out a high-speed
network to 5 million homes for as much as 2 billion pounds
($3.1 billion).  “Other companies now have the certainty and low prices
they need to build a business case,” Liv Garfield, chief
executive officer of BT’s Openreach unit, said today in a
statement. “It’s time for others to help us with the heavy
lifting.”  Fujitsu, Japan’s biggest computer-services provider, said
in April that its proposals relied upon BT providing
“reasonable” terms.  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , which plans to lease
part of the network, had warned that the old prices may harm
government plans for broadband rollout to rural areas.  Fujitsu is competing with Virgin and  TalkTalk Telecom Group
Plc (TALK)  to obtain the majority of the 830 million pounds in
government funding to extend the high-speed network. The total
plans may cost Fujitsu 1.5 billion pounds to 2 billion pounds
over three to five years, the company said in April.  Fujitsu will consider the new pricing, Graham Goulden, a
spokesman for the company, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
