The European Union said it plan to
create a support structure for  Portugal  to better use community
funds.  “The European Commission, at the request of the  Portuguese
government , has decided to create a support structure with the
aim of better using and targeting Community funds in support of
the Economic and Financial Assistance program being implemented
in Portugal,” the EU said today in an e-mailed statement.
“This support structure will consist of a small team of experts
which will provide technical assistance to the Portuguese
authorities in reprogramming and reprioritizing Community funds
in a way which mutually reinforces the objectives of the program
agreed with troika as well as the growth perspectives of
Portugal.”  The EU said the initiative is part of the overall
commission support to the countries under assistance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
