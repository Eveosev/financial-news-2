Whirlpool Corp., the world’s largest
appliance maker, said it won a six-month stay of litigation in a
refrigerator-technology patent infringement lawsuit brought in
Trenton,  New Jersey  by Korean rival  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)   The postponement was related “to progress in separate
proceedings challenging the validity of LG’s patents” in the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Whirlpool, based in Benton
Harbor,  Michigan , said today in a statement.  “We expect LG’s patents to be found invalid under the re-
examination proceedings,” said Marc Bitzer, president of
Whirlpool’s North America Region.  In another case, Whirlpool and Seoul-based LG halted
proceedings in mid-trial last week in U.S. District Court in
Wilmington,  Delaware .  “The court’s ruling will be entered and made public in the
near future, resolving the issues that were pending in this
retrial” over a patent for refrigerator icemakers, Kristine
Vernier, a Whirlpool spokesperson, said in an Oct. 3 e-mailed
statement. LG officials didn’t return messages seeking comment.  In the Delaware case, Whirlpool lawyers asked a jury to
award $16.2 million in patent damages.  Whirlpool fell $2.20 or 4 percent to $53.04 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 1:49 p.m. LG shares rose
100 won to 74,000 in Korea.  The Delaware case is LG Electronics v.  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) ,
1:08-cv-00234, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,082,130.  To contact the reporter on this story:
