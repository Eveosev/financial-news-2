Brazil  is stepping up efforts to
fight  insider trading  related to earnings releases after
identifying suspicious patterns, chief securities regulator
Maria Helena Santana said.  “We’re starting a new line of investigation that focuses
on earnings releases,” said Santana, president of the Brazilian
securities commission, or CVM, in an interview today at
Bloomberg’s office in Sao Paulo. “Depending on what we get,
there could be sanctions.”  The securities regulator is developing a new system to
monitor markets and detect trading patterns on the days prior to
earnings releases, Santana said.  The use of non-public information to trade securities is a
crime in Brazil and penalties range from one to five years in
prison and a fine of as many as three times the illegal profit.  The probe is “positive for the market”, said Jorge Simino, who helps manage 18.5 billion reais ($10.5 billion) as
investment director at pension fund Fundacao Cesp, in  Sao Paulo .
“If anything like that happened, the best thing is to
investigate and punish, because it purifies the market.”  Santana declined to comment on the number or names of the
companies and investors being investigated by CVM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
