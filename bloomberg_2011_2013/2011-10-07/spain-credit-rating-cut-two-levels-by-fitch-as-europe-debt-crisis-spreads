Spain had its  credit rating  cut two
levels by  Fitch Ratings , which cited the “intensification” of
the euro crisis, slower Spanish growth and regional finances as
risks to the nation’s debt outlook.  Fitch cut its rating to AA- from AA+, the company said in a
statement today from London. The outlook is negative. Fitch
cited similar reasons for also downgrading Italy one level to
A+, while maintaining Portugal at BBB-, saying it would complete
a review of that ranking in the fourth quarter.  Spain’s rating, which was AAA until 2010, has now been
lowered twice by Fitch as the deepest austerity measures in
three decades fail to convince investors the nation can stem the
surge in its debt burden. Moody’s Investors Service also warned
on Oct. 4 “all but the strongest euro-area sovereigns” are
likely to see further downgrades, as it cut  Italy ’s rating for
the first time in almost two decades.  Fitch said it expects Spanish growth to remain below 2
percent a year through 2015. Still, the nation’s debt burden
will peak at 72 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, below
the forecast for the euro area on average, the company said.  Spain is paying yields of around 5 percent on its 10-year
bonds even after the  European Central Bank  stepped in to prop up
its  bond market  on Aug. 8. The gap between Spanish and German
10-year borrowing costs was 299 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
