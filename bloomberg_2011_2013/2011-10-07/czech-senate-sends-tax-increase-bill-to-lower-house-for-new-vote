The Czech Senate rejected a
government bill that would increase the lower value-added tax
bracket to help finance an overhaul of the public pension
system.  Premier Petr Necasâ€™ ruling coalition has a sufficient
majority in the lower house of parliament to override Senate
vetoes. The upper house, dominated by the opposition Social
Democrats, voted on the VAT bill today in  Prague , it said on its
website.  The bill would lift the lower VAT rate on goods and
services including food, drugs and public transport to 14
percent next year from 10 percent, while the upper bracket would
stay at 20 percent. Both rates will be unified at 17.5 percent
in 2013, according to the legislation.  The government will use the extra VAT proceeds to cover a
deficit in public finances after workers start diverting part of
their social-security taxes to privately run retirement funds in
2013.
