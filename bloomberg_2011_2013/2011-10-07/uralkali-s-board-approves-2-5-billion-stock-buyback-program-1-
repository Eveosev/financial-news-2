OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s biggest
potash producer, will buy back as much as $2.5 billion of its
shares and global depositary receipts after its share price
plunged in September from a three-year high.  The fertilizer maker’s Enterpro Service Ltd. unit will
carry out the program, which runs for one year until Oct. 6,
2012, Berezniki, Russia-based Uralkali said today in a statement
after a board meeting yesterday.  Uralkali agreed to borrow as much as 66 billion rubles ($2
billion) from OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, which will
be exchanged into dollars and provided to Enterpro to purchase
stock, according to the statement.  The shares jumped 6.9 percent to 240.47 rubles at 12:03
p.m., extending yesterday’s 11 percent gain. The price had
fallen 33 percent in two weeks from a high of 296.11 rubles on
Sept. 20. The 30-stock Micex index lost 17 percent in that
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
