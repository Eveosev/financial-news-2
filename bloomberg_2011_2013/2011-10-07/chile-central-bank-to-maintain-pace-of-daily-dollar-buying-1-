Chile ’s central bank will keep buying
$50 million a day over the next month as part of a $12 billion
program to raise reserves and limit the peso’s gain.  The bank announced the continuation of its foreign exchange
intervention as well as a $936 million bond-sale calendar for
the month through Nov. 8 on its website today. The central bank
will also sell $463 million of bonds on behalf of the
government.  The central bank will sell $257 million of bonds in pesos
and $680 million of inflation-linked debt while the government
will sell $145 million of bonds in pesos and $319 million of
inflation debt, it wrote. The bank left the amount of bonds and
their maturities unchanged from the previous month.  The bank has bought $9.7 billion of U.S. currency since it
started the program in January. The peso has depreciated 11
percent against the  U.S. dollar  in the last month, leaving the
bank with a $799 million profit, according to Bloomberg
calculations that exclude the cost of financing the operation
and gains and losses from investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
