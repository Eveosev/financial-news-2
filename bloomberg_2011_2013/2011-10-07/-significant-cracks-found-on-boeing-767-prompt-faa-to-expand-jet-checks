United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
 Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ,  American Airlines  and other U.S. carriers
may need to inspect their  Boeing Co. (BA)  767s twice as often after
one operator found “significant crack sizes” had developed
sooner than expected.  Airlines should inspect the twin-engine jets after 2,000
flight cycles or 6,000 flight hours, double the current
requirement, the  Federal Aviation Administration   said in a
proposal  to be published in the Federal Register next week. The
rule may affect 417 planes in the U.S., the agency estimated.  The FAA is proposing heightened scrutiny of the wing skin
after cracks as large as a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) were
found on either side of a fastener hole on a plane that had
18,900 flight cycles and 89,500 total flight hours. The 767 is a
wide-body plane typically used on international flights.  “We support the rule proposed by FAA,” Julie O’Donnell, a
spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, wrote in an e-mailed
message. The change “essentially would mandate the
recommendations that Boeing first made to operators in a service
bulletin in 2009 and revised in March 2011.”  Delta is one of the biggest operators of 767s, with 92 of
the jets, some of which are an average of 19.7 years old,
according to the Atlanta-based carrier’s most recent annual
report.  Fort Worth , Texas-based American has 73 of the planes,
some of them 24 years old; Chicago-based United has 61 of the
planes, some 18.3 years old.  Delta, United Continental  Delta wasn’t the unnamed airline whose 767 had the cracks,
spokeswoman Ashley Black wrote in an e-mail. The company is in
compliance with current FAA inspection requirements and will
follow any changes that the agency makes, she said.  United Continental also complies with FAA directives and
will continue to do so, said  Megan McCarthy , a spokeswoman for
the carrier.  “We’re watching it closely,” she said.  Spokesmen for the other carriers didn’t immediately comment
on the proposed regulation.  Earlier this year, Boeing called for more inspections on
older 737 narrow-body jets after a  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  plane
split open midflight, prompting an emergency landing. Two people
were injured.  Metal fatigue cracks on the so-called 737 Classic weren’t
forecast to occur until “much later,” after 60,000 cycles of
takeoffs and landings, Boeing said in April. The Southwest jet
that ripped open on an April 1 flight had flown 39,781 cycles.  Investigators said the Southwest plane’s fissure was caused
by weakened fasteners in joints along the crown of the jet, and
Dallas-based Southwest later found cracks on five more 737s.
Boeing developed repair plans for the aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
