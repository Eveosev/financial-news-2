Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP,
the hedge-fund company run by  Alan Howard , said it will return
capital to some investors in its biggest hedge fund after assets
rose to about $27 billion.  Shareholders in BH Macro Ltd. and BH Global Ltd., which are
publicly traded companies that feed capital into the Brevan
Howard Master Fund, won’t be affected by the decision, the
Guernsey-based companies said in a statement today. Money will
be given back to “certain” Brevan Howard investors, the
statement said.  Investors in the master fund have said they want assets to
remain at about $25 billion to ensure its performance, prompting
the London-based hedge fund to consider returning about $2
billion to clients, Brevan Howard Chief Executive Officer Nagi Kawkabani said in a Sept. 20 interview. Assets increased after
the hedge fund posted investment gains of more than 12 percent
this year through September.  Brevan Howard may pick and choose which clients get their
money back, or it could return money to investors on a pro rata
basis. The statement released today indicates that not all
clients will get money back.  Hedge funds  often restrict the size of their funds to make
sure they can continue to find profitable investments. SAC
Capital Management LLC, Caxton Associates LP and JAT Capital
Management LP have all told clients in recent months that they
want to limit size because they see fewer opportunities to make
money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
