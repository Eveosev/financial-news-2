A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk snapped a three-day decline on concerns that the
economy was losing momentum ahead of data projected to show that
U.S. payroll gains were too small to reduce the  unemployment
rate .  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.1 basis points to a
mid-price of 141 basis points as of 8:07 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, has declined from 150.1
basis points on Oct. 3 on optimism that European policy makers
may prevent the sovereign debt crisis from engulfing bank
balance sheets.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
