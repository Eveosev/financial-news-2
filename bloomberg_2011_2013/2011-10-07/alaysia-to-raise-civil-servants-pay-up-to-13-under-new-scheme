Malaysia will increase the pay of
civil servants by as much as 13 percent as the government
overhauls the civil-service system, Prime Minister Najib Razak
said in his budget speech in parliament in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  The 1.3 million federal government workers will get a 2
percent annual pay rise beginning 2013, Najib said. They will
also get an extra half-month salary in December, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
