U.S. property and casualty insurance
providers reported their worst six months of losses tied to
catastrophes since the first half of 2001 as claims costs
climbed to $23.9 billion.  The combined ratio of losses and expenses per premium
dollar deteriorated to 110.5 percent, the lowest since 111.1
percent in the first half of 2001, ISO, a unit of Verisk
Analytics Inc., said today in a  statement . Second-quarter U.S.
disasters caused $19.6 billion in insured losses, an increase of
almost sixfold from $3.3 billion a year earlier, ISO said.  “These losses for us were larger than those we incurred
from  Hurricane Katrina  in 2005 and the equivalent of losses we
would expect from a 1-in-100 year hurricane,” Travelers Cos.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman said in an
earnings statement July 21. Travelers, based in  New York , is the
lone insurer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Travelers,  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. are among firms that took losses on a U.S. tornado
season that killed more than 150 people in Joplin,  Missouri , and
leveled parts of Tuscaloosa,  Alabama . The net loss for the
industry was $3.1 billion in the second quarter after net income
of $7.8 billion a year earlier, ISO said.  The cost from disasters was $8 billion in the first half of
last year.  Sales Rising  Sales rose as carriers including Chubb Corp., Travelers and
Allstate raised rates. First-half policy sales advanced 2.6
percent to $218.8 billion from $213.3 billion a year earlier,
ISO said.  Consulting firm Towers Watson & Co. said commercial
insurance rates rose 1.5 percent in the second quarter in a
separate survey released Sept. 13. It was the first time rates
had increased for all standard lines of coverage since the
fourth quarter of 2003, New York-based Towers Watson said.  About 70 percent of Chubb’s commercial business renewed in
the U.S. in the second quarter was at the same or a higher rate,
Paul J. Krump, president of commercial and specialty lines for
the Warren, New Jersey-based carrier, said on a July 21
conference call.  Personal insurers are also raising rates as they deal with
increased losses.  Allstate Chairman and CEO  Thomas Wilson  said the
Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer plans to raise rates for
homeowners’ coverage after storms caused $2.34 billion of
catastrophe costs in the second quarter, according to an Aug. 1
statement. Allstate had received approval for increases in 18
states when the statement was issued.  Net investment gains for U.S. insurers rose to $28.4
billion in the first half from $26 billion a year earlier, ISO
said in its report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
