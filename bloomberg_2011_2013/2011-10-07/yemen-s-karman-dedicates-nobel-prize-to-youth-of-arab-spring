Tawakkul Karman, a Yemeni activist
who is one of three winners of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize,
said she dedicated the award to the youth of the Arab Spring.
She commented by phone today from Sana’a, Yemen’s capital.  Yemenis are seeking the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, inspired by revolts across the Arab world that included
the toppling of the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt .  “This is an honor for me, and I dedicate this to all the
people who have sacrificed their lives to the freedom of the
country. I dedicate this esteemed prize to all the youth of the
Arab Spring.”  “This is very important in my life, and this will help
push young people to continue working for peace, democracy and
freedom. This recognizes the role of youth in these countries.”  “We will continue our struggle until we end the Saleh
family rule that has destroyed our country for decades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
