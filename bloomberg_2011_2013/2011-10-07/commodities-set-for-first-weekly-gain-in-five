Commodities climbed, set for the
first weekly advance in five, after European policy makers
stepped up measures to contain the region’s debt crisis,
boosting prospects for demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
gained as much as 0.5 percent, and was at 609.24 at 12:25 p.m.
in  Singapore . That would be a weekly increase of 3.1 percent,
the biggest since the week to July 8. New York-traded crude
climbed as much as 0.6 percent to $83.08, and copper rose as
much as 2.1 percent to $7,375 per metric ton in London.  The  European Central Bank  will resume covered-bond
purchases and reintroduce yearlong loans for banks to support
markets and the Bank of England boosted its asset-purchase
program. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet Oct. 9 over Greece’s debt problems as
the nation edges closer to default.  “While the big unknowns remain in financial markets,
prices are unlikely to rebound strongly,” Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. analysts led by  Mark Pervan  said in a
report today. “Encouragingly, demand fundamentals don’t appear
to have deteriorated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
