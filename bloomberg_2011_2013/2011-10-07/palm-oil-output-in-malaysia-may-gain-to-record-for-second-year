Palm oil  output in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer, may climb for a second year to a record
in 2012 on rising yields and “speedy” replanting of aging
trees, according to the nation’s finance ministry.  Production may gain 2.2 percent to 18.7 million metric tons
next year, from an estimated 18.3 million tons this year, the
ministry said in its Economic Report for 2011-2012 today.  Rising supplies may pressure prices, which have fallen 26
percent this year, and help cap global food costs that jumped 16
percent in the past year, according to the  United Nations . The
tropical oil used in everything from cookies and potato chips
has slumped this year on bigger harvests and concern that a
global slowdown may curb demand.  Malaysia ’s palm oil exports may reach 70 billion ringgit
($22.1 billion) this year, Plantation Industries and Commodities
Minister Bernard Dompok said yesterday.  Palm oil on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange may average
3,200 ringgit a ton this year, the report said. That compares
with an average of about 3,310 ringgit so far this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  Rubber production may advance 4 percent to 1.04 million
tons next year as steady prices spur growers to expand planting,
the ministry said. Output will rise 6.5 percent to 1 million
tons this year as small-holders are expected to increase tapping
of trees to benefit from higher prices, it said.  The planted area probably increased 2.7 percent to 1.05
million hectares (2.59 million acres) in 2011, with new
plantations in Sabah and Sarawak, the report said. Malaysia is
the world’s third-largest rubber producer.  Rubber futures in  Tokyo , down 24 percent this year, more
than tripled in the previous two years as rising global vehicle
sales boosted tire demand. Global demand may expand at a faster
pace, led by strong vehicle sales in  China , which will help
sustain rubber prices, the finance ministry report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
