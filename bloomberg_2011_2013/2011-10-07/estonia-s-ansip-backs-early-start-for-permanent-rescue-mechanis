Estonian Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip 
said the government supports implementing Europe’s permanent
crisis management facility a year earlier than planned.  Estonia backs launching the European Stability Mechanism in
July 2012 as it is more effective and ensures better legal
certainty than the temporary European Financial Stability
Facility, Ansip said today in Paris after meeting his French
counterpart  Francois Fillon , according to an e-mailed statement
from his press office.  The Baltic nation also supports an early start for the ESM
as its contribution would be 0.186 percent of the total,
compared with 0.26 percent under the EFSF and the contribution
doesn’t count as part of the nation’s public debt, Ansip said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
