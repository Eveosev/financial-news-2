Oil rose to its highest in more than
a week in  New York , reversing losses as higher-than-expected
jobs growth in the U.S. bolstered confidence that fuel demand
will be supported in the world’s largest crude consumer.  Oil headed for its first weekly gain in three weeks after
the Labor Department reported that employers added 103,000 jobs
last month, exceeding an estimate of 60,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet yesterday announced a bond-purchase program to
tackle the region’s debt crisis.  “The good numbers we saw today are a step in the right
direction,” said  Robert Montefusco , senior broker at Sucden
Financial in London. “The market was not comfortable with Brent
below $100. That’s not to say we’re out of the woods yet.  Europe 
needs to get its act together."  Oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose as much as $1.41, or 1.7 percent, to $84 a barrel,
the highest price since Sept. 28, and was at $83.57 at 1:48 p.m.
London time. Brent crude for November settlement gained 0.5
percent to $106.27 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
