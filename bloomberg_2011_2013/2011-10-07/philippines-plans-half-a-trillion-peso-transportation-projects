The  Philippines  will offer “half a
trillion” pesos of infrastructure projects in the next five
years to improve transportation and boost the economy,
Transportation and Communications Secretary Mar Roxas said in
Manila today.  The government will seek “low-cost” funding for these
projects and may seek loans from multilateral agencies or
auction the projects to private companies, Roxas said in a
forum. The state may also finance some, he said.  The projects include a high-speed train from Manila to
Clark, provincial airports as well as extension rail projects in
the capital, Roxas said.  The government in September last year said it will invite
bids for infrastructure projects worth more than 700 billion
pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
