Petroleos Mexicanos Chief Executive
Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said Mexico’s state oil company
didn’t expect a hostile reaction from the management of  Repsol
YPF SA (REP)  after it formed an alliance with fellow shareholder  Sacyr
Vallehermoso SA. (SYV)    Pemex, as the Mexico City-based company is known, won’t
support higher dividend payments from Repsol if they adversely
affect investment in productive projects, Suarez Coppel said in
an interview today in Mexico City.   To contact the reporter on this story:
