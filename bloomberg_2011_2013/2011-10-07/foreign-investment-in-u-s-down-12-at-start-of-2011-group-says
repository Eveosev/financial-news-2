The U.S. must come up with policies
to reverse a decline in investment in the country by overseas
companies, according to the Organization for International
Investment.  Foreign direct investment fell 12 percent in the first six
months of 2011 compared with the same period last year, the
Washington-based group said in a  report  released today. The U.S.
received 18 percent of the world’s foreign direct investment in
2009, down from 41 percent in 1999, according to the report.  The declines indicate the  U.S. economy  has become less
attractive to global companies, the report said. A lack of new
policies to boost inflows into the U.S. will lead to fewer jobs
and a “continued erosion of America’s competitiveness,” it
said.  “This is a non-partisan issue both sides of the aisle can
work on together,” James Guyette, president and chief executive
officer of Rolls-Royce North America Inc., said in a statement.
“A national effort to attract foreign investment will help us
compete with the rest of the world to grow jobs right here.”  Rolls-Royce is among the companies represented by the
organization, which also include BNP Paribas SA, Research in
Motion Ltd. and the  Tata Group . The report doesn’t suggest
specific policies for improving foreign direct investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
