Telecom Corp. of New Zealand , the
nation’s largest telephone company, said first-half profit rose
52 percent as depreciation and other costs fell after separating
its Chorus network unit.  Adjusted after-tax earnings rose to NZ$240 million ($200
million) in the six months ended Dec. 31 from NZ$158 million a
year earlier, the Auckland-based company said in a statement.
Sales fell and operating profit from continued operations was
unchanged.  “Costs have declined faster than revenues,” Chief
Executive Officer  Paul Reynolds  said in the statement. “The
ongoing operational improvement in Telecom’s continuing business
is clear.”  Chorus was separatly listed in November after Telecom
decided to restructure so it was eligible to partner the
government in its ultrafast broadband program. The company plans
a NZ$300 million share buyback to return excess capital to
shareholders after the demerger, it said today.  The company included a NZ$28 million currency gain and
earthquake insurance payments. Depreciation fell NZ$93 million.  Telecom expects second-half adjusted earnings will be
NZ$160 million to NZ$190 million.  First-half sales fell 8.5 percent to NZ$2.32 billion amid
increased competition, lower prices and the inclusion of a unit
of  Australia ’s AAPT that has since been sold.  First-half operating profit, or earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, for continuing operations
rose 0.2 percent to NZ$488 million.  Second-half operating profit is expected to be about NZ$560
million, Telecom said today  To contact the reporter on this story:
