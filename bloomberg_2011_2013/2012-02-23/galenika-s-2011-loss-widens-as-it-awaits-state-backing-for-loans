Galenika AD, Serbia’s state-run
drugmaker, says its 2011 loss probably widened to 20 million
euros ($26.6 million) as a lack of cash hurt operations and
sales dwindled while the company awaited a bailout.  The expected loss for last year would compare with a loss
of 14 million euros in 2010. Revenue fell to about 50 million
euros from 90 million euros a year earlier, acting General
Manager Zivomir Novakovic said in an interview in Belgrade
today. Official results are due in the second quarter.  The  company , the second-biggest pharmaceutical maker in the
Balkan country, is looking to Parliament for approval of a state
guarantee for a 70 million-euro loan from four banks. The seven-
year loan, with a two-year grace period, was negotiated with the
local units of  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  AIK Banka AD (AIKB) ,  “Banks are getting nervous, details have been agreed, we
just need the green light from Parliament” or face a bigger
halt in production, Novakovic said. Talks on the bailout package
began in June last year.  Bank Support  Erste would provide 30 million euros, Societe General and
UniCredit would each provide 10 million euros and AIK would
participate with 20 million euros.  Galenika needs the loan to service 63 million euros of
short-term debt to 18 banks, including units of Societe
Generale,  Raiffeisen Bank (RBI)  and to AIK Banka, and to pay almost 26
million euros owed to suppliers, Novakovic said. At the same
time, the company claims some 90 million euros from wholesalers
and the state-run  health insurance fund  for drugs delivered,
after collecting 20 million euros from them since mid-2011.  The loan agreement includes a reduction of Galenika’s
workforce to 1,500 by 2018 from 2,300 now, and direct sales to
pharmacies and hospitals, eliminating wholesalers, he said,
speaking to reporters at a separate news conference.  The efforts should help Galenika return to profit next
year, with earnings seen at 6.2 million euros in 2013, while
also improving market share, currently at just over 20 percent
of the $1.2 billion Serbian market for medicines, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
