Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 2 percent to 59,666.62 at the close in Istanbul, its
biggest loss in almost seven weeks, after Morgan Stanley said
Turkish equities are “ripe for reversal.”  The following stocks were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  , an Islamic bank,
declined 4.2 percent to 1.83 liras, its biggest loss this year,
after reporting a 27 percent plunge in fourth-quarter profit,
missing estimates.  TAV Havalimanlari AS (TAVHL)  , Turkey’s biggest airport
operator, gained 1.6 percent to 8.80 liras.  Aeroports de Paris ,
the owner of Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, is competing
with French builder  Vinci SA (DG)  for a stake in the company, two
people with direct knowledge of the sales process said.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  , Turkey’s
largest mobile-phone company, slipped 3.1 percent to 9.40 liras,
its biggest retreat since November. The company hasn’t decided
on a management proposal to convene a new extraordinary
 shareholders’ meeting  relating to its delayed 2010 dividend
payout, Chief Executive Officer Sureyya Ciliv said.  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK)  , the bank part-owned by
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , plunged 5.7 percent to 3.30 liras, its biggest
decline since Dec. 8. The company reported fourth-quarter profit
of 474.6 million liras ($269 million), lagging estimates, and
said it has agreed to pay 8.3 percent above the benchmark three-
month London interbank offered rate on its $585 million
securitized loan from UniCredit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
