Consumer confidence  in the U.S.
increased last week to the highest level since April 2008 as
more Americans had a favorable view of their finances.  The Bloomberg  Consumer Comfort (COMFCOMF)  Index rose to minus 38.4 in
the period ended Feb. 19, its fifth consecutive gain, from minus
39.8 the previous week. It marked the second straight week above
minus 40, which is the level associated with recessions and
their aftermath. Men, homeowners and households with annual
incomes of more than $50,000 were the most optimistic in more
than a year.  A majority rated their personal finances as positive for
the first time since July, indicating a rising stock market and
job growth may encourage consumers to keep spending. At the same
time, higher gasoline costs threaten to unravel the recent gains
in sentiment, as occurred a year ago.  “An improving labor market and rising equity prices have
bolstered sentiment of survey participants, especially those in
the upper-middle and wealthy classes,” said Joe Brusuelas, a
senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York . Still, the
“improvement will be put to the test in coming weeks due to the
spike in gasoline prices.”  The  price  of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline climbed
to $3.57 as of Feb. 19 from a 10-month low of $3.21 in December,
according to AAA, the nation’s largest automobile association. A
year ago, gasoline costs rose through the middle of May,
climbing to $3.99 a gallon, from $3.10 at the end of January. At
the same time, confidence waned.  Gasoline Prices  “Rising gas prices killed a short-lived advance in the CCI
last winter,”  Gary Langer , president of Langer Research
Associates LLC in New York, which compiles the index for
Bloomberg, said in a statement. “The question now is whether
other factors are strong enough to counteract the usual negative
impact of rising gas prices on consumer sentiment.”  Higher share prices may be lifting sentiment. The  Dow Jones (INDU) 
Industrial Average climbed above the 13,000 level this week for
the first time in almost four years. It has gained about 21
percent since a recent low on Oct. 3 last year. The Dow was up
0.4 percent to 12,993.01 at 11:20 a.m. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index was up 0.3 percent to 1361.60.  The comfort index has a “strong long-term correlation” of
0.81 with the Dow, said Langer. A correlation of 1 means
components move precisely in tandem, while a reading of minus 1
means they move in the opposite direction all the time.  Four-Year Low  Jobless claims held at a four-year low last week, a report
today showed. First-time filings for  unemployment benefits  held
at 351,000 in the week ended Feb. 18, the lowest since March
2008, the Labor Department said in Washington. Unemployment in
January fell to 8.3 percent, the lowest since February 2009, the
Labor Department said Feb. 3.  The comfort index has a minus 0.63 correlation with
jobless claims and a minus 0.79 correlation with unemployment,
according to Langer. The index has a 0.67 correlation with
housing starts, which were up in January from the prior month as
well as from a year earlier.  Two components of the weekly consumer comfort index
improved, while the third declined. An index of the  buying
climate  increased to minus 42.7, the highest since January 2011,
from minus 47.4. The gauge of personal finances was little
changed at 1, the highest since July, after a reading of 0.2,
with 51 percent rating their finances as positive. The measure
of Americans’ views on the state of the economy fell to minus
73.3 from minus 72.1 the prior week.  Highest Level  The comfort index reached its highest level in almost a
year among Republicans, at minus 34.7. Among political
independents, considered a key group in presidential elections,
the gauge is 10.7 points higher than when President  Barack Obama 
took office in January 2009.  The index rose to almost four-year highs among blacks and
55- to 64-year olds, the bulk of the baby boom population.  The weekly Bloomberg comfort index, which began December
1985, has averaged minus 43.3 this year following last year’s
minus 46.8 average. That compared with minus 45.7 for 2010 and
minus 47.9 in 2009, the worst full-year reading on record.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses
to telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers
18 years old and older. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for
their views on the economy, personal finances and buying
climate; the percentage of negative responses is subtracted from
the share of positive views and divided by three. The most
recent reading is based on the average of responses over the
previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  Field work for the index is done by SSRS/Social Science
Research Solutions in Media,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporters on this story:
