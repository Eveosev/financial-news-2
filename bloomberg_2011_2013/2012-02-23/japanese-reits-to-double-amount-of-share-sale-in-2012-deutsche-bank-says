Japanese real estate investment
trusts are set to double the amount of capital they raise
through share sales this year, spurring a recovery in the
nation’s real estate market, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Japanese  REITs (TSEREIT)  may sell as much as 500 billion yen ($6.2
billion) worth of shares through secondary offerings in 2012,
compared with the 223.8 billion yen they sold last year, said
 Yoji Otani , an analyst at Deutsche Securities Inc. in Tokyo. A
total of 91.8 billion yen of share sale has already been
announced so far this year, he said.  Japan Real Estate Investment Corp. (8952)  and  Nippon Building Fund
Inc. (8951)  are among J-REITs that have announced plans this year for
public offerings to fund property acquisitions and pay down debt.
Real-estate transaction among J-REITs rose 31 percent to 714.4
billion yen in 2011 from a year earlier and compares with 246.8
billion yen that changed hands in 2009, the lowest since 2002,
according to Deutsche Securities.  “An increase in capital raising is a sign of recovery in
the  property market ,” Otani said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “The market has bottomed in 2009 and the recovery is
likely to accelerate this year.”  The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index rose 1.7 percent at the
close in Tokyo to the highest level in almost five months.  Japan  Real Estate Investment, the country’s second-biggest
property trust, said earlier this week it plans to raise as much
as 39 billion yen. It plans to use the proceeds to pay for
Asakasa Park Building in Tokyo it had acquired in November for
60.8 billion yen from Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s second-
biggest developer.  Others to Follow  Nippon Building, the country’s largest REIT, last month
said it plans to raise 20.9 billion yen for six office buildings
that cost a total of 22.7 billion yen as well as future
purchases.  Advance Residence Investment Corp. (3269)  will sell 15.8
billion yen worth of shares to finance 15 apartments that cost
23.5 billion yen, while  Industrial & Infrastructure Fund
Investment Corp. (3249)  is planning a 17.5 billion yen sale.  The Bank of Japan’s decision for additional monetary easing
and setting an inflation target of 1 percent will help boost
land prices in the six major cities by 10 percent, Otani said in
a report dated Feb. 15.  The number of sites in Japan where land values were
unchanged or increased in the last three months outnumbered
spots that fell for the first time in 3 1/2 years, helped by
recovering demand around Tokyo bay area housings, a land
ministry survey yesterday showed.  The REIT Index has gained 9.6 percent so far this year,
while the 46-member Topix Real Estate Index has risen 27 percent.  “The wall formed by the overly pessimistic outlook of
investors is starting to crumble,” Otani said in a separate
report dated yesterday. “The real estate sector has entered a
period of rising share prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
