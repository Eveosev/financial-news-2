The European Commission said
Hungary’s economy will probably shrink this year while inflation
will be the fastest in the European Union.  Gross domestic product  will contract 0.1 percent, the
European Commission forecast today in its Interim Forecast,
downgrading a 0.5 percent growth estimate from its Autumn
Forecast. The inflation rate will average 5.1 percent, the
highest in the EU, the commission said, increasing its previous
4.5 percent estimate.  Hungary’s government predicts GDP will grow 0.5 percent
this year. Economic performance will be somewhere between
stagnation and 0.5 percent growth,  Mihaly Varga , Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban ’s chief of staff, said Feb. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
