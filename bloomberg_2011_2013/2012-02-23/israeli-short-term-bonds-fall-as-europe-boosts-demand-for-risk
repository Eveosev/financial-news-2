Israeli short-term  government bonds 
fell, pushing yields to the highest in almost five weeks, after
a bigger-than-expected rise in German and Italian consumer
confidence boosted demand for riskier assets.  The yield on the 3.5 percent bonds due September 2013
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.63
percent, the highest since Jan. 23, at 3:31 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .
Yields on longer-term debt fell. On the 5.5 percent bond due
January 2042, the yield declined one basis point to 5.49
percent, while the rate on the 5.5 percent bonds due in January
2022 retreated by the same to 4.62 percent.  German business confidence rose to the highest in seven
months in February as progress in taming  Europe ’s debt crisis
tempered the risk of a recession. Italy’s consumer confidence
index rose to 94.2 from a revised 91.8 in January, above the
92.1 median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Exports make up about 40 percent of the Israeli economy
and Europe is one of its largest markets.  “Positive sentiment surrounding the situation in Europe is
contributing to a decline in the risk premium of Israeli assets
and boosting appetite for higher-yielding assets,” said Guy Lazarovich, a bond trader at IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Investors are lengthening positions buying
longer-term bonds and selling shorter-term notes.”  Inflation Expectations  The one-year break-even rate, the difference between
inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-rate
government debt, fell less than one basis point to 263. That
implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.63 percent.
Economists’ 12-month inflation expectation was 2.4 percent, the
Bank of  Israel  said on Feb. 19.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell one basis point to
2.48 percent. The rate has risen 14 basis points this month.  The  Bank of Israel ’s monetary committee, led by Governor
 Stanley Fischer , will hold the benchmark  interest rate  at 2.5
percent at a policy meeting on Feb. 27, according to all 22
economists in a Bloomberg  survey . The central bank lowered
borowing costs to 2.5 percent on Jan. 23, the third reduction in
five months.  The  Tel-Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  of corporate bonds was little changed
at 264.08. The shekel gained 0.3 percent to 3.7480 a dollar.  The central bank and the  Finance Ministry  have reduced
their growth predictions for this year, citing the impact of the
European debt crisis. The economy expanded an annualized 3.2
percent in the fourth quarter compared with a revised 3.8
percent in the third quarter as exports and private consumption
declined, the statistics bureau said Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
