(Corrects to say YPF gained in headline.)  The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are the close of trading in  Buenos
Aires .  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index fell 0.7 percent to 2,818.09.  YPF SA (YPFD)  ,  Argentina ’s largest oil company, rose 0.1
percent to 159.50 pesos after earlier declining 0.9 percent as
the company said it barred three politicians from entering a
board meeting in Buenos Aires today. Roberto Baratta, the
government’s board representative who voted against two YPF
dividend payments last year, walked out in protest after the
politicians were kept out.  Tenaris SA (TS)  (TS AF), the world’s largest producer of
seamless steel tubes used in the oil industry, fell 1.6 percent
to 97.45 pesos. The company’s shares had “climbed a lot in the
past week” and today’s drop after Tenaris reported “very
positive results” in the fourth quarter may have been caused by
investors selling stakes they bought at lower prices, Guillermo Maresco, a trader at Buenos Aires-based brokerage Nacion
Bursatil, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
