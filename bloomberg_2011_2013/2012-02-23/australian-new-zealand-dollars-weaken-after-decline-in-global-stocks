The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced against their major peers as stocks rallied
after economic data in  Europe  and the U.S. beat estimates.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi rose for the first time in
three days versus the greenback as German business confidence
increased to the highest level in seven months amid progress
taming the region’s debt crisis. Initial jobless claims in the
U.S. held at a four-year low. Gains in the Australian dollar
were limited as Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  called a ballot for
the leadership of the ruling  Labor Party  following Foreign
Minister  Kevin Rudd ’s resignation.  “It looks like risk appetite is reasonably well
underpinned,” said Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy for
BNP Paribas SA in  New York . “It’s a little bit of ‘no news is
good news’ as far as the euro zone is concerned.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.5 percent to $1.0687 at at
12:17 p.m. New York time. It earlier slid to $1.0598, the
weakest since Feb. 1. The currency rallied 0.4 percent to 85.78
yen.  The New Zealand dollar rose 0.6 percent to 83.40 U.S.
cents. The kiwi rose 0.4 percent to 66.87 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent and the
MSCI World Index of stocks climbed 0.3 percent. The S&P GSCI
 Index (SPGSCITR)  of 24 raw materials gained 0.2 percent.  Australia Elections  The kiwi has appreciated 0.3 percent today, the best
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie has gained
0.2 percent.  Gillard called for a leadership ballot on Feb. 27, seeking
to end weeks of tension with Rudd, whom she ousted from the top
post in 2010.  In a news conference from  Washington  today shortly before
Gillard spoke, Rudd said he was encouraged by support he has
received from party colleagues since he resigned overnight.  “This is a diversion from the government actually pushing
through whatever they need to push through,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency-
risk management company. “All this, in the very short term, is
not a good thing for the Aussie dollar.”  The currency may see a “small correction” and may decline
toward $1.05 in coming weeks, Mumford said.  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits were unchanged in
the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed today. The median projection in
a Bloomberg News survey called for 355,000 claims. The Munich-
based Ifo institute said its business climate  index (SPX) , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6 from 108.3 in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
