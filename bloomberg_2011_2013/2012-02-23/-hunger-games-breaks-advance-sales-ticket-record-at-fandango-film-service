“The Hunger Games,” the first film
in a young-adult movie series from  Lions Gate Entertainment
Corp. (LGF) , set a first-day record for advance sales on Fandango, the
ticket-selling site owned by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   The picture, about teens forced to fight to the death on
live television, yesterday broke the record held by “The
Twilight Saga: Eclipse,” Fandango said today in a statement.
The “Twilight” mark was set on May 14, 2010.  The company didn’t report how many tickets were purchased.
It said hundreds of showtimes for the March 23 opening have sold
out. Lions Gate, based in Vancouver and run from Santa Monica,
California, is planning four films based on the Suzanne Collins
book series. The company  purchased  Summit Entertainment in
January, acquiring the studio behind the blockbuster
“Twilight” teen vampire romance movies.  Lions Gate , also producer of cable TV’s “Mad Men” series,
rose 2.8 percent to $12.90 at the close in New York. The  stock 
has risen 50 percent since the company announced the Summit
acquisition on Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
