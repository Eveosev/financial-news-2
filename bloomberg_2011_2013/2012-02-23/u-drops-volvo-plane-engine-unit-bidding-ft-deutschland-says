MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX)  has
withdrawn from the bidding process for  Volvo AB (VOLVB) ’s aircraft-
engine unit,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
unidentified people from the industry.  Volvo’s unit didn’t fulfill MTU’s expectations in terms of
return ratios and outlook to warrant a purchase that may have
cost the Munich-based manufacturer an estimated 800 million
euros ($1.06 billion), the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
