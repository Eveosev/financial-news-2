Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc (CSCG) ,
the U.K.’s largest publicly traded shopping-mall owner, said
full-year profit excluding items rose 43 percent after
acquisitions boosted revenue.  Profit excluding changes in asset values and one-time items
rose to 138.6 million pounds ($218 million), or 16.5 pence a
share, the London-based company said in a statement today. That
compares with a profit of 96.6 million pounds, or 15.4 pence, a
year earlier. Net asset value was unchanged from six months
earlier at 391 pence a share.  Analysts expected Capital Shopping to generate earnings of
16.2 pence a share, the average of  19 estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s 1.6 billion-pound purchase of the
Trafford Centre in Manchester, England, in January 2011 was the
biggest single property transaction in Europe last year,
according to New York-based Real Capital Analytics Inc.  With the Trafford Centre, Capital Shopping owns 10 of the
U.K.’s 25 largest malls by retail sales, including the
Metrocentre at Gateshead. The company also acquired a 75 percent
stake in the Broadmarsh shopping center in Nottingham for 55
million pounds in November.  Capital Shopping fell 5.1 pence to 334.8 pence in  London 
trading yesterday. The shares advanced 16 percent in the three
months to yesterday’s close, the second-best performance of the
11 members of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index,
which rose 8.2 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
