Canadian natural gas fell after a
report showed U.S. inventories declined less last week than
analysts estimated.  Alberta  gas dropped 2.3 percent, reversing gains prior to
the  Energy Department (DOENUSCH)  report. U.S. stockpiles fell 166 billion
cubic feet to 2.595 trillion in the week ended Feb. 17, 40
percent above the five-year average. The decline was 4 billion
cubic feet below the median estimate made by 24 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  “We’re looking at a very large year-on-five-year
surplus,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in  New York . “Looking ahead, we’re likely to see a
below-average storage withdrawal for this week.”  Alberta gas for March delivery declined 4.75 cents to
C$2.02 a gigajoule ($1.91 per million British thermal units) at
3 p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has dropped 30 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 2.2 cents to settle at $2.621 per million Btu.  Gas for prompt delivery rose amid forecasts of colder-than-
normal weather in the U.S. Midwest and Northwest. Chicago’s low
Feb. 25 may dip to 21 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 Celsius), 4
degrees below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. Demand for
heat in the Northwest will exceed normal by 15 percent through
March 1, Weather Derivatives said.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
7.37 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.7794 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 6.89 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.5791.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was up 7.37 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.6888.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 94 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.82 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 685 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.97 billion cubic feet today, or 74 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
