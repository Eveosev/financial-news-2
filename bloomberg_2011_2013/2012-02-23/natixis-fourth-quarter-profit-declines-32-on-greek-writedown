Natixis SA (KN) , the investment-banking
and asset-management unit of Groupe BPCE, said fourth-quarter
profit fell 32 percent after it wrote down Greek sovereign debt.  Net income dropped to 302 million euros ($400.4 million)
from 442 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based bank said
in a statement today. The shares rose after earnings beat the
215 million-euro average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Natixis and French rivals such as BNP Paribas SA and
Societe Generale SA have been embroiled in  Europe ’s crisis
because of their $620 billion in holdings of private and public
debt in  Greece ,  Portugal , Ireland,  Italy  and  Spain , according to
figures from the Bank for International Settlements. Natixis
took a 124 million-euro provision for credit losses including
its Greek government-debt holdings in the quarter.  Natixis “absorbed shocks relatively better than others,”
said Jacques-Pascal Porta, who helps manage 300 million euros at
Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris and owns no shares of the company.
“It’s a nice surprise in the doldrums of financial results that
we have seen in the fourth quarter.”  Natixis gained as much as 10 cents, or 4.5 percent, to 2.44
euros, its highest price in five months, and was at 2.41 euros
at 9:58 a.m. in Paris trading. That gives the company a market
value of 7.4 billion euros.  Net revenue at Natixis’s corporate-and investment-banking
division fell 20 percent in the quarter to 588 million euros
amid a “very challenging environment” and “lower customer
activity,” the company said. Pretax profit at the CIB unit
declined 44 percent to 151 million euros.  Earnings before tax at the investment-solutions division,
which includes asset management, insurance and private banking,
dropped 15 percent to 122 million euros.  “In 2012 we will continue to adapt our business model with
our plan to further reduce liquidity needs and risk-weighted
assets,” Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
