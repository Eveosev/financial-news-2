Stocks in Europe  declined for a
third day as the European Commission said the region’s economy
will shrink this year, dragged down by Italy and  Spain .  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  tumbled 6.6 percent after saying it won’t
pay a dividend for 2011 and will ask investors to swap some
hybrid instruments for shares.  Fiat SpA (F)  led a drop among
carmakers. Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-biggest reinsurer,
gained after raising its shareholder payout.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  lost 0.2 percent to 264.08 at
the close of trading, after earlier rising as much as 0.4
percent and falling as much as 0.7 percent. The gauge has
rallied 8 percent this year as euro-area leaders took measures
to contain the region’s debt crisis and U.S. economic data
topped estimates.  “The European Commission comments remind us that the
situation in the eurozone is not good at all,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief European strategist at Market Securities in  London .
The earnings scorecard, which showed that one out of two
companies in the region reported earnings below analyst
estimates, also weighed on sentiment, he said. “Overall, the
earnings season hasn’t been a good one.”  The 17-nation euro economy will contract 0.3 percent in
2012, the European Commission said, abandoning a November
forecast for a 0.5 percent growth. The commission expects the
economy to shrink 1.3 percent in  Italy  and 1 percent in Spain.  Economic Sentiment  “Although growth has stalled, we are seeing signs of
stabilization in the European economy,” European Union Economic
and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said in the introduction to
the quarterly forecasts today in Brussels. “Economic sentiment
is still at low levels, but stress in financial markets is
easing.”  In Germany, the Munich-based Ifo institute said its
 business climate  index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
climbed to 109.6 in February from 108.3 in January. That’s the
fourth straight gain and the highest reading since July.
Economists predicted an increase to 108.8, according to the
median estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  indicated she will maintain
pressure on  Greece  to meet debt-cutting pledges required for its
second financial rescue, saying fiscal discipline is needed to
hold the euro area together.  “People are getting skeptical that Greece will stick to
its commitments in the future,” Ekolo of Market Securities
said.  Rescue Package  Euro-area finance ministers this week approved a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) aid package for Greece and persuaded
investors to provide more debt relief to the nation.  Of the 204 companies on the Stoxx 600 that have reported
quarterly  earnings  so far, 102 have missed analyst estimates,
while 90 have surpassed them, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Hope in the market “will be crushed,”  Albert Edwards , a
global strategist at Societe Generale SA, wrote in a note. “To
me this feels no different from the start of 2011 but with one
major difference. Profits are sliding instead of rising
robustly.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in 12 of the 18
western European markets. Germany’s DAX dropped 0.5 percent,
while France’s CAC 40 was little changed. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
gained 0.4 percent.  Commerzbank Capital Increase  Commerzbank fell 6.6 percent to 1.93 euros. Germany’s
second-largest lender said it won’t pay a dividend for 2011 and
will ask investors to swap hybrid capital instruments trading
below face value for new shares, in a plan to boost its
financial strength. The measures could increase the core  Tier 1
capital  by more than 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion), the bank
said.  Vallourec SA (VK) , a French producer of steel pipes for the oil
and gas industry, tumbled 6.4 percent to 52.95 euros. The
company reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates and forecast a lower profit margin this year.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  lost 3 percent to 8.70 euros. The
company forecast earnings will fall further this year after
posting a 1.34 billion-euro quarterly net loss because of
writedowns on  T-Mobile USA  and its Greek business.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization excluding some items will be about 18 billion
euros, or 3.7 percent less than in 2011, Germany’s largest phone
company said today. That compares with the 18.5 billion-euro
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Automakers Retreat  A gauge of  carmakers  dropped 1.7 percent, for the biggest
decline among the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600. Fiat lost
4.5 percent to 4.57 euros. Preferred shares of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
 Europe ’s largest automaker, slid 2.3 percent to 139.15 euros.
 Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-largest maker of luxury cars,
slipped 1.9 percent to 46.93 euros.  Swiss Re (SREN)  rose 2.6 percent to 54.40 francs. The world’s
second-biggest reinsurer may use excess capital to pay a special
dividend for this year, after increasing its 2011 payout as
fourth-quarter profit exceeded analyst estimates.  The company posted a net income of $983 million following a
loss of $725 million in the year-earlier period. That beat the
$299 million average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Natixis (KN)  SA, the investment-banking and asset-management
unit of Groupe BPCE, jumped 8.4 percent to 2.53 euros. The bank
said fourth-quarter profit fell 32 percent to 302 million euros
after it wrote down Greek sovereign debt. That compares with the
215 million-euro average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Cookson Group Plc (CKSN) , the world’s biggest maker of ceramic
linings for metal smelters, advanced 4.7 percent to 670 pence.
The company said it will sell its U.S. precious metals business
to a unit of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc .  To contact the reporter on this story:
