Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to increase daily exports of Brass River crude
in April by 21 percent, according to a loading program obtained
by Bloomberg News.  The country will ship five cargoes totaling 131,667 barrels
a day of the blend, compared with 108,871 barrels for March, the
plan shows.  Nigeria will also export one 700,000 barrel cargo of Abo
crude and one shipment of 900,000 barrels of Okono, according to
a separate plan.  Shipping schedules of Amenam, Antan, Erha, Okwori and
Pennington grades are not available yet. Loading programs are
monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators
to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
