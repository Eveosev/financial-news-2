BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, raised its quarterly dividend 9.1 percent to
$1.50 a share.  The  dividend  is payable March 23 to shareholders of record
as of March 7, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. BlackRock said also that it expanded its share
repurchase program to buy back as many as 5 million shares of
common stock.  Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink said in January
that the firm would deploy its “enormous, large free  cash
flow ” to boost the dividend payout and fund stock buybacks.
BlackRock generated an operating cash flow of $2.7 billion in
2011, the firm said last month.  BlackRock manages $3.3 trillion in mutual funds,
institutional accounts and exchange-traded funds. A year ago,
the firm raised its dividend by 38 percent to $1.375 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
