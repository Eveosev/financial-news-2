A  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  unit sued
XenoPort Inc. in federal court in Delaware, seeking a ruling
that it properly promoted the restless-leg medicine Horizant in
the U.S.  Glaxo Group of Middlesex, England, and  Santa Clara ,
California-based XenoPort agreed to collaborate on Horizant
starting in 2007 and the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration last year, according to court papers.  Last month, XenoPort told Glaxo it wasn’t doing enough “to
commercialize and promote Horizant” or reach certain
milestones, and said it would terminate the agreement, Glaxo
contends in the suit.  The British company asked a federal judge in Wilmington to
rule it has complied with XenoPort’s terms and to preserve
Glaxo’s “exclusive license rights” to Horizant.  Jackie Cossmon, a XenoPort spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
reply to voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  Horizant has the potential for $100 million a year in U.S.
sales, an analyst said April 7, after the drug was approved.  Shares of XenoPort rose 12 cents or 2.37 percent to $4.32
in Nasdaq stock market trading at 11 a.m. in  New York .  The case is Glaxo Group Ltd. v.  XenoPort Inc. (XNPT) , U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
