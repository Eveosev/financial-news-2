The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a third day, sliding 1.9 percent to 994.6 at its close
in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   declined
for a second day after the broadcaster said yesterday its
fourth-quarter loss widened. The stock slid 11 percent to 137.1
koruna, after earlier tumbling as much as 19 percent.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, added 2.3 percent to 153.5 koruna.  Europe ’s coal
and electricity prices rose after a gauge of business confidence
in  Germany , the region’s largest economy and the biggest buyer
of Czech exports, gained more than forecast. NWR earlier fell as
much as 6 percent after saying 2011 profit shrank 44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
