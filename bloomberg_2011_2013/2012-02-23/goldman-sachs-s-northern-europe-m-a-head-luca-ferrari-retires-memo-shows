Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Luca Ferrari, an investment banker to  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  on its proposed
merger with Glencore International Plc, is leaving the company
after 12 years.  Ferrari, a managing director based in London and head of
Northern European M&A at the firm, joined from UBS Warburg in
2000. He was named a partner in 2006, according to an internal
memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a spokeswoman in
London today.  His exit is the third by a senior banker in the investment
bank this month. Goldman Sachs said that George Mattson, head of
the industrials investment-banking group, was leaving the firm.
Jeffrey Moslow, a partner based in  New York , will also leave the
company according to a memo.  Ferrari’s clients have included Telefonica SA,  Spain ’s
largest telephone company. New York-based Goldman Sachs is the
top ranked merger adviser this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Glencore (GLEN) , the world’s largest publicly traded commodity
trader, plans to combine with Xstrata’s coal and copper mines to
create a business with $209 billion in sales, the companies said
on Feb. 7. The takeover would be the biggest-ever mining deal if
completed and would form a commodities supplier to challenge BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
