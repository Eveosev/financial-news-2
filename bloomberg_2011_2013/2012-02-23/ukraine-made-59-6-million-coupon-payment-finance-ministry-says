Ukraine’s government  made  a $59.6
million coupon payment of its 10-year Eurobonds, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  The former Soviet republic raised $1.5 billion in a sale of
Eurobonds in February last year.  Ukraine also redeemed yesterday 3.4 billion hryvnia ($424.5
million) on domestic debt, the largest payment to service
domestic debt in the first quarter of this year, the ministry,
based in the capital Kiev, said today.  Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said today Ukraine won’t
default, according to a statement on his website. The central
bank and the government are in control of the financial and
economic situation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
