London Metal Exchange board members
arrived at the exchange for the meeting to discuss takeover bids
and trading fees.  Martin Abbott , chief executive officer of the exchange, 
Gavin Prentice, Jim Coupland and Gabriela Grillo were among the
directors seen entering the exchange building today. The
LME got preliminary bids from CME Group Inc., NYSE Euronext and
Intercontinental Exchange Inc., according to three people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  “We have no idea” how long the meeting will last, Abbott
said.  The LME held a meeting with members this month after saying
in December it planned to raise fees by adding a user charge in
March. Last month, three directors wrote to members opposing the
plan, a person familiar with the letter said at the time. The
exchange handles more than 80 percent of trade in nonferrous
metals futures led by aluminum, copper and zinc.  “The first proposal was always subject to fine-tuning and
that’s what I expect today,” Coupland, head of industrial
metals trading at Standard Bank Plc, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
