The zloty advanced for the first
time in three days as reports showed Polish  retail sales  growth
accelerated in January and German business confidence rose to a
seven-month high.  The Polish currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 4.1770 per
euro as of 5:34 p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest gain among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Retail sales growth accelerated in January to 14.3 percent
from a year earlier, compared with an 8.6 percent rise in
December, the statistical office said today, beating the 13.8
percent median forecast of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The Munich-based Ifo institute’s German  business climate index ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6 this
month from 108.3 in January.  Germany  is Poland’s largest trading
partner.  Poland’s economic outlook is “much better” than in
December as an improving situation in the euro area gives the
government greater confidence that “negative outcomes” on
growth won’t occur, Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  told
reporters in Warsaw yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
