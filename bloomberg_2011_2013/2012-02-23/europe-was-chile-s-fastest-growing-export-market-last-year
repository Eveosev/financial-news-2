Europe , whose economy is forecast to
contract this year, was Chile’s fastest-growing export market in
2011 on shipments of  copper , wood products, meat and fish, the
Andean nation’s central bank said.  The world’s top copper producer exported $16 billion to
Europe last year, up 21 percent from 2010, according to a  report 
posted on the bank’s website today. Exports in the Americas rose
17 percent and sales to  Asia , the South American country’s
biggest export market, grew 7.3 percent. Total exports climbed
13 percent to $81 billion in 2011, the bank said.  Exports will fall to $79 billion in 2012 as the average
price of copper declines 13 percent to $3.50 per pound, policy
makers said in their latest economic forecast, published in
December. Copper has averaged $3.7491 a pound so far this year
and was trading at $3.8275 at 9:42 a.m. Santiago time.  The Netherlands was  Chile ’s biggest export destination in
Europe last year, followed by Italy and  Spain , the bank said.  Europe’s economy will shrink 0.25 percent this year from
2011, when it grew an estimated 1.35 percent, according to the
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
