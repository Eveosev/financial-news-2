The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  will hold a roundtable next week to consider steps to
safeguard collateral -- including a plan to insulate futures
clients’ funds during a broker default -- following the collapse
of  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , according to two people briefed on
the agenda.  The plan, one of several possible regulatory changes, would
mimic new rules completed Jan. 11 for the swaps market,
according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the roundtable agenda isn’t public. The swap plan,
approved on a 4-1 vote, is designed to protect clients’
collateral if their broker defaults, while also allowing the
customer funds to be pooled before a bankruptcy.  The roundtable will take place on Feb. 29 and March 1,
according to one of the people. The event is an early step
toward additional rules and regulations that would require an
official CFTC proposal and vote by the agency’s five
commissioners.  CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  asked the agency’s staff to
develop recommendations for new oversight of the industry’s
self-regulatory organizations and brokers. The review may
include recommendations for changes requiring congressional
action, according to a Jan. 26 letter from Jill E. Sommers, a
Republican commissioner, to Senator  Pat Roberts , a Kansas
Republican. Sommers is overseeing the agency’s work on the
collapse of MF Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
