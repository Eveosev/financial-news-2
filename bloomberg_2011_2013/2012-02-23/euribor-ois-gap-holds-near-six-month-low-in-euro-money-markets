A measure of European banksâ€™
reluctance to lend to one another held at the lowest level in
almost six months, according to a money-market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 67 basis
points at 9:11 a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The measure has declined from 97 basis points at the start of
the year to the lowest since Sept. 1.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 70 basis
points below Euribor, from minus 68 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year basis swap was 62 basis
points less than Euribor from minus 61 yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 466 billion euros ($620 billion) with the central bank,
down from 449 billion euros on Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
