Agustin Carstens, the governor of
 Mexico ’s central bank, urged  Europe  to combine the interim
European Financial Stability Facility with the European
Stability Mechanism, which is intended to be permanent, the
Financial Times Deutschland  reported , citing an interview.  Amalgamation would increase money available for bailouts to
750 billion euros ($995 billion), from 500 billion euros, though
it’s unclear whether that would be adequate, the newspaper cited
Carstens as saying.  Euro member-states’ decision to force losses on private
sovereign bondholders last year was a mistake, leading to
contagion elsewhere in Europe, Carstens added, according to the
FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
