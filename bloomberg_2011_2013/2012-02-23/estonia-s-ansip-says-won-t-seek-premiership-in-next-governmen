Estonia ’s Prime Minister  Andrus
Ansip  said he won’t seek another term when the current
government is replaced.  “If this government’s ability to work, or the will to
cooperate ends, even before the next elections, then my
premiership will end as well,” Ansip said, according to an e-
mailed copy of a speech he made in Tartu, southern Estonia,
today. “I will not form the next government, not before nor
after the new Riigikogu is elected.”  The next general elections in Estonia are scheduled for
March 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
