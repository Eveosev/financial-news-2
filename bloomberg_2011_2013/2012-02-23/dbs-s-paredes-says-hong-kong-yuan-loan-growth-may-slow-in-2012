Sebastian Paredes, chief executive
officer of the  Hong Kong  unit of  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) ,
comments on the outlook of yuan-denominated loan growth in Hong
Kong. He spoke in an interview in Hong Kong today.  On the outlook of yuan loan growth in Hong Kong:  “The different  interest rate  regimes between mainland
China and Hong Kong, as well as the scarcity of U.S. dollars,
gave a window of opportunity” for growth in yuan-denominated
loans in Hong Kong.  “As this arbitrage, or this interest rate differential
reduces, as the pressure on liquidity subsides, and as the
tightening of the monetary policy in China also subsides, you
have to ask yourself, will this trend continue at the same pace
as it did 2011? That is the biggest question for us in 2012.  ‘‘We are beginning to see a substantial reduction of the
rate of growth of loans in Hong Kong. And when you look at the
duration of most of the yuan loans, the duration matures in the
third quarter of this year.  ‘‘So we will see as the year progresses whether we will be
able to renew those trade loans as they mature and if the amount
is significant.  ‘‘If it doesn’t, it’s going to be a challenge just to
replace those loans because banks in  China  are not as tight as
they were. The mainland Chinese customers are not going to be
forced to borrow here.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
