John Fingleton , chief executive
officer of the U.K.’s  Office of Fair Trading , will step down
later this year after seven years in the role, the agency said
in a statement on its website today.  Fingleton said he hasn’t decided on his next move and that
it was “a good time for someone new to take the helm,” in the
statement.  The U.K. government is preparing to merge the watchdog with
another regulator, the  Competition Commission . The OFT started
11 cases under Britain’s competition law in 2010, less than 1
percent of the complaints from businesses seeking to break into
markets with large, established players, law firm Reynolds
Porter Chamberlain LLP said in December.  “Under John’s vigorous leadership the OFT has taken on
issues that really matter to consumers and the economy,” OFT
Chairman Phillip Collins said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
