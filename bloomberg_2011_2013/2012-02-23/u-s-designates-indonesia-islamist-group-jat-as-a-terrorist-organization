The U.S. designated the violent
Islamist group Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid as a foreign terrorist
organization, according to an e-mailed statement from the State
Department.  JAT is responsible for multiple coordinated attacks against
innocent civilians, police, and military personnel in  Indonesia ,
according to the statement issued today.  The action coincides with the Treasury Department’s
designation of three JAT leaders: JAT’s Acting Emir Mochammad
Achwan, JAT spokesperson Son Hadi bin Muhadjir, and JAT
leadership figure Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba’asyir.  “JAT seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia,
and has carried out numerous attacks on Indonesian government
personnel and civilians in order to achieve this goal,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
