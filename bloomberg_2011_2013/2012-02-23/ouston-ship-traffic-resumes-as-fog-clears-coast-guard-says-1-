Sixty ships awaited passage through
the  Houston Ship Channel  as of 4 p.m. local time after pilots
resumed transits halted by fog, the U.S. Coast Guard said.  Houston port pilots, who were forced to suspend work
yesterday, resumed traffic to and from the largest U.S.
petroleum port at 9 a.m., Albert Hernandez, a Coast Guard watch
supervisor, said in a telephone interview. Pilots serving ports
in Galveston Bay, Galveston and  Texas City  resumed at 8 a.m.  As of 4 p.m., 25 ships were in Houston waiting to depart
and 35 were waiting to arrive, Hernandez said. Transits at
Galveston and Texas City are “all caught up,” he said.  “Right now, there’s a report that we should expect fog
overnight, so we’re waiting to see what happens,” Hernandez
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
