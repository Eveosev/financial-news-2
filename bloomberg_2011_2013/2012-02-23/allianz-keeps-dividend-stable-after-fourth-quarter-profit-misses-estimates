Allianz SE (ALV)  (ALV),  Europe ’s biggest
insurer, proposed an unchanged dividend after fourth-quarter
profit missed analyst estimates.  Net income fell to 492 million euros ($652 million) from
1.14 billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-based insurer said
in a statement today. That missed the 876 million-euro average
estimate of 18  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Allianz proposed
keeping the  dividend  stable at 4.50 euros a share.  Insurers are seeking higher prices for their policies as
low interest rates, natural disaster losses and writedowns on
investments related to the sovereign-debt crisis weigh on
earnings and capital buffers. Allianz, led by Chief Executive
Officer Michael Diekmann, 57, had its  credit rating  placed on a
negative outlook by Standard and Poor’s on Jan. 27. That
threatens the insurer’s AA long-term  rating , the highest among
the 28 members of the  Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index. (BEINSUR)   “2011 was a tough year. But we maintained our stability
throughout,” Diekmann said in the statement.  Allianz has climbed 22 percent in Frankfurt trading this
year, giving the insurer a market value of 41 billion euros. The
Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index rose 14 percent over the
same period with  Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second-biggest insurer,
gaining 22 percent and  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, 5 percent.  Target Range  Full-year operating profit fell to 7.87 billion euros from
8.24 billion euros in 2010, meeting Allianz’s target range of
7.5 billion euros to 8.5 billion euros. The insurer said it aims
for operating profit of 8.2 billion euros, give or take 500
million euros, for 2012.  Zurich Financial last week reported fourth-quarter profit
that missed analyst estimates, declining 46 percent to $557
million after losses from Thai floods and other natural
catastrophes. Paris-based Axa reported an 82 percent drop in
second-half profit to 325 million euros after writedowns on
Greek sovereign debt and a one-time cost at its U.S. variable-
annuity life-insurance book.  To contact the reporter on this story:
