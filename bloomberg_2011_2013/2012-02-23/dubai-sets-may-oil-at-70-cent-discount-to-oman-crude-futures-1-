Dubai kept the  differential  used to
determine the cost of its oil shipments unchanged for May and at
the steepest discount since the Persian Gulf emirate began
pricing its exports against the  Oman Crude Futures (OOSPOMAN)  contract.  May shipments will sell at a discount of 70 cents a barrel
to the Oman crude price that will be determined through trading
on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, according to an e-mail from
the emirate’s Department of Petroleum Affairs today.  Oman sets its official selling price based on trading on
the DME, an exchange part owned by that country’s sovereign
wealth fund and by Chicago-based  CME Group Inc. (CME)  Those two
shareholders said this week the will invest an undisclosed
amount in the DME, boosting their holdings.  Dubai, which owns a stake in the DME through a government-
run investment fund, began pricing its high-sulfur crude in
relation to the Oman variety in September 2009. The DME is
seeking to establish the Oman contract as a more widely adopted
benchmark among Middle Eastern producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
