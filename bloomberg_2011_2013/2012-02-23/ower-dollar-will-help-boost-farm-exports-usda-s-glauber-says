A decline in the value of the  dollar 
will more than make up for slowing global growth this year,
helping boost U.S. agriculture exports, said  Joe Glauber , the
chief economist for the Department of Agriculture.  Glauber made the comments today at a conference in
Arlington,  Virginia . The dollar has  fallen  1.5 percent this year
against a basket of six major currencies. Farm exports will
total $131 billion in the year that began Oct. 1, Glauber said.
That would be second only to the previous year’s record $137.4
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
