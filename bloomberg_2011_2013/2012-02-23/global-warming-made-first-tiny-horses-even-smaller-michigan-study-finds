(Corrects study location in last paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  Global warming 50 million years ago
caused the first horses, already tiny in stature compared with
present-day animals, to shrink 30 percent to about 8.5 pounds,
the size of a house cat today, a study suggests.  Later, as the climate cooled, the horse called  Sifrhippus 
began to grow in size, according to research in the journal
 Science . Scientists used fossilized teeth to make the size
estimates.  The finding, which correlates to a 10 to 20-degree change
in global temperature, follows  Bergmann’s rule , which says that
smaller animals within the same species are usually found in
hotter climes. The study also may suggest that creatures alive
today may shrink if global warming continues, said Philip
Gingerich, director of the University of Michigan’s Museum of
Paleontology.  “I joke about this all the time -- we’re going to be
walking around 3 feet tall if we keep going the way we’re
going,” Gingerich said in a statement. He wasn’t a study
author.  From 1906 to 2005, the world was an “unequivocal” warming
trend, according to the  Environmental Protection Agency ’s
website. The earth warmed about 1 to 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit over
that time, much less than the warming trend 56 million years
ago.  The research was led by Ross Secord of the University of
 Nebraska  in Lincoln and Jonathan Bloch of the  Florida  Museum of
National History at the University of Florida in Gainesville.  To contact the reporter on this story:
