Staff at  Donald Trump ’s Trump Towers
in  New York  will work daily with Communities Against Turbines
Scotland, an anti-wind farm group, the Herald reported, citing
Trump’s legal counsel George Sorial.  Sorial will attend an anti-wind farm meeting to be held by
the lobby group in St Andrews on March 1, said the newspaper.  Trump said in January he would scrap plans for a hotel and
housing at his golf course resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, if
the government approves an offshore wind farm in view of his
championship course due to open in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
