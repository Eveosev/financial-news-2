German 10-year bunds declined after
a report showed business confidence rose more than economists
forecast to the highest in seven months in February.  The 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 1.91
percent at 9:04 a.m. London time. German two-year notes were
little changed with the yield at 0.28 percent.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6
from 108.3 in January. Thatâ€™s the fourth straight gain and the
highest reading since July. Economists predicted an increase to
108.8, according to the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
