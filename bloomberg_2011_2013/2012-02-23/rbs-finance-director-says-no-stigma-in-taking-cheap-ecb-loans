Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
Finance Director Bruce Van Saun said there is no “stigma” in
taking three-year loans from the  European Central Bank .  The longer term refinancing operation is “offering
relatively cheap funding,” Van Saun said at a press conference
in London today. “There is very little stigma around banks
taking it in reasonable doses.”  RBS took 5 billion pounds ($7.9 billion) of the three-year
loans from the Frankfurt-based ECB at a December auction, a
person familiar with the decision said earlier this month. More
than 500 banks took an unprecedented 489 billion euros ($650
billion) at the offering. Analysts said they expect demand from
the industry to be just as high at a second auction on Feb. 29.  The ECB is flooding the banking system with cheap money in
a bid to avert a credit crunch after the market for unsecured
bank debt seized up last year and funding from U.S. money
markets disappeared. Any bank in the region can borrow an
unlimited amount, provided it pledges eligible collateral.
