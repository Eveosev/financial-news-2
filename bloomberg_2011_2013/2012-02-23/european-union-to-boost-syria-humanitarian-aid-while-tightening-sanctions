European Union governments plan to
bolster  humanitarian aid  to Syria while tightening sanctions on
the country, an EU official said.  EU foreign ministers will consider options for delivering
relief to the Syrian population when they meet Feb. 27 to
toughen economic penalties against President Bashar al-Assad’s
regime, the official told reporters today in Brussels on the
condition of anonymity.  The 27-nation EU is moving toward stiffer sanctions on
Syria because of the government’s continued violent crackdown on
civilian opponents. The new European measures, which build on an
oil embargo approved last September, are due to include a freeze
on the Syrian central bank’s assets and a ban on imports of
precious metals from the country.  A previous EU plan to ban imports of phosphates from  Syria 
has been dropped because the measure didn’t get support from all
member nations, the official said. On the other hand, EU
governments are willing to include a ban on Syrian cargo-only
flights to the bloc among the new measures, according to the
official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
