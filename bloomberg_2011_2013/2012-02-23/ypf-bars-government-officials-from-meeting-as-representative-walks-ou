YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest energy
company, said it barred three politicians from entering a
meeting in  Buenos Aires  today, prompting the government’s
representative on the board to walk out in protest.  Roberto Baratta, who voted against two YPF dividend
payments last year, left the board meeting after being told that
Energy Secretary Daniel Cameron, Deputy Economy Minister Axel
Kicillof and other officials accompanying him weren’t allowed to
attend, YPF said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Argentine unit of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , based in Buenos Aires,
faces pressure from the government to reduce dividends and
invest more after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
blamed the company and other oil producers for the doubling of
fuel imports in 2011. Cameron last week threatened “vigorous
measures” against YPF if it fails to meet domestic fuel demand.  YPF told the three politicians to wait to speak with Repsol
Chairman  Antonio Brufau  and YPF Chief Executive Officer
Sebastian Eskenazi after the board meeting and they decided to
leave without doing so, YPF said.  YPF’s American depositary receipts rose 0.3 percent to
$33.65 in New York today. They have dropped 33 percent in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
