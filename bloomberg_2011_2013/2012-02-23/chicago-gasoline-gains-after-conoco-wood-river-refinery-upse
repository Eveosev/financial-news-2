Chicago  gasoline rose for a fifth
consecutive day after a fault at a sulfur plant at
ConocoPhillipsâ€™ Wood River, Illinois, refinery.  Conoco flared more than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide at the
356,000-barrel-a-day refinery yesterday, according to a filing
with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 1 cent to 15 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:39 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
3.8 cents to $2.9657 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, strengthened 1.25
cents to a discount of 10 cents gallon.  Inventories of gasoline in the region dropped 864,000
barrels to 56.4 million barrels last week, according to the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
