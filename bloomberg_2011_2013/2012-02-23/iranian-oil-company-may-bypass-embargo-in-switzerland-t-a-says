Iran â€™s state oil company, Naftiran
Intertrade Company, has an office in Pully,  Switzerland , and may
use it to bypass the European Union embargo,  Tages-Anzeiger 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The company can continue its oil business because
the embargo, adopted in January, doesn't apply to Switzerland,
the newspaper said. Switzerland will decide later whether to
follow the EU measures, according to the newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
