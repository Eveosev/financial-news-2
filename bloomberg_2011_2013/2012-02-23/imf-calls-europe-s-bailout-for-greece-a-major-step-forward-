The  International Monetary Fund  said
it sees the bailout for  Greece  as a “major step forward” that
will give the country time to face its fiscal challenges.  “That’s a strong package that can create space
for Greece to make improvements in its debt sustainability, in
its competitiveness and ultimately to resume growth, which is
the goal that we’re all seeking,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told
reporters in  Washington  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
