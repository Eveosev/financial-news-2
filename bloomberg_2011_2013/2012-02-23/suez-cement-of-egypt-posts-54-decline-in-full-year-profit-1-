Suez Cement (SUCE) ,  Egypt ’s biggest
publicly traded cement producer, posted a 54 percent decline in
2011 profit as social unrest disrupted construction work.  “The outlook is still very uncertain in the current
political context and before a stable government can be
established,” the Cairo-based company said in a filing to the
Egyptian bourse today.  Net income fell to 568.6 million Egyptian pounds ($94
million) from 1.24 billion pounds in 2010, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
