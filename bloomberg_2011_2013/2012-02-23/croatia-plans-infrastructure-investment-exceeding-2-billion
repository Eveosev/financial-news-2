Croatia  plans infrastructure and
energy investments of 1.6 billion euros ($2.13 billion) in 2012
to revive its economy and create jobs, Deputy Prime Minister
Radimir Cacic said.  Available funds from the  World Bank , the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the  European Investment Bank ,
totaling about 1 billion euros, would be injected into projects
by national grid Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d., the national
waterways Hrvatske Vode d.d., and the national railways Hrvatske
Zeljeznice d.d., Cacic told the Cabinet today.  In addition, non governmental groups would contribute to
investment with estimated 400 million euros, while European
Union funds would provide 200 million euros, he said.  “Croatia’s success in the next 18 months depends on how
much investment we will be able to attract,” Prime Minister
 Zoran Milanovic  told the Cabinet.  Croatia, which is set to become the EU’s 28th member in
2013, is facing a review of its  credit rating  as it needs revive
its faltering economy and service growing external debt.
Milanovic last month said the economy will grow 0.8 percent this
year, while central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said in
December the country may slide into recession again this year
after a modest recovery in 2011.  The government last month submitted its budget proposal to
lawmakers, which included cost cuts of 4 billion kuna ($700
million). The measure is expected to narrow the budget gap to
3.8 percent of gross domestic product from 5.5 percent in 2011.
Parliament vote on the budget tomorrow.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
