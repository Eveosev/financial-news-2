Indian stocks dropped for a second
day on concerns a rally in  Asia ’s best-performing stock market
this year may have outpaced the company earnings outlook amid
signs global growth is slowing.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the country’s largest mobile-phone
operator, tumbled to six-week low after it was sued by Econet
Wireless Ltd.  State Bank of India  rebounded from its biggest
loss in 31 months yesterday after Reuters reported the lender
has not given new loans to Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.  Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest copper and zinc producer,
sank 3.8 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.4 percent
to 18,078.50, according to preliminary closing prices 3:30 p.m.
in Mumbai. The  gauge  has rebounded 19 percent from its December
low, approaching the 20 percent threshold that signals a  bull
market , as a stronger rupee and the first cut in banks’ reserve
ratios since 2009 spurred foreigners to buy a net $5.3 billion
of stocks.  “There’s no great upside in the near term,” said Anand Tandon, chief executive officer of JRG Securities Ltd., in an
interview to Bloomberg UTV today. “If you go by the assumption
that central banks are out to flood the world with money, there
is a possibility that the upside can continue. But if you are a
dyed-in-the-wool investor the run-up is more than adequate for
any future policy action that is currently visible.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. slid 0.4 percent to 5,483.30. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  lost
0.4 percent to 2,218.22.  Foreign  funds  bought a net  $304.5 million  of local stocks
on Feb. 21, taking their net purchases of Indian equities this
year to $5.3 billion, data from the regulator show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
