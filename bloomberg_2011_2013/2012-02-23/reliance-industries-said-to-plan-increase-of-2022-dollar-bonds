Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  plans to
sell as much as $500 million more of its February 2022 bonds,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The bonds are being offered to investors to yield about 340
basis points, or 3.4 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, said the person, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc are
managing the sale, which will take place today, the person said.  A Mumbai-based Reliance spokesman, who declined to be named
citing company policy, confirmed that the company was marketing
dollar debt when contacted by phone today.  The owner of the worldâ€™s largest refining complex sold $1
billion of 5.4 percent 2022 bonds on Feb. 9 at a spread of 345
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company has the equivalent of $1.07 billion of bonds
 maturing  before the end of 2017, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
