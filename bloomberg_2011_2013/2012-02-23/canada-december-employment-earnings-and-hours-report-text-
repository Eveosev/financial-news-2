The following is the text of
Canada's employment, earnings, and hours report for
December released by  Statistics Canada .  In December, average weekly earnings of non-farm
payroll employees were $888.26, up 0.7% from the previous
month. On a year-over-year basis, earnings rose 2.4%.  Year-to-year change in average weekly hours and average
weekly earnings  The 2.4% increase in average weekly earnings during the
12 months to December reflects a number of factors, such
as wage growth and changes in the composition of
employment by industry, occupation and level of job
experience.  Average hours worked per week can also contribute to
changes in earnings. The year-over-year increase in weekly
earnings was tempered by a decline in average hours worked
per week. In December, average hours worked per week were
32.8, down from 32.9 hours in the previous month and down
from 33.0 hours in December 2010.  Average weekly earnings by sector  Year-over-year growth in average weekly earnings
exceeded the national average of 2.4% in four of  Canada 's
largest industrial sectors: retail trade, educational
services, construction and manufacturing.  Year-to-year change in average weekly earnings in the 10
largest sectors, December 2010 to December 2011  In retail trade, average weekly earnings were up 4.6%
in the 12 months to December to $527.61. The growth was
widespread across retail industries.  In educational services, average weekly earnings rose
4.0% to $961.08. Growth was notable in both universities
and colleges.  Average weekly earnings in construction increased 3.3%
to $1,122.96, with notable growth within heavy and civil
engineering construction.  In December, average earnings in manufacturing were up
2.5% from December 2010 to $1,000.55. Within this sector,
there was notable year-over-year earnings growth in
printing and related support activities; transportation
equipment manufacturing; computer and electronic product
manufacturing; and chemical manufacturing.  Growth in earnings also surpassed the national average
in some smaller sectors. From December 2010 to December
2011, earnings increased in the two highest-paying
industries: utilities, where they increased 8.7% to
$1,756.08; and mining, quarrying and oil and gas
extraction, where they rose 8.5% to $1,796.68.  Average weekly earnings in health care and social
assistance declined 1.9% to $788.68 in the 12 months to
December. Earnings in this sector have fallen for three
consecutive months, largely driven by earnings declines in
hospitals.  Average weekly earnings rose in every province  Average weekly earnings rose in every province in the
12 months to December, led by growth in Newfoundland and
Labrador,  Alberta  and Saskatchewan. The lowest rate of
growth was in Nova Scotia.  Year-over-year growth in average weekly earnings by
province, December 2010 to December 2011  In Newfoundland and Labrador, average weekly earnings
were up 5.8% to $907.26 in December from 12 months
earlier. Earnings in this province have been higher than
the national average since September 2011.  In Alberta, average weekly earnings increased 5.2% to
$1,064.80. Alberta continued to record the highest level
of earnings among the provinces.  In Saskatchewan, average weekly earnings were up 3.3%
to $893.21 in the 12 months to December. Earnings in the
province have exceeded the national average since August
2011.  The lowest year-over-year growth occurred in  Nova
Scotia , where average weekly earnings were up 0.5% to
$783.17.  Non-farm payroll employment by sector  From November to December, non-farm payroll employment
increased by 3,000. There were modest gains in 11 sectors,
led by transportation and warehousing, but they were
mostly offset by losses in 9 other sectors. On a year-over-
year basis, the number of non-farm payroll employees rose
1.4% (+206,200).  The highest year-over-year rates of growth in payroll
employment were in mining, quarrying and oil and gas
extraction (+7.7%); utilities (+4.5%); construction
(+3.6%); and accommodation and food services (+3.0%).  Note to readers  In March of every year, as part of the regularly
scheduled year-end review of the Survey of Employment,
Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), seasonally adjusted data are
revised using the latest seasonal factors.  In addition, as part of the annual review, there will
be revisions to a small number of industries for the 2001
to 2011 period. These revisions will affect both
unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data.  As a result, all data will be revised historically back
to 2001. On March 30, these revised data will be available
on CANSIM (tables 281-0023 to 281-0039 and 281-0041 to 281-
0049).  SEPH is a business census of non-farm payroll
employees. Its key objective is to provide a monthly
portrait of the level of earnings, the number of jobs and
hours worked by detailed industry at the national,
provincial and territorial level.  Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates
from its monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a
household survey whose main objective is to divide the
working-age population into three mutually exclusive
groups: the employed (including the self-employed),
unemployed and not in the labour force. This survey is the
official source for the  unemployment rate  and collects
data on the socio-demographic characteristics of all those
in the labour market.  As a result of conceptual and methodological
differences, estimates of changes from SEPH and LFS do
differ from time to time. However, the trends in the data
are quite similar.  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and
salaried employees, as well as the "other employees"
category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only
employees.  Average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried
employees only and exclude businesses that could not be
classified to a North American Industry Classification
System code.  All earnings data include overtime pay and exclude
businesses that could not be classified to a North
American Industry Classification System code.  Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total
weekly earnings by the number of employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
