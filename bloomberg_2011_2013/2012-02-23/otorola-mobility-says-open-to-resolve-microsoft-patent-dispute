Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)  said
it is open to resolving its patent-licensing dispute with
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  in a “mutually beneficial manner” after
Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint with the European
Commission.  Microsoft’s filing, and a related blog post, were “simply
tactics in the patent battle that Microsoft initiated with
surprise infringement actions against Motorola Mobility in
October 2010,” Gemma Goatly, a spokeswoman for Motorola
Mobility, said in an e-mailed statement.  The European Commission said yesterday that it received
complaints from Microsoft concerning Motorola Mobility and
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  Microsoft said the actions were in response to
attempts by Motorola to block sales of personal computers and
game consoles that run its software.  Microsoft said Google, which is buying Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, was included
in the complaint because it hadn’t committed to change Motorola
Mobility’s policies.  “Microsoft has touted the value of patent licensing for
its own patents, but a fair resolution requires that Microsoft
also recognize the value of the Motorola Mobility patents it is
using,” Goatly said.  Motorola Mobility, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics Co. and
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  are involved in numerous patent lawsuits in  Europe  as
demand for smartphones and tablets soar.  Apple has filed a patent-licensing complaint against
Motorola Mobility with the European Commission. The commission
is also probing Samsung over whether it broke licensing
commitments.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
