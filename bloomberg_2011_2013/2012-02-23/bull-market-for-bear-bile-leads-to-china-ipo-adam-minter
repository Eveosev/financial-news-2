On Feb. 1, with little fanfare, the  China  Securities Regulatory Commission released a list of  217 companies  seeking approval to hold initial public offerings in the coming months. It included manufacturers, property developers and, if you looked hard enough, a firm primarily engaged in the business of  selling bile  extracted from the gallbladders of live bears. Bear bile has been used in  traditional Chinese medicine  for centuries to treat a range of ailments including pain, fever and inflammation, the treatment of gall stones and vision problems. But  farming bears  for their bile  is an unconscionably cruel act, long  derided by activists in and outside of China. While China’s stock analysts and business journalists largely ignored the list of companies seeking IPOs, China's animal rights activists were paying close attention. In January 2011,  Guizhentang Pharmaceutical , the company in question, had applied to hold an IPO but the activists incited such  public outrage  over their treatment of 470 bears, that they withdrew their application. This month, the activists again highlighted the company 's animal abuse, sparking a clash between traditional Chinese values, and modern mores. The battle lines are clear, and not completely unfamiliar to Westerners accustomed to debates over product testing on animals. On one side are the unwavering animal rights defenders, well represented by China’s burgeoning throngs of pet owners. “Humans gain bear bile but lose their consciences,”  wrote Lin Zhen , a senior manager at a Chinese video sharing site, via Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog. “Stop all the cruelties.” On the other side are the defenders of China’s traditional pharmaceutical and culinary cultures (often, one and the same). For example, there is Lai Qinghui, a well-known blogger and moderator of the Sina portal’s "Women’s Forum," who  expressed her distaste  for her opponents in biting, personal terms: Alas, outside of synthetic substitutes, the Asiatic black bear is the sole source for bear bile in China and up until the mid-1980s, they were slaughtered for it. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, some  enterprising North Koreans  took this as a serious problem worth solving and developed a technique to “farm” bear bile in captivity. The method was crude but effective:  run a tube into a bear's gall bladder and extract when necessary. In the 1990s, the Chinese government banned this method and then stood by as the industry replaced it with a so-called “painless” method:  surgically cut a channel into a bear’s gut and access it when the bile is  ready to be harvested . It is, in effect, a permanent wound maintained for the purpose of bodily fluid extraction. Painless or not, and much to the horror of activists and many Chinese animal lovers, it is the method used in 68 bear farms with  6,000 to 8,000 bile-producing bears  across China -- including the 470 bears at Guizhentang Pharmaceutical's farm. For the last two weeks, graphic and  disturbing videos  of bear bile extraction have circulated on the Chinese internet. What likely makes those images palatable to Guizhentang's leaders and their shareholders are the profits: According to Chinese news reports, bear bile can be worth as much  RMB 4000 (or $635)  per kilogram. There are no quantifiable numbers on either the total value of the market or the number of consumers who demand it. But the Qilu Evening News, a large circulation paper in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, alluded to the speculatively large market for bear bile in a thoughtful editorial published Feb. 21. It  read : According to  China Daily , if Guizhentang manages to go public, it will use the proceeds to upgrade its farm to allow for a total of 1200 bears -- more than three times the current amount -- to extract around  4,000 kg of bile per year . That assumes a whole lot of demand for bear bile. But even with such strong demand, Guizhentang could not, and should not, be surprised by the negative reaction to its IPO application. Since its first attempt to go public in January 2011, the number of Chinese microbloggers  has multiplied ; the mainstream media often follow their lead. On Feb. 16, Fang Shuting, director of the Chinese Association for Traditional Chinese Medicine, defended Guizhentang -– with disastrous results for both parties. He  told  a press conference: The backlash was instant. Seventy-two Chinese celebrities signed  a petition  asking that Guizhentang’s application for an IPO be denied. Then, on Feb. 21, one of the signees, Zhou Guoping, a distinguished Chinese philosopher with more than 2 million followers on Sina Weibo,  tweeted his disgust : Zhou’s tweet has been re-tweeted (or, in Weibo terms, forwarded) over 800 times. But it is by no means the consensus among celebrity Weibo users, much less netizens. To be sure, the majority of online sentiment stands against Guizhentang. But some of the most thoughtful and cutting discussions on this subject come from the other side:  individuals who point out that Western medicine, too, harvests medical products from animals. Xin Yan, a doctor affiliated with  Guang’anmen Hospital , perhaps China’s leading institution for the practice and teaching of traditional Chinese medicine, argued this on Sina Weibo: Dr. Xin’s last point -– that the manner in which humans cultivate food is equivalent to the cultivation of bear bile -– has been embraced by many netizens, but none quite with the vigor of novelist and online provocateur, Xia Shang. Echoing the angry sentiments of many who may not patronize bile farmers, but still reserve the right to use nature as they see fit, he  tweeted : Guizhentang is no doubt sympathetic to Xia’s point-of-view, but there is little chance that they’ll hire him to respond to the increasing number of reporters questioning the company’s plans and operations. That job, according to  Caijing , an independent business weekly, was recently given to one of China’s top crisis management public relations firms  that wisely advised Guizhentang to avoid showing off “depressed and disabled bears.” Rather, they should focus on “all the happy young bears.” As of Feb. 23, Guizhentang is still awaiting approval to move ahead with its IPO.
