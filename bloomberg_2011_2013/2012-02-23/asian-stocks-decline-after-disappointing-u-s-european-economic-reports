Most Asian  stocks  declined as sales
of previously owned homes in the U.S. trailed estimates and on
speculation  China ’s Premier Wen Jiabao will lower the target for
economic growth this year.  Datang International Power Generation Co., a mainland
utility, slid 1 percent in Hong Kong.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) 
dropped 3.1 percent in Seoul, leading technology stocks lower
after Hewlett-Packard Co. forecast profit that missed estimates.
Mazda Motor Corp. sank 6.8 percent after Japan’s least
profitable major carmaker said it plans to sell as much as 162.8
billion yen ($2 billion) in new shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.03 point, or less than
0.1 percent to 127.77 as of 7:27 p.m. in  Tokyo , with five stocks
sliding for every four that rose. The gauge has rallied the past
nine weeks, extending its longest streak of advances since
December 2005, on signs the  U.S. economy  is improving, bets
China will ease monetary policy and optimism  Europe  will contain
its debt crisis.  “We’re seeing a bit of profit-taking as investors are
looking for the next catalysts,” said  Angus Gluskie , who
oversees about $350 million as managing director at White Funds
Management in Sydney. “Investors are very skeptical about
whether a recovery can proceed without another hurdle jumping up
again. The austerity measures running through Europe are likely
to take the edge off growth.”  Japan Small Caps  Today’s decline in the Asia-Pacific gauge, which is priced
in dollars, was limited as the U.S. currency fell against most
major peers during the afternoon. A weaker greenback increases
the value of companies in the measure whose shares are priced in
other currencies. Shares on the index trade at  14.7 times 
estimated earnings, up from 12.6 times on Dec. 16, when the
rally began.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.4 percent. A gauge
of smaller companies on the Tokyo bourse’s second section rose
for a 28th straight day, the longest stretch of gains since
1961. NIS Group Co., a consumer lender, rose the most in the
measure, advancing 50 percent to 6 yen.  South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 1 percent and Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.2 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.3 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 0.8 percent as property and
financial stocks declined.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent in  New York 
yesterday as purchases of previously owned U.S. homes rose less
than forecast in January, a report from the National Association
of Realtors showed.  Datang, Anhui  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is expected to target growth of
less than 8 percent for the world’s second-biggest economy in
his report to the National People’s Congress on March 5,
according to 8 of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
government had an 8 percent goal from 2005 to 2011.  Datang International Power slid 1 percent to HK$2.88 in
Hong Kong, while  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) , China’s biggest
producer of the material, slid 2.1 percent to HK$27.40.  Lonking Holdings Ltd. (3339)  slumped 12 percent to HK$3 after the
maker of construction equipment said earnings probably fell in
2011 due to rising operating costs.  Of 4,902 companies in the  Asia-Pacific gauge  that reported
earnings since Jan. 9, more than half have missed analysts’
estimates. Profit has dropped 57 percent on average, compared
with a 4.7 percent gain for the companies on the S&P 500 that
have reported so far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Samsung Electronics slumped 3.1 percent to 1,160,000 won in
Seoul today. Technology stocks fell after Hewlett-Packard
yesterday forecast second-quarter profit that fell short of
estimates as consumers buy fewer personal computers.  Mazda, Neptune Orient  Mazda (7261)  fell 6.8 percent to 137 yen in Tokyo. The company
said it plans to raise shares and take out a loan after
forecasting its biggest annual loss in 11 years.  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL) , a shipping company, slumped 5.6
percent to S$1.345 in Singapore after reporting a loss of $320.4
million for the quarter ended Dec. 30. It was expected to make a
loss of $123.6 million in the period based on the average of
eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose,  OneSteel Ltd. (OST) , an Australian
steelmaker, surged 21 percent to A$1.15 in Sydney, its steepest
gain on record. The company surged 58 percent in three days
after saying it’s switching focus to iron ore from its loss-
making steel unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
