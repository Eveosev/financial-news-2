An orderly resolution of the Greek
debt crisis “remains a key challenge,” and there is the “risk
of a subsequent debt restructuring,” following the pending
private-sector involvement deal, the  Institute of International
Finance  said in its Feb. Global Economic Monitor.  The IIF said its “main worries” about the global economic
outlook are “heavily centered on  Europe ,” with one of the main
issues being “uncertainty” about whether Greece’s government
will be able to stick to the European Union-International
Monetary Fund program, as well as the “growing domestic
unrest” in the country. There may be some prospects for a
recovery in Greece in the second half of 2012, the IIF said.  The IIF is also concerned that Portugal, which is at risk
of contagion from Greece, may miss its “very ambitious” fiscal
target for 2012. Spain’s “significant fiscal tightening into an
already weak economy” also presents concern, while  Italy ’s
ability to rollover its debt is a risk, the institute said.  Rising geopolitical risks in the  Middle East  “could
produce new oil price shock/supply disruption,” and Egypt is
facing challenges including a possible currency crisis, the IIF
said in the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
