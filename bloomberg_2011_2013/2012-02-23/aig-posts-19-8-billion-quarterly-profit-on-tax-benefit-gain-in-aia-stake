American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out insurer, said fourth-quarter profit jumped 77
percent, fueled by a tax benefit and an increase in the value of
a stake in Asian insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  The stock climbed after
operating profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Net income rose to $19.8 billion, or $10.43 a share, from
$11.2 billion, or $16.60, a year earlier, when the insurer
booked gains from the sale of businesses, according to a
statement today from the New York-based company. Operating
income, which excludes some investment results and the tax
figure, was 82 cents a share, beating the 59-cent  average
estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 67, has asked
potential investors to focus on property-casualty and life units
as he seeks private funds to replace the U.S. Treasury
Department’s majority stake. The insurer’s results have been
affected by swings in the value of mortgage investments and
shares of Hong Kong-based AIA, which  climbed 8.7 percent  in the
fourth quarter. AIG posted a $4.11 billion loss in three months
ended Sept. 30.  The volatility “is something we should expect from AIG for
a couple of years until they can divest” or wind down some of
these assets, Paul Newsome, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP, said in an interview before today’s announcement.
“The results will swing back-and-forth.” Newsome has a
“hold” rating on the stock.  Book Value  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose to $55.33 on Dec. 31 from $45.30 three months
earlier, on the tax benefit. The stock advanced 6.4 percent to
$29.77 in extended trading at 5:52 p.m. in  New York .  The insurer climbed 21 percent this year on the New York
Stock Exchange, after slumping 52 percent in 2011. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index has jumped 8.4 percent since Dec. 31 and was
little changed in 2011.  AIG posted a tax benefit of about $17.7 billion. Losses at
the insurer and its subsidiaries helped rack up more than $25
billion in deferred tax assets at the end of 2010 that can be
used to lower obligations to the government. By booking the tax
benefit, AIG is calculating it will be profitable enough to use
the assets.  Benmosche’s Confidence  “We have a high degree of confidence in our future
earnings prospects, which is a critical element in our
assessment supporting the release of the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance,” Benmosche said in the statement.  Full-year net income of $17.8 billion compares with a $7.8
billion profit in 2010, when the company posted gains on the
sale of American Life Insurance Co., two-thirds of AIA and other
assets.  Results included a mark-to-market gain on AIA of about $1
billion. AIG retained a stake in the Asian insurer after a 2010
initial public offering of the unit to raise funds to help pay
back the U.S. rescue.  Chartis, AIG’s property-casualty division, had operating
income of $348 million, compared with a loss of $3.97 billion a
year earlier. Benmosche named  Peter Hancock  to lead the unit in
March after it took charges of more than $4 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2010 tied to a reserve shortfall.  The unit spent $1.07 for every premium dollar on claims and
expenses, compared with spending $1.61 a year earlier. Flooding
in  Thailand  fueled a surge in catastrophe costs to $467 million
in the last three months of 2011, compared with $203 million a
year earlier. Sales at Chartis, which insures commercial
property, corporate boards and planes, rose 3.6 percent to $7.85
billion.  Life Insurance  AIG’s U.S. life insurance and retirement services unit
posted operating income of $931 million, compared with a $1.04
billion profit a year earlier, as investment income slipped.  Overall, net investment income fell 16 percent to $4.59
billion on a slump in private-equity and hedge fund holdings.
So-called  alternative investments  generated an $86 million loss,
compared with a $650 million profit a year earlier.  Buyout funds earned $10 million and hedge funds lost $96
million in the quarter. AIG had $18.8 billion in alternative
funds at the end of last year, compared with  $20.1 billion  on
Sept. 30.  AIG’s mortgage insurer, United Guaranty, reported an
operating loss of $23 million in the fourth quarter, compared
with operating income of $154 million a year earlier. AIG said
this week that Eric Martinez was becoming vice president of
global claims, operations and systems at Chartis after serving
as CEO of United Guaranty. Kim Garland was named new CEO of the
mortgage guarantor.  Plane Leasing  The plane business, International Lease Finance Corp.,
swung to an operating profit of $119 million from a loss of $606
million a year earlier when the business recorded higher
impairment charges. AIG said in September that it plans to sell
more than 20 percent of the subsidiary in an initial public
offering and divest most of the unit over time.  AIG had about 57,000  employees  at the end of 2011, down
from 63,000 a year earlier. Benmosche sold Japan life insurance
units in 2011 to Prudential Financial Inc.  The Treasury reduced its ownership of AIG in May by selling
200 million shares for $29 each in a public offering. The
government needs to divest its stake for an average of at least
$28.72 a share to recoup its investment.  AIG was rescued in 2008 as bets on the mortgage market
soured. The bailout was revised at least four times, swelling to
$182.3 billion as the U.S. extended more credit and lowered the
interest charged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
