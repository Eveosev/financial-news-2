BG Group Plc (BG/)  plans to sell half of
its 40 percent interest in the Quintero liquefied natural gas
plant on Chile’s central coast as it focuses on developing
natural-gas fields in the U.K. and Brazil.  BG, based in Reading, U.K., plans to keep 20 percent of the
plant and will consider an expansion with other shareholders
that include state-owned oil refiner Empresa Nacional del
Petroleo, Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA and Metrogas SA,
country head Diego Hollweck said in a telephone interview today.  BG may sell as much as $5 billion in assets around the
world as the company invests in oil and gas fields in Brazil,
the  North Sea  and Australia, the company said in a Feb. 9
statement.  The plan to divest the  Chile  stake mirrors the company’s
efforts to sell stakes in plants in countries such as India and
the  Philippines , Hollweck said. “Quintero is still an
outstanding investment.”  The divesture will not affect a supply contract that BG
owns to sell LNG to Chile, Hollweck said. Chile, the world’s
largest copper producer, imports more than 90 percent of its
fossil fuel needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
