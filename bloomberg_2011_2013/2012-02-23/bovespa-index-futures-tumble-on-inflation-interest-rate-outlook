Bovespa-index futures fell after a
report that showed Brazilian consumer prices rose more than
forecast this month prompted traders to pare bets for lower
borrowing costs, dimming the outlook for companies that depend
on domestic demand.  Vehicle-parts maker  Iochpe-Maxion SA (MYPK3)  may be active after
Credit Suisse Group AG cut its recommendation to “neutral”
from “outperform.” Retailers  Marisa Lojas SA (AMAR3)  and  Cia. Hering (HGTX3) 
may move after each was rated “overweight” in new coverage at
 Barclays Capital .  Bovespa futures dropped 0.3 percent to 66,745 at 10:22 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7007 per
 U.S. dollar .  Consumer prices as measured by the IPC-S index rose 0.27
percent in the 30 days through yesterday, from 0.30 percent in
the previous period, according to a report today from the Rio de
Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation. Inflation was expected
to slow to 0.22 percent, the median estimate of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The equity market has benefited from bets for lower
 interest rates  in the past few weeks, but now there seems to be
a correction following the IPC-S report,”  Luciano Rostagno ,
chief strategist with Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, said by phone
from Sao Paulo.  Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures advanced after
the report was released. The yield on the contract due in
January 2013 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
9.22 percent.  Relative Value  The Bovespa has advanced 16 percent this year, after
slumping 18 percent in 2011, buoyed by Brazil’s interest-rate
cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and renewed optimism  Europe 
may be closer to solving its debt crisis. The gauge trades at
10.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates, compared with a 10.7
ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders moved 5.29 billion reais ($3.11 billion) in stocks
in  Sao Paulo  yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a daily average of 6.97 billion reais this year
through Feb. 13, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
