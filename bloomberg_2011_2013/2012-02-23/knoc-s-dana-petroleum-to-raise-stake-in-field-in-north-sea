Dana Petroleum Plc (DNX) , the U.K.
explorer acquired by  Korea National Oil Corp (KNOCPZ) . in 2010, plans to
raise its stake in a  North Sea  oilfield, increasing its
production from the area by more than seven times.  The Aberdeen, U.K.-based company signed an agreement to buy
a 28.3 percent stake in the Bittern field from  Hess Corp. (HES)  of the
U.S. for an undisclosed price, the company known as  KNOC (KNOCPZ)  said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The purchase will enable Dana to increase production to
6,406 barrels of oil a day, from 906 now, and own a 33 percent
stake in the Bittern field, according to the statement.  Royal 
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns the biggest share with 39.6 percent.  Dana will also take over the ownership of the Triton
floating production, storage and offloading vessel, which serves
five fields, from Hess, according to the statement. That
transaction is subject to approval from the U.K. government and
partner companies.  South Korea , which imports almost all of its oil and
natural gas needs, plans to increase production at overseas
fields to 35 percent of imports by 2020.  Output from overseas assets reached 465,000 barrels a day
of oil equivalent last year, or 13.7 percent of the country’s
oil and gas imports, according to Korean government data. South
Korea aims to produce a further 170,000 barrels a day this year.
Anyang, South Korea-based KNOC is controlled by the South Korean
government. The company said it didn’t retain an adviser for the
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
