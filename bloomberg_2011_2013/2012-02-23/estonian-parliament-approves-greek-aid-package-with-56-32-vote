Estonian lawmakers approved a second
euro-area bailout package for  Greece  that’s vital to staving off
a default next month.  Lawmakers voted 56-32 in the capital, Tallinn, today
following two extraordinary sessions to discuss the
resolution.After weeks of wrangling, Greece reached an agreement
with its private creditors, paving the way for an accord with
other European governments on a 130 billion-euro ($174 billion)
bailout.  “The alternative to the organized solution backed by the
bailout would be bigger instability in Greece and the whole euro
area, especially in other countries with high debt, but it
wouldn’t leave  Estonia  untouched,” Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said before the vote. “By helping Greece, Estonia is
backing the stabilization of the euro area and our economic
environment.”  Investors will forgive 53.5 percent of their principal and
exchange their remaining holdings for new Greek  government bonds 
and notes from the European Financial Stability Facility,
helping to reduce Greece’s debt burden by 107 billion euros,
about half the country’s estimated output for 2011.  Estonian lawmakers last September approved the newest euro-
area member joining the temporary European Financial Stability
Facility, in which Estonia committed to guarantee 2 billion
euros or 0.27 percent of the fund’s capacity. The Baltic nation
backs an early start to  Europe ’s permanent crisis management
facility, or the European Stability Mechanism, where its
contribution would be 0.186 percent of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
