Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , the world’s
second-biggest oil-rig builder, reported its third quarterly
profit decline as it constructed more lower-priced rigs won
after the global credit crisis.  Net income  in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 dropped 4.3
percent to S$229 million ($182 million) from S$239.4 million a
year earlier, Sembcorp Marine said in a statement to the
Singapore stock exchange today. That exceeded the S$193.7
million average of 10  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales rose to S$997.6 million from S$982.9 million.  Sembcorp Marine is set to have its biggest orderbook since
2008 as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  invest
more for explorations and drilling to increase productions. The
company is building new yards in  Singapore  and Brazil to tap
that demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
