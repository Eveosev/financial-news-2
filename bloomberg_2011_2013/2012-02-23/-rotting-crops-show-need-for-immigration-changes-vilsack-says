Changes in immigration laws are
needed to ensure adequate levels of farm labor and prevent crops
from “rotting” in fields, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom
Vilsack said.  “The sad reality is that crops will be raised in this
country this year that may not be harvested because there simply
is not the workforce,” Vilsack said today at a conference in
Arlington, Virginia. “All of America, but especially farm
country, needs comprehensive immigration reform, and we need it
now.”  Vilsack called on Congress to have the “political
courage” to fix the system, which he said leaves farmers with
too few workers for the amount of acreage to be harvested.  “There’s a risk of rotting crops, and with that risk,
there’s no excuse for the efforts of some seeking to demonize
immigrant labor or prevent meaningful reform of a system that
everyone in the Congress and in the country admits is not
functioning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
