India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day as exchange data showed foreign investors stepped up
purchases of the nation’s bonds.  The Securities & Exchange Board of India auctioned $5
billion of corporate debt-purchase quotas on Nov. 30 to
foreigners, who must utilize the allocations by Feb. 28 or let
them expire. Overseas funds lifted  holdings  of rupee-denominated
notes by $98 million in the first two days of this week,
following last week’s net sales of $275 million, according to
data from the Securities & Exchange Board of India.  The rupee is “taking support from foreign investors’
buying,” Pramit Brahmbhatt, chief executive officer at the
Indian unit of Alpari Financial Services, wrote in an e-mail
today. “Oil importers restricted the rupee’s gain.”  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 49.20 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s  trade deficit  averaged $15.3 billion a month
in the last quarter of 2011, up from $11.8 billion in the
preceding period, as overseas purchases exceeded sales,
government data show.  Three-month onshore rupee forward contracts traded at 50.22
a dollar, compared with 50.24 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 50.24 from 50.29. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
