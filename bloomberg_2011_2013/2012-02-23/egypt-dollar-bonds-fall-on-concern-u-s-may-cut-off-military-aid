Egypt ’s 2020 dollar bonds fell,
pushing the yield up the most in a week, after the U.S. said it
may cut off military aid if the North African nation prosecutes
American workers in non-governmental organizations.  The yield on the nation’s 5.75 percent notes advanced five
basis points, or 0.05 of a percentage point, to 7.29 percent at
12:52 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gain on a closing basis since Feb. 16.  A criminal trial is scheduled to begin in Egypt Feb. 26 for
43 workers, including a group of Americans, accused of illegally
accepting payments from abroad. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration may be compelled to block $1.3 billion in
military aid to Egypt if it prosecutes the U.S. workers,  Andrew
Shapiro , assistant secretary of state for political-military
affairs, said yesterday.  “The drop in the dollar bonds is an initial reaction to
the news but we expect this issue to be resolved soon,”  Alia Mamdouh , Cairo-based economist at investment bank CI Capital,
said by telephone. “The government isn’t likely to ruin
relations with the U.S. because of the NGO issue and the U.S.
will not want to jeopardize that relationship either.”  The country, trying to curb borrowing costs, sold more  six-
month  treasury bills than it sought at an auction today,
accepting bids for 4.5 billion pounds ($745 million) at an
average yield of 14.923 percent, up from 14.918 percent at last
week’s sale, according to  Central Bank  of Egypt data on
Bloomberg. It was targeting 3 billion pounds.  Devaluation Concern  It also sold 2.5 billion pounds in  one-year notes , less
than the 4 billion pounds it sought, at a yield of 15.965
percent, unchanged from last week. The yield rose for 16
straight auctions to a record high before declining one basis
point last week.  Egypt’s  foreign reserves  fell for the 13th month in January
to $16.4 billion, the lowest level since December 2004. The drop
was mainly due to the payment of $651 million of external debt
to foreign creditors and $625 million was “repatriated by
foreign investors” after their holdings of treasury bills
matured, the bank said this month.  “The biggest concern for foreign investors is devaluation
so we expect them to stay out of the local  debt market  and for
yields to continue to rise,” Mamdouh said. “Of the economic
and social problems Egypt is facing, nothing has been resolved
in the past year.”  The pound, which weakened 3.8 percent against the dollar in
2011, was little changed at 6.0371 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
