Microsoft Corp. will invest an extra
$130 million to expand its data centre in Dublin as demand
increases for its “cloud” services such as Office 365, Windows
Live and  Xbox Live .  “We are continuing to build new infrastructure and
services in order to meet current and future demands,” Stephen
McGibbon, chief technology officer, Microsoft EMEA, said in the
statement.  Microsoft made an initial investment of $500 million in the
Dublin data centre, which has been operational since 2009, and
the expansion will add a 112,000 square feet (10,405 square
meters) facility to the centre, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
