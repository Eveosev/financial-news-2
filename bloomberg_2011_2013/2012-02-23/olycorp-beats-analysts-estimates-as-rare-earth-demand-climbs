Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , owner of the largest
rare-earth deposit outside China, reported fourth-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates after falling prices for
the metallic elements boosted demand.  Net income was $26.6 million, or 26 cents a share. Net
income excluding one-time items was 41 cents, beating by 1 cent
the average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A
year earlier, the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based company
posted a loss of 7.9 million, or 10 cents a share. Sales were
132.9 million up from $21.7 million a year earlier, Molycorp
said today in a statement.  “I still think customers are willing to pay for a supply
outside of China, especially one that’s pretty much
guaranteed,” said Jonathan Hykawy, an analyst with Byron
 Capital Markets  in Toronto.  The average price of lanthanum oxide, a rare-earth element
used in rechargeable batteries and refining catalysts fell 15
percent from the previous quarter to 129,167 yuan ($20,515) a
ton, according to data from Shanghai Steelhome. Neodymium, used
in high-strength magnets and batteries, fell 31 percent to
914,917 yuan.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
