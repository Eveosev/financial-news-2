Unused money from  Greece ’s first
bailout in 2010 will be transferred to the country’s second
rescue package to create a 165 billion euro ($219 billion)
financial war chest, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  About 35 billion euros remain from the May 2010 rescue
package, the newspaper reported, citing calculations of
 Germany ’s opposition Social Democratic Party.  European Union officials earlier indicated that the money
would be used to bolster the temporary euro-area wide rescue
fund and not shifted to Greece’s second aid package, the
newspaper cited SPD budget spokesman Carsten Schneider as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
