Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
Turkey’s biggest mobile phone operator, forecast that sales will
increase in 2012 by as much as 7.8 percent to a range of 9.9
billion liras ($5.6 million) to 10.1 billion liras from 9.37
billion liras last year.  The prediction compares will the average  estimate  of 9.99
billion liras of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Istanbul-based company had 34.5 million subscribers at the end
of December, up from 33.9 million in the previous quarter, it
said in a statement yesterday.  Turkcell has adjusted tariffs and has said it’s looking for
acquisitions in other countries as it faces competition at home
from  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,
majority owned by  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS. (TTKOM)  Turkcell aims to
post consolidated Ebitda of between 3 billion lira and 3.2
billion lira in 2012, compared with 2.91 billion liras last
year, the company said today.  “When we look at the projected quarterly trend for 2012,
we estimate the first quarter to be the lowest in terms of
profitability,” Turkcell said in the statement “This is due to
necessary investments to position ourselves strongly against the
competition,” the company said.  Turkcell, owned by  Teliasonera AB (TLSN) , Altimo of  Russia  and
Istanbul-based Cukurova Holding AS, said it expects  capital
investment  this year, as a percentage of revenues, to be at
around 17 percent, similar to the previous year.  In the fourth quarter, average monthly revenue per user
rose 4.2 percent to 19.7 liras from a year earlier, Turkcell
said in the statement.  Net income fell to 331.7 million liras in the quarter from
368.1 million liras a year earlier. Turkcell said on Feb. 17
that it expected profit at 330 million liras after an accounting
change for its Belarus division to reflect inflation.  Vodafone had 18 million users in  Turkey  at the end of
December after adding 1.3 million users in a year while Avea
gained 1.1 million for a total of 12.8 million.  “Following a tough, but successful year for us, I am
confident that we will give pace to our growth momentum in the
year 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Sureyya Ciliv said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
