The  U.S. economy  is “gradually
building immunity” from the kind of surge in gasoline prices
seen this year, according to Steven Wieting, Citigroup Inc.’s
managing director of economic and market analysis.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, spending on gasoline and
other motor fuels fell 10 percent from a peak in 2005 through
the end of last year. The drop is based on a 12-month moving
average of data compiled by the Commerce Department.  The chart also displays the average monthly retail price
nationwide for gasoline, as compiled by the Labor Department.
The pump price climbed 7.5 percent this year through Feb. 21,
according to data from the American Automobile Association.  Crude oil rose 7.3 percent for the year through yesterday
in New York futures trading, and gasoline advanced 15 percent.
Consumers will have to spend another $25 billion to fuel their
cars and trucks this year if higher prices stick, Wieting wrote
two days ago in a report. When the year started, he was looking
for a decline of $15 billion.  Increased  capital spending  on energy-related products will
lessen the economic effect of the reversal, the New York-based
economist wrote. Industry outlays rose $34 billion last year and
may climb even more this year, the report said.  “This combination suggests only very modest changes to the
U.S. growth and inflation outlook” from the energy-price
swings, Wieting wrote. He added that crude and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index track each other closely enough to indicate
higher  oil prices  may add to stock investors’ wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
