Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , facing an April
deadline to repay debt, plans to almost double the maximum
number of shares it can issue as the Japanese chipmaker searches
for a partner to help finance its business.  The company will raise the allowance to 803 million shares
from 403 million, subject to approval at an extraordinary
shareholders meeting March 28, Elpida said in a statement today.
It will also transfer 150 billion yen ($1.9 billion) in capital
to “other capital surpluses” to enable buybacks of preferred
shares, it said in a separate  statement .  “We are taking account of possible investments from
strategic partners, customers and vendors as we hold various
talks with them,” the Tokyo-based company said in an e-mail.
The capital transfer won’t effect net assets, Elpida said.  Elpida said Feb. 14 it wasn’t able to reach a deal with
 Japan ’s government and its main lenders to get financing. The
chipmaker’s ability to repay the 92 billion yen in  bonds  and
loans by the deadline has been eroded by slumping chip prices
and five straight quarters of losses.  Elpida is Japan’s biggest maker of dynamic random access
memory, the most common chip used in computers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
