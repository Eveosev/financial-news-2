China Three Gorges Corp. Chairman
Cao Guangjing said he does not believe the  Portuguese government 
will change the existing framework that supports renewable
energy in the country, Diario Economico reported.  The government made a commitment to maintain the stability
of the contracts that support renewable energy, the Portuguese
newspaper said, citing the Three Gorges Chairman.  The Portuguese government in December said it agreed to
sell a 21 percent stake in electricity company EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA to Three Gorges.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
