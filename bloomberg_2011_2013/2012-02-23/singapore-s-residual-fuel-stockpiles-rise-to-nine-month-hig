Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 10.4 percent to the highest in nine months, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen rose 2.04 million barrels in the
week to yesterday to 21.74 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
highest since the seven days ended May 18.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene were up 681,000 barrels, or 6.3 percent, at
11.47 million, based on the ministry’s data. Supplies increased
for a fourth week to the highest since Oct. 19.  Light-distillate (SPIVLDIS)  inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate gained 700,000 barrels, or 6.6 percent, to 11.25
million.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
