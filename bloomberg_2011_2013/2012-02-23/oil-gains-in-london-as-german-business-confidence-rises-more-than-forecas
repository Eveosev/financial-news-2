Crude oil advanced to its highest in
more than nine months in  London  after a German report showed
business confidence in Europeâ€™s biggest economy rose more than
economists had forecast.  Brent crude for April settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London gained as much as 79 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $123.69 a barrel, the highest price since May 3, and was at
$123.49 at 9:07 a.m. local time. Oil for April delivery on the
New York Mercantile Exchange was up 12 cents at $106.40, erasing
an earlier loss of 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
