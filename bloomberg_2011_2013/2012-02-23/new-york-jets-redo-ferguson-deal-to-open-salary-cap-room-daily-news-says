The  New York Jets  have freed $7.5
million in salary cap space for next season by reworking  Pro
Bowl  offensive lineman D’Brickashaw Ferguson’s contract, the 
New York Daily News  reported , citing an unidentified person.  The National Football League team converted $9 million of
Ferguson’s $9.99 million base salary this year into a signing
bonus, according to the newspaper. The cap value of the bonus
will be spread over the remainder of his contract, opening up
$7.5 million in cap space for the team heading into the 2012
season.  The Jets and Ferguson in July 2010 agreed on a six-year,
$60 million extension that will keep him under contract with the
team until 2017. Ferguson has started all 96 games for the Jets
since being selected with the fourth pick in the 2006  NFL Draft .
He was named to the Pro Bowl in each of the last three seasons.  New York had less than $500,000 in cap space before the
restructured deal, according to ESPN. Last year’s salary cap was
$120 million. The team finished 8-8 last season after reaching
the American Football Conference title game the previous two
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
