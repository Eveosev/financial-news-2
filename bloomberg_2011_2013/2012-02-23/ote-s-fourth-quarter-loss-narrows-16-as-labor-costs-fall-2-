Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) ,  Greece ’s biggest phone company, said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed 16 percent as the company lowered
payroll costs and revenue declined in Greece and Romania.  The company, which is 40 percent owned by  Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE) , said its net loss in the three months to Dec. 31 was 77.1
million euros ($103 million) compared with a 91.7 million-euro
loss in the same period a year earlier.  Sales fell 6.3 percent to 1.25 billion euros while earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization advanced
31 percent to 408.3 million euros, according to a faxed
statement from the Athens-based company  Fixed-line operations in Greece fell 8.5 percent while
Greek mobile operations dropped 5.9 percent. Fixed-line
operations in  Romania  dropped 4.4 percent. OTE, as the company
is known, also took an impairment charge of 253.2 million euros
on its Romanian operations.  ‘Tough Conditions’  “Throughout 2011, working under tough conditions, we made
significant progress in all priority areas we identified,”
Michael Tsamaz, chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. “The new labor agreement we have reached
provides security to our employees, while enabling the company
to secure the savings it needs.”  OTE cut the workforce by 356 in its Greek fixed-line
operations, by 1,728 at its RomTelecom unit and by 515 in its
mobile operations, according to the statement. The company’s
underlying net debt declined by almost 10 percent to 3.87
billion euros. Tsamaz said he is “confident” the company will
be able to meet future debt obligations, according to the
statement.  The company expects 2012 revenue to erode at the same rate
as in 2011 because the  Greek economy  is contracting for a fifth
year. A net capital gain from the sale of OTE’s 20 percent stake
in Telekom Serbia totaled 211 million euros and will be booked
in the first quarter of 2012.  “A weak domestic economy leaves little scope for optimism
despite cost-cutting efforts,” Paris Mantzavras, an analyst at
HSBC Pantelakis Securities, wrote in a note today. “More
importantly, we believe that macro-sovereign and debt
refinancing risks are likely to dominate debate for the stock in
the near term.”  Greece’s economy will contract by 4.4 percent in 2012 and
experience deflation as the consumer-price index falls, the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. The
country’s gross domestic product declined 6.8 percent last year
and 3.5 percent in 2010.  Shares in OTE rose 0.8 percent to 2.57 euros at 1:36 p.m.
in  Athens  after falling as much as 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
