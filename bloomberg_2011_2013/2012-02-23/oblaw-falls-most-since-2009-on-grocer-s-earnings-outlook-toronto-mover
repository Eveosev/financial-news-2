Loblaw Cos. (L) ,  Canada ’s biggest
grocer, fell the most in more than two years after the company
said earnings this year will fall from 2011 on higher costs for
technology.  Loblaw fell 5.8 percent to C$35.19 at 11:29 a.m. in Toronto
trading, the  largest drop  since July 7, 2009, after fourth-
quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates. Earlier, it fell as
much as 6.2 percent, its biggest decline in more than three
years.  Earnings per share for 2012 will be down from last year,
with more “pressure” in the first half, on increased spending
on technology, the Brampton, Ontario-based company said today in
a statement.  Loblaw said it plans to spend C$1.1 billion ($1.1 billion)
in the fiscal year, with 40 percent dedicated to  information
technology  and supply-chain projects.  Net income rose 5.5 percent to C$174 million, or 60 cents a
share, from C$165 million, or 58 cents. The company was forecast
to earn 66 cents a share, based on a Bloomberg survey of five
analysts.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
