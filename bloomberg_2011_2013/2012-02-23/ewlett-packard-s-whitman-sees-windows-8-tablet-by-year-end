Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Chief Executive
Officer Meg Whitman said the company will release a tablet
computer based on Microsoft Corp.’s new version of its Windows
software before the end of the year.  Speaking at a Wall Street Journal conference in Menlo Park,
California, Whitman said the initial tablet will be based on
 Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s technology. It’s “not clear” when Windows 8, the
update to Microsoft’s operating system, will be released for
devices running chips based on  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  technology, she
said. Microsoft hasn’t given an official release date for
Windows 8.  Whitman also said Hewlett-Packard is investing in
developing talented executives, focusing on organic growth, and
getting back to “The HP Way,” company’s original principles.  The next CEO is likely to come from within Hewlett-Packard,
Whitman said.  “I will not feel like I’ve done a good job if my successor
is not an internal choice,” Whitman said.  Hewlett-Packard hired from inside its walls until 1999,
when it recruited Carly Fiorina from Lucent Technologies. All
three succeeding CEOs, Mark Hurd, Leo Apotheker and Whitman
herself, were also outside hires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
