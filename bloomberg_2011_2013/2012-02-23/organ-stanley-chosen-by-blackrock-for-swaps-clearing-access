Morgan Stanley (MS)  has been chosen as
one of the swaps clearing brokers for  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the
world’s largest money manager, ahead of new rules requiring most
trades to be processed by clearinghouses.  The largest users of swaps, which comprise the biggest part
of the $708 trillion over-the-counter derivative market, such as
BlackRock will be mandated to clear their trades under the Dodd-
Frank Act, the financial regulation overhaul passed by Congress
in 2010 in response to the credit crisis. Morgan Stanley clears
trades for customers at a clearinghouse owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME) ,
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Ltd., the bank
said in a statement today.  Money managers and  hedge funds  needs firms such as Morgan
Stanley to act as their broker to gain access to swaps
clearinghouses, whose members include only the world’s largest
banks.  “We believe that OTC clearing can help to reduce systemic
risk and serve as an important mechanism to manage and reduce
counterparty exposure for our clients,” Supurna VedBrat, co-
head of market structure and electronic trading at BlackRock,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
