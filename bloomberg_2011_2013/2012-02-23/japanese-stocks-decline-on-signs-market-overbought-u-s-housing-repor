     Feb. 23 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose for a second
day, with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average extending a six-month
high, as the yen’s drop to its lowest against the dollar since
July boosted the earnings outlook for exporters.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , the world’s top maker of game consoles, rose
4 percent.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  jumped 13 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised their stakes
in the chipmaker.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which forecast its biggest
annual loss in 11 years, slumped 6.8 percent after announcing
plans to sell as much as 162.8 billion yen ($2 billion) in new
shares.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 percent to 9,595.57 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo  after falling as much as 0.4 percent. The gauge
this week has traded at the highest level since Aug. 4 after
advancing 13 percent this year. The broader Topix Index added
0.5 percent to 829.35 today.  Japan  was the only major market to
rise in  Asia  except for  China .  “The yen continues to have a big impact on stocks,” said
Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer of RCM Japan Co. “A
weaker yen lifts sentiment, but investors remain cautious about
a possible rebound.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday as
purchases of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose less than
forecast, according to the National Association of Realtors.  Yen’s Decline  Exporters gained after the yen touched 80.40 against the
dollar yesterday, the lowest level since July 11. Nintendo
gained 4 percent to 12,300 yen. Canon, a camera maker that gets
80 percent of its sales abroad, rose 0.7 percent to 3,610 yen.  Elpida jumped 13 percent to 349 yen after regulatory
filings showed Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse each raised their
stakes in the memory-chip maker above 5 percent. The stock has
plunged 71 percent over the past 12 months amid speculation it
may go bankrupt.  Stocks gained even after the 25-day Toraku index, which
compares the number of advancing and declining equities on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, rose to 141 yesterday. The measure has
been above the 120 threshold that some investors take as a sign
shares may decline for eight days.  Mazda slumped 6.8 percent to 137 yen after saying it may
sell as much as 162.8 billion yen in new shares and borrow 70
billion yen as it braces for a 100 billion yen loss. The
carmaker is also at risk of a credit-rating downgrade.  Japan’s $250 billion in spending to rebuild after last
year’s record earthquake is helping drive the longest streak of
advances in more than 50 years for the country’s smaller stocks.  The  TSE Second Section Price Index (TSE2) , a measure of smaller
companies on the Tokyo bourse, rose today for a 28th day, its
longest series of gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
going back to 1961. The gauge added 1.4 percent to 2,361.21,
bringing the value of stocks in the measure to 0.7 times book
value, compared with 1.2 times for the Topix.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  climbed 0.7 percent to
21.36, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after

billion yen, citing cost cuts and a reversal of deferred tax
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
