Lithuanian  economic growth  may slow
more than previously estimated as decelerating growth in export
markets curbs demand for the country’s products and domestic
consumption wanes.  Gross domestic product will probably expand 2.2 percent
this year, compared with a November forecast of 3.5 percent, the
Vilnius-based  Lietuvos Bankas  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economic growth may accelerate to 3.3 percent in 2013, it
said.  The Baltic nation’s economy is slowing from the second-
fastest pace in the European Union of 4.3 percent in the fourth
quarter as the euro region’s debt crisis damps demand for the
country’s goods. The economy grew 5.8 percent in 2011.  “Lower economic growth is projected in the main trade
partners of  Lithuania , whereas confidence indicators in
Lithuania and foreign countries are also deteriorating in the
context of uncertainty related to indebtedness problems in some
euro-area countries,” the central bank said. “Such a situation
damps the expectations of Lithuanian households and enterprises,
limits investment plans of enterprises, constrains employment
growth and strengthens household saving.”  The  Finance Ministry  estimates the economy may grow 2.5
percent this year.  The central bank cut the  inflation rate  forecast for this
year was cut to 2.1 percent and set the 2013 rate estimate at
2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
