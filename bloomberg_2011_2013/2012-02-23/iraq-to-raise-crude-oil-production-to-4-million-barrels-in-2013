Iraq  plans to increase its
production of crude oil to 4 million barrels a day in 2013, an
oil ministry spokesman told state-run Iraqiya television.  “Iraq is on its way to reaching production capacity of 12
million barrels of crude oil a day but will not necessarily
produce these quantities,” Assem Jihad said in an interview
with Iraqiya today. Iraq “will monitor international markets
and will pump oil without affecting” them, he said.  The Arab nation, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil
reserves, depends on sales of crude for most of the revenue it
needs to rebuild the economy after years of war, sabotage and
economic sanctions. The Persian Gulf state has awarded 15
licenses for drilling rights to foreign countries since the
U.S.-led invasion that ousted President  Saddam Hussein  in 2003.  Iraq plans to produce 3.4 million barrels a day this year
while exports will exceed 2.6 million barrels a day, Jihad said.
“Iraq will negotiate with OPEC to decide on the quota when
production reaches 4 million,” he said.  Iraq, which is the third-largest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumped 2.75
million barrels a day in January, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
