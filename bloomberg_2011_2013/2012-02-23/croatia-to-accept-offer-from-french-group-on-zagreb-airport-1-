Croatia  will accept an offer from a
French group led by  Aeroports de Paris  to build a new terminal
at the Zagreb international airport, Deputy Prime Minister
Radimir Cacic told reporters today.  The Paris-led group, called Zagreb Airport International
Co., will build Croatiaâ€™s main airport and pay 87 million euros
($115 million) in concession fees over 30 years, according to
Cacic. It will also have the right to operate the existing
terminal until a new facility is operational in 2015.  The new terminal will help boost tourism, which accounts
for about 20 percent of gross domestic product in the Adriatic
Sea nation. It may also provide a chance for Croatia to become a
regional hub in the western Balkans. Works will start by the end
of the year, Cacic said.  The first phase, during which a new terminal and runways
will be built, is estimated to cost 190 million euros. A further
29 million euros will be invested after passenger traffic
through the airport exceeds 5 million travelers, compared with
2.1 million in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
