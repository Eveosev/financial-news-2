Yale University Professor  Stephen
Roach  said the  U.S. economy  remains fragile because consumers
are struggling with a heavy debt burden.  “It’s pretty fragile,” Roach said on CNBC television from
New York today. “Debt is high, savings are very low.”  Roach, Morgan Stanley’s former chairman for Asia and chief
economist, said that a drop in  U.S. jobless claims  may be
sending a “false signal” and won’t necessarily power economic
growth.  The turn in the economy “has been glacial, the improvement
minimal,” he said. “It’s better than it has been but we’re
very far away from a normal vigorous recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
