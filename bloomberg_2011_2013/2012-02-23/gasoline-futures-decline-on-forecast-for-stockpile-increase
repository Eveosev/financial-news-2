Gasoline futures gained after the
Energy Department report showed stockpiles fell unexpectedly
last week and jobless claims held at a four-year low.  Futures advanced to a six-month high as the government said
 inventories  of gasoline declined 649,000 barrels to 231.5
million in the seven days ended Feb. 17. The median estimate of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 250,000-
barrel increase. Applications for  jobless benefits  were
unchanged in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, Labor Department
figures showed.  “Weekly jobless claims numbers are a very important input
for the gasoline prices,”  John Kilduff , a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy,
said by phone. “As the employment picture is improving, we
expect the gasoline demand to improve as well as people drive to
work.”  March-delivery gasoline rose 2.59 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$3.1136 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since July 28. Gasoline has advanced 16
percent in 2012.  Wholesale demand jumped 5.6 percent last week to 8.63
million barrels a day, department data show. That’s the highest
level since the week ended Dec. 23.  MasterCard Inc. said yesterday U.S. gasoline consumption
rose 3.4 percent last week to 8.28 million barrels a day. The
weekly SpendingPulse report showed demand increased from the
lowest level since it began collecting the data in 2004. Demand
was 6.4 percent below a year earlier.  Iran, Germany  Gasoline rose earlier along with crude oil on concern
tensions over  Iran’s nuclear program  may curb supply and as
German  business confidence  rose to a seven-month high in
February.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , the Turkish bank that handles
payments for Iranian oil, will stop processing transactions for
supplies into Turkish refineries from July amid tightening
Western sanctions against the Persian Gulf state.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) , which operates four
refineries, won’t be able to use the bank from the end of June
unless it gets a U.S. waiver, a Tupras official said today,
declining to be identified citing company policy.  Refiners are working to ensure supplies of crude to replace
Iranian oil. Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA,  Spain ’s second-
largest refiner, last week secured a guarantee for more crude
from the  United Arab Emirates  if Iranian exports are cut.  “There’s just no escaping the geopolitical influence and
the security premium from the  Iran  situation helping keep these
prices elevated,” Kilduff said.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 3.3
cents to $3.612 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  The government said heating oil and diesel  inventories  fell
208,000 barrels to 143.5 million in the week ended Feb. 17.
Analysts forecast a 1.5 million-barrel decrease, according to
the survey.  Heating oil for March delivery gained 2.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.2949 a gallon on the exchange, a 10-month high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
