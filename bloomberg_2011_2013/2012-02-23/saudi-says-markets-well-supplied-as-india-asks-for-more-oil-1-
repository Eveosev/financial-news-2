Oil markets are currently well
supplied,  Saudi Arabia ’s deputy oil minister said. India's 
junior oil minister said his country wants 5 million metric 
tons more oil from Saudi Arabia next year.  “The market is very much well supplied and there’s no need
for concern,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told reporters today
in  New Delhi . “We have demonstrated to our friends here how
much excess capacity there is today and how much capacity will
be there in the future.”  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil supplier, is
producing close to its record of about 10 million barrels a day
as consumers of  Iran ’s oil look elsewhere for supply amid
tightening U.S. and European sanctions. The kingdom is producing
9.8 million barrels a day, and has 2.5 million barrels a day of
spare capacity, Prince Abdulaziz said.  India  wants more Saudi oil to meet rising refinery capacity
in 2013, said R.P.N. Singh, the junior minister.  “Whatever the Indian companies’ requirements are, they can
approach Aramco,” Prince Abdulaziz said, referring to state-
owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. “We don’t interfere. It’s a
complete commercial decision.”  Saudi Arabia doesn’t “engage in any” discussions about
replacing Iranian oil, he said. “We have never associated
ourselves in any of those things. What we are concerned is to
keep the market well supplied. That has always been our
endeavor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
