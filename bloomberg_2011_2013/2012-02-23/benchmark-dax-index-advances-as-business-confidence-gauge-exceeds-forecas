German stocks  fell for a third day,
erasing earlier gains, as carmakers declined after the European
Commission forecast the region’s economy will shrink this year.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
slipped more than 1.5 percent.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  dropped 6.6
percent after Germany’s second-largest lender said it will ask
investors to swap hybrid capital instruments trading below face
value for new shares.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  slid 3 percent after
reporting a loss.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  retreated 0.5 percent to 6,809.46 at the
close of trading in Frankfurt, having earlier climbed as much as
0.9 percent. The measure has still rallied 15 percent this year
as U.S. economic data exceeded forecasts and the European
Central Bank took action to boost lending. The broader HDAX
benchmark also fell 0.5 percent today.  The euro-region economy will contract 0.3 percent in 2012,
the European Commission said, abandoning a November forecast of
0.5 percent growth. The downgrade was mainly due to projected
contractions of 1.3 percent in  Italy  and 1 percent in Spain.  In Germany, the Munich-based Ifo institute said its
 business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives,

predicted an increase to 108.8, according to the median of 38
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Labor Market  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for

showed today. The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey
called for 355,000 claims.  Volkswagen preferred shares fell 2.3 percent to 139.15

unveiling a plan to increase core Tier 1 capital by more than 1
billion euros ($1.33 billion) by buying back hybrid instruments
with new shares. The lender also booked a 700 million-euro
writedown on Greek debt in the fourth quarter.  Deutsche Telekom dropped 3 percent to 8.70 euros after
