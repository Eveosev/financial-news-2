(Corrects to show export data is for second half of fiscal
year and not full year in story published on Feb. 16)  Coffee exports from  Ethiopia ,
Africa’s second-biggest shipper of the beans, may rise at least
7 percent this year, the Ethiopian Coffee Exporters’ Association
said.  Exports are expected to be “no less” than 150,000 metric
tons in the six months through July 7, the second half of
Ethiopia’s fiscal year, Tesfaye Kenea, acting general manager of
the association, said in an interview today in the capital,
 Addis Ababa .  Shipments in the first half totalled about 60,000 tons,
35,000 tons less than the same period a year earlier, Tesfaye
said. Exports declined mainly because the crop was delayed for
two months by a “lengthy” rainy season and because “the New York
price is going down, but the Ethiopian price is not going down
proportionally,” Tesfaye said.  Arabica coffee for May delivery has fallen 12 percent so
far this year, and traded at $1.9920 a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
at 9:43 a.m. in  New York . Ethiopian buyers currently pay an
average of $1.9883 per pound, according to data from the
Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.  Ethiopia, Africa’s largest coffee producer, relies on the
beans to generate about a third of its foreign-currency
earnings. Exports of 196,119 tons brought in $841.7 million last
year, according to the country’s Trade Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
