Helical Bar Plc (HLCL)  and affiliates of
the Baupost Group LLC asked for planning permission to develop
shops, offices and more than 200 apartments near St.
Bartholomew’s hospital in the City of London financial district,
according to a legal notice published yesterday.  The companies bought the site in February 2011 for about 55
million pounds ($86 million) and will pay as much as 35 million
pounds more, depending on the planning approval and when the
property becomes available, they said in a statement at the
time.  Joint venture Barts Two Investment Ltd. plans to develop
230,000 square feet (21,000 square meters) of offices, 216
apartments and 24,000 square feet of shops and restaurants on
the site. The trust that operates  St Bart’s , Britain’s oldest
hospital, sold the land to Barts Two.  The plan will “create a brand new vibrant and dynamic City
destination,” Gerald Kaye, Helical Bar’s development director,
said at the time of the purchase.  Helical Bar owns one third of the joint venture and
Baupost’s affiliates hold the remainder.  To contact the reporters on this story:
