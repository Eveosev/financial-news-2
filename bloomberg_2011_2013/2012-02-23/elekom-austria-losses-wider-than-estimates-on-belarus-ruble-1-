Telekom  Austria  (TKA), the country’s
biggest network operator, reported a full-year loss four-times
greater than analyst estimates after hyperinflation in  Belarus 
erased profit.  The company reported a 252.8 million euro ($335.2 million)
net loss in 2011 on 4.5 billion-euro revenue, Vienna-based
 Telekom Austria (TKA)  said in a statement today. The company was
expected to report a 59.2 million-euro loss on sales of 4.4
billion euros, according to six analyst  estimates  collected by
Bloomberg.  “Severe macro-economic headwinds in most of its major
markets, fierce competition and further regulatory cuts of
roaming and interconnection tariffs,” drove a 4 percent revenue
decline from 2010, when Telekom Austria reported 4.7 billion
euros in sales, according to the statement.  The former Austrian monopoly, which operates mobile
networks in seven eastern European countries, has been cutting
workers in its home market to boost profitability. Egyptian
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  has been investing the company along
with private-equity investor Ronny Pecik. Together they own 20
percent of  Telekom Austria .  For 2012, the company forecast 4.4 billion-euro revenue and
1.5 billion euros of profit before interest, taxes, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for 2012,
it said.  Telekom Austria lost 321.5 million euros on 1.1 billion
euros of sales in the fourth quarter. That compares to a 273.7
million-euro loss, according to six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Belarusian hyperinflation and a 63 percent devaluation of
the ruble accounted for a 213.6 million-euro full-year loss,
Telekom Austria said in the statement. Staff reductions in
Austria led to a 233.7 million-euro charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
