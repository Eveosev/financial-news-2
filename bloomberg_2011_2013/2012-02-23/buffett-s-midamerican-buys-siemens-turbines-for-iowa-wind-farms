Warren Buffett ’s  MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co. (2454Q)  will buy an additional 407.1 megawatts of  Siemens
AG (SIE)  turbines for three wind farms in  Iowa , purchasing a total of
1 gigawatt in the past year.  MidAmerican, based in  Des Moines , Iowa, will buy 176 2.3-
megawatt capacity turbines for projects in Guthrie, Audubon and
Adair counties, Munich-based Siemens said in a statement today.
The turbines will power more than 120,000 homes once the project
is completed, Siemens said.  The order follows MidAmerican’s completion of 593.4
megawatts of wind projects in Iowa in 2011, according to the
statement. Turbines will be made at Siemens manufacturing
facilities in Fort Madison, Iowa, and Hutchinson, Kansas.  MidAmerican is a subsidiary of Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-
based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and bought the projects from a
developer last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
