Rates for  30-year (NMCMFUS)  U.S. mortgages
rose for the first time in four weeks as sales of previously
owned homes climbed to the highest level since May 2010.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan increased to 3.95
percent in the week ended today from 3.87 percent, the lowest in
records dating to 1971,  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The
average  15-year (NMCM15US)  rate rose to 3.19 percent from 3.16 percent,
according to the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance
company.  Low  mortgage rates  are helping to reduce the cost of
housing, supporting demand.  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of existing homes increased
4.3 percent to a 4.57 million annual rate in January, the
National Association of Realtors said yesterday. Distressed
deals -- encompassing foreclosures and short sales, in which the
price is less than the amount owed -- made up the largest share
of all purchases since April.  “The affordability is just very good right now,” George Mokrzan, director of economics at Huntington National Bank in
Columbus,  Ohio , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “I’m
more on the bullish side on housing.”  Home-loan applications decreased in the week ended Feb. 17,
the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association said
yesterday. The group’s measure of  purchase  loans dropped 2.9
percent, while its  refinancing  index fell 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
