German federal and state  tax revenue 
contracted slightly in January in net terms compared with a year
earlier, mirroring slower economic growth, the  Finance
Ministry ’s latest report showed.  Tax revenue grew 3.9 percent in nominal terms due to one-
time receipts that will have to be repaid later in the year, the
Berlin-based ministry said in its February report. In net terms,
revenue contracted by 0.4 percent compared with January 2011, it
said.  The trend established last year for tax revenue to grow
every month “has been broken,” the report said without being
more specific.  Europe ’s biggest economy is expected to grow 0.7 percent
this year, less than a quarter of the pace of 2011, according to
the government’s forecast. At the same time, unemployment is
expected to continue falling, boosting income-tax receipts.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s federal budget, passed into law
in December, forecasts tax revenue this year to match 2011
receipts of 248 billion euros ($328 billion). Total expenditure
is expected to grow by 0.6 percent to 306 billion euros compared
with last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
