Bayer AG (BAYN) ,  Germany ’s largest
drugmaker, proposed former Chief Executive Officer Werner
Wenning as chairman of the company’s supervisory board.  If Wenning, 65, is elected by the board as chairman at
Bayer’s April 27 annual shareholders’ meeting, he would succeed
current Chairman Manfred Schneider on Oct. 1, Leverkusen,
Germany-based Bayer said in an e-mailed statement today.
Wenning’s term would run until 2017, the company said.  Becoming chairman would mark Wenning’s return to Bayer, the
drugs and chemical company where he worked for more than 40
years and served as chief executive from April 2002 to September
2010. The statutory “cooling-off period” after which former
members of a German company’s management board can join the
supervisory board ends after two years, according to Bayer.
Wenning is currently chairman of EON AG, Germany’s largest
utility.  Bayer also nominated Sue Rataj, 55, member of the board of
directors of U.S. chemicals company  Cabot Corp. (CBT) , and Thomas Ebeling, 53, chief executive officer of ProSiebenSat.1 AG, as
supervisory board shareholder representatives.  Bayer also proposed a new compensation plan for the
supervisory board, in which the chairman would get a fixed
annual compensation of 360,000 euros ($480,000), the vice
chairman 240,000 euros, and each other member 120,000 euros as
well as additional payments for committee membership.  Bayer also wants members to make a “voluntary pledge to
purchase Bayer shares to the value of one quarter of their
compensation in order to enhance their interest in the company’s
long-term success,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
