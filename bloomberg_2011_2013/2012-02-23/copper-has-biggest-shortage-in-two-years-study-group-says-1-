Copper had the biggest shortage in
almost two years in November on imports into  China , the world’s
largest buyer, according to the International Copper Study Group.  Refined production lagged behind demand by 119,000 metric
tons, the most since 120,000 tons in March 2010, Ana Rebelo,
ICSG chief statistician, said by phone today from Lisbon.
China’s copper imports were “very low” in the first half of
last year and then rebounded in November and December, she said.  For the first 11 months of 2011, the shortage was 382,000
tons compared with 460,000 tons in the same period of 2010, the
ICSG said in a statement on its website today. Apparent world
usage rose 2.7 percent as mine output gained 0.1 percent, it
said. Apparent usage includes production, industry stockpiles
and exports and imports.  In October and November, world usage jumped 12 percent as
China’s apparent consumption climbed 38 percent, the ICSG said.
China’s net imports in October and November were 59 percent
higher than in the same period in 2010, the ICSG said. Demand in
the U.S. and European Union was “essentially unchanged” in the
first 11 months last year and fell 4 percent in  Japan  in the
same period, it said. Apparent usage jumped 64 percent in  Russia 
and 6 percent in  India , the ICSG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
