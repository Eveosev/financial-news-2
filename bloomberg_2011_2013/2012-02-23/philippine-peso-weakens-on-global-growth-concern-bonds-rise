The Philippine peso fell the most in
a week as data signaled global economic growth is slowing,
dimming the outlook for the nation’s exports. Bonds gained after
the government said it will end a sale of debt to individuals
ahead of schedule.  Preliminary purchasing managers’ indexes of manufacturing
in  China  and  Europe  released yesterday showed contractions ahead
of a Philippine interest-rate decision next week.  Oil prices ,
which reached a nine-month high yesterday, are also raising
concern inflation will accelerate.  “Global growth is going to be pretty weak, which means the
Philippine export sector isn’t going to look good,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
Singapore. “Coupled with uncomfortably high oil prices, these
developments aren’t positive for Asian currencies.’”  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 42.785 per dollar at the
close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.875 yesterday, the lowest level in almost a week.  China’s 49.7 PMI for February from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics compared with a final 48.8 in January. A euro-
area composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers in
manufacturing and services dropped to 49.7 from 50.4, according
to the initial estimate from London-based Markit Economics. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Retail Bonds  Crude reached $106.72 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the
highest level since May. Philippine exports shrank for an eighth
month in December, sliding 20.7 percent from a year earlier,
while inflation slowed to 3.9 percent in January, the least
since December 2010, official data showed this month.  The Philippines will end a sale of 20-year retail bonds
today and 15-year debt tomorrow, ahead of the proposed Feb. 29
deadline, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said in a mobile-
phone message today. The government has sold almost 100 billion
pesos ($2.3 billion) of the 20-year notes and 50 billion pesos
of 15-year securities, Mendiola said.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due
February 2032 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 5.75 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
