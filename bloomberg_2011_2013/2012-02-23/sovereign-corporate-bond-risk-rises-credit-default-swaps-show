The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, reversing an
earlier increase, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments eased 0.5 basis point to 349.5
at 8:58 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality ; a decline, the opposite.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 9.5 basis
points to 577.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was 1.5 basis point lower at
131.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell three basis points to 225 and the
subordinated index was six lower at 377.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
