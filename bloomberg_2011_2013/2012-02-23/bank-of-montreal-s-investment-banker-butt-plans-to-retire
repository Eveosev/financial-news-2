Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s investment
banking head, William Butt, is retiring after about 19 years
with the firm, a spokesman for the Toronto-based bank said.  Butt, 49, plans to step down April 1, according to an
internal bank memo confirmed by spokesman Paul Deegan.  Butt has been global head of investment and corporate
banking for Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit since
May 2008, overseeing underwriting, corporate lending and mergers
advisory, according to Bank of Montreal’s  website .  Previously, he was head of the Canadian and international
investment and corporate banking business, where he expanded the
firm into  China , Australia and India. He also spent two years as
head of the North American west coast operations, based in
 Vancouver .  Butt joined BMO Capital’s predecessor firm, Burns Fry, in
1993, Deegan said today. The Globe and Mail earlier reported
Butt’s retirement from Canada’s fourth-largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
