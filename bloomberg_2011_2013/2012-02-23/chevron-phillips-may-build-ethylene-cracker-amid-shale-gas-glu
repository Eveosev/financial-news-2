Chevron (CVX)  Phillips Chemical Co., a
joint venture of Chevron Corp. and  ConocoPhillips (COP) , is studying
whether to build an ethylene-cracking plant on the U.S. Gulf
Coast to process natural gas from shale fields.  The facility would “capitalize on advantaged feedstock
sourced from emerging shale-gas developments,” San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing today.  The chemical company initially announced the feasibility
study for a $5 billion cracker near Houston that would begin
operations in 2017. A surfeit of gas from U.S. shale formations
has pushed prices for the commodity to a 10-year low, prompting
companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc to pursue new cracker
developments from the Appalachians to Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
