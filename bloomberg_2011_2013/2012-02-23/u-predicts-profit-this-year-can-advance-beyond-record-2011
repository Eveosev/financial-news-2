MTU Aero Engines Holding AG, a
German aircraft-engine maker,  rose  to its highest ever, on a 7
percent increase in full-year profit and a report that it won’t
bid for a  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  unit.  The shares rose as much as 2.76 euros, or 5 percent, to
58.33 euros in early trading in Frankfurt, the biggest jump in 4
1/2 months. They traded at 57.90 euros at 10.30 a.m., the
highest since the company sold shares to the public in June
2005, giving MTU a market value of 3 billion euros ($4 billion).  MTU has withdrawn from bidding for Volvo’s aircraft-engine
unit, which didn’t meet its expectations in terms of returns,
the Financial Times Deutschland reported today, citing
unidentified people in the industry.  “Management in the past had said if anything, they’d be
interested in acquiring Volvo’s engine business, or Avio,” said
Stephan Klepp, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in  London . “Now
that Volvo seems no longer tangible, there is a bit of a relief
rally as some had feared MTU might overpay for an acquisition.”
Klepp recommends that clients “buy” MTU shares and sees them
rising to 65 euros within a year.  MTU said today that  net income , excluding some currency and
derivatives effects, rose to 196.6 million euros in 2011, with
sales rising 8.3 percent to a record 2.93 billion euros. Fourth-
quarter sales advanced 21 percent, the fastest pace since MTU
shares were listed. The company  forecast  a further profit
increase of as much as 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
