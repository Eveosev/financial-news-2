Oil options volatility declined
after crude rose to the highest level in more than nine months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30.2 as of 2 p.m. in New York, down from
30.7 yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery increased $1.58, or 1.5
percent, to $107.86 a barrel at 2:26 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after touching $107.94, the highest intraday
price since May 5.  “You’re seeing us break out of the range, but we’re doing
it at a slower pace here,” Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York, said by telephone. “As we
get to higher prices, $1 to $2 swings aren’t as volatile as when
we were at lower prices so you’re actually going to see the
volatility come in a little bit.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 puts. They fell 26 cents to 74 cents a barrel with
2,074 contracts trading as of 1:58 p.m. in New York. Next were
April $110 calls, which rose 45 cents to $2.09 a barrel on 1,968
lots. A contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts were 52
percent of the volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of the volume yesterday.
April $119 calls were the most actively traded options, with
9,684 lots changing hands. They fell 13 cents to 48 cents a
barrel. The next-most active options, April $110 calls, fell 11
cents to $1.64 a barrel on volume of 6,248 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,154
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,455 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,554.  To contact the reporter on this story:
