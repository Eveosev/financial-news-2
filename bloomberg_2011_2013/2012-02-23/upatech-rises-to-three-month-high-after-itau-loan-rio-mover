Lupatech SA , a Brazilian provider of
oil equipment and services, rose to the highest in more than
three months after its board approved a 15 million-real ($8.8
million) loan from  Banco Itau (ITUB4)  BBA SA.  Lupatech gained 0.8 percent to 6.48 reais in  Sao Paulo 
today, the highest since Nov. 18. The stock has gained 46
percent this year, compared with a 16 percent increase in the
benchmark Bovespa  index .  The increase follows an 8.6 percent gain yesterday after
Lupatech said an agreement to sell 700 million reais worth of
shares to investors in a private placement, which it originally
announced in December, will occur in about three weeks. The
Caxias do Sul, Brazil-based company is selling assets to meet
debt payments after posting losses every quarter since the
beginning of 2010.  The two-month Itau loan matures on April 17, Lupatech said
in a regulatory filing today.  Lupatech, which provides ropes and valves for oil
production, is expanding its business to exploration. It agreed
to buy oil driller  San Antonio  in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
