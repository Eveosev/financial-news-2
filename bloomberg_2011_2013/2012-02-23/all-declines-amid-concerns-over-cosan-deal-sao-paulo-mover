ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) 
dropped the most in more than three months on concerns that the
sale of a stake to  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio (CSAN3)  may make the
company focus on the transportation of agricultural products.  ALL declined 4.6 percent to 10.33 reais at 3:24 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, after earlier falling 5.7 percent, the most since Nov.
17. The Bovespa stock index dropped 0.3 percent.  Cosan agreed to pay 896.5 million reais ($523.8 million),
or 23 reais a share, for 5.67 percent of ALL, Latin America’s
largest railroad company, Sao Paulo-based Cosan said in a
statement on Feb 21. Cosan jointly controls the world’s largest
sugar-cane processor with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  “There is concern that with Cosan in management, ALL’s
trend would be to focus back on transportation of agricultural
products”,  Daniela Bretthauer , an analyst at Raymond James,
said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg News. She rates the
stock “market perform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
