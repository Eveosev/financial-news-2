Joseph Dever, a former assistant
regional director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
in  New York , joined Cozen O’Connor LLP in New York, the  law firm 
said.  Dever will head Cozen’s securities litigation and SEC
enforcement practice group, the Philadelphia-based firm said in
a statement. Dever, who supervised more than 100 investigations,
will focus on representing and counseling clients on government
probes and regulatory matters involving the SEC and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the firm said.  “Joe is one of the premier securities attorneys in the
country,” Jeffrey Weil, co-chair of Cozen’s litigation
department, said in today’s statement. “He has spent the past
eight years of his career enforcing U.S. securities laws and I
can’t think of anyone better to help our clients navigate those
complex regulations.”  Prior to joining the SEC, Dever spent six years as a
litigation associate at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP, according to
the statement. He earned his undergraduate degree from
 Georgetown University  and his law degree from Temple University
Beasley School of Law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
