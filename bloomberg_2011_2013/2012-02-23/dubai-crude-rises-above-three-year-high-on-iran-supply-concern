Dubai crude prices climbed to the
highest price in more than three years as buyers in  Asia  focused
on the potential loss of Iranian oil supplies.  Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  crude rose to $120.77 a barrel, the highest since Aug.
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Abu Dhabi ’s
 Murban (PGCPMURB)  rose 20 cents to a 2 cent premium over its official
selling price, the most since Feb. 10, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “In the current market environment, which is characterized
by supply tightness anyway, any absence of Iranian crude from
global markets is a reason for concern for oil consumers,”
analysts at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna said today in a note.
“Asian buyers of Iranian crude are scrambling to find
alternative sources.”  Japan  will propose cutting crude purchases from  Iran  by at
least 11 percent annually starting this year, according to a
Japanese government official on Feb. 21 who declined to be
identified because the talks are continuing. The country is
seeking an exemption to a U.S. law that would punish banks that
do business with Iran.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when the price for prompt
deliveries is greater than for later shipments,  widened  by 15
cents. Swaps for March were $1.81 cents a barrel more than in
May, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-
based broker. The price difference, known as a timespread, has
more than doubled since the start of the month, a sign of
stronger refiner demand for prompt oil.  Lower Zakum (PGCPLWZK) , also produced by Abu Dhabi, increased 19 cents
to 4 cents below its official selling price. That was the
smallest discount in almost two weeks.  Dubai Partials  South Korea ’s  SK Innovation Co. (096770)  sold three Dubai partial
cargoes today, according to a survey of traders who monitor to
Platts pricing window. Vitol Group bought two at $120 and
$120.10 a barrel, while  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought one at
$120.10.  The April  Brent-Dubai (PVMMDBSP)  exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
rose 20 cents to $4.50 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 14,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker. The May exchange fell 1 cent to $4.01.  Oman futures for April delivery rose 63 cents to $122.23 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:40 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,503 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$121.30 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
