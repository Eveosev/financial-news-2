Leaders from the world’s biggest
emerging markets will ask their finance ministers to study a
proposal for a bank funded exclusively by their nations at a
summit in March, a Russian official said.  India  has proposed setting up a multilateral bank that
would be exclusively funded by developing nations and finance
projects in those countries. The plan comes as leaders from
Brazil, Russia, India, China and  South Africa  seek a bigger say
in running the  International Monetary Fund  and other
multilateral bodies to match their rising economic heft.  The creation of the bank “could mean some serious
contributions of capital, so everything needs to be calculated
and analyzed,” Andrey Bokarev, the head of international
financial relations at Russia’s finance ministry, said from 
Mexico City yesterday, at the end of the Group of 20 summit.  Leaders from the so-called BRICS group will meet in New
Dehli March 29, their fourth-ever summit. The proposal for a
BRICS bank builds on a pledge leaders from the five nations made
at their last meeting in April 2011 in  China , when they promised
in a statement to “strengthen financial cooperation among the
BRICS Development Banks.”  The IMF projects 2012 economic growth at 3 percent in
Brazil; 3.3 percent in Russia; 7 percent in India; 8.2 percent
in China; and 2.5 percent in South Africa. The U.S. growth this
year will be 1.8 percent while the 17-nation euro area will
shrink by 0.5 percent, according to the IMF estimates released
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
