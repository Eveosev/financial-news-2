Brazil ’s real headed for a four-
month high after a report that showed German business confidence
climbed more than forecast spurred optimism about global growth
and bolstered demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.6988 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:28 a.m. in Sao Paulo, from 1.7060 yesterday. A close at
that level would be the highest since Oct. 28.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6
from 108.3 in January. That’s the fourth straight gain and the
highest reading since July. Economists predicted an increase to
108.8, according to the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  “Liquidity around the world is very high,” lifting demand
for emerging-market assets, said Alfredo Barbutti, an economist
at Liquidez DTVM Ltda, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract
due in January 2013 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 9.21 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
