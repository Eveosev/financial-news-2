Shortly after a major Cindy Sherman
retrospective opens at  New York ’s Museum of  Modern Art  on Feb.
26, one of her most famous images will be sold at Sotheby’s. The
combination could boost her prices after last year’s career high
auction total of $13.7 million.  The 8-by-10-inch black-and-white photograph depicts a young
working woman, wearing a crisp suit and an anxious expression,
standing amid big city buildings. It’s part of Sotheby’s
contemporary-art sale on March 9 in New York and has a presale
estimate of $150,000 to $200,000.  “It will get people very excited,” said  Todd Levin ,
director of  Levin Art Group  in New York. “I would expect it to
sell for between $600,000 and $800,000, with buyer’s premium.”  The work is from Sherman’s “Untitled Film Stills,” a
groundbreaking group of 69 gelatin-silver prints made between
1977 and 1980. In each, Sherman plays a female stereotype --
bombshell, housewife, lonely girl. MoMA bought the complete
series in 1995, and it occupies an entire room in the
retrospective.  Sotheby’s (BID)  “Untitled Film Still #21,” the first in an
edition of 10, is signed by Sherman on the back and inscribed
“City Girl.” The artist gave it to a collector associated with
Sherman’s 1984 exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art
in Philadelphia, according to the auction house.  Popular Photos  Along with the hitchhiker and the librarian, the city girl
is among the most popular photos from the series, said Janelle
Reiring, a partner at  Metro Pictures  gallery, which has
represented Sherman since 1980.  “I believe they were priced at $200 each” when the
gallery started working with Sherman, Reiring said. “Cindy has
sold them previously out of her studio for $50 each.” In her
last Metro Pictures exhibition, in 2008, works were priced
between $175,000 and $250,000.  Sherman’s annual auction revenue between 2000 and 2006 had
remained mostly in the range of $1.5 million to $2.8 million and
then jumped in 2007 to $8.9 million, according to Artprice, a
French research company. That year, a photograph from her
centerfolds series, which depicts women in different states of
emotional distress, fetched $2.1 million at  Christie’s (CHRS)  in New
York.  Her auction total dropped to $1.6 million in 2009, during
the recession, and was back at $8.1 million in 2010.  Revenue Rises  Last year was her biggest, with auction revenue rising 70
percent from 2010 to $13.7 million, according to Artprice. The
MoMA show, which comprises 171 photographs, could boost it even
further.  “Museum activities are very telling and have a huge
influence on the market,” said Lowell Pettit of  Pettit Art
Partners , a New York-based art advisory firm. “People pay
attention to that.”  Last May, a color photo from Sherman’s centerfolds series
fetched $3.9 million at Christie’s in New York, setting an
auction record for the medium. (Six months later, German artist
Andreas Gursky dethroned Sherman when his landscape photo sold
for $4.3 million, also at Christie’s.)  In 1981, when Metro Pictures exhibited the 12 centerfolds,
each was priced at $1,000.  The MoMA show also highlights the depth of support for the
artist’s work. Images were lent by billionaire philanthropist
 Eli Broad  and hedge-fund manager  Adam Sender . Computer-software
developer Peter Norton contributed money to the museum to
acquire several Sherman works. French billionaire  Francois Pinault  is a major collector.  Broad, the founder of the  Eli & Edythe Broad Foundation  in
 Los Angeles , first saw Sherman’s work in the early 1980s and has
since amassed more than 100 photographs by the artist.  “There has been always curatorial and museum support,”
Reiring said, “‘and she’s been always popular with
collectors.”  To contact the reporter of this story:
