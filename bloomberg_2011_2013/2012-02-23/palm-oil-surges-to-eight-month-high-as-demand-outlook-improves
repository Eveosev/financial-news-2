Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in more than eight months on speculation that demand may
grow as countries rebuild inventories and as expensive soybean
oil prompts users to buy the cheaper tropical oil.  The May-delivery contract advanced 0.7 percent to 3,272
ringgit ($1,086) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price at close for a most-active contract
since June 9.  Shipments from Malaysia, the second-biggest producer after
 Indonesia , fell 2 percent to 783,112 tons in the first 20 days
of February from the same period last month, surveyor  Intertek (ITSPALM) 
said Feb. 20. This compares with a 14 percent decline in the
first 15 days of the month.  Soybean oil ’s  premium  over palm oil
was $117.85 a ton today. It has averaged $117.23 this year
compared with an average of $33.09 in the same period last year.  “The market has good support, demand is picking up and
soybean oil prices are also high,” Vijay Mehta, a director at
Commodity Links Pte., said by phone from  Singapore . “We’re
receiving inquiries from India and Bangladesh also, good demand
is coming in for February and March shipments.”  The differential between soybean oil and competing oils
such as palm oil and sunflower oil is “too big,” Mehta said.
“Demand for soybean oil is going down.”  Palm oil is expected to trade above $1,300 a ton by the
middle of this year as global vegetable-oils supplies tighten,
 Michael Coleman , managing director at Aisling Analytics Pte.,
said at a conference in Singapore. The target referred to is the
contract in Malaysian ringgit converted into dollars, he said.  Soybeans for delivery in May gained 0.3 percent to  $12.825
a bushel today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
delivery in the same month were also little changed at 54.56
cents per pound, after trading at 54.65 cents yesterday and on
Feb. 21, the highest price since Sept. 22.  Palm oil for delivery in September closed little changed at
8,364 ($1,328) yuan a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.2 percent to
close at 9,404 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
