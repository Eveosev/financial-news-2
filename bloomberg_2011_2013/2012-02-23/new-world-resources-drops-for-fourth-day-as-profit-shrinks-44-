New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
coking-coal producer in the  Czech Republic , climbed as improved
German business confidence drove demand for commodities,
outweighing a drop in the company’s profit.  The stock rose 2.3 percent to 153.5 koruna by the close in
Prague, making it the best performer today in the 14-member  PX (PX) 
index, which fell 1.9 percent. NWR earlier tumbled as much as 6
percent after saying its profit shrank 44 percent last year.  Benchmark European coal and electricity futures contracts
increased today after a gauge of business confidence in Germany,
Europe’s largest economy and the main buyer of Czech exports,
jumped more than forecast. Mining companies including Randgold
Resources Ltd. and Fresnillo Plc advanced in London trading.  “Coal prices in Europe are increasing today and the whole
mining sector is doing well,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Prague-
based Komercni Banka AS, wrote in an e-mailed response to
Bloomberg News questions. “Still, I think  NWR (NWR) ’s earnings
warrant a completely opposite market reaction.”  Net income dropped to 130 million euros ($173 million) from
233 million euros in 2010, the Amsterdam-registered company said
today, citing a reduced demand for coal. That missed the 158
million-euro median estimate of 21 analysts polled by Bloomberg.  In London trading, NWR last traded up 1.3 percent to 520.5
pernce. The stock earlier tumbled to as low as 491.8 pence.  “The stock defended its psychological barrier of 5 pounds
and quickly rebounded from it,” Nemy said. “But an increase by
more than 2 percent” in Prague “is certainly a surprise,” he
said.  Coal (API2YR1)  for next-year delivery reached $115.25 a metric ton, a
two-week high, in the Netherlands and German electricity rose to
53.70 euros per megawatt-hour, poised for the highest close this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
