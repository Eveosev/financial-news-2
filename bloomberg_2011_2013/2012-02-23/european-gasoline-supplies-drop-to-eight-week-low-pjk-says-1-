Gasoline stockpiles in independent
storage fell to an eight-week low in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub as exports rose, according to
PJK International BV.  Inventories of the  fuel  dropped 4.6 percent to 646,000
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher
based in the  Netherlands . Cargoes were shipped to  Puerto Rico ,
 Ecuador  and other parts of  South America .  Gasoil supplies dropped 4.2 percent to 2.56 million tons as
freezing temperatures disrupted shipments along canals off the
Rhine River. “We had a recent cold snap which resulted in
frozen rivers,” Pieter Kulsen, found of PJK, said by phone from
Breda, Netherlands. “There was a backlog to replenish those
storage facilities.”  Fuel oil  reserves increased because it was unprofitable for
European companies to ship the product to  Asia , Kulsen said.
“The arbitrage to the  Far East  is closed,” he said. Stockpiles
of the fuel advanced 10.2 percent to 662,000 tons, according to
the researcher.  Jet fuel  supplies dropped 9.2 percent to 574,000 tons.
 Naphtha (ARASNPHT)  stores rose 42 percent to 78,000 tons, PJK said.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
