Profits in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index are  rising faster  than its price, leaving the gauge 9
percent cheaper than it was in April even after American
equities climbed within 0.1 percent of last year’s high.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.4 percent to 1,363.46 today following a
rally since October that added as much as $3.2 trillion to  share
values , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the index
is just shy of its 2011 peak of 1,363.61, expanding income has
pushed the price-earnings ratio to 14.1 from 15.4 in April.  Economic growth that has been slower than any post-
recession period since at least the 1940s is keeping investors
from paying more for earnings even after stocks doubled in three
years. The  best January  for the S&P 500 in 15 years has
coincided with a decline in New York Stock Exchange trading
volume to the lowest level since 1999 and record deposits with
investment-grade bond funds.  “The world is profoundly underinvested in U.S. equities,”
 Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James &
Associates in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , said in a phone interview
on Feb. 21. His firm manages $300 billion. “The public is
bombarded with all these negatives.  Greece  this,  Portugal  that,
dysfunctional governments. The retail investor is frozen.”  Topping Estimates  Corporate profits  have topped analyst estimates for 12
straight quarters. Analysts that cover companies in the S&P 500
 project earnings  will rise this year to $104.40 a share, the
highest level ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That would represent a 70 percent increase in earnings since
2009, compared with the 22 percent rally in the index in the
past two years. Earnings for S&P 500 companies from
Priceline.com Inc. to MasterCard Inc. and Lorillard Inc. are
estimated to jump 9.8 percent from last year.  The S&P 500 has recovered 24 percent since its low on Oct.
3. Its  price-earnings ratio  of 14.1 matches the average level
last year. The valuation has trailed the five-decade average of
16.4 for the longest stretch since the 13-year period beginning
in 1973, according to Bloomberg data.  The S&P 500’s valuation shrank as much as 27 percent in
2011 as S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating,
President  Barack Obama  and Congress debated deficit cuts and
 Europe  was forced to bail out Greece. The  European Central
Bank ’s three-year lending program for banks and the  Federal
Reserve ’s pledge to keep benchmark interest rates low through at
least 2014 have failed to bolster investor confidence enough to
boost valuations.  ‘Powerful Recovery’  “The powerful recovery in earnings thus far has allowed
market averages to rise without pushing the P/E higher,” David
Joy, the Boston-based chief market strategist at Ameriprise
Financial Inc., said in a Feb. 21 e-mail. His firm oversees $600
billion. “Many investors are either not convinced that this
price rally and earnings recovery are for real, or they simply
do not care, having been burned too badly in the downturn.”  U.S. gross domestic product expanded an average 2.4 percent
a quarter in the 2 1/2 years since the recession ended in 2009,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The world’s largest economy
hasn’t had a smaller post-recession recovery rate since at least
the 1940s, the data show. In the 2003  bull market , GDP rose 2.7
percent on average, before the S&P 500 surged 102 percent. For
the 1982 rally, the rate was 5.7 percent. Equities more than
tripled in that cycle.  Biggest Swings  Stocks saw unprecedented swings last year as global
economic concerns overshadowed S&P 500 fundamentals. The index
moved an average 1.3 percent each day from April 2011 through
the end of the year, compared with the 50-year average of 0.6
before the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  alternated between losses and gains of 400
points on four days in August, the longest streak on record.  The swings took a toll on professional and retail
investors. A total of 21 percent of 525 global fund categories
tracked by Morningstar Inc. topped their benchmark indexes last
year, the fewest since at least 1999. A  Hedge Fund Research Inc.
index (HFRIFWI)  of industry performance fell 5.2 percent in 2011, only the
third annual loss since 1990 and the biggest decline since 2008,
when it plunged 19 percent, according to the Chicago-based firm.  Trading by individuals has been slowing since the 2008
financial crisis. Daily average volume slipped 9 percent last
quarter compared with a year ago, according to data from  E*Trade (ETFC) 
Financial Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Charles Schwab
Corp. At  E*Trade (ETFC) , daily trading volume is 35 percent lower than
it was at the end of 2008. Revenue-generating trades are down 14
percent in the same period at Schwab.  ‘Hard to Jump In’  “When you have a market that has done so well so fast,
it’s really hard to jump in,” Brian Culpepper, a portfolio
manager at James Investment Research Inc. in Xenia,  Ohio , which
oversees $3.2 billion, said in a telephone interview on Feb. 21.
“Everybody is pretty skittish right now on this overall rally.
There is by far a better chance for the market to head down than
there is for heading up here.”  Trading (MVOLUSE)  at the New York Stock Exchange declined to the
lowest level since 1999 last month, with the average volume over
the 50 days ending Jan. 25 slowing to 838.4 million shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The value of stock
changing hands dropped to $24.9 billion, a 50-day average not
seen since at least 2005.  Record-low  interest rates  have failed to keep investors
from putting money in bonds. The S&P 500’s earnings yield is at
7.1 percent, close to the highest on record when compared with
the  10-year Treasury (USGG10YR)  rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg since 1962. U.S. investment-grade bond mutual funds
saw a record $3.3 billion in inflows during the week ended Feb.
15, while American equity funds had outflows of $1.9 billion,
according to data by EPFR Global and Bank of America Corp.  Unduly Punished  Companies with business focused in the U.S., such as
hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc., have been
unduly punished, according to Ed Maran, a portfolio manager at
Thornburg Investment Management Inc. in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico ,
which oversees $80 billion. Community Health trades at 7 times
earnings in the past 12 months, compared with the average of
28.5 since it went public in 2000, according to Bloomberg data.  “The uncertainty at the global level probably should not
be reflected so greatly in the prices of these types of
companies,” Maran said. “As long as we have a resolution of
the European sovereign debt problem that’s orderly, stocks are
very cheap relative to other investment alternatives.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
