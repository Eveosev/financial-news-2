Units of  Vitro SAB (VITRO) , the Mexican
glassmaker that defaulted in 2009, were sued by a trustee for
noteholders, which is seeking to recover $311 million on unpaid
notes.  U.S. Bank NA, the trustee for Vitro’s 11.75 percent senior
notes due in 2013, sued subsidiaries to recover principal,
interest and fees owed, according to a complaint filed yesterday
in  New York  State Supreme Court. The bank is seeking damages on
behalf of noteholders of about $311 million, according to the
filing.  Vitro said this month that a Mexican judge gave final
approval to its plan to restructure $1.5 billion in defaulted
debt. U.S. noteholders fought the plan, and U.S. Bank said in
its court filing that it was appealing the Mexico decision along
with other creditors.  The Vitro units sued by  U.S. Bank  guaranteed the notes, and
the trustee is seeking a court ruling that the guaranty
obligations can’t be discharged through the Mexican proceeding,
according to the court filing.  The guaranties have been discharged under the approved
restructuring plan, according to a statement from Roberto Riva Palacio, a Vitro spokesman.  “Certain vulture fund investors, some of which invested in
Vitro bonds well after the restructuring process was under way,
have chosen to litigate at each and every turn in an effort to
extort outsized returns, and this lawsuit is no exception,” he
said.  The case is U.S. Bank NA v. Vitro Automotriz SA, 650506-
2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
