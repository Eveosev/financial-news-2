Nigeria  deducted in 187.1 billion
naira ($1.19 billion) from the excess crude account in January
because of a decline in crude oil production, and yesterday
distributed 614.4 billion naira to federal, state and local
governments, ThisDay reported.  Nigeriaâ€™s gross revenue declined last month to 666.3
billion naira from 892.7 billion naira in December, a result of
a decrease in oil production at the Bonga and Qua Iboe sites and
a week-long strike that followed the scrapping of gasoline
subsidies in January, the Lagos-based newspaper said, citing
Yerima Ngama, minister of state for finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
