Treasuries dropped as a report
showed U.S. weekly initial jobless claims were at a four-year
low and as the U.S. readies the sale of $29 billion in seven-
year notes.  Treasuries fluctuated earlier amid lingering concern
 Europe ’s rescue package for  Greece  won’t resolve the region’s
debt crisis. U.S. government securities have lost 0.9 percent
this month, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes,
on signs the global economic recovery is weathering Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  “People are setting up for the auctions,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading at
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “Demand is going to be
fine.”  Yields on 10-year notes advanced two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 11:25 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 25/32. Yields touched 2 percent
yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 17.  Seven-Year Auction  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.45 percent
in pre-auction trading. The prior sale of the security on Jan.
26 drew a record low auction yield of 1.359 percent.  Investors bid for 2.73 times the amount offered in January,
compared with an average of 2.81 for the past 10 auctions. The
U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year debt on Feb. 21.  Today’s auction is the final of three this week totaling
$99 billion. A $35 billion U.S. five-year auction yesterday drew
a yield of 0.9 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.901
percent in a Bloomberg survey of seven primary dealers, which
are obliged to participate in government debt offerings.  This week’s note auctions and last week’s sale of $9
billion of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities will
raise $47.8 billion of new cash as maturing securities held by
the public total $60.2 billion.  Volume in the Treasury market yesterday remained below the
one-year average of $275 billion. About $255.44 billion of
Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker.  Price Swings  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
price swings based on options, closed yesterday at 79.6 basis
points, near the lowest level since July 2007. The five-year
average is 112 basis points.  Applications for jobless benefits were unchanged in the
week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed today. The median projection in
a Bloomberg News survey called for 355,000 claims, marking the
fourth straight week that the figures have been better than
forecast.  “The market sold off a little bit on the jobless-claims
data,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New
York at Jefferies Group Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that
trades with the  Federal Reserve . “This is the survey week for
employment so it indicates we may get another strong payroll
data.”  Inflation Measure  Economic gains are encouraging traders to increase
inflation bets. The difference between yields on 10-year notes
and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt known
as the break-even rate, widened to as much as 2.34 percentage
points, the most since August. It has averaged 2.14 percentage
points during the past decade.  Federal Reserve policy makers set a target of 2 percent for
inflation on Jan. 25 and forecast costs in the economy will
probably fall short of the goal this year.  The price gauge that the central bank uses is the personal
consumption expenditures index, which climbed 2.4 percent for
the 12 months ending Dec. 31. The measure increased 1.8 percent
after taking out food and energy costs.  The Fed sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries maturing from April
2014 to February 2015 today, according to the  New York  Fed’s
website. The bank is replacing shorter-maturity securities in
its holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs.  Benchmark 10-year note yields may rise to 2.49 percent by
year-end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of financial companies, with the most recent projections
given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
