A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit
risk dropped to the lowest level in more than a week as economic
reports showed a strengthening U.S. labor market and growing
 consumer confidence .  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 1.5 basis points to 96.3 basis points at 4:54 p.m. in
New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. That’s the lowest since
Feb. 14.  Traders pushed down the gauge, which typically falls as
confidence in U.S. companies improves and rises as it
deteriorates, after Labor Department figures showed today that
 applications  for unemployment insurance benefits were unchanged
in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March
2008. Swaps on  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the bailed-out
insurer, dropped 18 basis points to 276 after it reported a
fourth-quarter profit.  Consumers grew more optimistic as stocks gained this year,
with the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbing 3.4 percent in
January. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 38.4
in the week ended Feb. 19, the strongest reading since April
2008. A majority of consumers rated their personal finances as
positive for the first time since July.  AIG’s net income rose to $19.8 billion, or $10.43 a share,
from $11.2 billion, or $16.60, a year earlier, when the insurer
booked gains from the sale of businesses, according to a
statement today from the New York-based company. AIG posted a
tax benefit of about $17.7 billion.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract that’s
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
