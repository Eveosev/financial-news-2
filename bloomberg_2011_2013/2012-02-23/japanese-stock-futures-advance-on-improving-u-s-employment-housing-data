think investors will be comfortable the recovery in the U.S.
this time around has a better chance of surviving and

risk appetite and improving economic fundamentals will create a
catalyst that’s been lacking despite attractive valuations
across a number of risk assets.”  Jobs, Housing Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
