Wheat fell in  Chicago  on speculation
world stockpiles of the grain will touch an all-time high by the
current marketing year’s end in May.  Inventories may reach a record 213.1 million metric tons in
the period, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Global
stocks may come to 220 million tons in the coming 2012-13
marketing year, Mike O’Dea, a senior risk manager at INTL
FCStone Inc., said yesterday. Prices are down 1.5 percent this
year, partly on speculation inventories would swell.  “The inventory outlook is quite stable compared to corn
and soybeans,” said Nick Higgins, a London-based analyst at
Rabobank International.  Wheat for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $6.4325 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade,
this week’s second decline. Milling wheat for May delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.1 percent to 206.25 euros
($247.27) a ton.  Corn for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $6.42 a bushel in
Chicago. Soybeans for delivery in the same month climbed 0.2
percent to $12.815 a bushel, advancing for an eighth session in
nine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
