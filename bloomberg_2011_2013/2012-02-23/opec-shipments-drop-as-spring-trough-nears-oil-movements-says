OPEC will reduce crude shipments by
0.3 percent this month as demand nears its “spring trough,”
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
 export  23.27 million barrels a day in the four weeks to March
10, compared with 23.34 million in the period to Feb. 11, the
Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. The figures exclude  Angola  and Ecuador.  “Refinery turnaround is climbing and offline capacity is
rising to its seasonal peak,” Roy Mason, Oil Movements’
founder, said by phone today. Crude demand will drop through
mid-April or early May as refiners in the U.S. and  Asia  carry
out maintenance at their plants, he said.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will decrease 0.7 percent to 17.37
million barrels a day in the four-week period, according to the
tracker.  Crude on board tankers will average 475.58 million barrels
in the four weeks, up 2.2 percent from 465.54 million in the
month to Feb. 11, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya ,
Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
