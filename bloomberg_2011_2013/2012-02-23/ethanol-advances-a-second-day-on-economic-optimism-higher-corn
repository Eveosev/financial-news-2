Ethanol futures advanced for a
second day in  Chicago  after a government report showed jobless
claims at a four-year low and as corn gained on increased
Chinese demand.  Futures rose 0.4 percent. The Labor Department reported
applications for jobless benefits were unchanged last week at
351,000, the lowest level since March 2008, while the
Agriculture Department said U.S. exporters sold 120,000 tons of
corn to  China  for delivery in the 2011-2012 marketing year that
ends Aug. 31.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. and blended with
gasoline to stretch supply as part of the nationâ€™s plans to
reduce dependence on petroleum.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 0.9 cents to
$2.21 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are down 11
percent from a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  slipped 1 cent
to $2.24 a gallon and in Chicago slid 1 cent to $2.175,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 1 cent to $2.225 a gallon and
on the West Coast lost 1 cent to $2.295.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.425 a
bushel in Chicago, the second straight gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
