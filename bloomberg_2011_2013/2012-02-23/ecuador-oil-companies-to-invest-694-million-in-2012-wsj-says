Ecuador expects private  oil
companies  to boost investments by about 58 percent to $694
million this year, Dow Jones said today, citing Non-Renewable
Natural Resources Minister Wilson Pastor.  Pastor also said the South American nation plans to open
concessions in April for 21 oil blocks in the southeastern part
of the country, Dow reported.  No one at the ministry could immediately confirm the story,
said an official who canâ€™t be cited because of internal rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
