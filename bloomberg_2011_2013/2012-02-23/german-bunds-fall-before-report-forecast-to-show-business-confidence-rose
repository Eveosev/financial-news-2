German  bunds  fell after an industry
report showed business confidence in  Europe ’s largest economy
rose more than economists forecast in February, damping demand
for safer assets.  Ten-year yields climbed from within a basis point of the
lowest in a week and bunds underperformed most of their euro-
region peers. Italian bonds fell after the European Commission
forecast Europe’s economy will shrink in 2012 as nations battle
to escape the debt crisis. An International Monetary Fund
official said it will limit its loans to Greece to 30 billion
euros ($40 billion).  “We’ve seen bunds come back a bit on the back of the
Ifo,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “With the euro
crisis there’s still uncertainty and many hurdles to clear. On
the other hand,  Germany , has been reasonably positive so that’s
held bonds from continuing their rise.”  The 10-year German yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 11:53 a.m. London time
after falling to 1.89 yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 17. The 2
percent bond due January 2022 dropped 0.135, or 1.35 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.825.  Ifo Index  Spanish 10-year bonds rose, pushing the yield down three
basis points to 5.06 percent. The additional yield investors
demand to hold the securities over bunds narrowed five basis
points to 315 basis points.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 109.6 from 108.3 in
January. That’s the highest reading since July and more than the
108.8 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  The 17-nation euro-bloc economy will contract 0.3 percent,
the commission said, abandoning a November forecast of 0.5
percent growth. The downgrade was mainly due to projected
contractions of 1.3 percent in  Italy  and 1 percent in  Spain .  “While improvements in the Ifo survey are obviously a
positive, so long as concerns remain over the growth outlook and
longer term sustainability of public finances of many euro-zone
states it’s unlikely to be sufficient to alter the safe-haven
appeal of bunds,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank
Plc in London.  Italian 10-year  government bonds  fell for a second day,
pushing yields three basis points higher to 5.54 percent.  The IMF will seek to keep its exposure to Greece under a
new bailout package at 30 billion euros, including money still
owed from a previous loan, an official said yesterday. The
organization has yet to announce its share of the 130 billion-
euro bailout package for  Greece  agreed on two days ago.  Bond Writedowns  The Greek March 2012 note rose to 26.75 percent of face
value. It traded at 42 percent on Feb. 16.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Commerzbank AG of Germany
and  France ’s Credit Agricole SA all took writedowns on their
Greek government debt two days after Greece’s private creditors
agreed to a debt swap, paving the way for its second bailout.  RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, posted a
wider-than-expected full-year loss after taking a sovereign-debt
impairment of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.73 billion). The bank said
it reduced its exposure to Greek, Italian, Irish, Portuguese and
Spanish government debt by 90 percent last year.  Commerzbank, Germany’s second-biggest lender, booked a 700
million-euro writedown on Greek debt in the fourth quarter and
 Credit Agricole , France’s third-largest bank, reported a
quarterly loss after booking 220 million euros in impairments on
Greek debt.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.2 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek
securities fell 6.9 percent while Italian debt returned 9.3
percent, according to the indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
