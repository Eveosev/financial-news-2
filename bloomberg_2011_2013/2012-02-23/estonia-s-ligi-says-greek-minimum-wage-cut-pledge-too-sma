Greece ’s pledge to cut its  minimum
wage  by at least 22 percent is too small to improve employment
and may prove to be the weak point of a new aid program,
Estonia’s Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said.  “As I said in ministerial meetings, together with other
countries with sound public finances: this doesn’t correspond to
Greek wealth levels, it does not correspond to the Greek labor
market situation,” Ligi said in parliament in Tallinn today
during a discussion of a second bailout package for Greece. “To
cut 22 percent is clearly too little, although it may be a lot
politically.”  Greece pledged to cut minimum wages by 22 percent and by 32
percent for those under 25 years of age, according to austerity
measures agreed with the so-called troika -- the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund . The Greek minimum wage was 751 euros ($1,000) for
workers older than 23 years at the start of 2012, compared with
290 euros in Estonia, according to the Federation of European
Employers’  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
