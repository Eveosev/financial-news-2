Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua
said that he won’t occupy the presidency during  Hugo Chavez ’s
absence when he travels to Cuba to undergo a third surgery
related to cancer.  Jaua, speaking today on state television, said that Chavez
will request approval from the National Assembly tomorrow to
travel to Cuba for the operation. Chavez, who said yesterday
that medical tests on Feb. 18 revealed a lesion that may be
malignant, will be able to continue governing from the Caribbean
island, Jaua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
