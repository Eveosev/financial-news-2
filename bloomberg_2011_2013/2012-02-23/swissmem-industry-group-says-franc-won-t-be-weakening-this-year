The Swissmem industry group doesn’t
expect the Swiss franc to weaken versus the euro in 2012 as the
euro-area crisis is likely to persist, the lobbying group said.  Many firms in the machinery and engineering sector will see
their margins erode further this year, Swissmem said in a faxed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
