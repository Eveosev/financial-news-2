China’s stocks may fall as much as
13 percent by the end of the year as the central bank’s “fine-
tuning” of monetary policies won’t be enough to offset an
economic slowdown, according to Bank of America Corp.  The government needs to cut  interest rates  or relax curbs
in the property market to sustain this year’s 9.3 percent
rebound for the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , David Cui, chief China
strategist at the Merrill Lynch unit, said in an interview in
its Shanghai office yesterday. Cui, 43, who has been bearish on
China equities since May 2010, said the Shanghai gauge may drop
to 2,100 by year-end. It rose 0.9 percent to 2,403.59 yesterday.  “If the government only does fine tuning, it’s not
sufficient to remove the major overhangs behind the poor market
performance over the past two years or so, including a lack of a
new and sustainable growth driver and the banking system’s bad
debts,” said Cui. “The markets will likely remain lukewarm.”  China’s stocks have rebounded this year on speculation the
government will loosen monetary policies to stem a decline in
economic growth triggered by  Europe ’s debt crisis and a slumping
 property market . The Shanghai gauge tumbled 33 percent over the
past two years, making it the worst performer among the world’s
10 biggest markets. The People’s Bank of China increased
interest rates and lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios last year
to tame consumer prices that rose 4.5 percent last month, up
from 4.1 percent in December.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
