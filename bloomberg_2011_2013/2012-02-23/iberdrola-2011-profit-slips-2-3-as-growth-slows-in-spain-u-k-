Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Spain ’s biggest
electricity supplier, said net income slipped 2.3 percent last
year as the global economic slowdown damped demand and that it
may miss a profit target for 2012.  The world’s largest owner of wind-energy plants said profit
fell to 2.8 billion euros ($3.72 billion) from 2.87 billion
euros in 2010, according to a filing today. Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 1.6 percent to
7.65 billion euros.  “If 2011 was complicated, 2012 isn’t going to be any less
so,” Chairman Ignacio Galan said at a press conference in
Madrid. “The conditions in our markets have deteriorated
significantly.”  The Spanish economy slipped toward a second recession in
four years during the second half of 2011 while activity in the
U.K. slowed as governments struggled to rein in their borrowing.
Profit growth may fall short of the company’s 5 percent target
this year should the economic slowdown persist, Galan said.  The stock fell 3.1 percent to 4.52 euros at 12:55 p.m. in
 Madrid , trading near the seven-year low it reached in September.
In comparison, the MSCI Europe/Utilities Index has rebounded 9.2
percent from the lows it reached at the same point.  The European Commission today cut its forecast for the
euro-area economy, seeing a 0.3 percent contraction this year
compared with November prediction for a 0.5 percent expansion.
Spain’s economy will shrink 1 percent while the U.K. economy
will slow to 0.6 percent from 0.9 percent in 2011.  Iberdrola’s power output in Spain last year fell by 11
percent and in Britain it dropped 19 percent. In the U.S.,
Iberdrola’s output rose 14 percent after the company added more
than 600 megawatts of renewable-power generating capacity.  Iberdrola said it will maintain the dividend for the year
at 32.6 euro cents per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
