U.S. farmers will boost corn
planting by 2.1 percent this year to a 94 million acres, the
most since 1944,  Joe Glauber , the U.S. Department of
Agricultureâ€™s chief economist, said today in  remarks  at a
conference in Arlington, Virginia. A bigger crop may send prices
down 19 percent in the 2012-2013 marketing year that begins
Sept. 1, to $5 a bushel from $6.20, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
