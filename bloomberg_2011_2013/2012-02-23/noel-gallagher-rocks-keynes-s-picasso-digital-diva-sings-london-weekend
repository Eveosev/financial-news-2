The Mexican guitarists Rodrigo y
Gabriela are adding a little Havana spice to their music,
performing with the band C.U.B.A.  The duo has spent a decade building up a fearsome live
reputation with their dueling acoustic guitars. Now their
flamenco, Latin and rock tunes get an even bigger sound.  In a busy weekend for music fans, admirers of Oasis will be
heading for the O2, where Noel Gallagher’s new band High Flying
Birds features a guitar attack of a more traditional rock kind.  Rodrigo y Gabriela with C.U.B.A., Brixton O2 Academy, 211
Stockwell Road, SW9 9SL, Feb. 24. Information: +44-844-477-2000,

shows likely to sell out.  Saturday  Who knew?  Economist  John Maynard Keynes  was one of Britain’s earliest
Picasso buyers. The suggestive still life he picked up at
auction now hangs in “Picasso & Modern British Art” at  Tate
Britain . So does a sketch of Keynes’s future wife, a Russian
ballerina who made sure she wasn’t alone when Picasso drew her.  The show plots Picasso’s emergence in British collections
and his influence on local art. The Spaniard dominates, though
in the final rooms, Bacon and Hockney offer clever ripostes.
Bacon derives his bulbous figures from a tentacular Picasso
beach scene. Hockney draws himself naked and seated opposite the
Iberian maestro, who wears his signature sailor top.  The show ends July 15 at Tate Britain, Millbank, SW1P 4RG.

cousin.  Sadly, Tony can’t stand Constance in the  National Theatre ’s
new production of the mistaken-identity comedy “She Stoops to
Conquer” (penned in 1773 by Oliver Goldsmith). That doesn’t
stop Mrs. Hardcastle’s campaign to rise above her station: She
feigns an upper-class accent, and performs a courtly curtsey
that lasts far longer than she ever intended.  Sophie Thompson is a hoot as the social-climbing parent.
“She Stoops to Conquer” ends April 21 at the National Theatre:
