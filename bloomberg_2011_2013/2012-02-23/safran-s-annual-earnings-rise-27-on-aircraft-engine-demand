Safran SA (SAF) , Europe’s second-largest
maker of  aircraft engines , said full-year profit increased 27
percent as it benefited from production increases by commercial
planemakers.  Profit excluding some items in 2011 rose to 644 million
euros ($853 million) or 1.59 euros a share, from 508 million
euros, or 1.27 euros a share, a year earlier, the company said
in an e-mailed statement. That compared to 1.69 euros from 17
 analysts  in a Bloomberg survey.  Safran builds engines for single-aisle planes made by
 Airbus SAS (EAD)  and Boeing Co. through its CFM International venture
with  General Electric Co. (GE)  The two biggest planemakers are
boosting output to record levels as airlines worldwide expand
and refresh their fleets with newer, more-efficient jets.  “In what is likely to remain an unstable environment, we
are confident we are on track for further solid earnings growth
in 2012,” the Paris-based company said in the statement.  Sales rose 9.1 percent to 11.74 billion euros. Analysts in
a Bloomberg survey had estimated 11.77 billion euros. Safran
 predicted  a 10 percent increase in revenue this year and a 20
percent jump in recurring operating income, which in 2011 rose
35 percent to 1.19 billion euros.  The backlog rose to 43 billion euros. CFM’s new Leap
engines, which will power Airbus’s A320neo,  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 737 MAX
and Commercial Aircraft Corp. of  China ’s C919, recorded more
than 3,000 orders, Safran said. Airbus’s A320neo is set for
first deliveries in late 2015. The Boeing plane will enter
service in 2017 and Comac has said its C919 will begin service
in 2016.  Safran said it will ask shareholders to approve an increase
in the dividend to 62 cents a share, from 50 cents, at the
company’s annual meeting May 31.  Results are adjusted for the effect of re-evaluating
currency hedges and purchase-price allocations, as well as
accounting for assets and liabilities in acquisitions, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
