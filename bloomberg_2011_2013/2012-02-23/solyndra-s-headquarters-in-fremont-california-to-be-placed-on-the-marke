Solyndra LLC’s  California 
headquarters will be marketed by brokerage  Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) 
after the failed solar-panel maker received sale approval by the
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  overseeing disposal of its assets.  The 450,000-square-foot (42,000-square-meter) facility in
Fremont, California, was completed in 2010 and can be used by a
variety of technology companies, the brokerage said in a
statement today. The 30-acre (12-hectare) property, near the San
Jose and Oakland airports, has 280,000 square feet of
manufacturing space and a two-story office building.  “This is a unique opportunity for a manufacturer or other
user to acquire a brand new, state-of-the-art facility in the
heart of Silicon Valley,” Bart Lammersen, managing director of
Jones Lang LaSalle’s Palo Alto office, said in the statement.  Solyndra sought Chapter 11 protection on Sept. 6, two days
before its offices were raided by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. The company listed about $854.1 million in assets
and about $867.1 million in debt in court papers filed Oct. 31.  The manufacturer’s collapse prompted congressional scrutiny
of President Barack Obama, who praised the company during a May
2010 tour of its facilities. Solyndra faces a probe by
Republicans in Congress over the federal loan guarantee it used
to build a $733 million factory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
