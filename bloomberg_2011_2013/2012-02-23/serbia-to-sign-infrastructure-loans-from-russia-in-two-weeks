Serbia  expects to sign the first
agreements for an $800 million loan with Russia for
infrastructure next month, a government official said.  Serbian Deputy Finance Minister Goran Radosavljevic will
negotiate the “final details” in Moscow next week, including
the  interest rate  and the participation of Serbian and Russian
companies, Infrastructure Minister Milutin Mrkonjic said in
Belgrade yesterday. The signing of the  credit line , agreed by
the two nations’ presidents in 2009, will take place in two
weeks, he said.  The upgrades for Serbia’s state-owned rail company
Zeleznice Srbije include purchasing Russian-made diesel engines
for $100 million, the reconstruction of more than 400 kilometers
(250 miles) of tracks along Serbia’s main north-south route and
the railroad from Belgrade to neighboring Montenegro.  The projects on which Serbia’s government negotiated last
year with OAO  Russian Railways (RZHD)  also include upgrading the 15-
kilometer link between Belgrade and Pancevo, the site of the
country’s main oil refinery and chemical plants, completing a
new  railway station  in the capital and building a 68-kilometer
section between the western towns of Lozinca and Valjevo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
