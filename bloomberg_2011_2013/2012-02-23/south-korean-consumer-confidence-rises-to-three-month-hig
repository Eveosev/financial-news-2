South Korean consumer confidence
rose to the highest level in three months as signs of an
improvement in the  U.S. economy  and progress in resolving
 Europe ’s debt crisis helped reduce external risks.  The  sentiment index  rose to 100 in February from January’s
98, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement today. A
reading of 100 indicates the number of optimists is equal to the
number of pessimists.  South Korea’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said yesterday
that the risks from Europe have receded and uncertainties in the
global economy have eased now that a second bailout plan for
 Greece  has been agreed. Finance Ministers from the Group of 20
nations are expected to discuss ways to increase the
International Monetary Fund’s lending capacity when they meet in
Mexico City on Feb. 25 and 26.  The expected inflation rate over the next year is 4 percent,
compared with 4.1 percent last month, today’s report showed.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on survey responses
from 2,062 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between Feb. 10 and Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
