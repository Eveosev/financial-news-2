Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a third
day on speculation yields on the nation’s debt are no longer as
attractive to overseas investors after the central bank
unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest.  Global funds reduced  holdings  of Indonesia’s government
bonds by 3.8 trillion rupiah ($419 million) this month through
Feb. 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bank Indonesia  lowered
its  reference rate  by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent on Feb. 9,
taking advantage of easing inflation to support growth.
Indonesia’s 10-year benchmark government bonds are yielding 5.29
percent, compared with 5.51 percent for Italy and 5.56 percent
for  Poland .  “The rupiah is likely to trend down for the day,” said
Taufan Tito, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia in Jakarta. “Investors are finding the high returns
in  Europe  more attractive. It’s still the effect of the central
bank’s rate cut earlier this month.”  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,077 per dollar as of
10:22 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has lost 0.9 percent this
month. Inflation eased to a 22-month low of 3.65 percent in
January, from 3.79 percent in December, official data show.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.29 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
