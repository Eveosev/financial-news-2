South Korea’s won slid to a one-week
low and government bonds gained as a downgrade of Greece’s
credit rating and global stock declines deterred risk-taking.  Fitch Ratings  lowered Greece’s credit grade by two levels
to C from CCC yesterday, saying a default is highly likely in
the near term. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 0.2
percent yesterday, after the gauge rose above 13,000 for the
first time since 2008 the previous day. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of
shares fell 1 percent as overseas investors sold more shares
than they bought for the first time in a week.  “Stocks failing to recover previous highs and declining
shows there is not much momentum to take riskier bets,” said
Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based senior currency dealer at Hana Bank.
“The Greece credit-rating downgrade also worsened investor
sentiment, and some players are seeking to take profits
following recent gains in the won.”  The won slid 0.3 percent to 1,129.00 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , trimming this year’s advance to 2.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,130.28,
the weakest since Feb. 16.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent debt due December
2014 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
3.44 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year bond
futures rose 0.09 percent to 104.24. The one-year interest-rate
swap was steady at 3.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
