The U.S. Postal Service, which
predicts an annual loss of $18.2 billion by 2015, plans to
eliminate 5.4 percent of its workforce by closing almost half of
its mail-processing facilities to cut costs.  The service plans to shut 223 of its 461 mail-processing
plants by February 2013, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said
in a telephone interview today. The closings will cut about
35,000 jobs, said David Partenheimer, a Postal Service
spokesman.  The closings will save the Washington-based service about
$2.5 billion a year, Donahoe said. In September, the agency said
it was seeking to save $3 billion a year by closing 252 plants
and cutting 35,000 jobs.  Shutting mail-processing facilities is part of a plan to
consolidate work and slow mail delivery to save money. The
service, which is seeking to end Saturday mail delivery, posted
a loss of $3.3 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31.  The agency has closed 214 mail processing facilities since
2005, including 26 since the September announcement, according
to data provided by Sue Brennan, a Postal Service spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
