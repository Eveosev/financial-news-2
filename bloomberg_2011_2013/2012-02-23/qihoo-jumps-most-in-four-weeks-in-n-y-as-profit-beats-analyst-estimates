Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd. (QIHU)  jumped
the most in four weeks in U.S. trading after the Chinese
computer security software developer said fourth-quarter net
income more than tripled.  American depositary receipts of Qihoo gained 2.8 percent to
$17.98 by 10:06 a.m. in New York, after earlier surging as much
as 6.3 percent to $18.60, the biggest intraday advance since
Jan. 27.  Beijing-based Qihoo said net income in the last three
months of 2011 increased by 274 percent from a year earlier to
$15 million in a statement yesterday after U.S. markets closed.
That exceeded the $9.9 million  average estimate  of five analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings per ADR were 13 cents, beating the 8-cent forecast
of analysts, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Analysts at RBS Asia Ltd. and Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
reiterated their “buy” recommendations today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
