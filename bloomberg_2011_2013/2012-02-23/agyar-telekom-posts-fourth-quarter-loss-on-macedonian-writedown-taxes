Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) , the Hungarian
unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, posted a fourth-quarter net loss
that exceeded forecasts on a writedown at its Macedonian unit,
higher tax payments and a loss on financial operations.  The former phone monopoly’s loss totaled 38.7 billion
forint ($178 million), compared with a profit of 9.7 billion
forint a year earlier, according to a statement on the Budapest
Stock Exchange’s website today. The median  estimate  by 10
analysts was for a loss of 1.9 billion forint.  Magyar Telekom recognized a 31.4 billion-forint impairment
loss from the goodwill on its Macedonian unit after lowering its
10-year growth plans as much as 25 percent. That more than
doubled depreciation and amortization to 60.9 billion forint. It
booked a financial loss of 11.8 billion forint, compared with a
loss of 6.6 billion a year earlier, and saw income tax expenses
surge to 15 billion forint on tax regulation changes.  “A deteriorating economic environment” in 2012 will
affect the company’s results, saidChristopher Mattheisen,
chairman and chief executive officer in the statement.  Revenue will probably range between zero growth to a 2
percent annual drop. Underlying earnings before interest taxes,
depreciation and amortization is expected to “deteriorate”
this year by 4 percent to 6 percent.  Still, Ebitda jumped to 46.7 billion forint from 26 billion
forint a year earlier after the company booked a special
telecommunications tax introduced in 2010 in the last quarter of
that year.  Magyar Telekom  shares  gained 11.8 percent this year while
the benchmark  BUX index  rose 12.3 percent in the same period.  The company sees  capital expenditures , excluding spectrum
acquisitions, remaining in line with 2011, Mattheisen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
