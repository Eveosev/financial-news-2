Italy  won’t extend its ban on short
selling of financial shares after it expires tomorrow, said
 Giuseppe Vegas , chairman of Italian market regulator Consob.  “We will let it expire quietly,” Vegas said at a meeting
with reporters at the London Stock Exchange today. “We have no
plans to extend it.”  France, Belgium,  Spain  and Italy moved to prohibit short
selling of financial shares in August in an effort to stabilize
markets after European banks including Societe Generale SA hit
their lowest levels since the credit crisis of 2008. France,
Belgium and Spain ended their bans last week.  Short-sellers sell borrowed shares with plans to buy them
back later at a lower price, a practice politicians and some
investors blame for roiling markets. The trade is known as
“naked” when sellers haven’t first taken steps to ensure that
they can borrow the securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
