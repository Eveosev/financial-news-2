President  Barack Obama  signed into
law legislation extending a temporary payroll tax cut and
continuing expanded unemployment benefits through the end of the
year.  The measure also will avoid a cut in doctorsâ€™ Medicare
reimbursements. All three provisions were set to expire at the
end of this month. The House and Senate passed the legislation
Feb. 17.  The two-percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax for
workers will mean an extra $40 per paycheck for a typical
worker, according to the White House. Obama has said the
extension will help sustain the recovery by bolstering consumer
spending, which makes up 70 percent of the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
