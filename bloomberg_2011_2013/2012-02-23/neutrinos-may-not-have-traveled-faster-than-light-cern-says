A neutrino beam may not have
traveled faster than the speed of light as a measurement flaw
was identified, undermining an announcement late last year,
according to the institute in charge of the research project.  The  European Organization for Nuclear Research , or CERN,
said in September a neutrino beam was measured as traveling
faster than the speed of light, appearing to break the limit set
by  Albert Einstein  in 1905. That finding may have been flawed
because of a technical malfunction in timing instruments, CERN
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “If this is the case, it could have led to an
underestimate of the time of flight of the neutrinos,” Geneva-
based CERN said. “New measurements with short pulsed beams are
scheduled for May.”  Neutrinos, subatomic particles fired from CERN’s Geneva
base to a laboratory 730 kilometers (450 miles) away in Gran
Sasso,  Italy , were clocked at a velocity 20 parts per million
above the speed of light, the organization said in September.  “To me as a theoretician, it screams systemic error,”
Roberto Trotta, an astrophysicist at Imperial College,  London ,
said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
