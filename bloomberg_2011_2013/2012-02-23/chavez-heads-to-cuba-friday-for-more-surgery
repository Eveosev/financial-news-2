Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
will travel to Cuba tomorrow for a third operation in his battle
with cancer after receiving unanimous approval for a leave of
absence from the National Assembly today.  Chavez, 57, will be in Cuba for “more than five days,”
which is the minimum time spent outside the country that needs
approval from the National Assembly, according to the
constitution.  Chavez, who has been preparing to campaign for re-election
in October in a bid to extend his 13-year rule, said Feb. 21
that tests undertaken during a previously unannounced trip to
Cuba showed a lesion of about 2 centimeters in diameter in the
same area where a tumor was removed in June. It is “highly”
probable that the growth is malignant, in which case it will
need radiation therapy, he said.  “I know the news has caused worry for the immense majority
of my compatriots,” Chavez said in a letter read aloud by
congress secretary Ivan Zerpa. “I will return as I always
return with more energy, enthusiasm and happiness to take my
position in the vanguard.”  Chavez said in the letter that the operation can’t be
postponed, citing advice from his doctors.  Venezuela ’s opposition alliance, while approving the
request, demanded that Chavez name Vice President Elias Jaua as
interim head of state in his absence. National Assembly
President Diosdado Cabello denied the proposal, saying the issue
was already discussed when Chavez first traveled to Cuba for
treatment last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
