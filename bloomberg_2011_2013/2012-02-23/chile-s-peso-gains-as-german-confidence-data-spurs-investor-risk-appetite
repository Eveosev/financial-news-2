Chile ’s peso strengthened the most
in three weeks after a higher-than-forecast reading of business
confidence in  Germany  bolstered optimism about global growth and
spurred appetite for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 480.77 per dollar at the close
in Santiago, the biggest gain since Feb. 2, from 483.25
yesterday. The peso led advances among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The euro rose as much as 0.7 percent after the Munich-based
Ifo Institute said its business climate index climbed to 109.6,
its highest reading since July. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
expected the indicator to reach 108.8.  “The confidence figure from Germany pushed the euro and
that helped the peso,” Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency
trading at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a phone
interview.  The price of copper, Chile’s main export, fell as much as
1.6 percent on speculation of a slowdown in  China , which may
crimp demand for the metal.  Chile´s inflation is likely to slow “substantially” this
year from 2011, when the rate surged to 4.4 percent, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters in Santiago today.  Two-year breakeven inflation fell by two basis points to
3.04 percent, while two-year inflation swaps in pesos rose by
four basis points, to 4.93 percent. The yield on a basket of 10-
year inflation-adjusted bonds rose by one basis point to 2.44
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
