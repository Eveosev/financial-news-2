HSH Nordbank AG (BARC) , a regional German
lender that was bailed out during the financial crisis, sued
Barclays Bank Plc in  New York  over the purchase of
$122.7 million in residential mortgage-backed securities.  Barclays made “misrepresentations and omissions” in
offering materials about characteristics of the  mortgage loans 
underlying the securities, including the percentage of
properties occupied by the owners, Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank
said in a complaint filed today in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan.  Barclays “knew, or at a minimum was negligent in not
knowing, that its representations and omissions were false
and/or misleading at the time they were made,” according to the
complaint.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  A phone call to the press office at Barclays headquarters
in  London  after normal business hours seeking comment on the
lawsuit wasn’t answered.  The case is HSH Nordbank AG v. Barclays Bank Plc,
650508/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
