Peru’s sol rose to a three-year high
as companies bought the currency to pay local taxes and reports
on U.S. jobless claims and housing beat projections, fueling
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol climbed less than 0.1 percent to 2.6790 per  U.S.
dollar  at today’s close, compared with 2.68 yesterday, according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency also touched
2.6790 on Feb. 21, its strongest level since at least December
2008.  “Companies need soles to pay income taxes and everybody is
trying to get ahead of the payment period” that starts next
month, said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America
economist at 4Cast Inc. “On top of that, the global market is
getting better.”  U.S. stocks gained after applications for American jobless
benefits held at a four-year low, while a Federal Housing
Finance Agency index of housing prices rose 0.7 percent, beating
the median forecast for an increase of 0.1 percent among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Dominion Bond Rating Service raised the outlook on  Peru ’s
long-term foreign and local-currency debt today to positive from
stable, citing the country’s “greater policy space to face
adverse shocks and favorable medium-term growth prospects.”  The Toronto-based firm hasn’t changed its rating for Peru
since October 2007, when it raised the nation to BBB (low), the
lowest investment grade.  Investment inflows and rising exports may cause the sol to
strengthen to 2.64 per dollar by the end of December, Banco de
Credito del Peru, the country’s largest bank, said yesterday in
an e-mailed report to clients.  Peru’s central bank bought $119 million in the spot
currency market today to stem gains in the sol. It paid an
average 2.6790 soles per dollar, the bank said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.54 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.09 centimo to 115.35 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
