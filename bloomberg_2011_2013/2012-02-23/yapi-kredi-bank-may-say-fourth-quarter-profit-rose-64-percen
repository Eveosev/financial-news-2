Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK) , the Turkish
bank owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , may say fourth-
quarter profit rose an annual 64 percent, due to lower
provisions and stronger interest income.  Net income will probably be 461.1 million liras ($263
million), compared with 280.9 million liras in the fourth
quarter of 2010, according to the average of 11 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Predictions ranged from 334
million liras to 599 million liras. Yapi Kredi had a profit of
406.1 million liras in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of
31 percent from a year ago.  “Yapi Kredi’s provision expenditures for non-performing
loans will be lower in 2011 after an increase in the previous
year,” Hakan Aygun, analyst at Ak Investment in Istanbul, said
in a phone interview yesterday. “Interest income will also
grow, as in other banks.”  Yapi Kredi will report the earnings today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
