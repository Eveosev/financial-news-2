Plans to grant banks the use of new
domain names such as .fin and .bank will make it harder for
regulators to stop fraud,  Europe ’s top banking authority told
the group in charge of the Internet’s address system.  The domain names “have a great potential” for “misuse by
unscrupulous individuals,” Andrea Enria, chairman of the
 European Banking Authority , said in a letter to Barbara Clay,
vice-president for communications at the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers. The plans for the names should
be dropped, Enria said in the letter on the agency’s  website .  American Express Co., Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola Co.
are among more than 50 companies that signed a petition in
November saying the domain name expansion would increase their
costs and confuse consumers. They urged the U.S. Commerce
Department to persuade ICANN to suspend the application period
for the names, which closes April 12.  The EBA plans to issue an alert “warning consumers of
banking services to the risks of these new naming conventions,”
the London-based agency said in its opinion on the plans, also
sent to ICANN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
