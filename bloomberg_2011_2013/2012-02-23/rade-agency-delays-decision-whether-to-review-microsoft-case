A U.S. trade agency said it needs
more time to decide whether to review a judge’s findings that
 Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)  infringed one  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
patent and not six others.  The U.S. International Trade Commission said today it will
announce its decision March 2. It gave no reason for the delay
in a  notice  posted on its website. The agency has the power to
block imports of products found to violate U.S. patent rights.  Motorola Mobility, being bought by  Google Inc. (GOOG) , was accused
of infringing seven Microsoft patents, a charge it denies. ITC
Judge Theodore Essex sided with Motorola Mobility on six of the
seven patents. The six-member commission can uphold the judge,
modify his decision or overturn him.  Microsoft’s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components

Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
