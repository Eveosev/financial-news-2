MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the
pay-as-you-go U.S. wireless carrier, rose the most in more than
three years after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Net income jumped more than sixfold to $91 million, or 25
cents a share, from $14 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier, the
Richardson, Texas-based carrier said in a statement. Analysts
 projected  16 cents, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  MetroPCS curbed phone subsidies and marketing costs,
leading to better-than-expected earnings, said James Ratcliffe,
an analyst with  Barclays Capital  in New York. The cost of
acquiring new customers fell to $165.79 from $193.95 in the
third quarter. That was lower than the $200.20 projected by
Ratcliffe, who rates the shares “neutral.”  MetroPCS increased 14 percent to $11.70 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-gain since November 2008. The stock has
fallen 8.3 percent in the past 12 months.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 15 percent to $362 million, topping the
average estimate of $319.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
