Indonesia â€™s government plans to
begin relocating some prisoners away from the Kerobokan jail in
the resort island of Bali after hundreds of police were called
to regain control over rioting inmates two days ago.  Foreign and female prisoners will be gradually transferred
to other jails on the island, Bali Police spokesman Hariadi said
by telephone from Bali today, without providing further details.
The prison was designed to hold around 300 people and is
currently occupied by more than 1,000, he said.  Three inmates were injured during the riots and 800  police 
officers were sent to regain control, police spokesman Saud
Usman Nasution said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
