SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of
business management applications, proposed a dividend that
exceeded analysts’ estimates after posting record profit last
year that left shares of rival  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  trailing.  The executive board recommended a 25 percent increase of
its 2011 dividend to 75 cents a share, plus a one-time 35-cent
payout for its 40th anniversary, Walldorf, Germany-based SAP
said yesterday. Analysts had projected 72 cents, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock rose as much as 2.3 percent in Frankfurt. SAP
last month reported fourth-quarter revenue and operating profit
that beat estimates, while Oracle Corp. fell short in its most
recent quarter. SAP forecast profit will rise this year, boosted
by demand for analytics software and mobile programs. The new
dividend would see SAP paying out 38 percent of earnings to
shareholders at a cost of 1.3 billion euros, the company said.  “The best year in the history of our company should also
be the best year for our shareholders,” co-Chief Executive
Officers  Bill McDermott  and Jim Hagemann Snabe said in the
statement. “The proposed dividend enables our shareholders to
partake in our success.”  The shares gained as much as 1.16 euros to 50.73 euros and
traded at 50.69 euros as of 10:04 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock
had gained about 16 percent in the 12 months through yesterday,
compared with an 11 percent drop at Redwood City, California-
based Oracle and a 2 percent decline at  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) ,
which is based in  San Francisco .  Separately, SAP shares were rated “overweight” in resumed
coverage by Morgan Stanley, which set a price target of 60
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
