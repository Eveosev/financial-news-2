Telecom Egypt (ETEL) , the Arab country’s
fixed-line monopoly, said it has increased efforts to generate
revenue from “high-end” customers after profit fell 7 percent.  Net income dropped to 2.9 billion Egyptian pounds ($484
million) in 2011 from 3.1 billion pounds a year earlier, the
Cairo-based company said in a  statement  on its website today.
The average estimate of 16 analysts was for a profit of 2.85
billion pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of fixed-line subscribers fell by more than 1
million to 8 million at the end of last year, Chief Executive
Officer Tarek Aboualam said in a telephone interview today. In
the same year, Telecom Egypt’s Internet service subscribers
increased 26 percent to 1.1 million.  “We’re trying to focus on profitable customers more than
keeping customers with low ARPUs without any real impact on our
revenues,” Aboualam said, referring to average revenue per
user. The drop in fixed-line users was “expected and
controlled,” he said.  Telecom  Egypt ’s ARPU was at 53.5 pounds per month at the
end of 2011 compared with 53 pounds a year earlier, according to
the company.  Virtual-Network  The company plans to bid for a so-called virtual mobile-
network operator’s license when it is offered by the government
by the end of this quarter, Chairman Akil Bashir said by
telephone today. If acquired, the license will “enhance”
Telecom Egypt’s relationship with the country’s biggest mobile
network operator  Vodafone Egypt Telecommunications SAE (VODE) , a
company of which it already owns 45 percent, Bashir said. A VMNO
license allows companies that want to offer mobile phone
services to use the networks of existing operators.  Telecom Egypt’s board plans to recommend a 1.1-pound
 dividend  when it meets next month after shareholders approved a
30-piaster payout in January, bringing the total to 1.4 pounds
for 2011. That compares with a 1.3-pound dividend for 2010.  Shares of Telecom Egypt  rose 2.2 percent, the most in more
than a week, to 16 pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That
values the company at 27.3 billion pounds, and brings the
stock’s rise this year to 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
