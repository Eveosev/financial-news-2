U.S. home prices fell 2.4 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year earlier, as sales were boosted by
investors seeking lower-cost distressed properties.  Prices dropped 0.1 percent from the prior three months on a
seasonally adjusted basis, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency 
said today in a  report  from  Washington . In December, prices
retreated 0.8 percent from a year earlier, while increasing 0.7
percent from the previous month.  Foreclosures (FORLTOTL)  are boosting the supply of properties on the
market and dragging down values for all houses. Banks may seize
more than 1 million U.S. homes this year after legal scrutiny of
their foreclosure practices slowed actions against delinquent
property owners in 2011,  RealtyTrac Inc.  said last month.  Distressed properties, comprising foreclosures and short
sales in which the lender agrees to a transaction for less than
the mortgage balance, accounted for 35 percent of all existing-
home purchases in January, the National Association of Realtors
said yesterday.  The FHFA’s House Price Index measures changes in real
estate values using purchases of properties with mortgages
backed by  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  or  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  It doesn’t provide a
specific price for homes.  As measured by the National Association of Realtors, the
median home  price  was $162,200 in December. In January, it fell
to $154,700, the trade group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
