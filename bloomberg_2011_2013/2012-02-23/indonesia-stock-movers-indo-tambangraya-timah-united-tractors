Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  fell 0.9 percent to 3,958.81,
its second day of declines.  Banks:  PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI)  , the nation’s biggest bank
by assets, dropped 2.3 percent to 6,300 rupiah, the first loss
since Feb. 15.  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI)  , the second-

the central bank’s target of a maximum 5.5 percent if the
government were to increase subsidized fuel prices by more than
1,000 rupiah a liter, Bank  Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution
said today.  “With inflation on the rise, we believe there is no more
room to lower  interest rates  at least in the short term,” Harry
Su, head of research at PT Bahana Securities, wrote in a note
today. “We advise investors to stay away from interest-rate
sensitive sectors: bank, auto and property.”  PT Timah (TINS)  , Indonesia’s biggest tin producer, fell
1.2 percent to 2,000 rupiah, its first drop in five days.
Refined-tin shipments from Indonesia, the world’s largest
exporter, may decline 11 percent in the first quarter to 20,000
metric tons, the lowest level in two years, as monsoon rains
disrupt mining, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  PT United Tractors (UNTR)  , Indonesia’s largest heavy
equipment seller, dropped 3.3 percent to 28,250 rupiah. The
company’s heavy-equipment sales in January fell to 617 units,
from 731 units a year earlier, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
