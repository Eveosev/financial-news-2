Gap Inc. (GPS) , the largest U.S. apparel
chain, forecast profit this year that was less than some
analysts estimated as sales declined at its  Old Navy  stores.  Profit in the year ending in January 2013 will be $1.75 a
share to $1.80 a share, San Francisco-based Gap said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $1.80.  Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Murphy  failed to boost
holiday sales at Old Navy after introducing a new marketing
campaign for the more-than-1,000-store chain during the third
quarter. The company yesterday said former Nike Inc. executive
Jill Stanton will become creative adviser for Old Navy, which
lost president Tom Wyatt last month.  “Old Navy is at the essence of the issue with Gap,”  Craig Johnson , president of Customer Growth Partners in New Canaan,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview before results were
announced. “They’ve made some cosmetic changes, but it’s going
to have to be more radical to save the brand.”  Gap rose 0.3 percent to $23.60 at 4:11 p.m. in New York.
The shares fell 16 percent last year.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 40 percent to $218 million,
or 44 cents a share, from $365 million, or 60 cents, a year
earlier, the company said. Analysts projected 42 cents, the
average of 28  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Comparable-store sales at North American Old Navy locations
and associated online sales fell 6 percent in the quarter,
compared with a 4 percent decline for the company overall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
