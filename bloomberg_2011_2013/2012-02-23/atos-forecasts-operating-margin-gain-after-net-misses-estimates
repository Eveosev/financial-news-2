Atos (ATO) , the French computer-services
supplier for this year’s  Olympic Games  in  London , plans to raise
its operating margin in 2012 after reporting profit that fell
short of analyst estimates.  Net income jumped 57 percent in 2011 to 182 million euros
($241 million), while sales rose 36 percent to 6.8 billion
euros, the Paris-based company said today in a  statement .
Analysts were expecting net income of 220 million euros on sales
of 6.8 billion, according to  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings were helped by the purchase of Siemens IT
Solutions and Services in July. Atos, which expanded in Germany
and central and eastern Europe with the Siemens IT takeover,
forecast today that the operating margin will reach 6.5 percent
in 2012, and free  cash flow  will be about 250 million euros. The
company will post a “slight” increase in sales at existing
units. Revenue on that basis rose 0.3 percent in 2011.  Operating profit last year totaled 422.4 million euros,
raising the margin to 6.2 percent of revenue from 4.3 percent in
2010. Analysts had predicted an operating margin of 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
