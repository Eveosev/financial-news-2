Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  Chairman  Charlie Ergen  asked U.S. regulators for immediate approval of a plan for
a nationwide high-speed network for wireless Internet devices.  Ergen met yesterday with Federal Communications Commission
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  and other agency officials,
according to a filing by Dish posted today on the agency’s
website.  Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider
behind  DirecTV (DTV) , asked the FCC in August for clearance to buy
assets of DBSD North America Inc. and TerreStar Networks Inc.
and for license waivers that would let it offer high-speed data
service.  Incumbent mobile providers say Dish’s proposed network may
cause interference to other services, and have asked the FCC to
consider Ergen’s proposal as part of a broad rulemaking on new
uses of airwaves.  CTIA-The Wireless Association, with members including
largest U.S. mobile providers Verizon Wireless and  AT&T Inc. (T) ,
asked for the rulemaking in an Oct. 17 filing. Dish is seeking
waivers “that would appear to eviscerate” some restrictions on
airwaves use, the association said.  Dish in the filing said approval of its service now
wouldn’t preclude a broad rulemaking later, and it would “look
forward to participating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
