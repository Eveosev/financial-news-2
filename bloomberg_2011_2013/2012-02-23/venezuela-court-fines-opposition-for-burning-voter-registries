Venezuela ’s  Supreme Court  fined the
head of the opposition coalition’s election body 15,200 bolivars
($3,500) for defying an order to hand over a voter list compiled
during a Feb. 12 primary and instead burning the register to
preserve voter anonymity.  The Supreme Court ruled that Teresa Albanes allowed the
registry books to be burned in spite of the ruling that followed
a candidate’s complaint, according to a statement. The attorney
general’s office is studying whether Albanes could be
imprisoned, the court said in the  statement .  Albanes said Feb. 15 the opposition alliance met an
agreement it made with the National Electoral Council to destroy
the books within 48 hours of the vote. Concern that the
registries could be used by the government to block opposition
voters from state jobs has grown since an ally of President  Hugo Chavez  published a list of Venezuelans who signed a petition to
force a 2004 vote on whether to cut short his term in office.  Government supporters have questioned the electoral
process, casting doubt on the 3 million votes registered during
the primary. Miranda state Governor Henrique Capriles Radonski
won with 64 percent against 30 percent for Zulia state Governor
Pablo Perez and will face Chavez in an Oct. 7 vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
