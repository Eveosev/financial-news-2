Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the private-
equity firm that manages $48 billion in real estate assets,
agreed to buy the logistics holdings of  Gecina SA (GFC)  for about 203
million euros ($246 million).  Blackstone, based in New York, will pay 13.9 percent less
than the appraised value of the 28 properties at the end of
2011, Gecina, Paris’s largest publicly traded office landlord,
said in a statement today. The occupancy rate is 82.7 percent,
it said.  Last year, Blackstone spent more than $11 billion on real
estate purchases including the U.S. holdings of  Centro
Properties Group  for $9.2 billion. The sale marks Gecina’s exit
from the logistics business as it focuses on homes, student
housing and health-care assets, according to the statement. The
company will retain two “non-significant” logistics assets.  Gecina expects to raise more than 1.2 billion euros from
asset sales this year, the company said in a separate statement.
In the first half, it sold or agreed to sell 975 million euros
of real estate, contributing to a 2 percent increase in
recurring net income, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
