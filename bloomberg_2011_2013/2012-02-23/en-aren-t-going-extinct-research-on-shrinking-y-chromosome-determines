Men aren’t going extinct, scientists
assured the world yesterday.  The Y chromosome, the strand of DNA that determines male
sex, contained about 800 genes some 200 million years ago. Now,
though, it has only 30, leading some scientists to conclude it
could disappear altogether, bringing about the end of men.  That’s probably not the case, said Jennifer Hughes, a
researcher with the  Whitehead Institute  for Biomedical Research,
in Cambridge,  Massachusetts . The number of genes on the
chromosome has been stable for at least the past 25 million
years, she and her colleagues found in a study reported in the
journal Nature.  “Although the Y chromosome did suffer quite a bit over the
course of evolution, it seems like what remains of it is not
going anywhere,” Hughes said in a telephone interview. “The
genes that remain on it have critical biological functions, and
that means they are going to survive.”  Hughes and colleagues compared chromosomes of humans to a
Rhesus monkey, a species that split from human ancestors 25
million years ago, and that of chimpanzees, which separated 6
million years ago.  The data led them to conclude that the Y chromosome decays
quickly at first, then stabilizes and keeps genes important to
continuing its existence, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
