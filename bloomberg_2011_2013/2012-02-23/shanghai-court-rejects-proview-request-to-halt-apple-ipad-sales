A court in  Shanghai  rejected a
request by the Shenzhen unit of  Proview International Holdings
Ltd. (334)  to halt sales of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad tablet in the city, the
lawyer for the Chinese company said.  The Pudong District Court’s decision is “wrong” and
Proview’s Shenzhen-based unit will appeal the ruling, Roger Xie,
an attorney for the company, said in an interview yesterday.
Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu, based in Beijing, said she didn’t
immediately have information available on the issue.  Proview’s Shenzhen unit had asked the Shanghai court on
Feb. 22 to stop sales of the iPad in the city because it
infringes on a trademark the company received in 2001. The
Shanghai court suspended the case to allow another court time to
deliver a ruling on who owns the trademark.  “I don’t agree with their reason,” Xie said of
yesterday’s ruling in Shanghai. “They should protect the
interest of the trademark holder in compliance with  China  law.
We will appeal.”  Apple says it purchased Proview’s iPad trademark in China
in 2009 and sued Proview over the rights in 2010 in the Shenzhen
Intermediate People’s Court.  The Shenzhen court rejected Apple’s claim in November and
said its contract with Proview’s Taipei-based unit failed to
prove the transfer was authorized by the owner in Shenzhen.
Apple appealed the loss and a hearing of that case is scheduled
for Feb. 29 before the Higher People’s Court of Guangdong.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
