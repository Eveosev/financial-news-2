Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable company, sued a unit of  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  alleging
infringement of four telecommunications patents.  Comcast “has been irreparably harmed by that infringement
and will suffer additional damages,” unless the court prevents
additional infringement, lawyers for the company said in a
complaint filed Feb. 21 in Delaware federal court.  Scott M. Sloat, a spokesman for  Overland Park , Kansas-based
Sprint, said the company couldn’t immediately comment on the
lawsuit.  Comcast contends that services provided by Sprint, the
nation’s third-largest wireless phone company, misappropriate
technology used for accessing communication data, determining a
telephone number and optimizing a telephony network.  Comcast last week filed a separate suit against Sprint
claiming infringement of four other telecommunication patents in
federal court in Philadelphia. Sprint sued Philadelphia-based
Comcast and three other cable companies in December alleging
infringement of patents related to transmitting phone calls over
digital lines.  To see the patents, click: 7,012,916; 7,206,304; 7,903,641;
6,873,694.  The case is Comcast v. Sprint, 12-cv-00205, U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
