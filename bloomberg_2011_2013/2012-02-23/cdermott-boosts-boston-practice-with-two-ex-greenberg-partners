McDermott Will & Emery LLP (1121L)  hired
 John A. Sten  and  Jason C. Moreau , both formerly of  Greenberg
Traurig LLP (1153L) , as partners to expand the law firm’s trial practice
in  Boston .  Sten, 43, has experience with federal and state securities
and commodities litigation, McDermott said today in a statement.
He previously served as chairman of the Greenberg Boston
office’s securities and broker-dealer practices.  Moreau, 38, whose practice concentrates on commercial
litigation and disputes, also worked out of Greenberg’s Boston
office, McDermott said.  “In view of today’s heightened regulatory and enforcement
environment, the new whistle-blower statutes and the
complexities of Dodd-Frank legislation, John and Jason will add
tremendous value to our litigation team,” Mark W. Pearlstein,
partner-in-charge of McDermott’s Boston office, said in the
statement.  McDermott had revenue of $825.5 million in 2011, a 4.7
percent increase from the previous year,  according  to the
American Lawyer, a trade publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
