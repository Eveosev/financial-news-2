Asia ’s naphtha crack spread widened
from the lowest in four days, signaling higher profit for
refiners making the petrochemical feedstock. PetroChina Co. sold
gasoil fuel-oil cargoes in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $122.98 a metric ton at 3 p.m. Singapore time
from $119.32, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of processing profit, was $134.04 on Feb.
20, the highest in three weeks.  Vitol Group bought 50,000 barrels of  92-RON gasoline  from
Total SA at $131.50 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought three 150,000-barrel cargoes
of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5 percent in  Singapore , according
to the Bloomberg survey. PetroChina paid 20 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes to load from March 9 to March 13, BP Plc paid a
10-cent premium for March 10 to March 14 and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc bought at parity for March 11 to March 15. Brightoil
Petroleum Holdings Ltd. sold a similar cargo for March 20 to
March 24 to Glencore International Plc at a premium of 10 cents
a barrel.  PetroChina sold two 150,000-barrel cargoes of gasoil with
10 parts-per-million of sulfur for March 9 to March 13 loading,
the survey showed. Shell and BP each paid $2.40 a barrel above
benchmark quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude increased 59
cents to $16.44 a barrel at 2:37 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the
widest  crack spread  so far this week.  Jet fuel  declined 5 cents to a 70 cent-a-barrel premium to
gasoil, PVM said. This  regrade  turned positive on Feb. 21 after
more than five weeks at a discount, indicating it has become
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  PetroChina sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180) 
fuel oil in Singapore, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
Chinese producer received $7 a ton over benchmark quotes from
Vitol to load from March 20 to March 24 and a $6 premium from
Mercuria Energy Ltd. for March 14 to March 18.  Kuo Oil Ltd. sold 20,000 tons of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380)  grade to
Brightoil Petroleum at $6.25 a ton above benchmark quotes, for
March 20 to March 24 loading, the survey showed. Hin Leong
bought a similar cargo for March 9 to March 13 from Lukoil OAO,
which sold four cargoes yesterday.  Fuel oil  fell 53 cents to $5.63 a barrel below Dubai crude
at 2:37 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data. The  discount  has
widened 19 percent so far this week, indicating losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after rising to
$10.75 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  Refinery News  Cosmo Oil Co. plans to idle the No. 2 crude-distillation
unit at its refinery in Chiba, Japan, for maintenance from the
end of April until the beginning of June, according to a company
official, who asked not to be identified because the information
has not been made public.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.’s Jinling refinery
produced China IV grade gasoline that met government standards,
parent China Petrochemical Corp. said in its online newsletter
today. This has similar specifications to the Euro IV grade.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. shut a 9,300 barrel-a-day
alkylation unit at its Mizushima A refinery in western  Japan 
today after a fire, a company official said.  The unit caught fire around 11:45 a.m. local time,
according to a statement on the company’s website. The fire,
extinguished in 20 minutes, did not affect operations of the
150,000 barrel-a-day crude distillation unit at the refinery,
according to the official, who declined to be identified because
of company policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
