UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  shifted 150,000 tons
of paper production to  Finland  from central  Europe  after the
government cut taxes on energy, newspaper Kauppalehti reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Jussi Pesonen.  UPM is running mills at a higher rate to achieve the output
increase, which adds about 100 million euros ($133 million) to
Finnish exports annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
