U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  to the highest level since May 2008,
amid better-than-estimated housing and jobs market reports.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , which  comprises  12
percent of the share-price weighted Dow, added 28 points to the
index.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  rose 3.1 percent as the largest
consumer-products company said it will cut 5,700 jobs.
PulteGroup Inc. and KB Home advanced at least 4.3 percent to
pace gains in homebuilders.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  soared 19
percent as it plans to raise as much as $770 million by selling
11 store sites and separating some smaller-format businesses.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.4 percent to
1,363.46 at 4 p.m. in  New York , erasing earlier losses. The
benchmark gauge briefly rose above its April 2011 peak of
 1,363.61 (SPX) , which was the highest level since June 2008. The Dow
gained 46.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,984.69. The  Russell
2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies rallied 1.6 percent to 829.23.  “The recovery is starting to pick up speed,” Tom Wirth,
who helps manage $1.5 billion as senior investment officer for
Chemung Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York, said in a phone
interview. “There was so much fear about what was happening in
 Europe  that people couldn’t see through all of that.”  Stocks gained as applications for  jobless benefits  were
unchanged in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since
March 2008. A report from the  Federal Housing Finance Agency 
showed that a gauge of  home prices  jumped 0.7 percent in
December, beating estimates. The euro rose to the strongest
level in more than 10 weeks against the dollar as a report
showed German business confidence climbed.  Monthly Gain  Today’s advance extended the  S&P 500 ’s rally in February to
3.9 percent. The index was poised for a third straight month of
gains, the  longest streak  in a year, on higher-than-estimated
economic data. Still, it was the second time this week that the
S&P 500 failed to hold above its highest close since 2008.  “Sometimes when you’re knocking on the door of a
meaningful psychological level you have to knock hard a few
times to gain admittance,”  David Sowerby , a Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan-based portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co., which
oversees more than $155 billion, said in a phone interview.
“Valuation is compelling. There’s been improvement in the
economy. That provides potential for stocks to move higher.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, tumbled 7.6 percent to 16.80, the lowest since
July. The Dow Jones Transportation Average added 0.7 percent,
following a  three-day slump . Nineteen out of 30 stocks in the
Dow advanced. IBM jumped 1.9 percent, the second-biggest gain in
the Dow, to $197.61.  Cost Savings  Procter & Gamble rallied the most in the Dow, rising 3.1
percent to $66.42. The cuts include 1,600 announced in January
and will be achieved through attrition and layoffs, Paul Fox, a
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The reductions are part of a plan
to achieve $10 billion in cost savings by 2016, as detailed
today by Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald and Chief
Financial Officer Jon Moeller at a conference in  Florida .  A gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes climbed 2.3 percent.
 KB Home (KBH)  added 4.4 percent to $11.75. PulteGroup advanced 4.8
percent to $8.73.  Sears surged 19 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$61.80. The rights offering to separate the Hometown and Outlet
shops and some hardware stores may raise $400 million to $500
million,  Hoffman Estates , Illinois-based Sears said today in a
statement. The 11 sites will be sold to General Growth
Properties for about $270 million, the retailer said.  Almost Doubled  Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  soared 78 percent to $18.73 after the company’s
pill Qnexa won the backing of a regulatory panel, moving the
drug a step closer to gaining U.S. approval as the first new
obesity treatment in 13 years.  Target Corp. (TGT)  jumped 2.9 percent to $54.50. The second-
largest U.S. discount retailer posted fourth-quarter earnings
that exceeded some analysts’ estimates, helped by discount card
initiatives and grocery sales.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  rallied 14 percent to $11.70.
The pay-as-you-go U.S. wireless carrier reported fourth-quarter
profit that beat analysts’  estimates .  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rose 0.7 percent to a record $516.39. Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Cook , speaking today at an annual investor
meeting, said Apple was continuing “active discussions” about
what to do with its $97.6 billion in cash and investments,
saying the cash hoard was “more than we need to run a
company.”  HP Tumbles  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP)  dropped the most in the Dow, slumping
6.5 percent to $27.05. The U.S. computer manufacturer’s fiscal
second-quarter profit forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates
as consumers curtailed personal-computer purchases.  Solar shares fell after  Germany , the world’s biggest market
for solar power, plans record reductions in subsidies for the
industry as part of a program to rein in a boom in
installations.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  declined 8 percent to $37.20.
 Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  tumbled 12 percent to $8.63.  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  declined 7.6 percent to $20.95. The grocer’s
fourth-quarter sales excluding fuel at stores open at least one
year increased 1.5 percent, trailing the average 2 percent gain
expected by analysts.  The rally in U.S. stocks has pushed a trend measure of the
S&P 500 to an “extreme” level not seen since 2004, a sign that
the advance may be stalling, according to Sundial Capital
Research Inc.  The benchmark gauge’s Average Directional Index, which
measures the strength of a trend, climbed to 40.7 yesterday. The
last time the indicator was higher following an advance, in
November 2004, the S&P 500 was stuck in a 93-point range over
the next eight months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The trend is “extended,” Jason Goepfert, president of
Sundial in Blaine,  Minnesota , wrote in a note yesterday.
“Almost every time, by the time the trend becomes this strong,
it’s about to become significantly less so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
