Vietnam ’s  three-year bonds  rose on
speculation some banks have surplus cash to invest. The dong was
steady.  The State Bank of Vietnam is limiting lenders’ loan growth
to reduce bad debts and boost investor confidence, according to
a statement on its website on Feb. 13.  “Liquidity at some big commercial banks has improved as
they haven’t lent out too much so far this year because the
central bank limited their credit growth,” said Hanoi-based
Tran Thanh Thao, a fixed-income analyst at Thang Long Securities
Joint-Stock Co. “That has left them with more cash to buy
bonds.”  The yield on three-year notes fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 11.99 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,838 per dollar as of 2:30
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed its daily reference  rate  at
20,828, unchanged from yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
