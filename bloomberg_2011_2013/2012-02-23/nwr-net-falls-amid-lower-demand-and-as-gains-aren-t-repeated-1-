New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the largest
Czech coking-coal company, said full-year profit fell 44 percent
as demand declined and a gain from the sale of an energy unit
and a tax refund from last year weren’t repeated.  Net income for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 was 130 million
euros ($172 million) compared with 233 million euros a year
earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said in a Regulatory News
Service statement. Revenue fell 3 percent to 1.63 billion euros,
almost matching an estimate of 1.64 billion euros in a Bloomberg
survey.  The “progressive” deterioration of business confidence in
the euro-area, combined with an “uncertain” economic outlook,
“significantly” compounded a slowing in demand for steel and
its raw materials, Executive Chairman Mike Salamon said in the
statement. The company does see a “strong” trend with thermal
coal in 2012.  Regional Customers  NWR produces coking, or steelmaking, coal and thermal coal
and owns mines and coking facilities in the Czech Republic and
 Poland . It sells coal to customers including the Czech unit of
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker. The miner booked
a gain of $82 million from a sale of its energy unit and a  tax
refund  of 23 million euros in 2011.  NWR’s coke sales suffered due to lower capacity utilization
by steel producers and the company’s coke business made an
“overall” loss in 2012, the company said today. The board
proposed a final dividend of 0.07 euro, which will bring the
full-year dividend to 0.23 euro a share.  NWR fell 1.8 percent to 505 pence as of 8:26 a.m. in London
trading and was little changed in Prague, its home market, at
150 koruna after earlier falling as much as 6 percent.  Steel capacity utilization is about 70 percent in the
region, which is down year on year, rebounding from a low in
2009, Salamon said in a phone interview. Demand in the region
for steel has been very “buoyant” and the company is seeing
mills bringing back capacity, Salamon said.  Thermal coal demand has been underpinned by the demise of
nuclear reactors, particularly in  Germany , and Polish production
continued to fall, Salamon said.  The miner plans to produce 10.8 million to 11 million
metric tons of coal and have external sales in 2012 of 10.25
million metric tons to 10.5 million metric tons, it said.  NWR expects to increase the proportion of coking coal in
its external sales mix to more than 50 percent in two to three
years, depending on underground development works and mining
conditions. The external sales split for 2012 is seen at about
48 percent of coking coal and 52 of thermal coal.  NWR will watch the markets “closely” to take advantage of
opportunities either to raise new financing and to refinance
debt, it said. The company’s first significant debt maturity is
not until 2015, according to the statement.  The miner’s balance sheet remains “robust” and the
company is not under any time pressure to seek refinancing,
Salamon added.  Fourth-quarter net income declined to 8.8 million euros
from 69.7 million euros in the year-ago period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
