Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the German bank that
posted the biggest decline on the benchmark DAX Index last year,
may pay a larger share of the bonuses of top earners with stock
in future.  “We’re looking into whether it would make sense, we’ll
also have this discussion with our employees,” Chief Financial
Officer  Eric Strutz  said today on a conference call from
Frankfurt. “There’s a trend toward having more shares within
the payment structure, especially of risk takers and this is
something the regulators expect.”  Commerzbank last month asked employees to accept stock as
part of their bonuses in a bid to raise 250 million euros
($332.5 million) of capital by the end June to help the lender
meet regulatory requirements. While the plan to ask employees to
help raise capital is a “one-time event,” the bank is looking
into whether it can use shares more often for people with a
“significant amount” of variable pay, Strutz said.   Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing , whose annual
salary is capped at 500,000 euros, said today that the drop in
the value of his Commerzbank shareholdings exceeded his net pay
over the past four years. Blessing didn’t specify the time frame
for the decline in the value of his shares in the bank.  Commerzbank (CBK)  has climbed almost 50 percent in  Frankfurt 
trading this year after slumping 71 percent in 2011 amid the
sovereign debt crisis and concern that  Germany ’s second-largest
bank would require taxpayer aid to meet capital targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
