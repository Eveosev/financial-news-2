U.K. mortgage approvals rose in
January to the highest in two years as buyers tried to complete
purchases before a property tax suspension ends, the British
Bankers’ Association said.  Lenders granted 38,092 loans to buy homes, up from a
revised 36,553 in December, the London-based lobby group said
in an e-mailed report today. From a year earlier, mortgage
approvals rose 34 percent from 28,539.  “January saw the high street banks approve more mortgages
for house purchase than of late, despite low household
confidence, as some people try to complete transactions before
the stamp duty holiday ends in March,” BBA statistics director
 David Dooks  said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
