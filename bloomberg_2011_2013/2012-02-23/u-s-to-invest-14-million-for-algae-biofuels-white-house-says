The Energy Department plans to
invest $14 million to make transportation fuels out of algae,
according to the White House.  “We could replace up to 17 percent of the oil we import
for transportation with this fuel that we can grow right here in
the  United States ,” President  Barack Obama  said today in Miami
during a speech on energy policy. “That means greater  energy
security ” and a “stronger economy,” he said.  Algae, a plant-like organism without roots, can be
harvested from ponds near industrial sites, where it can grow
from power-plant  carbon emissions  or wastewater substances, the
White House said in a fact sheet. The Energy Department is
backing about $85 million for more than 30 projects to develop
biofuels from algae, it said.  Biofuels from algae may be used as a substitute for
gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, Obama said. The president is
seeking to begin construction on at least four commercial-scale
refineries for biofuels by 2013, according to the White House
fact sheet.  The Energy Department plans to ask small businesses,
universities and national laboratories to create “test beds”
to conduct research on algae biofuels, according to an agency
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
