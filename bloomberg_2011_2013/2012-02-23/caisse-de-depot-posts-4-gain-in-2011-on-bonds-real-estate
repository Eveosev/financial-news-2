Caisse de Depot et Placement du
 Quebec , Canada’s biggest pension  fund manager , posted a 4
percent investment return last year, fueled by gains in
infrastructure and  fixed income .  Net investment income fell to C$5.7 billion ($5.71 billion)
from C$17.7 billion a year earlier when the returns were 14
percent, the Montreal-based manager said today in a statement.
The Caisse’s assets as of Dec. 31 increased to C$159 billion
from C$157.9 billion at the end of June.  The Caisse beat the 0.5 percent return of Canadian pension
funds last year, as estimated in a Jan. 23 report by RBC Dexia
Investor Services Ltd. Chief Executive Officer  Michael Sabia 
said in August the Caisse wasn’t immune to market turmoil in a
“highly uncertain” global economy after disclosing a first-
half return of 3.6 percent.  “We managed to navigate through a difficult year,” Sabia
said today at a press conference in  Montreal . “The Caisse is
stronger, more agile today.”  Infrastructure fared best among investment classes last
year, returning 23 percent. The Caisse has about C$5.8 billion
in infrastructure assets such as airports, hospitals and
pipelines. Real-return bonds rose 18 percent, contributing to a
14 percent return for the Caisse’s C$25.2 billion “inflation-
sensitive” portfolio.  Fixed-income investments returned 10 percent last year,
fueled by a 19 percent gain in long-term bonds. The Caisse has
C$58.8 billion invested in fixed income, including C$41.6
billion in bonds and C$6.8 billion in short-term investments.  Stocks Underperform  Equities, the Caisse’s largest asset class with C$72.8
billion, declined 4.2 percent, the pension manager said.
Canadian stocks, where the Caisse has C$18.6 billion under
management, dropped 11 percent, while the C$8.1 billion
portfolio of U.S. stocks returned 4.6 percent.  Canada ’s benchmark  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX) 
dropped about 11 percent last year, lagging behind the
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which ended the
year virtually unchanged.  The Caisse said it has begun an “in-depth review” of its
Canadian equity portfolio “to ensure that it is well aligned
with the new market conditions.”  Real estate gained 11 percent in 2011, underperforming the
16 percent return of its benchmark. The Caisse, which has C$18.2
billion invested in property, said it plans to spend more than
C$700 million for Brazilian malls this year, doubling the value
of its real estate holdings in the country.  Quebecor Stake  The value of the Caisse’s stake in Quebecor Media Inc., a
Montreal-based cable television and newspaper company, was C$2.3
billion at year-end, Sabia said at the press conference. The
pension, which owns 45 percent of Quebecor Media as part of its
private equity portfolio, paid about C$3.2 billion for the stake
in 2000.  The pension manager is expanding its research teams in
areas such as mining and  emerging markets , Sabia said at the
press conference. The Caisse hired about 50 new people last year
and now has about 770 employees, he said.  Liquidity topped C$45 billion as of Dec. 31, the Caisse
said. The reserves will enable the fund manager to “meet all
its potential obligations, even in the event of a significant
market correction.”  Caisse de Depot oversees pensions for retirees in the
French-speaking province. The Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, which had C$152.8 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, covers
every Canadian province except Quebec.  To contact the reporters on this story:
