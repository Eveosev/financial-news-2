Dubai’s shares rose to the highest
level in almost 10 months as investors bought low-priced stocks
on bets the Dubai economy is recovering and after corporate
earnings topped analysts’ estimates.  Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR) , the property company controlled by
Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, soared to the highest level in almost
two years. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 1.5 percent to
1,632.27 at the 2:00 p.m. close in the emirate, the highest
level since April 28. Gulf Navigation Holding gained for a sixth
day.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  and the Bloomberg GCC 200
Index added 0.2 percent. About 564  million shares  traded in
Dubai today, compared with the 12-month daily average of 114
million shares.  “The market is resilient and the move is more on the
small-denomination-type shares,” said  Haissam Arabi , the Dubai-
based chief executive officer at Gulfmena Investments Ltd.
“Investor interest is coming back, the valuations are good, the
numbers that are coming out are better-than-expected and the
banks are doing well,” he said.  Earnings of property companies based in Dubai are starting
to recover after prices plunged more than 60 percent from their
2008 peak as speculators fled the market amid the global credit
crisis. Emaar Properties PJSC, Dubai’s biggest publicly traded
developer, is among companies whose quarterly profit beat
estimates.  Best-Performer  Deyaar, the biggest mover on the index today, has soared 75
percent since reporting on Feb. 4 it returned to full-year
profit in 2011 following a loss a year earlier. The stock
advanced 13.1 percent to 39.6 fils today, the highest since May
2010. Gulf Navigation, the most-active share by volume, soared
14.3 percent to 36.8 fils.  Dubai’s economy may expand as much as 5 percent this year
after growing more than 3 percent last year, Sheikh Ahmed bin
Saeed  Al Maktoum , head of Dubai’s Supreme Fiscal Policy
Committee, said this month.  The emirate’s benchmark, which tumbled 17 percent last
year, has risen 21 percent this year and is the best performer
in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. The gauge trades at
10.1 times estimated 2012 earnings compared with 10.7 for the
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   “The drop last year was unjustified, so it is right that
we have a re-rating or an upward correction to the unnecessary
penalty that we paid last year,” Arabi said.  In Abu Dhabi, the measure rose to 2,539.2 points, extending
its gains this year to 5.7 percent. Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.4
percent, Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced 0.5 percent and Kuwait’s
 gauge  climbed less than 0.1 percent. Bahrain’s  BB All Share
