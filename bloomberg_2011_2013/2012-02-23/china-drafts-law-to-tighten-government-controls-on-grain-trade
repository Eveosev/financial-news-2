China , the world’s biggest grain
consumer, has drafted a law to tighten controls over the
production and trade of grains, including a clause that forbids
the unauthorized use of genetically modified seeds.  The proposed law defines the authority of agencies in
controlling and monitoring markets, including rules legitimizing
government powers to limit the size of a company’s operations,
imports and exports of grains, according to  statements  on the
State Council’s website dated Feb. 21, which said the government
is seeking public feedback before enacting the legislation.  The research, experiment, sales and imports and exports of
genetically modified seeds must comply with government rules and
no businesses or individuals should engage in the unauthorized
application of biotechnology in major grains, it said.  “It’s normal” that the government continues to be
cautious about genetically modified crop seeds, Tommy Xiao,
analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., said by e-mail. “The
approval will take some time and due process,” he said.  --William Bi. Editors: Jarrett Banks, Ovais Subhani  To contact the reporter on this story:
