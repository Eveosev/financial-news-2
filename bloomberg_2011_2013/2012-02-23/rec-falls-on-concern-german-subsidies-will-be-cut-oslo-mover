Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC) , a
Norwegian maker of solar energy components, was the biggest
loser in the benchmark  OBX (OBX)  index as Germany accelerated cuts in
subsidies for solar energy facilities.  The shares fell as much as 8.7 percent, and were down 8.2
percent, the biggest drop in the OBX, to 4.38 kroner as of 14:50
p.m. in the Norwegian capital. It was the largest decliner today
in the  Bloomberg Global Large Solar Energy - Principal Business
Index. (BISOLAR)   Germany will reduce rates paid for solar power to between
0.195 euros and 0.135 euros per kilowatt hour from March 9 and
cut them each month starting in May, Environment Minister
Norbert Roettgen said today. Subsidies to plants bigger than 10
megawatts will stop after July 1. Germany is the world’s biggest
market for solar power.  Investors were “cautious ahead of that and are afraid it
will impact demand from Germany,” Haakon Levy, an analyst with
DNB Markets, said before the announcement. REC’s exposure to
changes in demand has become more pronounced as it sells more of
its polysilicon output on the  spot market , he said.  REC and competitors such as Solarworld AG and Q-Cells SE
have cut production amid over supply as demand shrinks in  Europe 
after Germany, France and Italy have reduced subsidies to cap
booming solar installations.  Germany’s feed-in tariff system ensures solar power
providers receive above market rates for the energy they supply
in order to encourage investment in renewable energy sources as
the country seeks to substitute its nuclear reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
