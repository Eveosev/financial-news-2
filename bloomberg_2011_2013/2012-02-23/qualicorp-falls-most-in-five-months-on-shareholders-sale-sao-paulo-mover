Qualicorp SA, a Brazilian health-
insurance broker, fell the most in five months after saying
controlling shareholder  Carlyle Group (CG)  and founder Jose Seripieri Filho plan to sell existing shares in the company in a public
offering.  Qualicorp dropped 4.8 percent to 16 reais at 4:13 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo , and earlier retreated 6.1 percent for the biggest
intraday decline since Sept. 22. The shares have lost 4.5
percent this year.  “You have a large quantity of shares coming to the
market,” said Joao Carlos dos Santos, an equity analyst at
Banco BTG Pactual SA in Sao Paulo. “The fact that the company’s
founder is also selling shares is a bit unusual and a bit more
negative.”  The offering, which is being managed by Credit Suisse Group
AG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and  Banco Bradesco (BBDC4)  BBI SA,
could total as much as 850 million reais ($498 million),  Valor
Economico  reported today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  may also
participate in the sale, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Qualicorp declined to comment in an e-mailed statement.  Washington-based Carlyle owns 39.7 percent of Qualicorp
through investment vehicle BHCS FIP, while Seripieri holds 28
percent through a vehicle named L2 FIP, according to the
company’s website. The company and its shareholders raised 943.6
million reais in an initial public offering in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
