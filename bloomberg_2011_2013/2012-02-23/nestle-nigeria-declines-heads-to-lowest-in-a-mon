Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) , the West
African nation’s largest food company by market value, headed
for the lowest close in a month after its final dividend
disappointed investors.  The stock fell 4.8 percent to 420 naira as of 10.43 a.m. in
Lagos, the lowest since Jan. 23. Nestle Foods Nigeria, a unit of
Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company, will pay a 11.05
naira per share final dividend, increasing the total for 2011 to
12.55 naira per share, the company said Feb. 21 in a statement
sent to Bloomberg by the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  in an e-mail.  The dividend announcement has “discouraged a lot of
investors,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust & Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone
today. “It is too small compared with its price.”  The dividend Nestle is paying translates into a yield of
2.8 percent based on the Feb. 21 closing price of 441 naira,
compared with a 16.89 percent yield on the country’s 364-day
treasury bills, according to data from the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  Feb. 9. The company’s shares have declined 5.8 percent
this year while the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX) 
retreated 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
