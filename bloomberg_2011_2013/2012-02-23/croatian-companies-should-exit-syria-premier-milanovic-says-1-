Croatian companies should exit  Syria 
because of civil violence in the Middle Eastern country, Prime
Minister  Zoran Milanovic  said today in Zagreb.  Deputy Prime Minister Radimir Cacic said that the decision
was made in consultation with  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , which
has relied on its Syrian business for its profit. He added the
measure will causes losses to the company amounting to
“hundreds of millions of euros.”  INA, the Croatian unit of Hungarian oil company  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,
has a unit in Syria that risks further setbacks because of
unrest in Syria, according to Zoltan Aldott, who heads the
management board. Syria has come under mounting international
pressure as a result of President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown on
protesters, which is nearing its one-year mark.  INA  will “respect the government’s decision,” the company
said in an e-mailed statement, adding that it will review the
situation and take “necessary steps” to coordinate its
activities in the Middle Eastern country.  Syria has been a main driver for INA’s earnings, which
returned to profit in 2010 on increased production from its gas
and crude oil plant in Hayan. Income from Syria completely dried
up in the last three months as the country spiraled into
violence, CEO Aldott said on Feb. 14.  The exit from Syria is in line with a European Union
embargo, Cacic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
