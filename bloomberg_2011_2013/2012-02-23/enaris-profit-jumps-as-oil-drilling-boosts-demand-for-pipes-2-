Tenaris SA (TS) , the world’s largest
maker of seamless steel pipes, said fourth-quarter profit rose
25 percent, beating analyst estimates, on increased demand from
oil and natural-gas explorers and higher prices.  Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $399.6
million, or 34 cents per American depositary receipt, from
$320.9 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the Luxembourg-
based company said today in a statement. Tenaris was expected to
post profit of $383.9 million, excluding some items, the average
of nine analysts’ estimates compiled by  Bloomberg. (TEN)   Increasing oil drilling in  North America , Tenaris’s biggest
market, and in other regions stoked demand for the company’s
products. The average  number of active  U.S. oil and gas rigs
rose 18 percent to 2,007 in the year through Dec. 30, according
to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  Average selling prices rose 11 percent in
the quarter, Tenaris said.  “In most places around the world, oil and gas activity
increased over the course of 2011,” said Christian Reos, an
analyst at brokerage Allaria Ledesma & Cia. in Buenos Aires,
before the results were announced. Sales volume rose “above all
in seamless pipes, with higher prices across all areas of the
business.”  Net sales climbed 33 percent to $2.75 billion. Sales in
North America gained 36 percent to $1.17 billion. In South
America and Europe sales rose 33 percent and 30 percent,
respectively.  Tenaris declined 1.4 percent to 15.47 euros in Milan, after
rising as much as 2.9 percent earlier today. The stock dropped
9.1 percent in the last 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
