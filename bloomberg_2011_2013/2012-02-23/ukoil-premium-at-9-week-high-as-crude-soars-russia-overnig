OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  jumped in New York,
pushing its premium over Moscow stock to the most in nine weeks,
as signs U.S. and European economies are reviving drove Urals
crude to the highest level in more than three years.  American depositary receipts of Lukoil, the nation’s
biggest non-state oil producer,  gained  the most in a week
yesterday, trading 1.6 percent higher than shares listed on
Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  as markets in Moscow shut for a holiday.
Futures expiring in March on Moscow’s dollar-denominated  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  fell 0.2 percent to 163,415 in U.S. trading.  Urals (EUCRURNW) , Russia’s chief export blend and biggest export
earner, surged to the strongest level since July 2008 and crude
in  New York  jumped to a nine-month high as U.S. jobless claims
stayed at a four-year low and German business confidence
exceeded estimates, tempering the outlook for a global slowdown.
Lukoil, which got more than 80 percent of its revenue from
 international sales  in the third quarter, has climbed 15 percent
in New York this year, as Urals gained 18 percent.  “Investors have more confidence in the stronger-for-longer
oil thesis and see recent gains in oil as a result of
fundamental supply constraints rather than temporary
geopolitical issues,” Yan Gloukhovski, a trader at Alfa  Capital
Markets  in  London , said by e-mail yesterday. “The strength in
equities was mainly driven by oil names.”  The  Bloomberg Russia-U.S. 14 index  of Russian companies
traded in the U.S. rose for the first time in three days, adding
0.8 percent to 108.84 yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) ,
a U.S.-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 1.1 percent
to $31.81, climbing the most since Feb. 13.  Falling Volatility  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, declined 1.6 percent to 30.65 yesterday. The
30-stock Micex index dropped 1.3 percent to 1,538.17 on Feb. 22,
the most since Dec. 21.  Lukoil ADRs gained 1.8 percent to $61.05 in New York
yesterday, boosting the  premium  to the most since Dec. 21, when
it was 1.8 percent. One ADR represents one ordinary share.

producer, rose 1.2 percent to $12.74 yesterday, swelling its
premium over the company’s Moscow-listed shares to 0.8 percent,
the most since Feb. 3. Gazprom fell 0.9 percent to 187 rubles,
or the equivalent of $6.32, on Feb. 22. One Gazprom ADR
represents two ordinary shares.  Gazprom trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 3.47 in
Moscow, compared with 4.15 for Lukoil and 5.81 for London-based
oil company BP Plc, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gazprom ‘So Cheap’  “Gazprom is just so cheap,” Arjun Jayaraman, who manages
$400 million in emerging-market equities at Causeway Capital
Management in  Los Angeles , said by phone yesterday. Causeway
owns Russian energy stocks including  Gazprom (GAZP)  and Lukoil, he
said.  Crude oil for April delivery gained 1.5 percent to $107.83
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement price since May 4. Brent oil for April
settlement increased 0.6 percent to $123.62 on the ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange in London. Urals surged 1.5 percent to $124.03.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  ADRs rose 0.8 percent to $6.49  in U.S.
trading, after its preferred  shares  in Moscow gained on Feb. 22,

ADR equals ten ordinary shares.  Russia’s 30-stock Micex index trades at six times analysts’
earnings estimates for member companies, compared with 10.7 for
the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of developing-nation stocks.

while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at 10 times and the
 BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Risk-on Environment’  “This year it’s been a risk-on environment and Russia has
benefited from it,” Jayaraman said. “As long as we remain in
an environment where there is no bad news coming out of Europe,
Russian equities should be doing fine.”  Applications for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. were
unchanged last week at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008, the
Labor Department reported yesterday. The German  business climate
index  climbed to 109.6 in February, according to the Munich-

the 41 percent growth rate expected earlier, Renaissance
analysts wrote in a research note.  Yandex gained 1.5 percent to $22.97 in New York yesterday,
