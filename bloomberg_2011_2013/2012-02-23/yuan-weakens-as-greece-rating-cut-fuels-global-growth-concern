China’s yuan dropped after a Greek
rating downgrade fueled concern the global recovery will stall,
boosting demand for safer assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares declined after  Fitch
Ratings  lowered Greece’s credit grade by two levels to C from
CCC yesterday, saying a default is highly likely in the near
term.  Oil prices , which touched a nine-month high yesterday, are
also adding to concern that international economic growth will
slow.  “The rating cut has damped market optimism but it won’t
change the overall trend of appreciation,” said Liu Dongliang,
a Shenzhen-based senior analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-biggest lender. He said the yuan may rise as much
as 3 percent against the dollar this year.  The yuan fell 0.04 percent to 6.2985 per dollar as of 4:30
p.m. in Shanghai, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The central bank weakened the reference rate by 0.07
percent to 6.3031. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent
either side of the daily fixing.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.07
percent to 6.2825 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts were at a 0.3 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency
was little changed at 6.2971.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
