Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  shares fell
the most in two months in Seoul, retreating from a record
yesterday as rising  oil prices  and economic data raised concern
that demand for electronics goods may soften.  Samsung, the world’s biggest maker of televisions, dropped
3.5 percent to 1.16 million won as of 12:55 p.m. on the Korea
Exchange, its steepest decline since Dec. 19.  LG Electronics
Inc. (066570) , which last week climbed to eight-month high, slipped 5.1
percent to 83,500 won. The benchmark Kospi index sank 1.2
percent.  Crude futures in New York increased to $106.28 a barrel
yesterday, the highest since May 4. European services and
manufacturing output shrank in February, Markit Economics said,
and Taiwan cut its 2012 growth forecast yesterday, while U.S.
sales of previously owned houses missed economists’ forecasts,
according to an industry report.  “Recent solid gains in the shares and some weak economic
readings are leading investors to sell, locking in gains,” Kim Jae Dong, the head of equity at SEI Asset Korea Co., which
manages about $5.6 billion in assets, said by telephone today.
“Higher oil prices raise some concern that global demand for
 consumer goods  could slow.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
