Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  Chief
Executive Officer  Edmund Clark ’s 2011 compensation amounted to
C$11.4 million ($11.4 million), about the same as a year
earlier.  Clark, 64, was granted C$1.5 million in salary, C$5.2
million in share-based awards, C$1.96 million in non-equity
incentive plans, C$2.6 million in option-based awards and
C$105,696 in other compensation, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a  filing  to Canadian securities regulators.  While Clark’s performance was “excellent,” his pay was
unchanged “in light of the current economic outlook and
external environment,” said Toronto-Dominion, Canada’s second-
largest bank. His direct compensation for 2011 would have been
C$11.95 million if not for those reasons, the bank said.  Toronto-Dominion posted record  earnings  in 2011 of C$6.05
billion, or C$6.43 a share under International Financial
Reporting Standards. The stock gained 2.8 percent last year,
second-most among 10 companies in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Banks Index (STBANKX) .  Chief Financial Officer Colleen Johnston received C$3.25
million in total direct compensation, a 6.9 percent increase
from 2010, according to the regulatory filing. Domestic
consumer-banking head Tim Hockey received C$4.78 million, a 4.9
percent increase.  TD Securities  U.S. consumer-banking head Bharat Masrani was awarded
C$6.99 million, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Robert Dorrance, head of Toronto-Dominion’s investment bank TD
Securities, was awarded C$7.15 million, a 12 percent decline,
reflecting lower adjusted net income in that business, according
to the filing.  Toronto-Dominion said in a separate statement that it
awarded Clark C$11.28 million. That excludes the $105,696 in
“all other compensation” for transportation, wellness and
housing allowances, and premiums and applicable taxes.  Royal Bank of  Canada , the country’s largest bank, disclosed
this month it awarded CEO Gordon Nixon C$10.1 million in 2011,
an 8.3 decrease from the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
