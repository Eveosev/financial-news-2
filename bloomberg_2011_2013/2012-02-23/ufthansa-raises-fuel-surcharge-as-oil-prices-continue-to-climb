Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest airline, will increase fuel surcharges from Feb.
28 as oil prices rise to a nine-month high.  The surcharge on connections inside Europe will increase 4
euros ($5.33), while that on long-haul routes will rise by 12
euros, for totals of 35 euros and 134 euros respectively,
Lufthansa spokesman Boris Ogursky said by telephone from
Frankfurt. Flights to the  Middle East  and East Africa are
excluded from the increase.  “The recent surge in oil prices has increased our supply
costs,” Ogursky said. “Last year, fuel is estimated to have
cost us 6.4 billion euros, whereas in the previous year it was
5.2 billion euros.”  The surcharge includes extra costs from the European
Union’s emissions-trading program, which Cologne, Germany-based
Lufthansa estimates will add 130 million euros to its expenses
this year, Ogursky confirmed.  Brent crude  rose to its highest price in more than nine
months today after German business confidence surpassed
forecasts. Brent oil for April settlement rose as much as $1.60
to $124.50 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, and was
at $123.23 as of 2:46 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
