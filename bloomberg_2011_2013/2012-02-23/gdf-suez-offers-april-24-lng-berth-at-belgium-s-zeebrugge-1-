GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA advertised a liquefied
natural gas berth at the Zeebrugge terminal in  Belgium ,
indicating it doesn’t intend to import its own cargo.  GDF Suez LNG posted a slot today for April 24, according to
a  website  operated by Fluxys SA, Belgium’s gas-grid manager. The
berth was later removed from the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
