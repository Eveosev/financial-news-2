Kohl’s Corp. (KSS) , a U.S. department-
store chain, fell after projecting full-year earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Kohl’s  dropped  5.9 percent to $49.11 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since Dec. 1.  Profit for fiscal 2012 will be $4.75 a share, the  Menomonee
Falls , Wisconsin-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected $4.93 a share, the average of 19  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income for the fourth quarter decreased 7.9 percent to
$455 million, from $494 million, a year earlier, Kohl’s said. On
a per share basis, profit rose to $1.81 because the number of
outstanding shares decreased. That compared to the $1.80 average
of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company projected first-quarter earnings per share of
60 cents, while analysts predicted 78 cents, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
