Billabong International Ltd. (BBG)  is so
beaten down that potential buyers could top TPG Capital’s offer
for the Australian surf-wear company and still pay the lowest
valuation for an apparel deal on record.  TPG, the buyout firm run by  David Bonderman , has offered
A$765 million ($819 million) for Billabong, valuing the Gold
Coast, Australia-based company at 12 times projected fiscal 2012
 net income , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s half
the median 24 times paid in takeovers of apparel makers in
developed markets worth more than $500 million, the data show.  Even after Billabong  rose  54 percent in a week, TPG or a
rival suitor could offer A$3.85 a share, 39 percent more than
yesterday’s close, and still pay the lowest multiple relative to
earnings since at least 1998, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While Billabong is selling control of accessory-maker Nixon,
considered its most lucrative unit, buyout firms may still seek
to revive the company as it cuts jobs and shuts stores,
according to Tribeca Investment Partners and UBS AG.  “Private equity sees the opportunity to turn Billabong
around,” said Sean Fenton, who manages about A$900 million at
Tribeca Investment in Sydney. TPG’s bid will “flush out anyone
who is interested to run the numbers and have a look,” he said.  Billabong announced the TPG approach on Feb. 17, the same
day it disclosed the planned sale of a majority stake in Nixon.
The offer, which was conditional on Billabong not selling any
brands including Nixon, was revised three days later to allow
for the sale without a change to the price.  Surf Shorts  Billabong, which rose as much as  7.6 percent  today, ended
trading in Sydney at A$2.91, its highest price in ten weeks.  A spokeswoman for TPG declined to comment on its bid. John Mossop, a spokesman for Billabong, said he couldn’t immediately
comment on when Billabong would respond to TPG’s bid.  Formed in 1973 when Gordon Merchant, who is still the
 largest shareholder  with a 13 percent stake, stitched together
surf shorts in his apartment on  Australia ’s  Gold Coast ,
Billabong’s market value reached A$3.84 billion in May 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Billabong’s shares  then slid 90 percent before TPG’s
approach was disclosed, the biggest drop for any consumer
discretionary stock in Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
during that period. Profits tumbled as  consumer spending  slumped
in the U.S., Europe and Australia and major stores introduced
their own brands to compete with independent surf labels.  “Billabong has a strong portfolio of brands and a wide
retail distribution network,” said Michael Simotas, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank AG in Sydney. “The thing to do is to manage
that retail business better.”  Acquisition Spree  With a rise in the Australian dollar pressuring the 65
percent of revenue the company generates from the Americas and
 Europe , Billabong last week reported a 72 percent slump in
 profit  to A$16 million for the six months ended Dec. 31. That
was the lowest for any half year since its August 2000 initial
public offering,  according to data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Billabong said last week that it will close as many as 150
of its 677 stores worldwide by June 2013, and cut about 400
jobs. It also agreed to sell 51.5 percent of its Nixon accessory
and clothing business to buyout firm Trilantic Capital Partners
and management to raise $285 million and reduce borrowings by
more than one-third.  The company’s  debt load  increased after a series of
acquisitions made as it sought to reduce reliance on its
namesake brand, which generated almost all of Billabong’s sales
at the time of its IPO. Billabong has  closed 18 purchases  since
1999, acquiring labels such as Nixon and retailers including
Canadian chain West 49 Inc., data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Squeezed by Retailers  The Billabong label now accounts for 48 percent of
wholesale revenue, compared with 15 percent for Element, and 14
percent for Nixon, according to Citigroup Inc.  Over the past decade, larger retailers have squeezed
Billabong by establishing their own lower-priced, surf-themed
brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co.’s  Hollister . Since 2004,
the Australian company has tried to compete by setting up its
own store network to push its brands to customers.  That approach often causes problems for apparel companies,
and undoing it may improve Billabong’s prospects, said George
Svinos, lead retail partner at  KPMG  in  Melbourne .  “You can probably count on one hand how many people are
successful in both retail and wholesale,” he said. “There are
many examples of people that have struggled with that model and
many who’ve absolutely improved their business by either
deleting one or the other.”  ‘Management Have Failed’  Excluding extraordinary items, analysts now estimate
Billabong will earn  A$64.5 million  in the year ending June 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. TPG’s offer is worth
almost 12 times that forecast, compared with the median bid of
24 times profit for takeovers of apparel makers greater than
$500 million in the U.S., western Europe, and developed markets
in the Asia-Pacific region, the data show.  Private equity firm Permira Advisers LP, paid the lowest
multiple so far when it acquired Valentino Fashion Group SpA for
15.3 times net income before extraordinary and one-time items in
2007. A rival could top TPG’s offer for Billabong by 28 percent
and still pay a lower multiple, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “What we’ve seen in the last two years is that management
have failed to maximize the value of these assets,” said Andrew McLennan, an analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  in Sydney
who recommends investors sell the stock. “Clearly the assets
are worth more in the hands of a private equity player now.”  Higher Margins  As much as 20 percent of Billabong’s stores are
“underperformers,” while those that are profitable had average
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
margins of 18 percent in the six months through December, Chief
Executive Officer Derek O’Neill said on Feb. 17.  That’s higher than the median  Ebitda (BBG)  margin of 13 percent
among a group of 17 apparel designers that includes  Coach Inc. (COH) 
and Asics Corp., data compiled by Bloomberg show. Billabong’s
rival  Quiksilver Inc. (ZQK)  generated an Ebitda margin of 9.4 percent
in the twelve months through October, the data show.  If Billabong meets projections for an Ebitda  margin  of 9
percent this year, a buyer paying A$3.50 a share will generate
an internal rate of return of 12 percent, according to
Citigroup’s Craig Woolford. Restoring the company’s
profitability to the 11 percent Ebitda margin Billabong reported
in the financial year ended in June raises the return closer to
23 percent, Woolford’s analysis showed.  “Any buyer needs to have conviction that they can turn
around those margins,” said Sydney-based Woolford, who has a
“neutral”  rating  on Billabong. “They know what it has earned
historically, so the potential to earn profits remains quite
strong.”  Private Equity Returns  Australian private equity and venture capital funds formed
in 2002 generated a median internal rate of return of 6.7
percent through September, the best performance among funds
created between that year and 2008, according to an analysis by
 Cambridge Associates LLC . Funds formed since 2008 are too young
to have produced meaningful results, Cambridge Associates said.  Private equity buyers will be drawn by the chance to shrink
the business and trim costs, according to Tribeca’s Fenton.  Reviving past profits will be harder to do without the full
contribution from  Nixon , which sells sports watches, women’s
handbags and casual clothing. The unit contributed about one-
third of Billabong’s Ebitda in the year through June and is
growing at 20 percent a year, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a
Feb. 18 report. That compares with three years of Ebitda
declines at the group.  ‘An Excellent Purchase’  The proposed transaction values Nixon at approximately $464
million, representing about 9.2 times the last 12 months’
Ebitda, Billabong said. TPG’s offer for the rest of the company
values it at almost 6 times Ebitda, excluding Nixon.  Still, the sale of Nixon won’t necessarily turn private
equity buyers off given that Billabong “remains undervalued,”
UBS analysts wrote in a Feb. 17 note. The Zurich-based firm has
a ’’buy’’ rating on Billabong.  “TPG came back pretty quickly and dropped the Nixon
condition,” said John Maysles, event-driven senior analyst at
Los Angeles-based Elevation LLC. “That tells you they must be
pretty happy about the deal. If you can turn the thing around,
it would be an excellent purchase for a private equity guy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
