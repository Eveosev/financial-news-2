The yen weakened beyond 81 against
the dollar and fell to its lowest level since November against
the euro as three-year low foreign-exchange volatility and signs
of global growth prompted demand for higher-yielding currencies.  South Africa ’s rand and Norway’s krone climbed as a measure
of U.S. consumer sentiment for February rose higher than
economists predicted. The euro strengthened a third day as
officials prepared to address the debt crisis when Group of 20
nations meet tomorrow. The yen extended its drop against the
dollar to 4.3 percent since the  Bank of Japan  unexpectedly
expanded its asset-purchase program on Feb. 14.  “The data out of the U.S. is above expectations and that’s
helping to encourage more of a risk-on environment,” said  David Mann , regional head of research for the Americas at Standard
Chartered Plc in  New York . “Alongside an increasing amount of
calm about the risks that remain in  Europe , it looks like people
are focusing on the excessive short euro positions.” A short is
a bet the price of an asset will fall.  The yen dropped 1.5 percent against the dollar to 81.20 at
5 p.m. New York time after touching 81.22, the weakest since
July 8. Japan’s currency fell 2.1 percent, its largest intraday
drop since Oct. 31, to 109.18 per euro. It touched 109.25, its
weakest level since Nov. 1 and has dropped a 4.4 percent drop
since Feb. 17, the third-straight weekly decline. The euro rose
to more than $1.34 for the first time since Dec. 9, trading 0.6
percent higher at $1.3448.  Futures traders  decreased their so-called net-short
positions on the euro versus the dollar to 142,159 contracts in
the week ended Feb. 21. The positions reached a record high of
171,347 last month.  Pound Rises  The pound rose for a second day against the dollar after
the government’s economic-growth report showed  consumer spending 
rose more than analysts forecast, boosting speculation the U.K.
will avoid a recession.  The British currency rose 0.8 percent to $1.5875 and added
0.3 percent to 84.72 pence per euro, snapping four days of
losses against the common currency.  The implied volatility of three-month options on G-7
currencies as tracked by the  JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index (JPMVXYG7)  fell
to 9.71 percent, the least since Aug. 8, 2008, as options
traders scaled back the risk of large exchange-rate swings.
Lower volatility makes investments in currencies with higher
benchmark rates more attractive because the risk in such trades
is that market moves will erase profits.  ‘Risk-Taking Environment’  “We are moving gradually into a risk-taking environment,”
said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “The policy stance of the
Japanese government, low volatility and signs of economic
recovery are putting the yen on the defensive.”  The BOJ said this month it would expand its asset-purchase
program to 30 trillion yen ($372 billion) from 20 trillion, with
19 trillion yen set aside for  government bonds . The central bank
also said it will target 1 percent inflation “for the time
being.”  The euro had a seventh-straight advance against the yen,
the longest run since January 2010, after demand was boosted by
the prospect that G-20 officials meeting this weekend may
discuss committing further resources to Europe’s debt crisis.  The  currency pair  broke above its 200-day moving average,
at 107.12, for the first time since August.  Japan, Norway  Japan ’s currency has tumbled 7 percent in the past month,
the biggest loser among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The dollar weakened
2.3 percent and the euro rose 1.1 percent. Norway’s krone was
the biggest gainer, strengthening 3.8 percent.  The krone rose for a third day versus the greenback,
gaining 0.7 percent to 5.5745 per dollar.  The dollar weakened as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of consumer sentiment for February rose to
75.3 from 75 at the end of last month. Economists projected a
reading of 73 after a preliminary figure of 72.5, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  A separate survey showed purchases of new homes in the U.S.
exceeded forecasts in January after climbing a month earlier to
a one-year high. Sales, tabulated when contracts are signed,
fell 0.9 percent to a 321,000 annual pace from a 324,000 rate in
December that was stronger than previously reported, figures
from the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington .  “The U.S. data is improving and no doubt that’s adding to
the positive sentiment,” said  Tony Allen , global head of
foreign-exchange trading in Sydney at  Australia  & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. “Higher equity markets in the States equals
higher risk currencies.”  Bank Downgrades  Australia’s dollar lagged behind other commodity currencies
after  Fitch Ratings  downgraded three of the nation’s four so-
called pillar banks. Fitch reduced the ratings of  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia , Westpac Banking Corp. and National Australia
Bank Ltd. by one level to AA- from A, citing their dependence on
wholesale funding markets that are “vulnerable to swings of
confidence.”  The Aussie fell 0.2 percent to $1.0694. It fell against
most of its 16 major counterparts.  The rand gained 0.8 percent to 7.5986 per  U.S. dollar ,
strengthening 1.9 percent since Feb. 17. The Canadian dollar
fell 0.2 percent to 99.93 cents per U.S. dollar. It reached
99.07 cents on Feb. 20, the strongest since Oct. 28.  ‘Supply Shock’  Barclays Plc recommended investors bet on the depreciation
of the euro against an equally weighted basket of the dollar and
 Norway ’s krone before a three-year loan offering from the
 European Central Bank  scheduled for next week.  Financial institutions will ask the ECB for 470 billion
euros ($630 billion) in three-year funds for allotment on Feb.
29, the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  The second three-year longer-term refinancing operation
“is likely to be more of a liquidity supply shock and weaken”
the euro,  Paul Robinson , global head of foreign-exchange
research at Barclays in London, wrote in a research note
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
