Singapore’s private home purchases
by foreigners rose 20 percent in 2011 even as demand from
Singapore citizens and residents fell, DTZ Holdings Plc.  Foreigners bought a record 5,246 housing units last year,
surpassing the earlier record of 4,982 units in 2007, the
property brokerage said in a report. The number of private homes
purchased by Singaporeans and permanent residents in 2011 fell
by 24 percent and 16 percent respectively, the report showed.  Singapore’s private home prices posted gains in every
quarter last year, even as the government in January raised down
payment requirements for second mortgages and extended the
period homeowners must hold properties to avoid stamp duties or
sales taxes.  “The better performance in the primary market is due to
the availability of smaller units costing less than S$1 million
($797,000), and buyers can buy and hold during the construction
period to avoid paying the seller’s stamp duty in the first four
years of purchase which was imposed in January 2011,” Chua Chor Hoon, the head of Asia Pacific research at DTZ, said in the
statement.  Foreigners were the only group that increased purchases,
accounting for 17 percent of home sales in 2011, the highest in
the past 15 years since data is available, DTZ said, citing the
government’s data.  China vs Malaysia  Buyers from  China  overtook Malaysians for the first time,
making up 28 percent of foreign buyers last year from 20 percent
in 2010, DTZ said. Indonesians and Indians are also among the
dominant groups of buyers from abroad in 2011, with the four
nationalities making up 77 percent of transactions among non-
Singaporeans, up from 73 percent in 2010, DTZ said.  Singapore’s January private home sales rebounded from their
lowest in two years, boosted by purchases in the suburban areas
of the island state. Home sales dropped to the lowest in two
years after the government imposed new taxes on house purchases
by foreigners in December.  “With the implementation of the additional buyer’s stamp
duty measures, the share of local buyers is expected to rise in
2012 as foreigners now have to pay a much higher stamp duty on
any residential purchase,” Chua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
