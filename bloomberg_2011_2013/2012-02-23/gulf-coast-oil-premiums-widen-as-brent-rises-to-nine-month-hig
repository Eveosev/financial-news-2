U.S. Gulf Coast oils widened their
premiums to West Texas Intermediate as  Brent crude  rose to a
nine-month high after German business confidence surpassed
forecasts.  Brent futures advanced 0.6 percent after the Munich-based
Ifo institute’s business climate index gained for a fourth month
to its highest level since July. When Brent increases versus
WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that
compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Brent futures for April settlement rose 72 cents to end the
day at $123.62 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest closing price since May 2.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
widened $1.75 to $21 at 4:26 p.m. in  New York .  Light Louisiana
Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI added $2.05 cents to $20.30 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI widened $1.70 to $18.10 and
Mars Blend’s gained 65 cents to $13.65.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
widened 15 cents to $12.65 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s
premium narrowed $1 to $13.50 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 1.25 cents to $5.50 a
barrel below WTI.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  against futures was unchanged at
$13.25 a barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount was unchanged at $28.50 a
barrel.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s discount was unchanged at $13 a barrel.  April WTI futures gained $1.55, or 1.5 percent, to settle
