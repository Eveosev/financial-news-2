Norway’s krone jumped as much as 0.7
percent against the euro in a few minutes of trading amid
speculation the currency’s recent gains caused some traders to
end bets it would weaken.  The surge pushed the Nordic currency to a nine-year high
versus the 17-nation euro, extending its advance in the past
three months to as much as 5.2 percent. It later pared gains to
trade little changed. The krone has appreciated against all its
16 major counterparts in the past month as stronger  oil prices 
boosted demand for Norwegian assets.  “What we saw in euro-krone this morning was stop-loss
driven,” said Richard Falkenhall, a currency strategist at SEB
in  Stockholm , referring to levels where investors close trades
to limit losses. “A lot of people expected some slowdown in the
move lower in euro-krone.’  The krone traded at 7.5007 per euro at 4:44 p.m. in  London 
after jumping to 7.4371 at about 9:54 a.m., the highest since
January 2003. The currency climbed 0.3 percent to 5.6361 per
dollar, after reaching 5.5816, the strongest level since Nov. 8.  Brent crude  rose as much as 1.5 percent to $124.50 a
barrel, before settling at $122.61. Norway is the world’s
seventh-biggest oil exporter.  “If we see a stronger level from here, it may have an
impact on the Norges Bank’s monetary policy, and they will
express it, which should slow down the move,” Falkenhall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
