Abu Dhabi opened a power and water
plant that will produce as much as 120 million gallons of
potable water a day, 15 percent of the emirateâ€™s desalination
capacity.  The 1,510-megawatt Shuweihat 2 facility in the Al Gharbia
region has the capacity to power at least 300,000 homes,  Abu
Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the United Arab Emirates-based
utility known as Taqa, said today in a statement.  Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of the crude in the
U.A.E. while Dubai is the commercial, banking and tourism hub.
Taqa is 75 percent owned by the largest U.A.E. sheikhdom.  The plant 260 kilometers (160 miles) southwest of the city
of Abu Dhabi is owned by Ruwais Power Co., a joint venture of
Taqa, GDF Suez, Marubeni Corp., Osaka Gas Co. and the Abu Dhabi
Water and Electricity Authority.  Ruwais Power partners invested $2.7 billion to build the
plant to meet energy and water demands for Abu Dhabi, whose
population is set to double to 5 million by 2030.  To contact the reporter on this story:
