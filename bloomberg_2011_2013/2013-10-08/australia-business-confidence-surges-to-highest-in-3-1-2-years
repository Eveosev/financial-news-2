Australian  business confidence  surged
in September to the highest level in 3 1/2 years as majority
government and lower  interest rates  encouraged companies, even
as employment conditions remained poor, a private survey showed.  The confidence index jumped to 12 from 4, according to a
National Australia Bank Ltd. survey released today of more than
400 companies taken Sept. 24 to Sept. 30. The  business
conditions  gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and profits, was
minus 4 compared with minus 7 in August.  The result reflects the restoration of majority government
in Australia after three years of a hung parliament and record-low borrowing costs as the central seeks to engineer a
transition from mining investment to industries including
residential construction.  Tony Abbott ’s coalition ousted the
Labor government on Sept. 7 pledging to cut red tape and lower
taxes to boost the $1.5 trillion economy.  “The federal election result appears to have helped
confidence further,” NAB Chief Economist  Alan Oster  said in the
report. “Nonetheless, employment conditions remain subdued,
painting a soft outlook for the labor market.”  The local dollar has declined 9.2 percent this year as the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia reduced rates to a record low 2.5
percent, helping ease pressure on industries including
manufacturing and services.  Australia’s unemployment rate probably held at 5.8 percent
in September, a four-year high, economists predicted before
government data due to be released Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
