New York  Giants running back David
Wilson will miss this week’s National Football League game
against the Chicago Bears because of a neck injury.  Wilson, the Giants’ leading rusher, was hurt when he was
tackled for a loss on the final play of the first quarter in a
36-21 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles two days ago. Wilson
didn’t return and today was ruled out of the game against the
Bears two days away.  The Giants have an 0-5 record for the first time since 1987
and are averaging a league-low 56.8 yards rushing a game.  Brandon Jacobs led the Giants with 37 yards on 11 carries
against the Eagles. Running back Da’Rel Scott was re-signed by
the Giants to help offset the loss of Wilson, a week after being
waived by the team.  “I felt good about it, but just to be back because of that
-- I don’t want to see guys getting hurt,” Scott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
