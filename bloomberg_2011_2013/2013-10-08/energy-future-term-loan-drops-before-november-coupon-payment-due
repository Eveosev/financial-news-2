Energy Future Holdings Corp.’s first-lien term loan fell to the lowest level in eight months, three
weeks before the electricity provider heading for bankruptcy is
scheduled to make coupon payments to junior bondholders.  Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Co.’s $15.4 billion
term loan dropped 0.7 cent today to 66.3 cents on the dollar,
the lowest level since Feb. 14, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The loans are down from 74.2 cents on May 21.  The former TXU Corp. is scheduled to make $270 million in
coupon payments on Nov. 1 to junior bondholders. Those investors
may recover as little as 4 percent in a bankruptcy
reorganization, Moody’s Investors Service said in a Sept. 9
report.  Texas Competitive’s $1.83 billion of 10.25 percent senior
unsecured bonds, which pay interest on Nov. 1, traded at 3.38
cents as of 1:46 p.m. in New York, up from an all-time low of
1.87 cents on Sept. 25, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “We continue to have a high degree of confidence” in an
Energy Future restructuring before the interest payment is due
Nov. 1, debt-researcher CreditSights Inc. analyst  Andy DeVries 
wrote in a report today.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for the Dallas-based company,
declined to comment.  Energy Future has struggled with its  debt load  since it was
taken private in 2007 by KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman
Sachs Capital Partners for a record $48 billion. Creditors are
working on a bankruptcy proposal to cut the company’s $43.6
billion of obligations before its November coupon payment.
Lenders turned down an initial proposal advanced by the company,
according to an April 15 regulatory filing.  Texas’s largest electricity provider made a coupon payment
Oct. 1 as scheduled, a person with knowledge of the transaction
said at the time. The company owed as much as $59 million in
interest in October, CreditSights said in a Sept. 29 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
