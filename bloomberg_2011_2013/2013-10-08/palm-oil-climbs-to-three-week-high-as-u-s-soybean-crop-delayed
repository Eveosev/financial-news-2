Palm oil  advanced for a third day to
the highest level in almost three weeks on speculation that
rains in the U.S. may delay the harvest of soybean crop, crushed
to make an alternative oil used in food and fuel.  Palm for delivery in December gained as much as 1 percent
to 2,342 ringgit ($732) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the highest level for the most-active contract
since Sept. 18, and was at 2,338 ringgit at 11:21 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . Palm for physical delivery in October was at 2,330
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Palm oil is being supported by the gains in soybean oil,
which is a substitute for palm,” said Tan Chee Tat, an analyst
at  Phillip Futures Pte.  in  Singapore . “We are seeing some
bargain hunting as the current prices are still deemed to be
attractive.”  Soybean futures in Chicago increased for the fifth day, the
longest rally in four months. Rain last week in the U.S. Midwest
will likely delay harvests early this week, forecaster DTN said.
The contract for delivery in November advanced 0.5 percent to
$13.0325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean
oil for December delivery gained 1.3 percent to 40.40 cents a
pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery surged as much as 3.2
percent to 5,556  yuan  ($908) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange before trading at 5,480 yuan.  Soybean oil  advanced 0.3
percent to 6,978 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
