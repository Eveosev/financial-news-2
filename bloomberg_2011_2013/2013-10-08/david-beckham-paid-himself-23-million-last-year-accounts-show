Former England soccer captain David Beckham was paid 14.1 million pounds ($23 million) by his sponsorship and image-rights company in 2012, up 6 percent from the previous year, accounts show.  London-based Footwork Productions Ltd. said revenue increased 8 percent to 16.5 million pounds and that it expects a “sustained level of endorsement income during 2013.” Net income more than doubled to 292,000 pounds.  Beckham retired from soccer last season, ending a five-month contract at French league champion Paris Saint-Germain. He remains one of the world’s most marketable sports personalities. Forbes magazine in June put his total earnings at  $47 million , making him the eighth-highest paid athlete. Tiger Woods tops the  list  with $78 million.  The 38-year-old former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy player has deals with Adidas AG, Hennes & Mauritz AB and Coty Inc. In March he took on a role as global ambassador for Chinese soccer.  Footwork Productions, which has Beckham’s wife and former Spice Girls singer Victoria Beckham as company secretary, said it was “satisfied” with the results, released earlier this month. It reported the accounts in a U.K. Companies House filing.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Priechenfried at the London Sports Desk at  bprie@bloomberg.net .
