A Moscow court ordered a 38-year-old
Russian who took part in a rally against President  Vladimir Putin ’s 2012 return to power to undergo psychiatric care,
according to his lawyer.  Mikhail Kosenko was consigned to indefinite treatment in a
hospital after the court found he’d used violence against police
officers, his lawyer Valery Shukhardin said today by phone.
Kosenko was found to have a mental illness in a court-ordered
evaluation and unable to recognize the danger he posed to the
public during in a protest on May 6, 2012, against alleged fraud
during the presidential election.  The rally, which took place a day before Putin’s
inauguration to a third term in office, was attended by 8,000
people, according to Moscow police. Estimates from organizers
ranged from 20,000 to 100,000 people. Investigators opened cases
into misconduct by more than two dozen people soon after the
rally.  The court had no grounds to send Kosenko, who has been held
since November 2012, to the hospital, the lawyer said, adding he
will appeal the decision. The Zamoskvoretsky court’s press
office didn’t answer the phone when called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
