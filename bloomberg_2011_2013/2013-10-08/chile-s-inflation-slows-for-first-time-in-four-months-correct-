(Corrects to show median forecast was 1.9 percent in
second paragraph.)  Chilean inflation slowed in September
for the first time in four months, dropping to the lower end of
the target range as the central bank signals that  interest rates 
are likely to fall.  The rate slid to 2 percent from 2.2 percent the month
before, the  National Institute of Statistics  said in a report
released in Santiago today. Inflation compared with the 1.9
percent median forecast of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Prices gained 0.5 percent in the month, in line with forecasts.  Inflation has remained below the mid-point of the 2 percent
to 4 percent target range since June 2012, over which period the
central bank has left its key rate at 5 percent amid booming
consumer demand. Central bank President Rodrigo Vergara said on
Oct. 1 policy makers don’t have to wait for a slowdown in
 consumer spending  before cutting rates, a day after a report
showed retail sales soared 12 percent in August. Weaker consumer
sentiment and slower wage growth indicate consumer demand is set
to weaken soon, he said.  The central bank lowered its growth forecast for 2013 on
Sept. 4 to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent from 4 percent to 5
percent citing global conditions.  Core prices, which exclude fuel and produce, rose 0.6
percent last month, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
