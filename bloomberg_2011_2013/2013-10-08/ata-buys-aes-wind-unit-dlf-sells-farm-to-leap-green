Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , the generation
business of India’s largest industrial group, will buy  AES
Corp. (AES) ’s local wind business to boost wind capacity 10 percent.  Tata Power’s wind capacity will rise to 437 megawatts with
the deal, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Tata
didn’t say how much it paid Arlington, Virginia-based AES for
the 39.2 megawatts of assets in Dwarka, Gujarat state.  Separately, DLF Ltd., India’s largest property developer,
completed the sale of a 33-megawatt wind farm in Rajasthan state
to Leap Green Energy Pvt. for 674 million rupees ($11 million),
DLF said today in a filing. The sale is part of an effort by the
real estate developer to divest “non-core assets,” it said.  India ’s fragmented wind industry is ripe for mergers and
acquisitions, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have led about $1.1 billion
of private-equity buyouts, project and company acquisitions
since 2010, according to a June estimate by the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
