Cocoa futures reached a 23-month high
as ample rains threaten to slow already shrinking supplies from
West Africa, the world’s biggest growing region. Sugar, coffee
and orange juice also advanced, while cotton slid.  In the year started Oct. 1, cocoa output will trail demand
by 173,000 metric tons, followed by a shortage of 113,000 tons
the next season, Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates. Growing areas
in top producers  Ivory Coast  and Ghana may get as much as 150
percent of normal rain in October’s second half, slowing the
harvest, World Weather Inc. in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , predicts.  “If the heavy rain forecast for Ivory Coast and Ghana does
come, it could interrupt deliveries to ports and thus world
supplies, at least for a time,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in a report e-mailed today.  Cocoa for December delivery advanced 0.7 percent to settle
at $2,718 a ton at 12:20 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
after reaching $2,731, the highest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 8, 2011.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to
18.62 cents a pound, after reaching 18.67 cents, the highest
since March 18.  Rainfall in Brazil, the world’s top producer, may cut the
cane crushed in the first half of this month in the main growing
area by as much as 21 percent from a year earlier, said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge Group in New York.  “The potential for production losses there” from the wet
conditions is supporting the sweetener,  Jack Scoville , a vice
president for Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in a report.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in December gained 0.5
percent to $1.1505 a pound on ICE. Orange-juice futures for
November delivery increased 1.1 percent to $1.292 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery slipped 0.4 percent to
83.69 cents a pound, the third straight drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
