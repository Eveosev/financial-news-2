Spot gasoline on the U.S. East Coast
strengthened to a three-week high relative to futures as
refineries carried out maintenance and imports to the region
were forecast to fall.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  in New York Harbor climbed
1 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon above futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:02 p.m., the highest level since Sept.
18. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline known as RBOB added 0.05
cent to a premium of 1.13 cents, while conventional CBOB
gasoline gained 0.15 cent to 0.75 cent above Nymex futures.  Plants including Phillips 66’s Bayway,  New Jersey , refinery
and PBF Energy Inc.’s  Delaware  City, Delaware, site were
expected to have begun planned work on several units at the same
time shipments to the East Coast are forecast to fall.  “There are lower runs and lower imports,” said Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group Ltd., which forecast
that shipments of gasoline to the East Coast would ease to about
500,000 barrels a day in the coming week.  Imports of the fuel totaled 510,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Oct. 2, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
That’s about 6.3 percent below the three-year average.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in  New York  Harbor, a measure of
refining margins based on Brent oil in  Europe , added 23 cents to
$6.48 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
