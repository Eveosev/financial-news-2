Copper swung between gains and losses
as investors weighed post-holiday demand from  China , the top
consumer, against a stalemate over the debt ceiling and
government shutdown in the U.S.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange was little changed at $7,250 a metric ton by
11:48 a.m. in  Tokyo  after rising 0.2 percent and falling 0.4
percent. Futures for delivery in December were little changed at
$3.2995 a pound on the Comex in New York.  President  Barack Obama  reiterated that he won’t negotiate
with Republicans over the partial government closure and the
U.S. debt limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned that
Congress needs to increase the $16.7 trillion  debt ceiling  by
Oct. 17 or risk defaulting on its payments. The U.S. is the
second-biggest copper user.  “Investors remained on the sidelines to avoid risk until
the U.S. budget and debt limit issues are resolved,” said Tetsu Emori, the chief  fund manager  at Astmax Asset Management Inc.  Expectations of post-holiday demand in China and declining
LME stockpiles provided support for the market, Emori said.
China resumed trading today after a week-long holiday.
Stockpiles tracked by the LME dropped for a 23rd day to 523,425
tons, the least since March, exchange data showed yesterday.  Metal for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.8 percent to 52,360  yuan  ($8,557) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc and nickel were little changed,
while tin and lead rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
