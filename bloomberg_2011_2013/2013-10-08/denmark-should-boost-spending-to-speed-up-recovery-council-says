Denmark should increase spending to
help speed up an economic recovery as the nation’s long-struggling housing market emerges from a crash, the government-backed Economic Council said.  “The weak economic cycle and the assessment that the
planned economic policy won’t stimulate activity in coming years
warrants a temporary easing of fiscal policy,” the council,
also known as the Wise Men, said in a report released today.
“An easing of 0.25 percent of gross domestic product, equal to
5 billion kroner, will be consistent with the budget law.”  Denmark’s  economy  will grow 0.2 percent this year after
contracting 0.4 percent in 2012, the council said, keeping a May
estimate. Increasing exports to  Europe  and a tepid recovery of
domestic demand will contribute to a slow rebound, according to
the council.  Denmark will post a public deficit of 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product this year, narrowing from 4.2 percent in 2012,
according to the council.  House prices  will rise 2.5 percent
after falling 3.4 percent in 2012, the council said, revising a
previous forecast for a 1.2 percent increase.  The council also urged the government to move toward
surpluses “to have a real option” to use stimulus to stabilize
the economy in times of set-backs.  Until 2015  The council estimated that the government will probably
remain in deficits until 2015, using the government’s own
method, which forecasts GDP growth will accelerate from 1.6
percent in 2014 to 2.4 percent in 2020.  Denmark on Aug. 27 predicted its  budget deficit  will widen
to 2 percent next year, still within the 3 percent deficit limit
set by the European Union. Weaker growth and increased spending
will cause the deficit to widen from 1.7 percent in 2013,
according to the government.  The Wise Men see deficits of 1.7 percent in 2014 and 2.6
percent in 2015.  Denmark’s $320 billion economy is struggling to emerge from
a burst property bubble, which triggered a banking crisis and
wiped out more than a dozen lenders since 2008.  Denmark’s AAA rated government bond market emerged as a
haven from the euro area’s fiscal crisis last year as the nation
has kept public debt at less than half the average in the single
currency bloc, relative to GDP. That’s pushed Danish borrowing
costs lower and helped stimulate the economy as it struggles to
surface from a housing slump.  The Danish central bank uses monetary policy to keep the
krone pegged to the euro. It has kept its deposit rate below
zero since July to counter a capital influx. The benchmark
lending rate is 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
