The budget standoff in the U.S. will
probably dominate discussions of Group of 20 finance ministers
in  Washington  later this week, a Canadian official said.  The official, who spoke to reporters on condition they not
be identified, said a lack of resolution by U.S. lawmakers is a
key risk to the global economy in part because it poses risks of
disruptions to financial markets including currencies. An
impasse on the U.S. debt ceiling is a bigger issue than the
government shutdown, the official said.  Proposed plans by the  Federal Reserve  to trim its asset-purchase program would probably be good news for the global and
Canadian economies because it would signal stronger growth in
the U.S., the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
