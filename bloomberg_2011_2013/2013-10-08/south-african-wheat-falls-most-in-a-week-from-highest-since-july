Wheat futures traded in South  Africa 
fell the most in a week after reaching the highest price since
July 8 in yesterday’s session.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
dropped 0.4 percent to 3,440 rand ($346) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The
slide was the biggest since Oct. 1. The grain climbed as high as
3,476 rand yesterday.  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to
2,161 rand a ton, while the white variety for the same delivery
month was unchanged at 2,363 rand a ton. A meal made from white
corn is a staple food in South Africa, the continent’s largest
corn producer, and the yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
