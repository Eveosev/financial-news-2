The Treasury’s $30 billion auction of
three-year securities attracted higher-than-average demand from
an investor class that includes foreign central banks at the
first U.S. note auction since the government shutdown.  Indirect bidders purchased 34.4 percent of the notes at the
sale yesterday, compared with an average of 28.2 percent for the
past 10 auctions. The notes sold at a yield of 0.710 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.718 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  The sale comes after China and  Japan , America’s largest
foreign creditors with combined holdings of more than $2.4
trillion, raised pressure on the U.S. to resolve the impasse
that has reached a week. The Treasury also sold $30 billion of
one-month bills yesterday at a rate of 0.35 percent, the highest
since 2008, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.75, the lowest since
March 2009.  “So far, investors have tolerated the confusion in
 Washington , and foreign investors own a chunk of this universe,
so they want to see it go well,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “A strong auction moves the
focus to the 10- and 30-year sales. In this atmosphere all of
the auctions have to go well in order to stave off worry.”  The yield on the current three-year note rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.67 percent yesterday in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The yield
on the benchmark 10-year note added one basis point to 2.63
percent.  Government Services  Nonessential U.S. government services have been closed for
more than a week as politicians wrangle over a budget.
Republicans want to change the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while
President  Barack Obama  refuses to discuss conditions tied to
opening the government or raising the debt limit. Treasury
Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Congress needs to increase the debt
ceiling by Oct. 17 or the nation risks defaulting on its
payments.  A repeat of the “brinksmanship” that occurred in the 2011
debt ceiling debate as well as a technical default will lead to
“further shedding of Treasuries from the foreign community,”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including  Alex Roever  wrote in an
Oct. 4 note to clients.  Foreign investors reduced their purchases of Treasuries buy
an average of $30 billion a month in the months leading up to
and following the resolution of the government shutdown in 1996
and the debt ceiling debate in 2011.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.7 percent of the
notes yesterday. The average for the past 10 sales is 18.8
percent.  Bid Details  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.05,
compared with an average of 3.35 for the past 10 sales.  Three-year notes have lost 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.5 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The three-year
securities returned 0.6 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall gained 2.2 percent.  The auction was the first of three note offerings this week
totaling $64 billion. The government will sell $21 billion of
10-year notes today and auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow.  The sales will raise $31.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $32.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
