Sentinel Management Group Inc.’s
head trader Charles K. Mosley pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
which more than 70 customers had losses greater than $500
million.  Mosley, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of investment
adviser fraud today before U.S. District Judge Ronald A. Guzman
in federal court in  Chicago .  Mosley, the chief trader at the Northbrook, Illinois-based
cash management firm, was indicted last year with the firm’s
Chief Executive Officer, Eric A. Bloom. Bloom is set to go to
trial on Feb. 24.  The two men were accused of concealing from investors the
firm’s financial condition and of sending them misleading
account statements.  As a result of the scheme, more than 70 Sentinel customers
had losses of more than $500 million, according to the
superceding charging document to which Mosley pleaded guilty.
A sentencing date hasn’t been set.  The case is U.S. v. Bloom, 12-cr-409, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  Illinois , Eastern Division (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
