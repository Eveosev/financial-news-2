Lenders won’t have to hold capital
against portions of home loans backed by the U.K. government
under its Help-to-Buy program, the Prudential Regulation
Authority said.  The mortgages generate “an exposure to the government as
guarantor of the first loss on the loan,” and therefore carry
a zero risk weighting for the purposes of calculating capital,
the London-based PRA said in a  statement  on its website today.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s Natwest unit and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Halifax and Bank of  Scotland  will start
offering the Help-to-Buy mortgages this week, with Virgin
Money Holdings U.K. Ltd. and Aldermore Bank planning to start in
2014, the Treasury in  London  said in a statement today. The
program allows people to buy a home with a deposit of as little
as 5 percent with a guarantee from the government.  “The guaranteed portion of the loan would be treated as an
exposure to the U.K. government,” said the PRA, which took over
from the Financial Services Authority in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
