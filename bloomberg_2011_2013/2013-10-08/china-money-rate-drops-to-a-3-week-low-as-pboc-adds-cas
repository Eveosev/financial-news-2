China’s overnight money-market rate
fell to the lowest level in almost three weeks after the central
bank injected funds into the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China sold 65 billion  yuan  ($10.6
billion) of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements at 3.9
percent today, according to a statement on the website. The
authority  added a net  150.1 billion yuan in the week ended Sept.
27 to stabilize rates and help banks meet quarter-end funding
demand before the Oct. 1-7 National Day holiday.  “There will be 80 billion yuan of reverse repos maturing
this week, and given the new issuance of  government bonds  in the
next few days, it’s not strange the central bank decided to
improve the liquidity,” said Gao Hui, an analyst at Founder
Securities Co. in Beijing.  The  overnight repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the banking system, declined 14 basis points, or
0.14 percentage point, to 3 percent as of 10:06 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. That’s the lowest level since
Sept. 18.  The cost of the one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed
payment to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was little
changed at 3.97 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the government’s 4.08 percent bonds due August
2023 was unchanged at 4.03 percent, according to data provided
by the Interbank Funding Center.  A  service industries  Purchasing Managers’ Index for
September stood at 52.4, versus 52.8 in August, according to a
report by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. China
shouldn’t overly expand fiscal deficit and credit to spur short-term growth, Securities Daily published commentary today by  Yi Xianrong , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
