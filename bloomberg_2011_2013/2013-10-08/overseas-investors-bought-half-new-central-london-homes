People living outside the U.K.
accounted for about half of all new home purchases in  London ’s
best neighborhoods as affluent investors sought a safe haven
from turmoil in the Middle East and Europe’s debt crisis.  Foreign-born buyers, including those living in the U.K.,
made 69 percent of new-home purchases in London’s prime areas in
the two years through June, while those living abroad bought 49
percent of the homes, Knight Frank LLP said in a report today.
About 28 percent of those who bought central London homes worth
1 million pounds ($1.6 million) or more in the year through June
don’t live in the U.K., the broker said.  “The majority of demand for new-build property in London
from overseas remains focused on the relatively small and
concentrated market made up of the central London postcodes,”
Liam Bailey, London-based Knight Frank’s global head of
residential research, said in the report.  Overseas investors are buying real estate in the U.K.
capital to preserve wealth as political and economic tension
roils their homes markets.  Savills Plc (SVS)  and Knight Frank forecast
in July that luxury-home values in districts such as Mayfair,
Belgravia and Knightsbridge would rise 6 percent this year.  Most of the overseas buyers are from Europe, the Middle
East and  Russia , Knight Frank said, without being more specific.
British residents bought 85 percent to 90 percent of all new
homes sold in Greater London in the two years through June, the
broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
