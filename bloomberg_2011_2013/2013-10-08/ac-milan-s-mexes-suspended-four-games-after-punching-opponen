AC Milan defender Philippe Mexes was
suspended four games after punching Juventus’s Giorgio Chiellini
during a match.  The incident took place during Juventus’s 3-2 Serie A
victory in Turin two days ago. League officials said in a
 statement  they used video footage to determine that Mexes struck
Chiellini from behind as the two battled in the penalty area at
a corner kick.  Mexes was banned three matches for the punch and an
additional match for being sent off after receiving two yellow
cards in the second half, the league said.  Milan was also ordered to play its next home match against
Udinese in an empty stadium because of racist chanting by its
supporters during the Juventus game. Serie A officials said the
fans sang “insulting songs of territorial discrimination” and
also fined the club 50,000 euros ($68,000).  Milan has won two of seven games this season and sits 12th
in the 20-team league with eight points, 13 fewer than first-place Roma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
