Document published at the conclusion
of a meeting of G-20 finance chiefs in  Washington  this week will
probably be short, a German government official said.
* Final document, or communique, could be as short as two pages,
German official told reporters in Berlin today, speaking on
condition of anonymity because the ministerial negotiations have
yet to take place
* German official cited fact that G-20 leaders only met at the
beginning of September in  St. Petersburg  for brevity of document
* Central bank governors will discuss the exit from expansive
U.S. monetary policy, the German official said, noting the exit
should happen and be adequately coordinated, communicated and
calibrated. The official said this message may be repeated in
Washington.
* A U.S. government shutdown in 1995/96 did not lead to a
massive shock to the  U.S. economy , the German official said.
Official said he hopes the development this time will be similar
and that the shutdown will be temporary.
* A deadlock in the U.S. government in the middle of 2011 led to
downgrade of  U.S. government debt  by  Standard & Poor’s , and the
German official said he hopes a repeat can be avoided
* The G-20 needs a strong U.S. and not a U.S. that runs the risk
of being downgraded again, German official says.
