Swiss  consumer prices  fell in
September after stabilizing in the previous two months, resuming
a path of annual declines that started in 2011.  Prices decreased 0.1 percent from a year earlier, the
Federal Statistics Office in Neuchatel said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s in line with the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News  survey  of 15 economists. Compared with a month
earlier, prices increased 0.3 percent.  The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro two years ago, citing the risks of deflation and
a recession. While the measure has helped  Switzerland  dodge the
six-quarter slump that afflicted the neighboring euro area,
consumer prices declined for 21 months after the cap’s
introduction, the longest stretch since at least 1971, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The SNB, which expects consumer prices to fall 0.2 percent
this year, has “no reason” to discuss an exit from the cap,
considering the need to keep prices stable and the chance of the
euro-area crisis flaring up again, SNB President Thomas Jordan
said on Sept. 19 when the central bank held its quarterly
monetary policy review.  The cost of imported  consumer goods  rose 1 percent from the
previous month and declined 2.1 percent from a year earlier,
today’s report showed. Prices of domestic goods rose 0.1 percent
from August and 0.7 percent from a year earlier.  Under a European Union harmonized method, Swiss consumer
prices advanced 0.5 percent from the previous month and 0.2
percent from September 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
