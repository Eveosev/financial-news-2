U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
defended the handling of the sale of shares in Royal Mail Group
Ltd. after the opposition Labour Party said the price has been
set too low as part of a “fire sale.”  In a letter to his Labour opposite number,Chuka Umunna,
who has said Royal Mail is being undervalued, Cable warned there
is a danger of giving small investors the idea that the shares
are bound to rise when they begin trading on Oct. 11.  “It is irresponsible to imply that a share offering looks
significantly undervalued,” Cable wrote, according to a copy of
the letter released by his department today. “I think you
should consider the risk that you may be influencing the
decisions of retail investors. Equity investment always involves
risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the
market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there
is an easy bargain to be made.”  The U.K. government is offering Royal Mail shares at a
price of 300 pence to 330 pence ($4.84-$5.33) apiece. The sale
closes today.  The initial public offering opened on Sept. 27 and was
fully subscribed within hours, mainly on institutional demand,
people with knowledge of the situation have said. The
privatization of the 360-year-old postal service will be the
biggest in the U.K. since former Prime Minister John Major broke
up British Rail in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
