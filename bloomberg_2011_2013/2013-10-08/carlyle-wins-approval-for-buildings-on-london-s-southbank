Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the second-biggest
private-equity firm by assets, won local-government approval to
develop offices, shops and apartments in nine buildings on the
south bank of the River Thames opposite St. Paul’s Cathedral.  London ’s Southwark Borough Council granted permission today
for the project, which includes 489 apartments, about 45,000
square meters (485,000 square feet) of offices and 2,581 square
meters of shops next to the Tate Modern art gallery. The plan,
outlined in filings by affiliates of Washington-based Carlyle,
includes a 170-meter (558-foot) tall residential tower.  The South Bank area is home to some of the city’s most
high-profile real estate developments, including a plan to
redevelop the site of Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s London
headquarters. There are 27 projects under way on the south side
of the River Thames that will produce 16,300 homes during a 10-year period, broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  said in a report last month.  Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese developer controlled by
billionaire Wang Jianlin, is spending 700 million pounds on a
62-story luxury hotel and apartment building in Vauxhall, about
two miles upriver from Carlyle’s project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
