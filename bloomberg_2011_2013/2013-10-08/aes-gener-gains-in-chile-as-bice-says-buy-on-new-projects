AES Gener SA (AESGENER) ,  Chile ’s second-largest
power producer, rebounded from a one-week low after BICE
Inversiones recommending buying the stock, citing increased
revenue from new plants.  The shares advanced 0.9 percent to 300 pesos at 12:49 p.m.
in Santiago. Trading volume was 84 percent of the full-day
average of the past three months. The benchmark  IPSA (IPSA)  index
retreated 0.3 percent.  BICE raised its recommendation from hold as the company
spends $3.15 billion to add about 1,083 megawatts of new
generation capacity in Chile. Analysts Diego Eguiguren and
Agustin Alvarez set a target price of 424 pesos for the end of
2014, saying revenue from those projects accounts for 33 pesos
of that estimate.  “AES Gener has shown great ability to develop new
projects, which is remarkable in the Chilean electric
industry,” the analysts wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  AES Gener, a unit of Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp.,
fell to a 10-month low of 292.17 pesos on Sept. 25, which BICE
attributed to an “overreaction” from investors after the
company announced Sept. 17 it planned to sell $450 million in
new shares.  “Although we can’t discard the possibility of short-term
pressure on share prices, we think that these resources will be
used in value-added projects,” the BICE analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
