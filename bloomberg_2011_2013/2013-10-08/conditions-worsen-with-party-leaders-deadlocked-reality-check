U.S. financial conditions
deteriorated as Republican and Democratic congressional leaders
each said the other party needs to make the next move to resolve
the budget impasse in Washington.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  declined 0.05
to 1.16 to the lowest level since Aug. 30. The gauge measures
stress in the markets by combining everything from money-market
rates to yields on government and corporate bonds to volatility
in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the
index fell as low as negative 1.631.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said the Republican-controlled House should vote to end the government shutdown and
drop demands to change President  Barack Obama ’s signature
healthcare law. House Speaker  John Boehner  said Reid and Obama
should negotiate. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said over the
weekend that Congress must boost the debt limit by Oct. 17 or
the U.S. risks defaulting on its payments.  “What frightens us the most is what happens to the
plumbing system of the global-financial system,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “You will have cascading failure, multiple defaults, and
Treasuries that act as collateral would be very difficult to
exchange and people will simply step back.”  A default could seriously damage the world economy, leading
to major disruptions in financial markets, both in the U.S. and
abroad,  Olivier Blanchard , chief economist of the  International
Monetary Fund , said today at a news conference.  It’s a “low probability, but, were it to happen, it would
have major consequences,” Blanchard said.  Treasuries  Yields on one-month U.S. government securities  climbed  to
0.319 percent, the highest level since October 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities are yielding more
than the 0.174 percent yield on the one-month London interbank
offered  rate .  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury  note was
little changed at 2.63 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The yield is down from the high this year of 3
percent on Sept. 6 and compares with the average of 3.53 percent
over the past decade. The Treasury sold $30 billion of one-month
bills today at a rate of 0.35 percent, the highest since 2008.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, fell 1.6 basis points to 11.25 basis points.
The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of  government securities . The measure has dropped from this
year’s high of 19.55 on June 21.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk increased. The Markit
CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default
swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 1.9 basis points to a
mid-price of 84.5 basis points, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index, which typically climbs as investor
confidence in credit deteriorates and falls as it improves, has
averaged 81.8 this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose 0.16 percent to 1,009.76. The
index has traded in a range of 1,007.9 and 1,053.48 the past
three months. The greenback gained 0.17 percent to 96.87 yen.
The Japanese currency added 0.14 percent to 131.51 per euro.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  fell 1.23 percent to 1,655.45,
the biggest decline since Aug. 27. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  dropped 159.71 points, or 1.07 percent, to 14,776.53.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, rose 4.79 percent to
20.33, approaching its closing high for the year of 20.49 in
June and compared with a low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in
Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE
index fell to 81.12, compared with the average this year is
72.3.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index fell to 8.74, the lowest level since May 8,
versus a 2013 average of 9.38.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
rose 52 cents to $103.55 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,319.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices dropped 2.1
percent last week amid speculation that the Federal shutdown
that has furloughed 800,000 workers would be short-lived.  Copper futures for delivery in December fell 0.24 percent
to $3.2885 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
