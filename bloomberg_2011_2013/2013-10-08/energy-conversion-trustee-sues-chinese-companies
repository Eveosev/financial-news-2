A bankruptcy trustee for Energy
Conversion Devices Inc. sued three Chinese companies, claiming
their price-fixing and dumping drove the U.S. solar-panel maker
out of business.  Trina Solar Ltd.,  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  and
 Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  conspired to export more than 95
percent of their production and dump it at artificially low
prices to dominate the U.S. market, trustee  John Madden  said in
an Oct. 4 lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Detroit.  The trustee is seeking compensation for the loss of $950
million, Energy Conversionâ€™s book value, according to the
complaint, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street
Journal.  The case is Energy Conversion Devices Liquidation Trust v.
Trina Solar Ltd., 13-cv-14241, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
