The  New York  Rangers got their first
National Hockey League win under new coach Alain Vigneault,
beating the Los Angeles Kings 3-1 on the road behind a pair of
goals from  Brad Richards .  Ryan McDonagh was credited with the Rangers’ final goal in
the third period last night when Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick
misplayed a puck off the boards and knocked it into his own net
at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.  Henrik Lundqvist stopped 28 of the 29 shots he faced for
the Rangers after allowing four goals in a season-opening loss
to the Phoenix Coyotes last week.  Vigneault was hired by the Rangers in June, a month after
the team fired  John Tortorella . Vigneault coached the Vancouver
Canucks the previous seven seasons and won the NHL’s coach-of-the-year award in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
