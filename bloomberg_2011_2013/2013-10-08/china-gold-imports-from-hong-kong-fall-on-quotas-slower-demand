Gold shipments to China from  Hong
Kong  fell in August after some Chinese banks used up import
quotas and as buyers became wary of rapid price gains.  Net imports, after deducting flows from China into Hong
Kong, were 110.2 metric tons, from 113.2 tons a month earlier,
according to calculations by Bloomberg. Mainland buyers
purchased 131.4 tons in the month, including scrap, compared
with 129.2 tons in July, data today from the Hong Kong
government showed.  Gold prices rallied for a second month in August, gaining
5.3 percent, as conflict in  Syria  raised concern that the supply
of oil from the  Middle East  could be disrupted, stoking
inflation. Some Chinese banks might have run out of import
quotas after purchases in the first seven months jumped by 89
percent from a year ago, said Duan Shihua, a senior partner at
Shanghai Leading Investment Management Ltd.  “Appetite for gold seemed to slow somewhat as investors
became more cautious after the rapid run-up in prices,” Duan
said. “Some banks might have used up their quotas.”  Gold for immediate delivery in  London  traded at $1,321.42
an ounce at 4:57 p.m. Beijing time. Bullion, which dropped as
low as $1,180.50 an ounce on June 28, has declined 21 percent
this year.  Shanghai Gold  Bullion of  99.99 percent  purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange rose for the second month in August, advancing by 4.4
percent.  China’s total gold consumption this year may jump by 29
percent to reach 1,000 tons, overtaking  India  to become the
world’s largest consumer, according to the World Gold Council.
China and India combined account for more than half of the
world’s demand, according to the Council.  China’s purchases in August were more than twice as much as
the 53.5 tons in the same month last year, according to the data
from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department. Mainland
 China  doesn’t publish such data.  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 21.3 tons in
August, according to a separate Statistics Department statement,
compared with 16 tons in July and 26.5 tons in August 2012.  China may allow more companies to import and export the
precious metal under draft rules released by the central bank on
Sept. 30.  Financial institutions and companies that produce more than
10 tons of gold a year may be considered, the People’s Bank of
China said on its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
