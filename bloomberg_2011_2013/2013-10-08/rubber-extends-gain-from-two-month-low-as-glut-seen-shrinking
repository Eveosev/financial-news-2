Rubber extended a recovery from a
two-month low on prospects that a glut of supply will shrink on
record car sales and reduced output in  India  and Malaysia.  The contract for March delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange climbed as much as 1.9 percent to 261.9 yen a kilogram
($2,709 a metric ton) and traded at 261.2 yen at 10:12 a.m.
Futures extended gains from a two-month low of 253.8 yen reached
Oct. 4, paring losses for this year to 14 percent.  A global surplus will narrow by at least 12 percent to
284,000 tons this year, according to the International Rubber
Study Group, a 36-nation body based in Singapore. RCMA
Commodities Asia Group cut its estimate for this year’s glut by
33 percent to 351,000 tons on smaller-than-expected output
combined with rising demand.  “Rubber fundamentals are improving on reduced output and
healthy demand from  China  and the U.S.,” said Takaki Shigemoto,
an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Futures that fell as much as 62 percent since peaking in
2011 rallied into a  bull market  in August. Prices in Tokyo will
rise to 300 yen by Dec. 31, according to the median of 15
analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Natural rubber production in India, the fourth-biggest
grower, fell 4.9 percent last month, Rubber Board of India said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Imports by the nation rose
to 179,292 tons between April and September from 112,641 tons a
year earlier, it said.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1.4 percent to 20,370  yuan  ($3,327) a ton. The
market resumed trading after a week-long holiday.  Thai rubber  free-on-board was unchanged at 78 baht ($2.49)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
