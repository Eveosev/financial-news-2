The chairman of the U.K. markets
regulator said there is room for improvement in the selection of
client investments by wealth managers.  Suitability of investments, the effect of the Retail
Distribution Review on the industry and anti-money laundering
controls, are three key areas for wealth managers to focus on,
John Griffith-Jones, the Financial Conduct Authority’s chairman,
said at the Wealth Management Association’s annual conference
today.  “The thematic work we have done suggests there is still
room for some improvement” in arranging portfolios that meet
the needs of clients, Griffith-Jones said. “I would like to see
consistent evidence of clients and consumers being placed at the
heart of your business models.”  Griffith-Jones said wealth managers’ advice and the
execution of client-investment decisions would be watched
closely by the FCA. Documents supporting investment decisions
should also be available, he said.  The FCA fined a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unit 3 million pounds
($4.8 million) in May for failing to keep up-to-date records on
clients, including suitability reports.  The regulator’s chairman also urged wealth managers to fill
the “advice gap” left by the introduction of the RDR for
consumers seeking financial help. The RDR, which came into
effect this year, banned U.K. financial advisers from taking
commissions from fund companies to sell their products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
