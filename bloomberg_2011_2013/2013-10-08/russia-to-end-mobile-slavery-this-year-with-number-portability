Russia  plans to end so-called
“mobile slavery” by introducing mobile number portability from
December, according to Telecommunications Minister Nikolay Nikiforov.  The country will at least partially start number
portability from Dec.1 as planned despite proposals to delay
introduction until April 1, Nikiforov said, according to
official government newspaper  Rossiyskaya Gazeta .  The ministry expects about three million Russians a year to
change operator while keeping their mobile-phone number,
Nikiforov told Rossiyskaya.  Tele2 Russia  and  OAO MegaFon (MFON)  have
already successfully tested number portability, and  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  followed last week, the 31-year-old minister said.  Russia has a mobile penetration rate of 164 percent, which
means there are 1.64 active SIM-cards for each person in its
population of 143 million, according to research agency Advanced
Communications & Media. About half of Russians are potentially
ready to switch mobile operators while retaining their mobile
numbers, Nikiforov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
