The commodities super cycle has
“mostly ended,” while investors may still be able to find
profits in raw materials, said Berdibek Ahmedov of Pacific
Investment Management Co.  Prices for spot commodities probably will rise in line with
inflation, Ahmedov, a senior vice president and real return
product manager for PIMCO Europe Ltd., said today in a speech in
London. Inflation expectations are becoming “more and more
volatile,” and commodities are still beneficial as a hedge, he
said.  Investors  also may profit by buying and rolling contracts
closest to delivery in backwardated markets such as oil, where
prices are declining into the future, he said.  “The end of the super cycle doesn’t mean negative returns
for commodities,” Ahmedov said in an interview after his
speech. “There is still a role for commodities in investment
portfolios.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials
rallied to a record in 2008 and has more than doubled in the
past decade. The index is little changed this year, as gold
heads for its first annual loss since 2000 and corn and copper
dropped amid rebounding supply.  “There has been a true supply response in commodities,”
Ahmedov said in his speech. “We agree that the super cycle has
largely ended.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
