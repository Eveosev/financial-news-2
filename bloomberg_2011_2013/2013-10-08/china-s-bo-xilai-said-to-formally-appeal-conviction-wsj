Former Chinese Communist Party
Politburo member  Bo Xilai  appealed his conviction for bribery,
embezzlement and abuse of power, the Wall Street Journal
 reported  yesterday, citing an unidentified person.  Bo’s appeal was filed Sept. 30, a week after he was
convicted and sentenced by a court in Jinan in eastern  China ’s
Shandong province, the newspaper reported, citing the person,
who it said has direct knowledge of the case. The appeal process
may take two months or longer, the WSJ said.  The appeal, while expected because Bo had denied all
charges at his trial, is unlikely to affect the outcome of the
case, which has probably been decided by the Communist Party’s
top leadership, the Journal said, citing unidentified lawyers
and “party insiders.”  Bo, 64, was sentenced to life in prison last month by the
Jinan Intermediate People’s Court for corruption, bringing an
end to a crisis that roiled China’s Communist Party as the
country’s leaders prepare to lay out an economic reform agenda.  The court found Bo guilty of taking 20.4 million  yuan  ($3.3
million) in bribes, embezzling 5 million yuan and abusing his
power following a trial that exposed graft at the highest levels
in the communist state.  Two phone calls to the  Higher People’s Court  in Shandong
where the newspaper said the appeal may be heard, went
unanswered outside normal business hours.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
