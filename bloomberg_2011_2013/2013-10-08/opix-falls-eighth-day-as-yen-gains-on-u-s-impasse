Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index extending its longest drop since July 2012, as the yen
gained amid the deadlock over raising the U.S. debt limit to
avoid a default.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets almost 70 percent of revenue from
outside Japan, slumped 2.9 percent. Yahoo Japan Corp. tumbled
8.7 percent after saying it would scrap vendor fees for its
shopping and auction websites, while rival Rakuten Inc. plunged
19 percent. Oki Electric Industry Co., which makes
semiconductors and automated teller machines, jumped 7.4 percent
after a report it would post an unexpected first-half profit.  The Topix lost 0.4 percent to 1,143.11 as of 9:27 a.m. in
 Tokyo , headed for an eighth day of declines. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average dropped 0.3 percent to 13,805.75. The yen traded
at 96.76 per dollar after rising 0.8 percent yesterday.  “Japanese shares are getting hit with a double-whammy as
the U.S. problems channel through to the yen,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.,
a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest lender by market value. “We’re seeing a lack of buying
because of uncertainty, and investors are also selling to hedge
their risks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
