Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures jumped
after the central bank relaxed liquidity curbs for the financial
system. Rupee forwards gained.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery rose 0.8
percent to 5,979 at 9:31 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 5,906.15 yesterday.
The S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.1 percent. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares rose 0.2 percent.
One-month rupee  forwards  rose 0.3 percent to 62.26 per dollar.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cut the
marginal standing facility rate to 9 percent from 9.5 percent,
the second reduction in a month, as the rupee’s stabilization
gives the authority scope to relax cash curbs on the nation’s
lenders. The rupee has climbed about 11 percent versus the
dollar since reaching a record low in August.  “Markets have turned positive recently on easing of
liquidity concerns and also due to the appreciation of the
rupee,” Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at
Kotak Securities Ltd., wrote in an e-mail yesterday.  Rajan’s predecessor  Duvvuri Subbarao  increased both the
marginal standing facility and bank rates by 200 basis points in
July to try and contain the drop in the currency, which had been
weighed down by a current-account deficit, inflation and slower
economic growth.  Global investors bought a net $89.9 million of local stocks
on Oct. 4, taking this year’s purchases to $13.7 billion, data
from the regulator show. That’s the second-biggest inflow among
10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, after Japan.  The Sensex has risen 2.4 percent this year and is  valued  at
13.7 times projected 12-month profits, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
trading at 10.5 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
