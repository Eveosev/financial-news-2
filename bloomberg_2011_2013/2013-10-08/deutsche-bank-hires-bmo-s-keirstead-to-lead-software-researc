Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe’s biggest
investment bank by revenue, hired Karl Keirstead as an equity
analyst heading research of the U.S. software industry.  Keirstead, who will start as a director in December,
previously covered software at BMO Capital Markets, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank said today in an e-mailed statement. He’ll
be based in New York and report to Steve Pollard, head of
research for the Americas, the company said.  “Karl is a seasoned analyst possessing a blend of broad
technical skills, deep fundamental insights and extensive
corporate relationships,” Pollard said in the statement.  Keirstead started in 2010 at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s capital
markets unit, where he was a managing director, according to his
profile on  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) ’s website. From 2007 to 2010, he
worked as a senior equity analyst at Kaufman Bros. LP.  Keirstead began his equity-research career at Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 1996 covering information technology
services, according to the statement. He’s listed in
Institutional Investor magazine’s all-America research team
rankings in 2001 and 2002, Deutsche Bank said.  Tom Ernst, who previously covered software at Deutsche
Bank, joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in July to help lead
