Bank of America Corp. today moved
back its prediction for when  Canada ’s central bank will raise
its policy interest rate to the first half of 2016, the same day
the International Monetary Fund said an increase is expected
late next year.  “We continue to doubt the BoC view that the return to
export led growth is right around the corner,” Joshua Dennerlein, an economist in New York, said in an e-mailed
research note, referring to the Bank of Canada. His previous
prediction was for a rate increase in late 2014.  Dennerlein is the second economist in a week to say
Governor Stephen Poloz will keep the key rate at 1 percent until
2016, following Scotiabank vice-president of economics Derek
Holt. Earlier today the Washington-based IMF said a rate
increase is expected next year as growth accelerates to 2.2
percent from 1.6 percent.  Bank of America today also pared its 2014 Canada growth
forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and said “with
domestic sources of growth tapped out, we expect only a limited
acceleration in Canada’s growth rate over the next several
years.”  Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said last week a shift
in the drivers of growth to business investment and exports from
consumption is “elusive,” and cut the bank’s growth forecast
for the second half of this year. Statistics Canada today said
the nation’s trade deficit widened to C$1.31 billion ($1.26
billion) in August, exceeding all 20 economist forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey that had a median estimate of C$700 million.  Dennerlein also said the central bank will probably move
back its outlook for when  inflation  will return to the 2 percent
target to late 2015 or the first half of 2016, when it makes its
next interest rate announcement Oct. 23. The Bank of Canada’s
forecast in July was for inflation to be 2 percent in the second
quarter of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
