Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SUZB3)  and  Fibria
Celulose SA (FIBR3) , Brazil’s best-performing paper makers this year,
rallied as  Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc. recommended buying the
stocks, citing higher pulp demand and lower supply.  Fibria advanced 4.3 percent to 27.29 reais at 2:37 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  trading, the biggest gain today on the MSCI
Brazil/Materials Index, which was little changed. Suzano added
2.4 percent to 8.79 reais, the second-biggest advance on that
gauge. The benchmark Ibovespa index slid 0.5 percent.  Goldman Sachs boosted its recommendation on both stocks
from the equivalent of hold, citing a 26 percent increase in
Brazilian pulp sales to China in August. Fibria and Suzano will
also gain as the decision by Chile’s Empresas Copec SA and
Finland’s Stora Enso Oyj to postpone the opening of a plant in
Uruguay to the first quarter of 2014 reduces supply, according
to Goldman Sachs.  Fibria and Suzano “are best positioned to benefit from
improved demand,”  Marcelo Aguiar , Diogo Miura and Humberto Meireles, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note to
clients. “Both stocks have already significantly outperformed
the market year-to-date, but this has largely reflected
depreciation of the Brazilian currency and higher pulp prices in
2013.”  Suzano gained 25 percent this year and Fibria advanced 20
percent while the real weakened 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
