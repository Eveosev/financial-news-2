Investors appear less concerned about
the wrangling over the U.S. government’s budget and debt ceiling
than they were two years ago, according to Barry Knapp, Barclays
Plc’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks one indicator that Knapp used
to draw his conclusion, presented in an Oct. 4 report: the cost
of credit-default-swap contracts that insure against default on
U.S. Treasury securities.  Last week’s closing rate of 45.5 basis points was well
below a peak of 64.4 basis points in July 2011, the last time
the federal debt limit was almost breached, according to data
compiled by McGraw Hill Financial Inc.’s CMA unit. Every basis
point is equivalent to $1,000 a year for a contract protecting
$10 million of debt.  “A muted equity reaction is probable,” Knapp wrote,
because rising tax receipts and narrower budget deficits have
bolstered the U.S.’s fiscal position. Any increases in the CDS
rate and other “market implied risk” indicators from current
levels may be reversed, the New York-based strategist wrote.  One of the gauges shows the extent to which stocks in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index move in tandem, as they often do in
the midst of turmoil. The S&P 500’s implied correlation dropped
to 49.5 percent on Oct. 3 from 81.3 percent two years earlier,
according to data cited in the report.  Another indicator is the S&P 500’s implied volatility, a
barometer of potential price swings that’s based on prices of
index options. The Oct. 3 reading was 14.1, down from 40.7 on
Oct. 3, 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
