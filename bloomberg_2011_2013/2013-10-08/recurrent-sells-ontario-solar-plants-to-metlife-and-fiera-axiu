Recurrent Energy, a solar developer
owned by  Sharp Corp. (6753) , agreed to sell eight plants itâ€™s building
in Ontario, Canada, to  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Fiera Axium
Infrastructure Inc. for an undisclosed amount.  The Ontario Power Authority will buy the output from the 86
megawatts of power plants over 20 years, San Francisco-based
Recurrent said today in a statement. The projects are expected
to be completed early next year and will produce enough
electricity for more than 10,250 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
