American Electric Power Co. (AEP) , the
largest U.S. consumer of coal, expects stable natural gas prices
and continued swings in the cost of coal as plants are shut to
meet tighter pollution standards.  “I don’t see a big major shift in the price of gas in the
next decade,” Chief Executive Officer Nick Akins said today in
an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “They
continue to find more natural gas all the time.”  American Electric, which supplies more than 5 million
customers in 11 states, sees coal accounting for less than 50
percent of its generation capacity in 2016, down from 60 percent
this year, as dependence on gas increases. The Columbus, Ohio-based company plans to close coal plants capable of producing
7,150 megawatts by 2015, part of an estimated 60,000 to 70,000
megawatts being shut industry wide to meet tighter U.S. air
pollution standards.  Driven by a glut in supply from shale formations, gas
futures prices on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  reached a 10-year low of $1.927 per million British thermal units last year.
Gas is averaging $3.681 per mmBtu this year. Akins said that
even with gas prices at $7, the more efficient burn rate
compared with coal would make it the cheaper option.  Central Appalachian coal futures, the U.S. benchmark, have
ranged from $43.75 a ton to $81.77 a ton during the past five
years. The price has averaged $59.34 this year as producers
announced mine closings that will cut output by millions of
tons. Proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules
restricting power plant carbon dioxide emissions mean no coal-fired units will be added, he said.  “It’s going to go up and down,” Akins said of the price
of coal. “You’re retiring generation around the country and
you’re retiring coal mining capacity.”  American Electric’s coal consumption has fallen to about 55
million tons a year from a peak of 80 million in 2007, Akins
said. “Our future resources will be natural gas,” Akins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
