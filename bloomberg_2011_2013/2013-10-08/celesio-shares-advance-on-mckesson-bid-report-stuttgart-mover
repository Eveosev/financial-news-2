Celesio AG (CLS1)  shares rose to the highest
level in more than two years after a report that  McKesson Corp. (MCK) 
is in talks with majority shareholder Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH to
acquire the German drug wholesaler.  The shares  rose  as much as 19 percent and traded 17 percent
higher at 19.97 euros at 12:03 p.m. in  Frankfurt  today.  McKesson has gained access to Stuttgart, Germany-based
Celesio’s books may value the company at about 22 euros a share,
a premium of about 30 percent to yesterday’s closing price, Dow
Jones reported earlier today. The San Francisco-based company
may announce a bid as early as this month, according to the
report.  The stock has climbed 56 percent so far this year, giving
the company a market value of 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion),
amid speculation the company could be sold.  A possible Celesio sale comes as medical expenses rise and
governments cut spending in Europe. Drug wholesalers have been
examining their positions in Europe and ways to reduce costs
since  Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S. drugstore chain, agreed to
buy a 45 percent stake of U.K. pharmacy owner Alliance Boots in
2012.  Spokesmen for Celesio and Haniel declined to comment.
Representatives of McKesson couldn’t be immediately reached for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
