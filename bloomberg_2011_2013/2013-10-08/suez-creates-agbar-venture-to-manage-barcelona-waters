Suez Environnement (SEV) , the second-biggest water company in Europe, created a joint venture through
its Agbar unit to manage  Barcelona ’s water supplies and waste
for the next 35 years.  The 3.5 billion-euro ($4.8 billion) contract, announced in
part in July, will be handled via a venture with Metropolitan
Area of Barcelona, according to today’s statement. Agbar will
have an 85 percent stake and AMB the balance of a venture that
will serve 24 municipalities including Barcelona.  The Paris-based company gained control of Sociedad General
de Aguas de Barcelona SA in 2009 to expand in Spain, where the
water market was growing faster than in France. Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade has said Spain’s economic slowdown
since hasn’t stopped consumers from paying their bills.  The venture for the Catalan capital will be called Aguas de
Barcelona and supply 3 million residents in Spain’s second-most
populous city, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
