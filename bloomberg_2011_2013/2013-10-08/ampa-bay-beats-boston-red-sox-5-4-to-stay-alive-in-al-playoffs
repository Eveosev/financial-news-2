Jose Lobaton hit a game-ending home
run with two outs in the ninth inning and the Tampa Bay Rays
rallied from three runs down to defeat the  Boston  Red Sox 5-4
and stay alive in their American League division playoff series.  Lobaton, who came into the game as a late-inning
replacement, blasted a ball into the pool in the right-field
stands at Tropicana Field to give the host Rays their first win
in the best-of-five series after a pair of lopsided losses in
Boston.  The Red Sox took a 3-0 lead, with the runs scoring on a
throwing error, a wild pitch and David Ortizâ€™s RBI single. Evan
Longoria tied the game with a three-run homer in the fifth
inning.  Tampa Bay took a 4-3 lead in the eighth on a run-scoring
groundout by pinch-hitter Delmon Young, only to have Boston tie
it in the ninth on an RBI groundout by Dustin Pedroia.  Earlier today, Cardinals rookie Michael Wacha came
within five outs of pitching the third postseason no-hitter in
Major League Baseball history as the St. Louis Cardinals
defeated the host Pittsburgh Pirates 2-1 to even their playoff
series at two games each.  At  Detroit , Josh Reddick, Brandon Moss and Seth Smith
hit home runs as the Oakland Athletics won 6-3 against the
Tigers to take a two-games-to-one lead in their AL division
playoff series.  Tonight, the Los Angeles Dodgers lead 2-0 in the third
inning on a pair of solo home runs by Carl Crawford as they try
to finish off their NL series at home against the Atlanta
Braves. Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw started on three days
rest for the first time in his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
