Portugal ’s  economy  will contract less
than previously forecast this year as export growth accelerates,
the country’s central bank said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.6 percent in 2013
after declining 3.2 percent in 2012, the Lisbon-based Bank of
Portugal said today in its autumn economic bulletin. In July,
the central bank forecast a contraction of 2 percent this year
and growth of 0.3 percent in 2014. Today’s report doesn’t
include forecasts for next year.  “The information about the second quarter of 2013 and the
available indicators for the third quarter suggest that a
gradual process of economic recovery may be starting,” the
central bank said in a statement.  While the economy may pick up next year, Prime Minister
 Pedro Passos Coelho  still has to trim spending by about 3.3
billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2014 after relying mainly on tax
increases this year to meet targets set in a European Union-led
rescue program. Portugal is trying to regain full access to debt
markets with the end of the 78 billion-euro rescue plan
approaching in June.  “In the near future, the Portuguese economy faces the
enormous challenge of regaining full access to market
financing,” the Bank of Portugal said.  Export Growth  The country’s economy expanded in the second quarter for
the first time since 2010 on faster export growth. The
government raised its 2014 growth forecast on Oct. 3 to 0.8
percent from 0.6 percent. It estimated the economy will shrink
1.8 percent this year, less than its previous prediction of 2.3
percent.  Exports (PTTBEUAL)  will rise 5.8 percent this year, the central bank
said today. The  trade surplus  is forecast to widen to 2.1
percent of GDP in 2013 from 0.1 percent last year, when the
nation registered the first surplus in the balance of goods and
services in at least 60 years, according to the Bank of
Portugal. It projects inflation of 0.6 percent for 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
