Crude oil puts rose on speculation
that increasing oil supplies and lower fuel demand amid a
partial U.S. government shutdown will depress crude futures.  Implied volatility of puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in December futures prices on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, a measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge
of value, rose to 25.61 percent at 2:45 p.m. from 24.68 percent
yesterday. Puts accounted for 69 percent of electronic trading
volume today, and the seven most active options in electronic
trading today were puts for November, December and January.  “We’re seeing people buying puts,” said Selo Kraja, a
senior account executive at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“There’s a lot of interest in December and January, short-term
for $102 and $100 puts and longer-term for $87, $88 and $89
puts.  November $100 puts, the most active contract in electronic
trading, fell 8 cents to 37 cents a barrel with 4,002 lots
trading as of 3 p.m. December $87 puts climbed 1 cent to 12
cents a barrel on volume of 2,519 contracts.  At-the-money volatility for December options rose to 20.58
percent from 20.39 yesterday.  U.S. crude inventories surged 5.47 million barrels to 363.7
million in the week ended Sep.t 27, the biggest gain since
April, Energy Information Administration data show. The EIA will
probably report tomorrow that stockpiles increased 1.55 million
barrels last week, according to the median estimate of 10
estimates in a survey by Bloomberg.  Ample Supply  ‘‘Supplies are good,’’ said Kraja. ‘‘Unless we get some
news out of the  Middle East  or the  Federal Reserve , prices
should trail off.’’  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery climbed
48 cents to settle at $103.31 a barrel on the Nymex. The front-month November contract, which will expire Oct. 22, gained 46
cents to $103.49.  Prices rose as President  Barack Obama  reiterated that he
won’t negotiate with Republicans over the shutdown and the U.S.
debt limit. The U.S. will run out of borrowing authority on Oct.
17 unless the debt ceiling is raised. Congress has been unable
to hammer out a spending bill.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 54 percent of
the 89,524 lots traded.  November $108 calls were the most-active options yesterday
with 7,519 contracts changing hands as they lost 16 cents to 10
cents a barrel. November $98 puts, the next-most active,
advanced 4 cents to 21 cents on volume of 6,361 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,831 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,780 lots
and December $100 calls with 31,859.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
