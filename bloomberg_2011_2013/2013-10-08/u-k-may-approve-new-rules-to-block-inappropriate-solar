The U.K. may bring in sustainability
criteria to prevent “inappropriate” solar parks from receiving
subsidies if tougher planning guidelines don’t work, Energy
Minister  Greg Barker  said.  “I want local planning authorities to be much bolder in
refusing inappropriate solar developments,” Barker said today
in an interview at the sidelines of an industry conference in
Birmingham. “If that’s not enough I will come forward with
sustainability criteria and not allow them to claim subsidies.”  Ministers are trying to stem a backlash against renewable
energy projects that some campaigners say blight the landscape
and that also benefit from guaranteed power rates, raising
consumer bills. The government in June announced plans for wind
farm developers to pay communities to host their farms, and in
July, ministers toughened solar park planning guidelines.  Inappropriate and unsustainable photovoltaic projects can
include very large greenfield sites that antagonize local
communities or raise questions over their impact on landscapes,
Barker said.  The planning guidelines introduced in July were a response
to concerns from politicians from rural constituencies, who aim
to limit large-scale solar plants on fields. Such large projects
are increasingly driving the fast-growth in solar capacity in
the country, which surpassed 2.4 gigawatts at the end of June,
according to the energy ministry.  “I want to make sure that a small minority of developers
don’t ruin it for the rest of the industry,” Barker said as he
presented a road map for the U.K.’s first solar strategy today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
