U.K. government bonds declined after
an industry report showed a gauge of  house prices  rose to the
highest level in more than a decade last month.  A gauge by the  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors
increased to 54, the highest since June 2002, from 41 in August,
the London-based group said in a report, citing a poll of
property surveyors. The Debt Management Office is scheduled to
sell 1.75 billion pounds ($2.81 billion) of inflation-linked
bonds today. The pound was little changed.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield climbed two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.73 percent at 8:10 a.m. in
 London . The 2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 fell 0.155,
or 1.55 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.895.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2.8 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.7 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined
2.4 percent.  The  Bank of England  will keep its benchmark rate at 0.5
percent and its asset-purchase stimulus target at 375 billion
pounds when it announces its policy decision on Oct. 10,
according to Bloomberg News surveys of economists.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.6075 after rising to
$1.6260 on Oct. 1, the strongest since Jan. 2. The U.K. currency
was at 84.40 pence per euro.  Sterling jumped 4.4 percent versus the dollar in September
as improving economic data prompted investors to increase bets
the central bank would raise borrowing costs earlier than it had
predicted. Services activity expanded in September and house
prices climbed, reports showed last week.  The pound advanced 5.9 percent in the past six months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 0.1
percent and the euro rose 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
