South African scientists will this
week present evidence of a comet that struck Earth, heating the
sands of the  Sahara desert  to 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632
degrees Fahrenheit) and forming the silica glass found in
Egyptian King Tutankhamun’s scarab broach.  “Evidence of a comet entering Earth’s atmosphere and
exploding, raining down a shock wave of fire, which obliterated
every life form in its path,” Johannesburg’s  University of the
Witwatersrand  says in an e-mailed statement today. “The comet
entered Earth’s atmosphere above  Egypt  28 million years ago.”  In addition to glass, the impact produced microscopic
diamonds. Evidence of this is contained in a black, diamond-bearing pebble found “years earlier” by an Egyptian geologist,
the university said.  “The authors came to the inescapable conclusion that it
represented the very first known hand specimen of a comet
nucleus,” the university said. The pebble has been named
Hypatia after a female mathematician and astronomer from
Alexandria in Egypt.  The research will be presented at a public lecture at the
university of the Witwatersrand, known as Wits, on Oct. 10 and
will be published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.  Professor Charles Block of Wits, Professor Jan Kramers of
the University of Johannesburg, Doctor Marco Andreoli of the
South African Nuclear Energy Corp. and Chris Harris of the
University of  Cape Town  led the research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
