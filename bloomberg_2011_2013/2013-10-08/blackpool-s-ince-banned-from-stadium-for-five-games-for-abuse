Blackpool manager Paul Ince was given
a five-match stadium ban after verbally abusing the officials
during his team’s game at Bournemouth last month.  English soccer’s Football Association said Ince used
abusive and threatening language, as well as violent conduct,
toward the officials near the tunnel area during Blackpool’s 2-1
win on Sept. 14. The former England midfielder was also fined
4,000 pounds ($6,400), the governing body said in a  statement .  “Blackpool Football Club acknowledges the decision of the
Football Association and will now work closely with Paul and his
coaching staff to ensure that the penalty imposed does not
affect our short or long-term objectives,” the club said in a
statement.  Blackpool is sixth in the second-tier Championship with 20
points, six behind Burnley and Queens Park Rangers at the top of
the standings. Ince will miss league matches against Wigan,
Blackburn, Nottingham Forest, Ipswich and Birmingham.  The F.A. said a charge against assistant manager Alex Rae
of using threatening behavior toward an official was not proven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
