Copper advanced in  London  on signs of
growth in  China , the world’s largest metals buyer.  China’s services activity index was 52.4 last month
compared with 52.8 in August, according to the HSBC China
Services report compiled by Markit. An index above 50 indicates
an overall increase in services activity. Prices in  Shanghai 
fell 0.2 percent on the first day back after a weeklong holiday.  “China’s September service PMI adds more evidence that the
overall economy is improving,” Richard Fu, director for Asian
commodity trading at Newedge Group SA in London, said by e-mail
today. “Buyers are still holding back waiting for the U.S. debt
limit to be sorted.”  Copper for delivery in three months climbed 0.4 percent to
$7,274 a metric ton by 10:04 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices dropped 0.8 percent in London during the China holiday.  Germany may report rising factory orders, economists said
in a Bloomberg survey.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer, releases earnings today, marking the unofficial start
of the U.S. quarterly reporting season.  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher 
said yesterday the U.S. “cannot afford to default” and that
debt ceiling talks “will come down to the wire.” The country’s
borrowing authority is set to lapse Oct. 17.  Nickel fell 0.2 percent to $13,937 a ton, after stockpiles
extended gains to a record. Aluminum rose 0.8 percent and lead
climbed 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
