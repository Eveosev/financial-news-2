Belgium ’s federal government agreed
about a minimal stimulus package as part of a 2014 budget deal
that relies on an economic recovery to boost tax revenue and
meet the deficit goals agreed with the European Commission.  The budget assumes fiscal receipts will rise by more than  5
percent  next year as the Belgian economy recovers, compensating
for lower revenue from financial institutions and an increase in
welfare spending. Balanced regional budgets and a small surplus
at the level of municipalities should help contain Belgium’s
nominal deficit to about 2.15 percent of gross domestic product
next year, Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said.  “We continue to apply the Belgian prescription, which
consists of a mix of savings and supporting businesses and the
purchasing power of consumers,” Di Rupo told reporters in
Brussels today. He said the government couldn’t reach an
agreement to apply a reduced value-added-tax rate for
electricity.  Lack of consensus among the six parties in Prime Minister
Di Rupo’s coalition government ahead of next year’s elections
and the threat of fines under the European Union’s excessive
deficit procedure meant additional tax cuts for employers and
workers on the lowest wages were capped at about 260 million
euros ($350 million), less than the 400 million euros offered
last year.  Di Rupo said the government will continue talks about
toughening the Competition Act, designed in 1996 to keep Belgian
labor costs from rising faster than those in neighboring
countries.  The 2014 budget is based on the Belgian planning bureau’s
forecast of economic growth accelerating to 1.1 percent next
year after stagnating this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
