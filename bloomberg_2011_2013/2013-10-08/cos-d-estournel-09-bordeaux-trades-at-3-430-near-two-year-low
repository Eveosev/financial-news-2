A case of 2009 wine from Chateau Cos
d’Estournel, a second-growth Saint-Estephe estate, sold for
2,132 pounds ($3,430) on the Liv-ex market this week, near its
lowest level for two years and 15 percent below a 2013 high.  The trade, along with the 2,123 pounds a case at which 24
bottles changed hands Sept. 23, was the lowest since two cases
of the vintage each sold for 2,100 pounds in September 2011,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 2 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by declines since then. Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over
the past two months have weighed on prices of other vintages
from the region.  “With sellers trying to raise money, pressure has fallen
on the most recent physical vintages,” Liv-ex said in its
monthly Cellar Watch market report.  Cos d’Estournel 2009 dropped 39 percent from its peak
of 3,500 pounds a case on Liv-ex in March last year, and 6
percent from the 2,270 pounds at which it traded in June 2010
when it was released to the international market. It rallied
yesterday, with 24 bottles selling for 2,200 pounds a case.  In the international auction market, a single case sold at
Acker Merrall & Condit in  New York  last month for $4,305.   The 2009 vintage is the most expensive Cos d’Estournel
since 1982, according to merchant data collated by Liv-ex.  Parker Points  The 2009 Cos d’Estournel was given a perfect 100-point
rating by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , putting it at the top
of all wines produced by the estate.  Parker described it in a February 2012 tasting note as
having “an extraordinary bouquet of white flowers interwoven
with blackberry and blueberry liqueur, incense, charcoal and
graphite.” He said the wine should “age effortlessly for a
half century.”  Cos d’Estournel is located in Saint-Estephe, north of close
neighbor Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, and was designated a second-growth estate in the classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s
1855 Paris Exhibition, which remains in force throughout the
Medoc region.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
