Stock Spirits Group, the central
European distiller owned by  Oaktree Capital Management LLC (OAK) , is
selling shares in an initial public offering at 210 to 260 pence
apiece, according to terms of the sale seen by  Bloomberg News .  The  price range  implies a market capitalization of 420
million pounds ($675 million) to 520 million pounds, the terms
show. The London sale closes on Oct. 21 and the stock will start
trading the next day.  Stock Spirits, the largest vodka maker in Poland and  Italy ,
comes to the market for a second time on the heels of a quarter
where IPO volume in  Europe  rose about six-fold as the region’s
economies strengthened and fears of a debt crisis eased, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Stock Spirits will seek about 52
million pounds through the sale, it said Sept. 26.  Oaktree, which had attempted to list the distiller in 2011,
plans to remain the largest shareholder after the transaction,
though the company will sell some stock in the IPO.  The range at which the shares are being offered implies a
price to 2014 estimated earnings multiple of 11.8 times to 14.6
times, according to the terms. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura
Holdings Inc. are managing the sale.  Stock Spirits, which was bought by Oaktree in 2007,
reported revenue of 292.4 million euros in 2012. The distiller
said in 2011 it would continue to be owned by Oaktree after
potential bidders including  Diageo Plc (DGE)  and Bain Capital LLC
balked at an asking price said at the time to be more than 700
million euros ($946 million).  The IPO would leave 35 percent to 55 percent of the company
publicly traded, according to today’s terms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
