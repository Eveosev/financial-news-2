Indonesia ’s 10-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost two weeks,
before a meeting today at which the central bank is forecast to
leave borrowing costs unchanged. Rupiah forwards weakened.  Bank Indonesia  will keep its policy  rate  at 7.25 percent,
according to 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One sees
a 25-basis-point increase. The monetary authority has raised the
 reference rate  by 1.5 percentage points since mid-June as it
seeks to narrow the current-account deficit from a record in the
second quarter. The  trade balance  swung to a surplus in August
after recording the largest-ever shortfall in July.  “The country needs to continue curbing the current-account
deficit and monetary tightening would be useful, but we are not
expecting a rate hike,” said Irene Cheung, a foreign-exchange
strategist at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “The market has priced in the positive trade data.”  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 declined one basis point to 8.1 percent, the lowest level
since Sept. 25, as of 9:48 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield has fallen
41 basis points this month.  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.4
percent to 11,365 per dollar, the biggest drop since Sept. 30,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded 1.5
percent stronger than the onshore spot rate, which declined 0.1
percent to 11,540 per dollar, prices from local banks show.  Reserves Rise  A daily fixing used to settle the contracts was set at
11,209 per dollar yesterday, according to the Association of
Banks in Singapore. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 15.56
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Foreign-currency reserves climbed for a second month to
$95.7 billion in September, from $93 billion the previous month,
the central bank said in a statement late yesterday. That pared
the loss this year to 15 percent.  The yield on the government’s 9.5 percent bonds due June
2015 climbed four basis points to 7.08 percent, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. Indonesia plans
to offer 8 trillion rupiah ($693 million) of local-currency debt
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
