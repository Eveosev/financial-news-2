The  Federal Reserve  began supplying
banks with a  redesigned $100 note  with features aimed at
thwarting counterfeiters, including a blue, three-dimensional
security ribbon with images of bells and 100s.  “The new design incorporates security features that make
it easier to authenticate, but harder to replicate,” Fed
Governor Jerome Powell said in a press release today. “As the
new note transitions into daily transactions, the user-friendly
security features will allow the public to more easily verify
its authenticity.”  The introduction of the $100 note, unveiled in 2010, was
postponed due to a production delay. The Fed said consumers
don’t need to trade in older-design $100 notes for new ones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
