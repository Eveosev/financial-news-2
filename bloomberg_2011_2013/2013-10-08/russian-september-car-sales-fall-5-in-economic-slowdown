Russia ’s new car and light commercial
vehicle sales declined 5 percent in September from a year
earlier to 246,895, following the country’s worst economic
slowdown since 2009.  Automakers sold 2 million vehicles in the first nine months
of 2013, 7 percent fewer than in the same period a year earlier,
the Association of European Businesses in Russia said in an e-mailed statement. It was the seventh straight monthly decline.
Sales for OAO  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , the biggest Russian car producer, lost 14
percent in the first nine months, while its shareholder  Renault (RNO) 
SA gained 12 percent, the data showed.  Russian economic growth slowed to 1.2 percent in the second
quarter versus a year earlier, a deceleration from as much as
5.1 percent in the final three months of 2011. Car sales had
grown at least 11 percent for the last three years.  “Total market momentum is still lacking the sufficient
strength necessary to achieve a stable level, as a pre-condition
for moderate growth in the nearer future,”  Joerg Schreiber,
Chairman of the AEB Automobile Manufacturers Committee, said in
the statement.  Full-year 2013 sales could be 5.1 percent lower than in
2012, or about 2.79 million cars, according to the AEB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
