Mitchell J. Milias, co-founder and
chairman of Primecap Management Co., will step down at the end
of the year as co-manager of three Vanguard Group Inc. funds
with combined assets of more than $42 billion.  Joel P. Fried, Theo A. Kolokotrones, Alfred W. Mordecai and
M. Mohsin Ansari, co-managers of the $36.2 billion  Vanguard
Primecap Fund (VPMCX) , the $5.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core Fund and
the $574.8 million Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund’s Capital
Growth Portfolio, will take over most of the money overseen by
Milias, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard said today in
a statement. Milias, 71, will remain with Primecap in a
management and client-relationship role, Vanguard said.  “We have full confidence in the talented co-managers and
analysts at Primecap who will oversee these funds going
forward,” Bill McNabb, Vanguard’s chairman and chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Vanguard Primecap returned an annual average of 14 percent
in the five years through yesterday, beating 60 percent of
competing funds. Primecap Core had a 15 percent annual return in
that time, beating 85 percent of peers. A portion of the assets
overseen by Milias will be run by Primecap’s research
department.  Vanguard, known for its index-based funds, contracts with
31 outside asset managers to run many of its actively managed
offerings. Vanguard has about $2.3 trillion in U.S. fund assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
