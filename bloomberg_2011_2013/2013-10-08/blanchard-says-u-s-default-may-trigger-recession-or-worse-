A U.S. government default would
“almost surely” derail the nation’s economic recovery and lead
to potentially major market disruptions worldwide, said  Olivier Blanchard , chief economist of the  International Monetary Fund .  Blanchard was speaking today during a press conference in
Washington. He called a default a “tail risk” and a low-probability event.  A failure to lift the U.S. debt limit that triggers a
default could mean the economy slides into a “recession or even
worse,” he said.  The Washington-based IMF, which is holding its annual
meeting this week in the U.S. capital, released an update of its
World Economic Outlook earlier today that showed lower
projections for global growth this year and next than the fund
predicted in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
