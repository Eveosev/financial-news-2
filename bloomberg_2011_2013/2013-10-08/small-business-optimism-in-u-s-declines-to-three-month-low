Confidence among U.S. small
businesses fell in September to the lowest level in three months
as more companies grew pessimistic about the economic outlook.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s  optimism
index  decreased to 93.9 last month from 94.1. Three of the
measure’s 10 components accounted for the decline, the
Washington-based group said.  The share of business owners expecting an improvement in
 business conditions  in the next six months slumped by 8
percentage points, the biggest drop since November, to minus 10
percent. The decrease may have reflected mounting concerns ahead
of the federal government shutdown that began last week.  “Consumers and small-business owners are pessimistic, not
expecting a ‘crash’ in the economy, just accepting the notion
that growth is going to be sub-par and that their government is
likely to continue in dysfunctional mode,”  William Dunkelberg ,
the group’s chief economist, said in a statement.  The figures also showed fewer companies reported an
improvement in earnings. At the same time, more said they
projected sales will increase.  The NFIB data was based on a survey of 773 small-business
owners through Sept. 30. Small companies represent more than 99
percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S. Small
Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
