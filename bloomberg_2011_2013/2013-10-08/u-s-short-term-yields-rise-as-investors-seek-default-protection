Treasury  one-month bill  rates surged
to the highest since 2008 and yields on  three-year notes  rose as
the U.S. sold $30 billion of the debt in the first auction of
coupon securities since the start of the government shutdown.  The Treasury sold $30 billion of one-month bills at a rate
of 0.35 percent, the highest since November 2008 and more than
double the rate on comparable one-month securities yesterday.
China and  Japan , America’s largest foreign creditors with
combined holdings of more than $2.4 trillion, raised pressure on
the U.S. to resolve the political impasse. The three-year notes
attracted higher-than-average demand from an investor class that
includes foreign central banks.  “There’s nervousness in the bills sector,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,
 Pennsylvania . “Demand remains outside the money-market arena
for  Treasury securities . The market is looking to the
figureheads in government to provide clarity and direction on
which way this is going.”  The U.S. three-year  yield  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 0.67 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the
0.875 percent note maturing in September 2016 fell 3/32, or 94
cents per $1,000 face value, to 100 19/32.  Benchmark  10-year yields  rose one basis point to 2.63
percent, after rising as much as three basis points.  ‘Causing Troubles’  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 83 percent to $378.3
billion, from $206 billion yesterday. It was the biggest jump
since July 31. The average this year is $316 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index was little changed at 81. It climbed on
Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in two months. It touched a
record low 49 in May.  Today’s one-month bill auction had a bid-to-cover ratio --
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
debt offered -- of 2.75, the lowest since March 2009. Indirect
bidders, a category that includes foreign central banks,
purchased 31 percent of the securities, the most since May.  “This uncertainty in  Washington  is causing troubles in the
market, mostly in the front end, on whether issues maturing
around that time will be paid off,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.,
one of 21 primary dealers obligated to bid at Treasury auctions.  Historically Low  The  difference  in rates between one- and three-month bills
reached 28.9 basis points, the biggest since March 2008,
according to closing-market data. Three-month bill rates climbed
as high as 0.1014 percent after touching negative 0.0101 percent
on Sept. 27, the lowest level this year. The 2013 average is
0.047 percent. One-month bill rates rose 18 basis points to 0.33
percent.  Rates on bills due Nov. 21, just over a month after the
debt-ceiling deadline, are 0.04 percent, down from 0.06 percent
reached Oct. 4, the highest level since July 3.  While rates more than doubled on  one-month bills , today’s
increase pales in comparison with historical moves. Rates surged
39 basis points to 0.45 percent on Oct. 21, 2008, when the Fed
invoked emergency authority and agreed to provide up to $540
billion in loans to help relieve pressure on money-market mutual
funds beset by redemptions.  One-month bill rates averaged 2.47 percent in the decade
before the Fed reduced its  target rate  for overnight loans
between banks to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December
2008.  Note Auction  The average level of overnight Treasury general collateral
rose today as repo rates traded through 10 a.m.  New York  time
with ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, was 0.17
percentage point, almost doubling the 0.09 percentage point at
the start of the day. The rate climbed to 0.32 percentage point
on Aug. 1, 2011, the day before the U.S. was projected to reach
its borrowing limit then.  At today’s three-year note auction, indirect bidders
purchased 34.4 percent of the notes, compared with an average of
28.2 percent of the securities for the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 19.7 percent,
compared with an average of 18.8 percent at the past 10.  The notes  yielded  0.71 percent, compared with a forecast of
0.718 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight primary
dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio was 3.05, versus an average of
3.35 at the past 10 sales.  ‘Disaster’s Day’  Japan must consider the impact of any default on its bond
holdings, even as the U.S. will probably avoid a fiscal crisis,
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said today in  Tokyo . Chinese
Deputy Finance Minister  Zhu Guangyao  said yesterday that the
U.S. should prevent a default, the People’s Daily reported.  “US Treasury debt is foundation for all global credit &
equity,”  Bill Gross , co-founder of Pacific Investment
Management Co. and manager of the world’s biggest bond mutual
fund, wrote today in a comment on Twitter. “Default? Make
disaster’s day.”  Nonessential U.S. government services have been closed for
a week as politicians wrangle over a budget. President  Barack
Obama  said today at a White House news conference that
negotiations “shouldn’t require hanging the threat of a
government shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the
American people.” Republicans have sought changes to the 2010
Affordable Care Act in exchange for raising the ceiling.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Congress needs to
increase the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 or the nation risks
defaulting on its payments.  The  International Monetary Fund  warned that a U.S.
government default could “seriously damage” the world economy.  Bulls Run  Treasury investors were  more bullish  for the fourth
straight week ending yesterday, betting that the prices of the
securities will rise, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
survey.  The proportion of net longs climbed to 10 percentage
points, the highest since July, up from 6 in the week ending
Sept. 30, according to JPMorgan. The percentage of outright
longs, or bets the securities will increase in value, rose to 23
percent from 21 percent. Outright shorts dropped to 13 percent
from 15 percent. Neutral bets held steady at 64 percent.  The size of today’s  three-year offering  was the smallest
since January 2009 and the second consecutive reduction after
remaining at $32 billion for 35 sales beginning October 2010.
The size peaked at $40 billion from November 2009 through April
2010.  Three-year notes have lost 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.5 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The three-year
securities returned 0.6 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall gained 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering was the first of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $64 billion. The government will
sell $21 billion in 10-year debt tomorrow and $13 billion in 30-year securities on Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
