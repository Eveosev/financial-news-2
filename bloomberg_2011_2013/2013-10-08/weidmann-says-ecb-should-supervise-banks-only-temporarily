Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said that the  European Central Bank  should keep euro-area
lenders under its surveillance only temporarily.  “In the long run, it would be desirable to break off
supervision from the ECB and assign it to a separate independent
European institution,” Weidmann, who is also a member of the
ECB’s Governing Council, said in the text of a speech in Berlin
today. The ECB faces “potential conflicts of interest between
its oversight responsibility on the one hand and its monetary-policy mandate on the other hand,” he said.  The Frankfurt-based ECB is preparing to start a risk review
of bank balance sheets by the beginning of 2014 before taking
over the supervision of euro-area lenders later next year.
European officials are still debating how best to handle failing
banks and break financial links between sovereigns and lenders
by centralizing oversight and crisis management.  “Bank insolvencies have to be possible without endangering
the stability of the financial system,” Weidmann said.
“Therefore, we need a banking union that comprises, next to
common supervision, a clear resolution and restructuring
mechanism for systemically important financial institutions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
