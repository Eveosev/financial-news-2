President Richard Fisher said the U.S. “cannot afford to
default” on its debt as the deadline to raise the debt ceiling
approaches.  Default is “unthinkable,” and “no one will ever trust us
again,” Fisher, who doesn’t vote on policy this year, said
today in Dallas,  Texas . “I don’t think we will default, but it
will come down to the wire,” said Fisher, who has opposed
record monetary stimulus.  Many U.S. government services have been shuttered for a
week and the country is 10 days away from running out of
borrowing authority. Republicans are insisting on changing the
2010 Affordable Care Act, while President  Barack Obama  refuses
to engage in discussions about policy conditions tied to ending
the shutdown or raising the debt limit.  “It’s a big game of chicken and it’s a scary game,”
Fisher said in an address at Southern Methodist University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
