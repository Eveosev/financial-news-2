Gold futures fell for the third time
in four sessions as the dollar’s rebound damped demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a  gauge  against 10 major
currencies, rose as much as 0.2 percent. Earlier, gold reached a
one-week high as U.S. lawmakers remained at an impasse on the
budget and an increase for the nation’s debt ceiling, boosting
demand for a haven. Futures trading was 27 percent below the
average for the past 100 days, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  “The dollar’s strength pushed gold lower,” Tom Power, a
senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing a lot of
investors waiting on the sidelines.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped less than 0.1
percent to settle at $1,324.60 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Earlier, the metal reached $1,330.80, the
highest for a most-active contract since Oct. 1. The price has
slumped 21 percent this year.  Senate Democrats  are planning a test vote before the end of
this week on a measure that would grant authority to the White
House on raising the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling. President
 Barack Obama  reiterated that he won’t negotiate with Republicans
over the borrowing limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned
the U.S. may be unable to pay its bills after Oct. 17.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$22.443 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached $22.525, the
highest since Sept. 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 0.1 percent to $1,403.70 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 1.4 percent to
$714.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
