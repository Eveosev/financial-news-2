Morgan Stanley increased its  iron ore 
forecasts for the first and second quarters of next year as
global demand recovers and the seaborne market remains in
deficit well into 2014.  The steelmaking ingredient will average $130 a metric ton
in the first three months, $5 more than previously forecast, and
$120 in the second quarter, up from $117, analysts  Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane wrote in a report. Ore will average
$120 in 2014, an increase of 3 percent, the analysts wrote.  Iron ore entered a  bull market  in July as users in China
replenished stockpiles that shrank in March to the lowest level
since 2009.  Australia ’s Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics
said last week that prices will average $119 in 2014 from $112
forecast in June as surging Chinese consumption absorbs gains in
output that are seen pushing the global market into surplus.
Morgan Stanley reiterated that its view was above consensus.  “Although we believe market concerns over price into 2014
are warranted, they are overly pessimistic,” the analysts wrote
in the report dated yesterday. “Outside of  China , steel output
growth will see its best year since 2011, led by modest rebounds
in production in  India ,  East Asia  and  North America .”  The seaborne market will extend three years of deficit into
the first half of 2014, before shifting to surplus, they wrote.
The deficit is forecast to narrow from 71 million tons this half
to 25 million tons between January and June next year and then
swing to a surplus of 49 million tons in the second half of 2014.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was at $131.40 a ton yesterday, according to The
Steel Index Ltd. Prices have rallied 19 percent from this year’s
low on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
