Dubai International Financial Centre,
a tax-free business zone, plans to add buildings with a value of
15 billion dirhams ($4.1 billion) as high occupancy rates drive
expansion, the center’s property director said.  DIFC will seek property companies, developers, funds and
real estate investment trusts to develop 17 buildings through
joint ventures, DIFC Properties Chief Executive Officer Brett Schafer said today in an interview. The center will contribute
land and infrastructure while its partners will be responsible
for financing construction, he said.  While Dubai’s office vacancy rate is about 45 percent
following the emirate’s property crash, tax-free zones such as
DIFC and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre are performing
better because of rules that make it more simple to own and
operate properties there.  “We are the Wall Street of an $8 trillion economy” and
can’t be compared to the rest of Dubai, said Schafer, who was
appointed in May. “We are comparable to financial centers like
London and  Singapore , but we are cheaper.”  The expansion, to be completed over 10 years, will be 65
percent offices, 20 percent homes and the rest retail, the CEO
said. Construction of a 200-room hotel will begin next year.
More than 1,000 companies operate within the 110-acre (44.5-hectare) DIFC, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
