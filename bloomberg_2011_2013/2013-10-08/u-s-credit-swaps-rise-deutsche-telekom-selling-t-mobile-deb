A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
rose to the highest level in more than three weeks as lawmakers
began taking tentative steps toward raising the debt ceiling and
reopening the government.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  plans to sell $5.6
billion in  T-Mobile USA Inc. (TMUS)  notes.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.9 basis points to 84.5 basis points at 5:27 p.m. in  New York ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest
level since Sept. 13 in data that adjusts for the effects of the
market’s shift to a new version of the index last month.  Investors are watching for signs of a resolution in  federal
budget  and debt-ceiling talks nine days before the U.S. runs out
of borrowing authority Oct. 17. President  Barack Obama  said in a
speech today that the  U.S. economy  risks a “very deep
recession” if Congress doesn’t raise the limit.  “People are just sitting on the sidelines,” Scott Carmack, a  money manager  at Leader Capital Corp. in  Portland ,
 Oregon , said in a telephone interview. “We had a sell-off
yesterday. People bought insurance and today we opened
relatively flat.”  Senate Democrats are planning a test vote before the end of
this week on a measure that would grant Obama the authority to
raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.  The swaps index typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Deutsche Telekom  Deutsche Telekom, which controls T-Mobile, may sell $1.25
billion in 6.542 percent notes due in 2020 and $1.25 billion of
6.731 percent debentures that mature in 2022, according to a
person with knowledge of the offering, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  The company also intends to offer $1.25 billion of 6.464
percent securities due 2019, $1.25 billion in 6.633 percent
bonds due 2021 and $600 million of 6.836 percent notes due 2023,
according to a regulatory filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Default Rate  The debt is part of an $11.2 billion private placement of
senior notes T-Mobile issued to Deutsche Telekom in April in
relation to its merger with MetroPCS Communications Inc.,
according to the filing.  Third-quarter defaults by speculative-grade companies fell,
according to a report dated yesterday by Moody’s Investors
Service.  The trailing 12-month global speculative-grade corporate
default rate was 2.8 percent at the end of September, down from
2.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.3 percent a year
earlier, according to the ratings company. Moody’s forecasts the
global rate to climb to 3 percent by the end of this year.  The Markit CDX North American High Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade bonds, rose 8 basis
points to 405.9 basis points, Bloomberg prices show.  The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries widened 1 basis point to 133.4 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade,
or junk-rated, debt fell 20.1 to 670.  Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody’s
and at least BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
