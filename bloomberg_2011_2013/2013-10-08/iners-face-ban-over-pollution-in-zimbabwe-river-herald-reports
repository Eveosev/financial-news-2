Eleven small-scale mining companies
face a ban after  Zimbabwe â€™s Environmental Management Agency
found chemicals such as mercury and cyanide in the Mazowe River,
the state-controlled Herald reported.  The miners, panning for gold in the river and digging its
banks to find the precious metal, may be allocated licenses to
mine further away from rivers, the Harare-based Herald said on
its website, citing Water Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  and EMA
Director Mutsa Chasi.  Zimbabwe will ban all river-bed and river-bank mining in an
effort to protect streams and rivers, the Herald cited
Kasukuwere as saying. The mining companies involved are mostly
owned by Chinese nationals, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
