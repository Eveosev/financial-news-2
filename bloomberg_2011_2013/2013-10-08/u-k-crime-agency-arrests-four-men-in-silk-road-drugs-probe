Four men were arrested last week in
the first U.K. detentions linked to the global online network
used to sell cocaine and heroin known as Silk Road, the  National
Crime Agency  said.  The four men, one in his early 50s and the rest in their
early 20s, were arrested hours after the U.S. police tracked
down the alleged mastermind behind Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, on
Oct. 1, the NCA said in an e-mailed statement. More people will
be arrested in the coming weeks, the NCA said today.  The Silk Road was a cyber-bazaar that brought together
buyers and sellers of heroin, cocaine and other illegal goods
while keeping users’ identities shrouded in secrecy. It used
Bitcoin digital currency to generate the equivalent of $1.2
billion in illicit sales and take in $80 million in commissions
in less than three years, according to a criminal complaint
filed in federal court in  New York .  “These arrests send a clear message to criminals,” Keith
Bristow, the NCA’s Director General, said in the statement.
“The hidden Internet isn’t hidden and your anonymous activity
isn’t anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and
we will catch you.  Ulbricht, 29, was charged with narcotics trafficking
conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering
conspiracy.  The NCA, which started operations yesterday, focuses on
stopping organized crime activities in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
