Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
to a three-month low on concern Chinese demand may recede during
winter without more government-funded infrastructure projects.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1 percent to 3,550 yuan ($580) a metric
ton, the lowest since July 2, and traded at 3,555 yuan at 9:51
a.m. local time. Chinese markets were closed for a week for the
National Day holiday.  China ’s steel demand usually wanes in November as
construction activity slows in the winter months unless
government unveils “massive and substantial” infrastructure
projects, according to Citic Securities Futures Co. Average
daily crude steel output in China rose to 2.14 million tons in
mid-September, from 2.13 million tons in the first 10 days of
September, according to the China Iron and Steel Association.  “Mills continued to crank out steel products as much as
they can, so demand needs to rise accordingly to help absorb
supply,” said Huang Fulong, an analyst at Citic in Shenzhen.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was at
$131.40 a dry ton on Sept. 30 before the holiday, according to a
price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The  average spot 
price of rebar retreated 0.2 percent on Sept. 30 to 3,488  yuan  a
ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
