Pbb Deutsche Pfandbriefbank , the core
business of Hypo  Real Estate Holding AG (REAEH) , raised its 2013 profit
target by 50 percent, helped by a gain in new business.  The company, based in Munich, raised the full-year pretax
profit target to at least 150 million euros ($204 million) from
100 million euros, it said in a  statement  today. It reported a
pretax profit of 124 million euros in 2012.  Chief Executive Officer Manuela Better is selling the
lender’s Dublin-based Depfa Bank Plc unit, which is closed to
new business, to meet European Union conditions for Hypo Real
Estate’s government bailout. By the end of 2015, she also needs
to find a buyer for Pbb Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, which combines
most of the continued business of  Hypo Real Estate .  For the third quarter, the company expects pretax profit of
more than 60 million euros after the impact from the valuation
of derivatives was more than offset by a property sale. The
lender, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Nov.
12, had a 60 million-euro first-half profit.  New business in real estate finance and public investment
finance rose 50 percent to about 2 billion euros in the third
quarter, the company said, adding that it also expects strong
new business development in the current three-month period.  Hypo Real Estate received EU approval in 2011 for a
bailout, with  Germany  injecting 10 billion euros and state and
financial institutions providing credit lines and debt
guarantees of as much as 142 billion euros to save the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
