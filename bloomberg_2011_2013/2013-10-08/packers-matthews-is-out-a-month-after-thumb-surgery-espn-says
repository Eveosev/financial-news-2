Green Bay Packers Pro Bowl linebacker
 Clay Matthews  probably will be out for a month after undergoing
surgery on his broken right thumb,  ESPN reports , citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Matthews, 27, was injured two days ago when he sacked
Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford during the third
quarter of the Packers’ 22-9 win.  Packers coach Mike McCarthy said at a news conference
yesterday that he wasn’t able to provide details of the injury
and was hopeful it’s not season-ending.  Matthews has a team-leading three quarterback sacks and two
forced fumbles this season. Green Bay takes a 2-2 record into
the club’s Oct. 13 road game against the Baltimore Ravens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
