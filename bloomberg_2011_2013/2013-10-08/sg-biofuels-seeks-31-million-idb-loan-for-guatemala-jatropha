SG Biofuels Inc., the renewable fuel
company working with Airbus SAS, may receive $30.6 million in
financing from the  Inter-American Development Bank  for jatropha
plantations in Guatemala.  SG Biofuels will use the funds to plant 25,000 acres
(10,100 hectares) of the energy crop on low-quality land
unsuitable for  food production , the San Diego-based company said
today in a statement.  The Inter-American Development Bank is evaluating the $76
million project and may approve the loan and help arrange
additional debt with other lenders, according to the statement.  The plantations will produce 6.2 million gallons (23.5
million liters) of plant oils a year. Jatropha is an inedible
plant native to Central America. Its seeds are crushed to
produce oils that are processed into biofuel and specialty
chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
