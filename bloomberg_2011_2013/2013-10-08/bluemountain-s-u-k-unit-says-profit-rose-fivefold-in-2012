BlueMountain Capital Management LLC’s
U.K. unit said profit rose more than fivefold last year,
according to a filing with the U.K.’s Companies House.  Earnings increased to 21.7 million pounds ($35 million)
from 4.2 million pounds in 2011, according to today’s filing.
New York-based BlueMountain, which earns fees for managing
client assets and for investment gains in its  hedge funds , said
revenue almost tripled to 36.8 million pounds.  BlueMountain, which has $15.7 billion under management and
was founded by Andrew Feldstein and Stephen Siderow, primarily
invests in credit and equity derivatives. It gained attention
last year for helping  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unwind trades that
cost the New York-based bank more than $6.2 billion after the
hedge-fund firm took positions against the lender.  JPMorgan’s derivatives holdings were built by a U.K. trader
who came to be known as the London Whale, because of the large
size of the positions. Feldstein, a former JPMorgan executive,
started BlueMountain in 2003.  The average number of employees who worked for
BlueMountain’s London unit in 2012 was 25, up from 19 a year
earlier, the filing shows. Employees were paid 11.8 million
pounds, or 472,000 pounds a person on average, compared with 6.6
million pounds in 2011, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
