Algeria tendered for 50,000 metric
tons of soft wheat for shipment in December, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the bids.  The deadline for offers is today at noon local time, they
said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized
to speak to the media. “Algeria is in the market,” Hakim
Chergui, director of foreign trade at the state grains office
OAIC, said. He declined to provide details of the tender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
