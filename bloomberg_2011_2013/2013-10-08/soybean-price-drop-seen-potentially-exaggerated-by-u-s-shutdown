A drop in soybean prices risks
becoming exaggerated as the U.S. government’s partial shutdown
leaves the market without official updates on Chinese buying of
the oilseed, according to Oil World.  Importers in  China  might step up purchases of U.S. soybeans
to capitalize on lower prices as they return from a national
holiday this week, the Hamburg-based researcher wrote in a
report today. Any increase may take place “largely unnoticed”
by the market, Oil World wrote.  “There is a risk that the downtrend of soybean prices is
overdone as the potentially bullish U.S. soybean export sales
and shipments are not publicized for the time being,” the
researcher wrote.  Soybeans for delivery in November fell 1.9 percent last
week on the Chicago Board of Trade. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture didn’t publish a regular export-sales report last
week and isn’t providing daily announcements on sizable
shipments because it has been closed since Oct. 1 as part of the
shutdown, suspending crop and livestock reports.  China is the world’s biggest soybean importer and the U.S.
is set to be this year’s second-largest producer after  Brazil .
The White House and Republican lawmakers are deadlocked over
extending the government’s debt limit to avoid a default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
