A U.S. default on its debt obligations would prove more unpredictable to financial markets than the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc., according to Pimco’s Mohamed El-Erian.  “What frightens us the most is what happens to the plumbing system of the global-financial system,” El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “You will have cascading failure, multiple defaults, and Treasuries that act as collateral would be very difficult to exchange and people will simply step back. It will be like Lehman, but more unpredictable.”  The  $12 trillion  of outstanding  U.S. government debt  dwarfs the $517 billion Lehman owed when it filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. The U.S. Federal Reserve is the biggest single holder of Treasuries, with $2.27 trillion as of Oct. 7. The demise of Lehman escalated a financial crisis, that had begun with the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market, into a near global credit freeze that required both the Fed and U.S. government to take extraordinary measures to resolve.  Even as  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco sees the probability of a U.S. government default as “very, very small”, volatility in the markets will increase as Oct. 17, the date the government will run out of its borrowing authority according to the Treasury Department, approaches, El-Erian said.  Recession Risk  U.S. lawmakers began taking the first tentative steps toward a path to raising the government’s debt limit even as the rhetoric between President  Barack Obama  and Republican leaders grew more divisive.  Senate Democrats are planning a test vote before the end of this week on a measure that would grant Obama authority to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, probably for a year unless two-thirds of both chambers of Congress disapprove.  If politicians fail to find a compromise agreement to enable them to lift the debt ceiling, a still struggling global economy risks a slide in growth, said El-Erian, who runs the world’s largest manager of bond funds with over $1 trillion in assets.  “There is no doubt in my mind that if we do not lift the debt ceiling and if we default, the world goes into recession,” El-Erian said in  New York . “The irony of the U.S., is this is not about an ability to pay, this is about a willingness to pay. And we are playing Russian roulette, not just with our standing but with the global financial system.”  Rates on Treasury bills that mature near Oct. 17 have risen this week as investors sought compensation for the risk of a default should Congress fail to increase the borrowing limit.  Rates on $93 billion of Treasury bills due on Oct. 24 climbed today as high as 0.225 percent, the most since they were issued in April, from negative 0.01 percent as recently as Sept. 27.
