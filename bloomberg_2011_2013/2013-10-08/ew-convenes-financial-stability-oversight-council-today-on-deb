The U.S. Financial Stability
Oversight Council today held a telephone discussion called by
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew to review issues including the
deadline to raise the nation’s debt ceiling.  “Failure to raise the debt limit by Oct. 17 would place
the United States government in the untenable position of
operating with only the cash on hand and could severely impact
financial markets and the broader economy,” Treasury spokesman
 Anthony Coley  said in an e-mailed statement. Lew is the chairman
of the council, which also includes Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
