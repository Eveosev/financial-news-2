Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , the owner of the
largest rare-earth deposit outside of China, named Chief
Operating Officer Geoff Bedford its next president and chief
executive officer.  Bedford will start his new role Dec. 2, succeeding interim
CEO Constantine Karayannopoulos, who will continue as a director
and become vice chairman, the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based
company said today in a statement.  Like Karayannopoulos, Bedford, 47, was formerly an
executive at Neo Material Technologies Inc., the Canadian rare-earth and magnetic-powder producer acquired by Molycorp for
C$1.22 billion ($1.18 billion) in June 2012. Karayannopoulos
took the helm at Molycorp six months later after his
predecessor,  Mark Smith , was asked to leave.  Molycorp rose 3.9 percent to $7.38 at 8:15 a.m. before the
start of regular trading in New York. The stock dropped 25
percent this year through yesterday.  Molycorp said yesterday in a separate filing that it
amended an accord with Molibdenos & Metales SA, allowing the
Chilean company to acquire a shareholding of as much as 27.5
percent, up from a previous limit of 19.9 percent. Molibdenos &
Metales had a 17 percent stake in Molycorp as of Jan. 30,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar metallic elements
used in rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and electric
vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
