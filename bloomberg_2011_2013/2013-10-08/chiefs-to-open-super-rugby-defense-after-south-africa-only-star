The 2014 Super Rugby competition
will open with a South Africa-only round before  New Zealand ’s
Chiefs begin their title defense the following week.  The southern hemisphere’s elite provincial competition will
start its 19th season on Feb. 15 with the Cheetahs hosting the
Lions in Bloemfontein and the Bulls visiting the Durban-based
Sharks, tournament organizer  South Africa , New Zealand and
 Australia  Rugby said.  The Chiefs, who beat Australia’s ACT Brumbies in the Aug. 3
final, start their bid for a third straight championship Feb. 21
at record seven-time winners the Crusaders in Christchurch.  South African teams will be off in Round 17 on June 27 and
28 because the Springboks’ home Test matches in June are on
different dates to their southern hemisphere rivals.  The playoffs are scheduled to start July 18 with final
taking place on Aug. 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
