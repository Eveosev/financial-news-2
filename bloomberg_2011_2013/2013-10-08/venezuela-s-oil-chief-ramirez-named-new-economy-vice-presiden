Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez is the country’s new vice president responsible for the
economy, according to a decree signed by President Nicolas Maduro published in the official Gazette distributed today.  Ramirez, who has overseen South America’s largest oil
industry since 2002, replaces Finance Minister Nelson Merentes
as the head of Maduro’s economic team. Spokesmen for the finance
and oil ministries didn’t immediately reply to phone messages
seeking comment.  Merentes is the leader of the government faction trying to
move  Venezuela  closer to a full market economy, Barclays Plc
said in a note to clients on Aug. 14. Since becoming finance
minister in April, he has started new dollar auctions, met
foreign investment bankers and talked to more than 5,000
businessmen in a bid to damp world-beating inflation and reduce
shortages of staple goods such as sugar, toilet paper and meat.  “Although vice presidents in Venezuela don’t have any real
power, the move underlines internal dynamics within the
regime,” Efrain Velazquez, a partner in economic consultancy
Azpurua Garcia-Palacios & Velazquez, said by phone from Caracas
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
