Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will update its lineup of iPads at an Oct. 22 event, a person with knowledge of the plans said, as the company works to remain ahead of rivals in the increasingly crowded tablet market.  The Cupertino, California-based company will unveil a new version of the original 9.7-inch iPad as well as the smaller iPad mini, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been made official. Apple also will show its new Mac personal-computer operating system, called Mavericks, and Mac Pro PC, the person said.  The event, scheduled for a month after Apple debuted two new iPhone models, will feature changes to the bigger iPad that include a thinner design, people familiar with the plans said in August. A new iPad mini will sport the high-definition screen now on the iPhone and bigger iPads, the people said.  The event was  reported  earlier by AllThingsD.  Trudy Muller , a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment.  In the absence of a new iPad, the tablet market shrank in the second quarter, suggesting pent-up demand for the new models. Global tablet unit sales fell 9.7 percent to 45.1 million, with iPad shipments falling to 14.6 million units from 19.5 million in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC.  While Apple remains the market leader for tablets, which meld the functions of touch-screen smartphones and laptops, its share has been threatened as competitors such as Amazon.com Inc.,  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and Microsoft Corp. introduce other models.  Apple shares fell 1.4 percent to $480.94 at yesterday’s close in  New York . The stock has fallen 9.6 percent this year.
