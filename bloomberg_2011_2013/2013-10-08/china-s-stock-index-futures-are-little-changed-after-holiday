China’s stocks  rose the most in two
weeks as retailers and property developers advanced on increased
sales during a week-long holiday.  Beijing Wangfujing Department Store (Group) Co. (600859)  jumped 2.8
percent to pace gains for consumer-discretionary companies.
China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate Group Co., the nation’s
biggest developers, advanced at least 4.6 percent. ZTE Corp. and
China United Network Communications Ltd. led a rally for phone
stocks after the government said it will boost development of
industries related to a fourth-generation mobile network.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 1.1 percent to 2,198.20
at the close, the biggest gain since Sept. 23. China’s markets
were shut from Oct. 1 through yesterday for the National Day
holiday.  Shanghai  trading volumes were 13 percent below the 30-day average. The CSI 300 Index climbed 1.4 percent to 2,441.81.  “The sales figures during the holidays were good,” said
Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dragon Life Insurance
Co., which oversees $3.3 billion. “That will add some
confidence to economic growth, especially domestic
consumption.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 0.8 percent
today. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index, the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 1.2 percent in
 New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite trades at 8.7 times projected
earnings for the next 12 months, compared with the five-year
average of 12.6 times, according to  data  compiled Bloomberg. The
index climbed 9.9 percent last quarter, the biggest increase
since the three months ended September 2010, as Shanghai-based
companies jumped on speculation they will benefit from
deregulation in the city’s free-trade zone.  Holiday Sales  The Shanghai Composite will probably extend its three-month
rally as accelerating growth lifts valuations from the lowest
level among major markets, according to Bocom International
Holdings Co.  “Data flow on China during the holiday period has been
positive,” Hao Hong, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Bocom
International, a subsidiary of China’s fifth-biggest bank by
market value, said in an e-mail interview yesterday. “Valuation
is still cheap, especially relative to developed markets, and
fundamentals are improving.”  China’s retail and catering combined sales grew 13.6
percent during the holiday from a year earlier to 870 billion
 yuan  ($142 billion), according to a statement posted on the
website of the Commerce Ministry.  A gauge of  consumer-discretionary  companies in the CSI 300
advanced 1.2 percent. Beijing Wangfujing, which operates
department stores in the city, rose 2.8 percent to 21.94 yuan.
Chongqing Department Store Co. jumped 4.6 percent to 24.79 yuan.  Home Sales  Qingdao Haier Co. (600690) , the biggest refrigerator maker, gained
3.7 percent to 13.81 yuan after New York-based private-equity
firm KKR & Co. agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the company.  China Vanke led an advance for developers, surging 4.6
percent to 9.55 yuan, while Poly Real Estate rose 5.1 percent to
10.38 yuan.  Beijing’s new home sales from Oct. 1-6 almost doubled from
a year earlier,  China  Securities Journal reported today, citing
the municipality’s commission of housing and urban-rural
development. Shanghai’s home sales during the Chinese holiday
increased from a year ago, the reported cited unidentified
industry participants as saying.  Services Trade  A gauge of China’s service industries dropped to 52.4 in
September from 52.8 a month earlier, HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics said in a statement today. A number more than
50 indicates an expansion. Another services report released by
the statistics bureau on Oct. 3 showed an increase to 55.4 in
September from 53.9 in August.  A measure of telecommunication stocks in the CSI 300 jumped
9.1 percent, the biggest gain among the industry groups.  ZTE, China’s second-biggest phone-equipment maker, advanced
9 percent to 18.09 yuan, the highest close since March 2012.
China United, which controls the nation’s second-largest cell
phone operator, surged 10 percent to 3.61 yuan.  China will aim to nurture large and key mobile internet
companies related to the 4G industry, according to a statement
posted on the National Development and Reform Commission’s
website.  Neusoft Corp. (600718)  jumped by the maximum daily 10 percent to
14.17 yuan. The company said it expected to win a computer
