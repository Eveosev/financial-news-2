Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at two of the city’s roadside-monitoring stations,
according to data from the Environmental Protection Department’s
website.  The index was 138 in the Central business district and 110
in Causeway Bay as of 8 a.m. local time. The reading in Mong Kok
was 87. A reading of more than 100 triggers a government warning
for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
