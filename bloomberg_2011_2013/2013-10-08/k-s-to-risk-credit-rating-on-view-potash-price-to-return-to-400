K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s biggest producer of
potash, said it’s prepared to put credit ratings at risk on
funding a new mine because the company predicts prices for the
crop nutrient will return to about $400 a ton.  A hybrid bond to raise one-third of the investment, or
about $1.4 billion, for the Canadian project called Legacy is
one option being considered, Chief Financial Officer Burkhard Lohr told analysts at a meeting yesterday. Lohr’s comments,
reported in a Bernstein Research note today, were confirmed by
Michael Wudonig, a spokesman at the Kassel, Germany-based potash
producer.  K+S has dropped 29 percent in Frankfurt trading since
competitor  OAO Uralkali (URKA)  said July 30 that the fertilizer’s price
may tumble to less than $300 a ton from more than $400 as the
Russian company ramps up production to full capacity. K+S is
forecasting that potash prices will bottom out in the last three
months of this year and rise again in 2014, Lohr told the
analysts.  “Watch for a potential downgrade of debt status since
Legacy will continue with more debt financing,” the Bernstein
analysts, including Jeremy Redenius and Paul Gait, said in a
report titled “How K+S sees the industry and how we differ.”  K+S  gained  as much as 1.6 percent to 19 euros and was
trading up 0.4 percent at 3:23 p.m., reversing a drop of as much
as 1.3 percent earlier today. The stock has lost 46 percent this
year, cutting the company’s market value to 3.59 billion euros
($4.88 billion).  The German company’s debt is rated BBB+ at  Standard &
Poor’s , the third-lowest investment grade, and Baa2 at Moody’s
Investors Service, the second-lowest. Both credit-reporting
companies have a negative watch on K+S, meaning they may
downgrade the debt.  K+S will announce a cost-cutting program by the time it
publishes quarterly earnings on Nov. 14, the CFO said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
