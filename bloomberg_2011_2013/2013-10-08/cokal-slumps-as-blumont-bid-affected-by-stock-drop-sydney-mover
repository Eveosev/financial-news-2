Cokal Ltd. (CKA) , a coal mine developer,
slumped by the most in 4 1/2 years in Sydney trading after
takeover talks with  Blumont Group Ltd. (BLUM)  were affected by a record
plunge in the buyer’s stock.  Cokal fell 22 percent to 18 cents at 11:04 a.m. in Sydney
trading, the biggest drop since February 2009. Blumont shares
declined 85 percent to 13 Singapore cents yesterday, extending a
56 percent drop on Oct. 4. The two-day, 90 percent drop shaved
S$4.9 billion ($3.9 billion) from its market value.  “The movement in the Blumont share price materially and
adversely affected the commercial terms of the takeover
proposal,” Cokal said in a statement. “Blumont and Cokal
continue to believe in the strategic merit underpinning
Blumont’s proposals, further discussions are now occurring to
restructure the financing and potential takeover offer.”  Buying Cokal would give Blumont stakes in coking coal
projects, including the BBM project in  Indonesia  scheduled to
begin production next year. Cokal, which has plans to become a
global coking coal miner, owns stakes in projects in Indonesia
as well as joint ventures in Tanzania and  Mozambique , according
to the statement.  Blumont yesterday agreed to loan Cokal $8 million, it said
in a statement. It would allow development work at Cokal’s
projects to continue as the pair pursue talks about further
investment in the Australian company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
