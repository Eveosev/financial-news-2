     Oct. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Starbucks Corp.’s juice unit
Evolution Fresh will quadruple capacity with the opening of a
new factory as the coffee company seeks to increase its share of
the $1.6 billion super-premium fruit drink industry.  Evolution Fresh, which was acquired by Starbucks in 2011
for $30 million, will employ 190 employees at the new facility
in Rancho Cucamonga,  California , the company said today in a
statement. The $70 million, 264,000 square-foot (24,526 square-meter) juicery will be Starbucks’ sixth manufacturing site in
the U.S., following five coffee-roasting plants.  The new factory is a “testament to the breakthrough of
cold-pressed juice,” Chris Bruzzo, general manager of Evolution
Fresh, said in an interview.  Starbucks, based in  Seattle , sells Evolution Fresh juice in
about 5,000 of its cafes and will roll out the beverage to all
of its about 11,200 U.S. stores in the next year, Bruzzo said.
The world’s largest coffee-shop operator has been expanding its
product offerings -- in cafes and grocery stores -- to include
salads, baked goods and other packaged products, as it seeks to
broaden its scope beyond coffee.  Evolution Fresh juice is stocked in 3,000 grocery stores in
the U.S., Bruzzo said, including  Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , which
started selling the juices, along with Evolution Harvest snack
bars, in August. It plans to be in more than 8,000 Starbucks and
grocery retailers by the end of the year, according to the
statement.  Revenue from the Evolution Fresh products is expected to be
in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars in the next five
years, Bruzzo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
