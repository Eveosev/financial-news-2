Chinese security forces fired into a
crowd of protesters in Tibet, wounding at least 60 people, Radio
Free Asia  reported .  Many of those hurt during the Oct. 6 incident suffered
gunshot wounds to their hands and legs, the broadcaster reported
yesterday, citing people it didnâ€™t identify. Two are in critical
condition, it said.  The crowd had gathered in Biru county to confront police
trying to search the home of a man who had been detained for
protesting an order for residents to fly the Chinese flag from
their homes, RFA said.  Dorje Draktsel was detained last week after taking part in
demonstrations over the flag order, according to the report.  Calls to the reception offices of the Biru county
government and the office of the deputy secretary general of the
 Tibet  Autonomous Region went unanswered today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
