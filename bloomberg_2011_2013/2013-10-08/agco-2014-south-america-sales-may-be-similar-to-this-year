Agco Corp. (AGCO) , the largest seller of
tractors in  Brazil , said revenue in South America in 2014 may be
“similar” to this year.  “Next year in South America, it looks pretty good,”
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Martin Richenhagen said
yesterday in a telephone interview from Agco’s Duluth,  Georgia ,
headquarters. He declined to provide an exact forecast. “Worst
case it looks like it being flat.”  Richenhagen’s comments come after Agco saw a 16 percent
jump in revenue in the region in the first half of 2013. That
pace of expansion isn’t likely to be sustained in 2014 as crop
prices are forecast to decline. An increase in interest rates in
Brazil may curb sales in 2014, said Joel Tiss, a New York-based
analyst for BMO Capital Markets.  “Crop economics are looking a little bit less favorable
into next year due to lower costs of soybeans and higher input
costs,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William
Blair & Co., said in a telephone interview.  Agco’s share of the Brazilian tractor market has fallen to
49 percent from 64 percent in 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Richenhagen said the company is trying to reverse
the trend by improving quality and technology and consolidating
some smaller dealers.  In North America, “farm income will be pretty strong” in
2013 after a record harvest, he said. “Even if prices are
lower, the high tonnage will overcompensate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
