Brazil ’s swap rates dropped to a two-week low after an inflation report added to speculation that the
central bank will signal tomorrow that it will slow the pace of
increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 10.06 percent at 9:55 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since Sept. 25. The
real climbed 0.2 percent to 2.2006 per  U.S. dollar .  Policy makers begin a two-day meeting today after raising
the target lending rate to 9 percent from a record low 7.25
percent in April, the fastest pace among major economies tracked
by Bloomberg. The real has rallied 11 percent since Aug. 22,
when the central bank embarked on $60 billion intervention
program to bolster the currency and curb import prices.  The gauge of inflation “came in lower than expected,
showing that the impact of the real on inflation may be losing
strength,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco
Mizuho do Brasil, said in a telephone interview.  Wholesale, construction and consumer prices rose 1.36
percent in September from a month earlier after previously
climbing 0.46 percent, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported
today. The median forecast of 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 1.49 percent increase.  Policy makers will raise the target rate by 50 basis points
for a fourth straight meeting tomorrow, according to the median
forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
