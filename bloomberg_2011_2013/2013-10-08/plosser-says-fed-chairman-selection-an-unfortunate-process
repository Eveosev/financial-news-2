President  Charles Plosser  said the selection of Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s successor has exposed the central bank to undue
political pressure.  The process “was largely unnecessary and one which I think
potentially is a disservice to the Fed as an institution,”
Plosser said today in response to an audience question during a
speech in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The public debate over the
succession has been “way too political,” he said.  President  Barack Obama  has been weighing who to name to
succeed Bernanke when his term ends in January, with an initial
focus on his former adviser Lawrence Summers and Fed Vice
Chairman Janet Yellen. Summers withdrew his name from
consideration after drawing opposition from Democrats in
Congress for his support of deregulation while serving as U.S.
Treasury secretary.  “We should try our best to depersonalize it if we can,”
Plosser said, referring to the nomination of a new central bank
chief. The process “has been an unfortunate one at best.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
