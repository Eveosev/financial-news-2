Ledermann Immobilien AG (LIMN) , a Swiss real
estate company, said it postponed its planned initial public
offering because of lower-than-anticipated interest for its
shares.  “The demand turned out to be lower than initially
expected,” the Zurich-based company said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “There is no pressure for us of going
public. For that reason we don’t have to force the IPO.”  Ledermann, which was scheduled to start trading today, said
earlier that it was suspending the IPO, the first one this year
in Switzerland, “for the time being,” without giving a reason.
The real estate company had planned to raise as much as 130
million Swiss francs ($144 million) in the sale, which  UBS AG (UBSN) 
was to manage. Zuercher Kantonalbank was the co-lead manager.  The company, founded in 1979, owns 60 properties in the
Zurich area that were valued at 626 million francs at the end of
June, according to its website. Most of them are residential
buildings.  At least 10 IPOs have been postponed or withdrawn in Europe
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
