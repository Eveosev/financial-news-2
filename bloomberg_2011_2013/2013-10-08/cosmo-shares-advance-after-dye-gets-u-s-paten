Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA (COPN)  gained the
most in eight months after the Italian drugmaker said it got a
patent in the U.S. for a dye to test for intestinal diseases.  Cosmo jumped as much as 11 percent to 67 Swiss francs in
Zurich, the biggest intraday advance since Jan. 28, and was up
8.2 percent at 11:52 a.m. local time. The stock has doubled this
year, giving the Lainate, Italy-based company a market value of
982 million francs ($1.1 billion). More than 25,000 shares were
traded today, almost twice the daily average for the past three
months.  The drugmaker will begin a final-phase clinical trial on
the dye, called Methylene Blue MMX, in November after receiving
the go-ahead from the European Medicines Agency for the study,
Cosmo said today in a statement.  Canaccord Genuity Corp. raised its rating on Cosmo to buy
from hold, with a price estimate of 73.40 francs a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
