Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR) , which
owns a stake in Norway’s biggest oil discovery in decades, has
appointed Karl Johnny Hersvik chief executive officer.  Hersvik, 41, who has been Senior Vice president of  Statoil
ASA (STL) ’s research and development division since January 2011, will
take up his new position May 1, the company said in a statement.
He will succeed Erik Haugane, who left Aug. 1.  “We are confident that he is the right person to take the
company further in an exciting phase,” Chairman Sverre Skogen
said in the statement. “Det Norske will be strengthened by a
young and dynamic chief executive with extensive professional
experience.”  Det Norske, which is almost 50 percent owned by billionaire
Kjell Inge Roekke’s  Aker ASA (AKER) , has interest in two of the three
licenses holding the Johan Sverdrup field in the  North Sea ,
possibly Norway’s biggest discovery since 1974 with as much as
3.6 billion barrels of oil. Det Norske plans to boost output to
more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2019 from
less than 6,000 barrels in the second quarter thanks to its Ivar
Aasen oil field and Sverdrup, due to start at the end of 2016
and 2018, respectively.  “It is both exciting and challenging to contribute to the
further development of Det Norske as a significant player on the
Norwegian shelf,” Hersvik said.  Skogen will continue as working chairman and Oeyvind
Bratsberg as general manager until Hersvik takes over as CEO,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
