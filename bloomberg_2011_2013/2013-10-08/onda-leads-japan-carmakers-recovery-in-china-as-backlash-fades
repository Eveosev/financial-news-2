Japan’s three biggest automakers saw
their sales in  China  surge last month as they recovered from
last year’s backlash against Japanese brands.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  led the rebound as sales doubled from a
year earlier to the highest in 21 months, according to company
figures released today.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s deliveries climbed
63.5 percent and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s. sales, excluding
multipurpose vehicles, rose 83 percent.  All three automakers saw sales rise month, the first time
that’s happened since January, when the timing of the lunar new
year holidays distorted year-earlier comparisons. Still, the
rebound signals Japanese automakers are winning back customers
after last year’s territorial dispute between the two nations
expanded into protests against Japanese products.  “It will take a little while before the Japanese can fully
recover,” said Zhou Jincheng, an analyst at automotive research
firm  Fourin Inc.  in Nagoya,  Japan . “But these companies will
not give up on China.”  Honda’s recovery stood out among the three as it sold more
vehicles in September than it did before the backlash. That’s
due to the popularity of its new models such as the Crider
sedan, Zhou said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
