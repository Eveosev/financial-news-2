Canadian Treasury Board President
 Tony Clement  said the government has a “national security”
role to play as it monitors future developments with BlackBerry
Ltd.  “We have a role to play obviously, which involves national
security and making sure what occurs is in the public interest
and we take that very seriously,” Clement, who has also been
industry minister, told reporters today in Ottawa. “We’ll let
it play out in the marketplace and if and when the
government has to respond, we certainly will.”  BlackBerry has dropped 11 percent to $8 a share since
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. announced last month a tentative
bid to take the company private for $9. Investors are betting
Fairfax, the Canadian insurer that is BlackBerry’s biggest
shareholder, will struggle to find backers or financing for its
takeover of the Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone company by
the Nov. 4 deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
