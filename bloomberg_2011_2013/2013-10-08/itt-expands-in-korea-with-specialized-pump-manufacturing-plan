ITT Corp. (ITT)  opened a specialized plant
to expand production in South Korea of high-energy pumps for oil
and gas industry applications.  The new $34 million factory will manufacture and test
Goulds Pumps brands in Chungcheongbuk-do, ITT said today in a
statement. The maker of high-energy pumps for mining,
petrochemical, gas, oil and power spun out its water company two
years ago. Xylem Inc., like ITT, is based in  White Plains , New
York, making products including submersible drainage pumps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
