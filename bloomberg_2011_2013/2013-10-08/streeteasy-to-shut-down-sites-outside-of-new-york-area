StreetEasy, the real estate listings
website purchased by  Zillow Inc. (Z) , is shutting down its sites for
 Washington , Philadelphia and south Florida properties.  StreetEasy will continue to list homes in the New York
metropolitan area, including  New York City , the Hamptons and
northern New Jersey, Sofia Song, vice president of research for
the website, said in a telephone interview. The other sites will
no longer be active as of Oct. 11, she said.  “We have realigned our focus to the New York metro
market,” according to a  post  on the company’s Washington
website. Zillow is the top site for property listings in the
markets where StreetEasy will no longer operate, Song said.  Zillow, based in Seattle, bought StreetEasy in August for
$50 million. The website, founded in 2006, allows users to view
New York apartments for sale as well as all units that have sold
in a given building, how long they were on the market and what
kind of discount their owners had to offer to strike a deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
