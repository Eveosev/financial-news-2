France ’s soft-wheat exports, the
biggest in the European Union, jumped 23 percent in August from
a year earlier as shipments to  Algeria  were the most for a
single month in at least 25 years.  Exports of soft wheat jumped to 1.78 million metric tons in
the month from 1.45 million tons in August 2012, trade  data 
published by the government today showed. Shipments more than
doubled from 828,526 tons in July.  France exported 17.1 million tons of soft wheat in 2012-13
as well as 1.59 million tons of the harder durum variety used to
make pasta and couscous. That made the country the world’s
fourth-biggest wheat shipper behind the U.S., Australia and
 Canada , based on International Grains Council estimates.  Algeria was the biggest client for French soft wheat in
August, with deliveries rising 39 percent to 728,140 tons. That
was the biggest monthly volume shipped to the North African
country since at least 1988, Eurostat data show. Algeria is
Africa’s second-largest wheat importer behind  Egypt , according
to the IGC.  Soft-wheat exports to  Belgium , France’s second-biggest
destination in August, rose 2 percent to 130,419 tons, while
shipments to the U.K. surged 79 percent to 83,647 tons.  Durum wheat shipments were little changed from a year
earlier at 88,835 tons, barley exports dropped 11 percent to
486,718 tons and corn cargoes rose 7.4 percent to 435,429 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
