Juhayna Food Industries climbed to a
record as investors bet a pick up in sales during the Islamic
month of Ramadan boosted third-quarter profit of the Egyptian
juice and dairy producer.  The company’s  stock  surged as much as 9.6 percent to 11.70
Egyptian pounds, before trading at 11.15 pounds as of 1:41 p.m.
in Cairo, poised for the highest close since the food
manufacturer sold shares to the public in June 2010. Juhayna led
advancers on the benchmark EGX 30 Index, which fell less than
0.2 percent.  Cairo-based Juhayna will post 19 percent profit growth in
the third quarter to 143 million pounds, according to the median
of  three analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Juhayna shares
have gained 45 percent this year, outperforming the benchmark
gauge’s 5.4 percent increase. Ramadan ended on Aug. 7.  “Investors are expecting strong third-quarter results”
after a sales increase in Ramadan, said Hisham Metwalli, a
trader at Cairo-based Arab Finance Brokerage.  Eight out of  13 analysts  have a hold rating on the stock,
while two recommend buying and three advise selling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
