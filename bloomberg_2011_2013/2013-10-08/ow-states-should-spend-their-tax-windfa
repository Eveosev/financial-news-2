Away from the shutdown in  Washington , the battle over  government spending  is being fought in state capitals against a different backdrop: Rising  tax revenue , and the debate over how to spend it. Many states are choosing to cut taxes -- a worthy goal that’s being embraced a little too carelessly.  State tax revenue in the second quarter of 2013 was almost  10 percent higher  than a year before, according to U.S. Census data. The uptick has encouraged states, especially those with Republican governors or legislatures, to cut corporate or individual income taxes. Wisconsin,  Indiana ,  New Mexico  and  North Carolina  have done so, and Florida and  South Carolina  are thinking about it. The cuts are intended to “encourage work and investment,” as Ohio Governor  John Kasich   said  in August.  That’s fine, so long as the recovery in revenue isn’t a blip and critical spending programs aren’t being starved of funds. Both points warrant more careful attention.  Some of the recent revenue windfall is from wealthy taxpayers  shifting income  into 2012 for tax-planning purposes. The revenue from individual income taxes was almost 20 percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier -- a far bigger swing than the tepid economic recovery would have caused by itself. If the new level of revenue is partly an illusion, overgenerous tax cuts could put some states in fiscal distress later on. States would be well-advised to project their revenue (forgive the expression) conservatively.  Desirable as lower taxes might be, many states also ought to recognize other pressing uses for new revenue, should it last. Underfunded state-run  pension plans  cloud the long-term fiscal prospects in many parts of the country. Making proper provision for those liabilities (alongside steps to contain their growth) ought to come first.  Spending on education should be another high priority. From 2001 to 2012, state funding per student in higher education  fell  from $8,427 to $5,906 in 2012 dollars, a drop of almost a third. That left colleges to lean increasingly on students and the federal student-loan program. The cost of a bachelor’s degree at a public university rose  46 percent  in real terms from 2000 to 2010, and the proportion of people defaulting on federal  student loans  is at its highest in almost  two decades .  Those defaults have wider economic consequences. And young people who decide to forgo a college education aren’t just blighting their own economic prospects: With a bachelor’s degree fetching  71 percent  higher earnings than high school alone, less-educated workers have less to spend in their communities, and pay less tax as well.  You can’t help noticing that the drop in spending on higher education has been most pronounced in some of the states that have cut or are trying to cut taxes.  -- Wisconsin cut general-fund spending on higher education by 17 percent in 2012. That brought the total to  $1.16 billion , less than in any year since 2000 (and that’s in dollars unadjusted for inflation or expanded enrollment). In June, Governor  Scott Walker  signed a two-year budget that includes almost  $1 billion  in tax cuts, and his spokesman said he’s considering more.  --  Kansas  has cut general-fund spending on higher education every year since 2008. Governor  Sam Brownback  signed legislation last year that cut state income taxes by  $3.7 billion  over five years.  --  Iowa  cut its general-fund spending on higher education by 20 percent from 2009 to 2012, providing less than in any year since 1996. In June, Governor Terry Branstad cut property taxes by  $4 billion  over 10 years, and cut income taxes by $90 million a year. He called it the biggest tax cut in Iowa’s history.  -- Florida cut general-fund spending on higher education by  $255 million  in 2013, to the lowest in a decade. Governor  Rick Scott  has proposed a  $500 million  tax cut.  Lower taxes are a good thing -- but not if they put states on a path to the next fiscal crisis, and not if they come at the expense of spending on education that in the end will pay for itself.
