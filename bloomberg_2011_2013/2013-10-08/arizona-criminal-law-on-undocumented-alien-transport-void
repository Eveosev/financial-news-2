An  Arizona  law criminalizing the
transport or harboring of unauthorized aliens was struck down by
a federal appeals court in San Francisco that ruled it was vague
and pre-empted by federal statutes.  The law was part of sweeping immigration measures Arizona
enacted in 2010 to reduce the influx of undocumented immigrants
to the state. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 struck down much of
the law on grounds that states must defer to the federal
government on immigration policy.  The rules against harboring aliens were challenged by
groups that claimed they could face prosecution for providing
sanctuary and shelter to undocumented immigrants. After a
federal judge blocked enforcement of the laws, Arizona appealed.  The statute “is incomprehensible to a person of ordinary
intelligence,” the appeals court said in today’s ruling, saying
federal law already makes it a crime to facilitate the unlawful
entry or movement of aliens in the U.S.  Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Arizona Attorney
General Tom Horne, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Valle Del Sol v. Whiting, 12-17152, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
