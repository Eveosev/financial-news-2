Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany ’s
biggest phone company, sold $5.6 billion of  T-Mobile USA Inc. (TMUS) 
notes in five parts, 81 percent more than the American wireless
carrier had initially said would be sold.  Deutsche Telekom, which  controls  T-Mobile, sold $1.25
billion of 6.542 percent notes due 2020 to yield 460 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1.25 billion
of 6.731 percent debentures that mature in 2022 to yield 444
basis points more than benchmarks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The German telecommunications company also sold $1.25
billion of 6.464 percent securities due 2019 with a relative
yield of 441 basis points, $1.25 billion in 6.633 percent bonds
due 2021 with a 447 basis-point spread and $600 million of 6.836
percent notes due 2023 at 450 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  The debt that was sold is part of an $11.2 billion private
placement of notes T-Mobile issued to Deutsche Telekom in April
as part of its merger with MetroPCS Communications Inc., the
company said in a regulatory  filing  yesterday with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The debt may be rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the offering, who asked not
to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley managed the transaction, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
