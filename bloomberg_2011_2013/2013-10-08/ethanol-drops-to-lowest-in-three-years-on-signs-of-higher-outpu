(Corrects million to billion in penultimate paragraph.)  Ethanol dropped to the lowest price
in more than three years, expanding its discount to gasoline, on
speculation the corn harvest will enable distillers to increase
production of the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, widened 2.75 cents to
96.66 cents a gallon at 11:03 a.m.  New York  time as the corn
harvest, which started in September and ends in November, will
lower costs for makers of the fuel. Output has risen 14 percent
through Sept. 27 from a record low in January, data from the
Energy Information Administration show.  “The general trend is going to increase from here,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 1.2 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.675 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade
after touching $1.668, the lowest price since July 2010. Futures
have dropped 24 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 1.55 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.6416 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S., and about 12 percent
of the  crop was harvested  as of Sept. 27, according to the
Agriculture Department.  More recent  data  isn’t available because of the partial
government shutdown. Blackford said that’s contributed to lower
ethanol prices, as traders don’t have access to more up-to-date
information on the market.  He also said traders expect the shutdown to cut demand for
the additive.  The USDA  estimated  last month that the corn crop will reach
a record 13.8 billion bushels.  Corn for December delivery declined 7 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.4225 a bushel in  Chicago . The December corn crush
spread of corn to ethanol was break-even, up from minus 1 cent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
