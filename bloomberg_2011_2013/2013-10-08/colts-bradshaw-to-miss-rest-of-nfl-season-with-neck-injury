Former  New York  Giants running back
 Ahmad Bradshaw  will be out the rest of the National Football
League season for the Indianapolis Colts due to a neck injury
that’s forced him to miss the past two games.  Bradshaw, 27, scored four touchdowns in his first three
games with the Colts before getting injured during a Week 3 win
at the San Francisco 49ers.  The Colts yesterday placed Bradshaw, who spent the previous
six NFL seasons with the Giants, on injured reserve and NBC’s
 Pro Football Talk reported  he’ll undergo neck surgery.  Indianapolis (4-1) entered the season with Bradshaw and
Vick Ballard as its featured running backs. After season-ending
injuries to both players, the Colts’ backfield is now led by
Donald Brown and Trent Richardson, who was acquired in a Sept.
18 trade with the  Cleveland Browns .  To contact the reporter on this story:
