Mexican peso volatility fell to a
six-week low as investors awaited the result of a budget
stalemate in the U.S., the country’s top trading partner.  One-month historical volatility, a measure of the magnitude
of the peso’s fluctuations during the period, fell to 12.16
percent at 10:16 a.m. in Mexico City, the lowest since Aug. 21,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency gained 0.1
percent to 13.1173 per dollar.  The U.S. government began a partial shutdown Oct. 1 after
lawmakers failed to reach a budget agreement before the start of
a new fiscal year. Republican lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  are also stalemated over raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  “Everything is paralyzed because of the U.S. government
shutdown,”  Pedro Tuesta , a senior economist at 4cast Ltd., said
by phone from Washington. “Nobody knows really where to go, so
they can’t really make a strong bet either way.”  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 growth
forecasts for Latin America and the Caribbean today, reducing
its projections for Mexico to 1.2 percent from 2.9 percent in
the previous report after lower  government spending , a decline
in construction and sluggish U.S. demand caused gross domestic
product growth to slow in the first half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
