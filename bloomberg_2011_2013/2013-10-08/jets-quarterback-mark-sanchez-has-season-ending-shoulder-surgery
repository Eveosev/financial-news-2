New York  Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez underwent shoulder surgery that rules him out for the
remainder of the National Football League season, the team said.  Sanchez, 26, damaged the labrum in his right shoulder
during the Jets’ third preseason game on Aug. 24 and was placed
on injured reserve-designated for return, keeping him out for a
minimum of eight weeks. The surgery was performed by James
Andrews, the Jets said in a statement last night, after a
rehabilitation program failed to solve the problem.  “The injury was recovering at an encouraging rate early on
and I avoided surgery as long as I could, but ultimately I was
counseled by the doctors that they simply would have to repair
my shoulder,” Sanchez said.  Sanchez, who was drafted by the Jets in 2009, is guaranteed
$8.25 million this season, after which he’ll be a free agent.  “Throughout this process, our goal has been to provide
Mark every opportunity to return this season,” Jets General
Manager John Idzik said in the team’s statement. “He will have
our full support for a complete recovery.”  Rookie quarterback Geno Smith, whom the Jets drafted this
year, two nights ago earned his first road win in the NFL as the
Jets beat the Atlanta Falcons 30-28 on a 43-yard field goal by
Nick Folk as time expired.  Smith, 22, threw three touchdown passes and didn’t have a
turnover for the first time in five games as the Jets improved
to 3-2 for the season. Smith has completed 94 of 156 pass
attempts for 1,289 yards, seven touchdowns and eight
interceptions this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
