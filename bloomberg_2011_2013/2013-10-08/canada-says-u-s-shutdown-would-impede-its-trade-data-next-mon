Canada ’s statistics agency said its
next  merchandise trade  report may be impeded by a lack of U.S.
data because of the government shutdown in  Washington .  “A continued shutdown will impede Statistics Canada’s
ability to release a complete picture of Canadian trade
statistics for the September reference period on November 5,”
Roland Boudreau, Statistics Canada’s director of its
international trade division, said in remarks e-mailed from the
agency’s Ottawa press office. “Specifically, data on Canadian
exports to the United States would be unavailable.”  If the U.S. government is still closed next month, “we may
have bigger issues to face than a missing trade report,” said
 David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist with TD Securities in
Toronto. Economists would “assume that exports are quite weak,
from being bottled up at the border.”  Canada and the U.S. use each other’s import data to
calculate exports under a 1990 agreement, Boudreau said.
“Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the situation and
will provide further information to users as it becomes
available,” he said.  Today’s Canadian report wasn’t affected by the shutdown. It
showed the merchandise trade  deficit  widened for a second month
in August -- a 20th consecutive monthly trade gap -- as imports
rose to a record and exports to the U.S. reached the highest
since the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
