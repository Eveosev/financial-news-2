The U.S. Energy Information
Administration raised its 2013 forecast for gasoline consumption
by 0.1 percent from last month’s estimate to 8.71 million
barrels a day.  Gasoline  demand  in 2014 may be 8.67 million barrels a day,
up from last month’s forecast of 8.66 million, the statistical
arm of the Energy Department said today in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The agency reduced the outlook for regular-grade  gasoline 
in 2013 by 3 cents to $3.52 a gallon. Prices in the fourth
quarter will average $3.34 a gallon, the EIA said.  The average price next year may sink to $3.40 a gallon, 3
cents below the August estimate of $3.43. Prices in 2012
averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.83 million barrels a day this year, down from last month’s
outlook for 3.86 million. The estimate for 2014 consumption was
left unchanged at 3.91 million barrels.  On-road diesel will average $3.93 a gallon this year, down
from last month’s forecast of $3.96. Next year, prices may drop
to $3.76 a gallon, compared with last month’s estimate of $3.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
