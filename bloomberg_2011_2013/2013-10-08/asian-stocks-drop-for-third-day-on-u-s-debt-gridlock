holiday, during which combined retail and catering sales swelled
14 percent from a year earlier to 870 billion yuan ($142
billion), according to the Commerce Ministry.  “The broad impression I get is that the Chinese economy
has pulled back from the slowdown scenario this year, but it’s
not taking off,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
$131 billion under management.  HSBC Holdings Plc’s and  Markit Economics ’ purchasing
managers’ index for  China ’s service industries fell to 52.4 in

today.  South Korea ’s Kospi index rose 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s

Straits Times Index climbed 0.3 percent, and Taiwan’s Taiex
index added 0.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index advanced
1.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent after the gauge slumped 0.9 percent to a one-month low yesterday. Without an increase in the debt limit, the

earnings, compared with 15.1 for the S&P 500 and 14 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Default  “The topic is the likelihood of a U.S. default, and that
could be disruptive, but I don’t think at the moment people are
assuming this is going to happen,” said Tim Leung, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager who helps manage about $1.5 billion at
IG Investment Ltd.  “If the market assumes there will be a
default, the index won’t be at this level.”  Utilities gained the  most  among the MSCI Asia Pacific
gauge’s 10 industry groups with  Tokyo Electric  jumping 7.6
percent to 525 yen. Hokkaido Electric Power Co. rose 4.7 percent
