Canada’s central bank is expected to
raise interest rates in the second half of next year, the
International Monetary Fund said, which is sooner than bond
investors and some domestic economists predict.  The Bank of Canada’s current 1 percent benchmark overnight
 lending rate  is “appropriate” to deal with risks of weak
global demand, “with gradual tightening expected to begin in
the second half of 2014,” the Washington-based fund said in its
World Economic Outlook today.  Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said last week a shift
in the drivers of growth to business investment and  exports  from
consumption is “elusive,” and cut the bank’s growth forecast
for the second half of this year. Scotiabank vice-president of
economics Derek Holt said those comments suggest borrowing costs
may not rise until 2016 while trading in overnight index swaps
show investors are pricing less than a 50 percent chance of a
rate increase by December 2014.  The IMF forecast today pared growth for all of this year to
1.6 percent from a July forecast of 1.7 percent, and kept a
prediction for next year at 2.2 percent. Canadian governments
should tighten fiscal policy as the economy grows, with
provinces needing to pare debts “to rebuild fiscal space
against future shocks,” the IMF said in its report.  “In  Canada , growth will pick up as export recovery and
stronger business investment offset the slowdown in the housing
market and the deceleration in private consumption growth,”
according to the report. Consumer spending and housing have
driven the world’s 11th largest economy since the 2008 global
financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
