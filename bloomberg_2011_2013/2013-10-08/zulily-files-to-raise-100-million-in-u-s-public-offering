Zulily Inc. , which runs a shopping
website targeted at moms, filed to raise $100 million in an
initial public offering in the U.S.  The figure is a placeholder amount used to calculate fees,
and may change, according to a regulatory filing today. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., and Citigroup Inc. are
managing the sale, and Zulily plans to apply to list on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ZU.  Zulily’s IPO filing comes after online coupon provider
RetailMeNot Inc. and payment processor  Qiwi (QIWI)  Plc both surged
following their U.S. debuts this year. Web-based retail sales in
the U.S. will reach  $262 billion  this year, an increase of 13
percent from 2012, a March report from Forrester Research Inc.
showed.  Zulily, based in  Seattle , operates daily flash sales with
4,000 products from children and women’s apparel to kitchen
accessories. Sales more than doubled to $272 million in the
first half of 2013 from a year earlier, as active customers
increased to 2.2 million from 1.2 million, the filing shows.  Co-founders Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon formerly held
senior positions at Blue Nile Inc., an online jewelry retailer
which debuted in 2004. Blue Nile’s shares, up about 85 percent
from their IPO price, were trading at $38.01 each as of 11:06
a.m. today.  VC Backers  The company is also backed by venture-capital firms
Andreessen Horowitz, Maveron LLC and August Capital. Cavens,
Zulily’s chief executive officer, holds more than 20 percent of
the voting power at the company, while Vadon, the chairman, owns
over 30 percent.  E-commerce sales , defined as goods and services purchased
over the Internet, have increased every quarter since 2009,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Consumer spending  in the
country has risen for four consecutive months through August,
the Commerce Department said last month, as rising home values
and stock market gains bolster net worth.  RetailMeNot, (SALE)  a provider of online coupons from more than
60,000 retailers and brands, has gained 65 percent through
yesterday since its debut on July 19. Instant-payment operator
Qiwi from Cyprus, whose American depositary shares started
trading in the U.S. on May 3, has more than doubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
