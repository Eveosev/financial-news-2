Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
boarded a plane today for a planned summit in Cairo, hours after
police arrested his former prosecutor general, deepening
political rifts in the country ahead of June elections.  “It’s an ugly thing to do and I will certainly follow up
on it when I return,” Ahmadinejad said before leaving on his
two-day trip, according to the official  IRNA  new agency.  Former Prosecutor General Saeed Mortazavi was arrested on
unspecified charges last night, according to the Tehran
judiciary’s website. He was suspended in 2010 after the deaths
of three men arrested during the country’s protests that
followed the contested 2009 election.  Ahmadinejad on Feb. 3 sparred with Speaker  Ali Larijani  in
parliament, trading accusations of wrongdoing and improper
conduct, in the latest attacks on the president who can’t run
for a third term. The head of the country’s judiciary, Sadegh
Larijani, is the parliamentary speaker’s brother.  Ahmadinejad will attend an Organization of Islamic
Cooperation in Cairo, marking the first first trip there by an
Iranian president since  Iran ’s 1979 revolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
