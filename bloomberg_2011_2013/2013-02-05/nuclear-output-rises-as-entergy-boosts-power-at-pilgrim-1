U.S. nuclear generation rose for the
first time in four days as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased power at a
reactor in Massachusetts.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  said it will
permanently shut its Crystal River 3 reactor in Florida,  Total production  increased 37 megawatts to 93,269
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, the first gain since Feb.
1, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled
by Bloomberg. Output was 1.6 percent higher than a  year ago ,
with eight of 104 reactors offline.  Duke said it was closing the Crystal River reactor, which
has been idle since 2009, after deciding the risks and costs
associated with repairing it outweighed the benefits.  The 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1, about 38 miles southeast of
Boston, operated at 87 percent of capacity early today, up from
80 percent yesterday. The plant was slowed so technicians could
reseat a pilot valve, Carol Wightman, a company spokeswoman
based at the unit, said in an e-mail yesterday.  “We are in the process of increasing plant output,” she
said.  Production was higher than a year ago in every region
except the West. Output there was 4.8 percent lower after two
reactors, Wolf Creek 1 in  Kansas  and Diablo Canyon 2 in
California, were recently shut for eight-week refueling outages.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
