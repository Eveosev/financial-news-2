Former National League  Cy Young  Award
winner Brandon Webb retired from  Major League Baseball  after a
third unsuccessful attempt to come back from shoulder injuries
that have prevented him from pitching since 2009.  Webb, 33, led the majors with 70 wins for the  Arizona
Diamondbacks  from 2005 through 2008 and won the Cy Young in 2006
as the NL’s best pitcher by going 16-8 with a 3.10 earned run
average.  Webb was the runner-up for the award the following two
seasons and went 22-7 with a 3.30 ERA in 2008. His only start
after that was on opening day of the 2009 season, when he left
after four innings with discomfort in his left shoulder. After
undergoing two surgeries and failing to see improvement during
his comeback attempts, Webb decided he was out of options.  “I was at the top of my game and then it was just suddenly
over,” Webb was quoted as saying by  MLB.com . “My dad said, ’At
least you didn’t have to struggle, at least you went out on
top.’ I was like, ’Yeah, but I would almost have rather have
tapered off, because I think that would have been easier for me
rather than just suddenly be done.’”  Webb spent his entire seven-year major league career in
 Arizona , going 87-62 with a 3.27 ERA. He attempted comebacks
with the Diamondbacks in 2010, with the  Texas Rangers  in 2011
and again this offseason before retiring.  “It’s frustrating, but it’s a relief though, too,” Webb
said, according to MLB.com. “I can stop worrying if I’ve done
enough. I was putting in all this time and effort over the last
three years and it turned out to be all for nothing.”  Elsewhere in the majors, the Oakland Athletics yesterday
acquired infielder Jed Lowrie in a five-player trade with the
 Houston Astros .  Lowrie, a 28-year-old switch-hitter, batted .244 with a
career-high 16 home runs and 42 runs batted in over 97 games
last season, when he spent almost two months on the disabled
list. The A’s also got pitcher Fernando Rodriguez from the
Astros for first baseman Chris Carter, pitcher Brad Peacock and
minor-league catcher Max Stassi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
