Asian  stocks  fell, dragging the
regional benchmark index down from an 18-month high, amid
renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  Hong Kong  shares
tumbled the most since November amid speculation the government
may act to cool the  property market .  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a Japanese maker of imaging
equipment that gets 28 percent of its sales in Europe, dropped
3.1 percent.  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  lost 4.1 percent amid concern
full-year earnings may trail the Australian lender’s forecast.

HK$24 billion ($3.1 billion) at a discount.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 1.4 percent to 131.82 as
of 7:50 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost four stocks falling for each
that rose.  “It’s a return of worries about Europe,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of strategy at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which has about $126 billion under management. “The
market got very stretched and was due for a pullback, it was
just a question of what the trigger would be. We could still see
some further weakness this month.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, climbed 12 percent through yesterday since the
Nov. 14 announcement of Japanese elections sparked optimism a
new government would lead the country out of recession and
deflation.  That pushed valuations on the gauge to 14.8 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and a multiple of 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.4 percent. The measure sank

Japan.  Konica Minolta  lost 3.1 percent to 722 yen and NTN Corp.,
a bearing maker that gets a quarter of its sales in Europe, slid
5.2 percent to 273 yen.  Japanese shares fell, with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)

Straits Times Index fell 0.8 percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index
dropped 0.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 2.3 percent, with volume
56 percent above its 30-day average. Hong Kong’s market will be
shut for three days next week for the Lunar New Year holidays,
while markets in mainland  China  will be closed for the whole
week.  Rajoy, Berlusconi  Spanish Premier  Mariano Rajoy  faces opposition calls to
resign amid contested reports about illegal payments, and
Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi narrowed the front-runner’s lead
before elections this month.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.5 percent, maintaining
declines after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia kept its benchmark
cash rate at 3 percent as forecast by 24 of the 28 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. The central bank said Chinese economic
growth has stabilized at a “fairly robust” pace.  Developers led the rout in Hong Kong, with Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd., the world’s biggest builder by value, dropping
3.2 percent to HK$121.30. New World Development Co., which led
gains on the Hang Seng Index this year through yesterday with a
20 percent increase, fell 4 percent to HK$13.84.  Property Measures  “Lots of people are taking profits and worrying there will
be measures from the Hong Kong government to cool down the local
property market,”  Steven Leung , a Hong Kong-based institutional

rise to about A$803 million ($838 million) for the year ending
March 31 from an eight-year low of A$730 million a year earlier,
Bloomberg calculations based on the company’s forecast show.

A$838.5 million, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hitachi Ltd., Japan’s second-largest manufacturer, lost 6.4
percent to 531 yen after cutting its full-year forecast for
