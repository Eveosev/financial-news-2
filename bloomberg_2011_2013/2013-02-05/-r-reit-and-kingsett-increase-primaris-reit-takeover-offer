H&R Real Estate Investment Trust (HR-U)  and
KingSett Capital Inc. joined forces in a C$2.75 billion ($2.75
billion) offer for  Primaris Retail Real Estate Investment Trust (PMZ-U) ,
ending a bidding war for the Canadian shopping mall owner.  H&R and KingSett offered about C$28 a share in cash and
stock for Primaris, the companies said today in a statement.
That tops a C$27.33 a share cash and stock offer from H&R on
Jan. 17 and KingSett’s unsolicited C$26 cash bid in December.  The combined group said the transaction would create the
largest diversified Canadian REIT, owning office properties,
industrial sites and shopping malls across the country.
Primaris, based in Toronto, has 33 properties in 26 markets,
including the Burlington Mall, Oakville Place and Place
d’Orleans in Ontario, according to the company’s  website .  “It is a good offer now and in our view, it’s time to move
on,”  Michael Smith , managing director for real estate equity
research at Macquarie Capital Markets  Canada , said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. “We don’t think there will be
a better bid.”  Primaris  shareholders  will receive C$28 a share in cash, up
to a total of C$1.28 billion, or 1.166 units of H&R, according
to the statement. Primaris closed at C$26.93 yesterday in
Toronto, for a market value of C$2.64 billion. H&R closed at
C$23.66, for a value of C$4.61 billion.  Portfolio Breakdown  H&R, based in Toronto, will buy a C$2.7 billion portfolio
of 17 Primaris shopping centers, and nine more properties valued
at C$377 million that Primaris intends to purchase before the
deal closes. The remaining Primaris malls, valued at about C$1.9
billion including debt, will be acquired by a consortium led by
KingSett, a Toronto-based private-equity real estate business.  RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (REI-U) , a Toronto-based retail
landlord and a member of the KingSett group, agreed to buy
Oakville Place and a 50 percent stake in the Burlington Mall for
C$362 million upon completion of the deal.  The transaction needs the support of two-thirds of Primaris
shareholders and a majority of H&R  investors . H&R and KingSett
will receive a break fee of C$100 million if Primaris accepts
another hostile bid.  A takeover would give the buyers “good real estate” in a
market where deals of this size are infrequent, Smith said.  “It’s hard to buy assets in Canada because it’s a tightly
held market,” he said. “Whenever there’s an opportunity to buy
assets in bulk, it can be a good opportunity.”  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  and  Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce  advised KingSett, while  Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF)  worked
with Primaris.  Primaris rose 2.1 percent to C$27.50 at the close today in
Toronto. H&R fell 0.7 percent to C$23.50.  To contact the reporters on this story:
