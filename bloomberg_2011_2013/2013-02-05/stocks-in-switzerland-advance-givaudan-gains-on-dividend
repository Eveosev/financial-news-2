Stocks in Switzerland  climbed, with
the Swiss Market Index rebounding from a two-week low, as
Givaudan SA announced full-year dividend and profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Givaudan rallied to its highest price in five years.  Swiss
Re (SREN)  AG posted the biggest gain in more than a year as peer  Munich
Re  AG said it would increase its dividend after fourth-quarter
net income beat projections.  The  SMI (SMI)  added 0.6 percent to 7,404.63 at the close in
Zurich. The benchmark gauge slipped yesterday to the lowest
since Jan. 22. It has still advanced 8.5 percent this year as
the Swiss franc weakened against the euro and U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a compromise budget. The broader Swiss Performance
Index rose 0.5 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 11 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Euro-area  services output  shrank less than initially
estimated in January, a report showed. An index based on a
survey of purchasing managers in the services industry rose to
48.6 from 47.8 in December, Markit Economics said. That’s higher
than the 48.3 initial estimate published on Jan. 24. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Givaudan Dividend  Givaudan (GIVN)  gained 5.7 percent to 1,070 Swiss francs, its
highest price since January 2008. The world’s largest maker of
flavorings and fragrances announced a dividend of 36 francs a
share. That exceeded the Bloomberg Dividend Forecast of 25
francs. Net income rose to 411 million francs ($452 million),
beating the 387.5 million francs projected by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Swiss Re climbed 4.1 percent to 70.50 francs, its biggest
gain since January 2012. Munich Re, the world’s biggest
reinsurer, said it plans to increase its dividend for last year
by about 12 percent after fourth-quarter profit exceeded
analysts’ forecasts.  Evolva Holding SA (EVE)  surged 8.9 percent to 61 centimes after
saying it entered the pre-production phase to develop natural
vanillin for commercial use, along with partner International
Flavors & Fragrances Inc.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s second-largest bank,
advanced 2.3 percent to 26.76 francs.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest cement maker, declined 0.9
percent to 70.40 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
