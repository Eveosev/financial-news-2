Egypt  has lifted a travel ban and a
freeze on the assets of 13 former officials from the era of
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , South Cairo  Criminal Court  said.  The court removed the restrictions on individuals including
former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif, former Interior Minister
Habib El-Adly and Fathi Sorour, the former head of the
parliament’s lower house, the court said in a faxed statement
today.  The ruling came after they repaid the value of gifts they
were said to have received from state-run newspaper Al-Ahram, it
said.  Former officials facing charges of illegally seizing public
funds received more than 100 million pounds of gifts between
1984 and 2011, the court said.  Financial prosecutors last month approved a request by
Mubarak to repay 18 million Egyptian pounds in connection with
the so-called “Ahram Gifts” case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
