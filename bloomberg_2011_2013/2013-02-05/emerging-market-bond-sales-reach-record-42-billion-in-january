Companies in developing countries
sold a record $42.1 billion dollar-denominated debt in January,
fueled by demand for Asian bonds and non-investment grade notes,
according to Bank of America Corp.  The bond sales marked a 10 percent increase from the
previous record set in September, analysts led by New York-based
Oleg Melentyev, wrote in a Feb. 3  e-mailed report. Asian
companies sold $22.8 billion bonds, about 40 percent more than
the previous high of $16.3 billion four months earlier.  High-yielding, or junk, bond issuances reached $18.1
billion in January, a 44 percent rise from the previous monthly
record of $12.6 billion in May 2011. The January figure
represents about 30 percent of the average annual issuance of
junk bonds over the last three years, according to the report.  Companies including China Railway Resources Huitung Ltd.
and  Banco Do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  raised capital to lock in yields at
record lows. Yields on emerging-market corporate bonds fell to a
record 4.11 percent on Jan. 24, Bank of America data show.  Global corporate bond sales reached a record $412.3 billion
last month, surpassing the previous record of $407.2 billion in
January 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
