ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , whose chip designs
power Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPad, reported fourth-quarter
sales that rose more than analysts predicted as demand for
smartphones and tablets surged.  Revenue in the three months through December rose 19
percent to 164.2 million pounds ($258.4 million), the Cambridge,
England-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted 152.4 million pounds, according to the average of 18
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ARM shares rose as much as 5.2
percent, the biggest intraday advance since Nov. 6.  ARM started last quarter with a record order backlog for
its designs, the company said in October. ARM is benefiting from
a surge in demand for chips that enable mobile computing, such
as cloud-based storage, and technology for mobile phones and
tablets that saves energy and enhances performance.  “Customers are developing products to meet the needs of
the post PC era and are driving demand for ARM’s most advanced
technology,” Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in the
statement. “2013 brings exciting opportunities and challenges
as ARM enters competitive new markets where we are well
positioned to succeed.”  ARM shares were up 46 pence at 938 pence as of
8:13 a.m.in London trading, bringing the advance to about 63
percent in 12 months and giving the company a market value of
12.9 billion pounds.  Revenue in the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be
about $250 million as long as ARM’s royalty growth continues on
“similar trends,” the company said.  The worldwide smartphone market grew 36 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, driven by growth in Samsung
Electronics Co. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  devices, to 219.4 million units
shipped, according to a report from Framingham, Massachusetts-
based researcher IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
