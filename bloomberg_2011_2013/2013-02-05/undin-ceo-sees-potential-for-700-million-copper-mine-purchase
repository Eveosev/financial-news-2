Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) , a Canadian
metals producer, said it’s been studying copper acquisitions in
eastern Europe and can fund a deal of as much as $700 million.  “If we see something opportunistically we have the
financial capability to move, but we will only do so if it
really will add something to us,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Conibear said today at a conference in  Cape Town . “Our
preferences are more copper.”  Lundin has copper operations in Spain and Portugal, and a
stake in a copper-cobalt deposit in the  Democratic Republic  of
Congo. Producers of the conductive metal, used in wires and
pipes, have expanded to take advantage of increasing demand in
 China . Copper prices have more than doubled in four years.  “We are a European-based producer so other assets in our
backyard would be ideal,” Conibear said. “We have been
spending quite a bit of time in eastern Europe.”  Lundin has no debt, about $275 million in cash and an
unused credit facility to help fund any purchase, according to
the CEO. The company also expects increasing returns from its
Tenke Fungurume Congo mine this year, he said.  The producer could tap high-yield debt markets to help fund
an acquisition of as much as $1 billion, Dundee Securities Ltd.
said in a note yesterday. “The company enters 2013 in a strong
financial condition and with the flexibility to act quickly in
an M&A transaction if needed,” it said.  Lundin rose 0.8 percent to C$5.22 in Toronto trading as of
10:03 a.m. local time. The stock was little changed in
 Stockholm .  To contact the reporter on this story:
