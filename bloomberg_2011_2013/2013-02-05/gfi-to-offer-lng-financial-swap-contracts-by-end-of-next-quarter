GFI Group Inc. (GFIG)  will offer swap
contracts for liquefied natural gas by the end of next quarter
as it expects the market to expand in the next 12 to 14 months.  GFI will add swaps priced against the Platts Japan-Korea
marker and the ICIS East Asia index, Toby Davis, an LNG broker
at GFI, said by phone from London.  “There’s not a large amount of liquidity in the market; it
is still in its infancy,” Davis said. “If we enter the market
now, we will set ourselves up for when it grows.”  GFI joins brokers including  ICAP Plc (IAP) ,  Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) 
and Tradition Financial Services Ltd. that trade physical and
financial LNG products. Demand for shorter-term cargoes soared
in 2011 after Japan shut all its reactors following the meltdown
at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The nation is considering
restarting its 50 plants, all but two of which are still shut
for safety checks.  “Dynamics will change,” Davis said. “If Japan starts
turning on its nuclear plants, we continue to see more demand
from South America” and increased supply from Australia that
may boost volumes priced against the JKM swap, he said.  Most of the world’s LNG, gas chilled to a liquid for
transport by seaborne tanker, is traded under long-term
contracts.  Short-term LNG deals, with a duration of less than
four years, rose 50 percent last year to account for a quarter
of the amount supplied on world markets, according to the
International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers, a Paris-
based lobby group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
