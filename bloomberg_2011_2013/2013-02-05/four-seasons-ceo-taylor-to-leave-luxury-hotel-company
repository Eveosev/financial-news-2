Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts said
Kathleen Taylor, who replaced founder Isadore Sharp as chief
executive officer in 2010, is leaving the luxury hotelier.  The company’s nine-member executive leadership team will
assume management until a successor is found, Toronto-based Four
Seasons said in a statement today. The hotelier hired executive-
search firm Ferguson Partners Ltd. to look for Taylor’s
replacement. Four Seasons didn’t say why Taylor is leaving the
company.  Taylor joined Four Seasons in 1989 and was president and
chief operating officer before being appointed CEO. Kingdom
Hotels International, together with Cascade Investment LLC, a
company owned by  Bill Gates , and Triples Holdings Ltd., owned by
Sharp, took Four Seasons private in 2007. Sharp continues to
serve as the company’s chairman.  “We are confident that we can quickly identify a successor
to Katie who shares the Four Seasons vision and values,”  Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal , chairman of Kingdom Hotels, said in the
statement.  Sharp started Four Seasons as a motor inn in Toronto in
1961. The company now has 90 properties in 37 countries and more
than 50 projects under development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
