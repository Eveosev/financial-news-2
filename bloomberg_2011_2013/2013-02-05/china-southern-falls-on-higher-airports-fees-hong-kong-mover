China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , the
nation’s biggest carrier by passengers, fell the most in almost
eight months in Hong Kong trading, leading declines among
Chinese airlines, after local airports announced fee increases.  China Southern, based in Guangzhou, dropped 4.3 percent to
HK$4.48 at the close in Hong Kong, the biggest fall since June
8. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell 2.3 percent.  Beijing Capital International Airport Co. (694) , the world’s
second busiest airport by passengers, said regulators will allow
it to charge domestic carriers’ international flights the same
fees as foreign carriers effective April 1. The increased
charge, which also applies to domestic flights that connect to
international flights, will help boost revenue, the airport said
in a  statement  yesterday.  Chinese carriers pay about 40 percent less than their
foreign rivals for international flights to China’s airports,
Barclays Plc analysts led by Patrick Xu wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. Airports in Shanghai, Guangzhou and the
Hainan province announced fee increases after receiving the
notice.  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s biggest carrier by market
value, fell 3.1 percent to HK$6.59.  China Eastern Airlines
Corp. (670) , a Shanghai-based carrier, dropped 3.1 percent to HK$3.49.  Beijing Capital International Airport fell 0.2 percent to
HK$6.61.  To contact the reporter on this story:
