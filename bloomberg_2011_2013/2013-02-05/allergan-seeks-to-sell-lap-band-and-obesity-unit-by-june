Allergan Inc. (AGN) , the maker of the Botox
wrinkle treatment, said it’s committed to selling the company’s
obesity-treatment unit in the first half of 2013 after
completing a review of the business.  The unit, dominated by the Lap-Band weight loss device, has
been reclassified as a discontinued operation, resulting in an
unspecified charge to write down assets to fair value,  Irvine ,
California-based Allergan said in a statement today. Chief
Executive Officer David Pyott said last month he wanted to sell
the business by the end of the first quarter and that the unit
has attracted interest, including from a private-equity company.  The obesity unit’s sales tumbled 22 percent in the fourth
quarter to $36.8 million, Allergan said today. The unit’s annual
revenue has plummeted from a peak of $296 million in 2009
because of questions about the risks from the Lap-Band and
lawsuits stemming from surgeries that went awry. The obesity
market once generated about a third of Allergan’s U.S. sales.  “We are dynamically managing our portfolio to drive long-
term sales growth,” Pyott said in the statement.  The company said it can’t estimate a range of the expected
disposal loss stemming from the writedown, the company said. The
Lap-Band is an adjustable silicon band that helps people lose
weight by reducing the amount of food their stomachs can hold.  Allergan  rose  1.6 percent to $106.70 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 24 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
