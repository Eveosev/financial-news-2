Italy ’s two-year notes advanced,
pushing yields down the most in three weeks, amid easing
investor concern that budget reforms will be derailed as former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi seeks a political comeback.  Italian 10-year yields rose above 4.50 percent for the
first time this year. A report showed European  services output 
in January shrank less than initially estimated. German 10-year
bonds snapped a three-day advance as European stocks gained,
sapping demand for the safest assets. Spanish notes rose, after
falling for four days, as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy battled
to rebut corruption allegations.  Italian two-year yields declined 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 10:28 a.m. London time, the
steepest slide since Jan. 10. The 6 percent security due
November 2014 rose 0.17 or 1.70 euros per 1,000 euro ($1,354)
face amount, to 107.57.  “It is perhaps too soon to conclude that this is the long-
awaited reality check by the market,” said Elwin de Groot, a
market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht, the
Netherlands. “Political factors such as we are seeing in Spain
and Italy at the moment are always extremely difficult to gauge.
This could weigh on Spanish and Italian bonds for some time but
we should acknowledge the rally in markets since mid-2012.”  Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds were little changed at 5.44
percent while those on securities due in two years declined
three basis points to 2.85 percent.  Services Industry  Germany ’s 10-year yield rose three basis points to 1.64
percent after falling 10 basis points in the past three days.  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
euro-area services industry rose to 48.6 from 47.8 in December,
London-based Markit Economics said in a report today. That’s
above an  initial estimate  of 48.3 published on Jan. 24. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. The gauge has been below
that mark for 12 months.  Austria sold 1.1 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2019
and 2022.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.4
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Austrian securities dropped 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
