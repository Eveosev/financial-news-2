Power for 2014 delivery in  Germany 
rose, erasing earlier losses as European Union emissions
allowances rebounded.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, increased as much as 0.6 percent. Carbon
permits gained as much as 5.1 percent on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London  after falling 6.7 percent. Power can track
emissions, which affect production costs.  German next-year power, a European benchmark contract,
increased as much as 60 cents to 42.05 euros ($56.89) a
megawatt-hour as of 4:41 p.m. Berlin time after falling to 41.30
euros. EU carbon permits for December increased 12 cents, or 2.8
percent, to 4.44 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London after rising as high as 4.54 euros.  Day-ahead power in Germany surged 41 percent to 46.25 euros
a megawatt-hour. Output from wind turbines in Germany was
forecast to fall below 10,000 megawatts tomorrow, according to
the website of Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather
forecaster. Wind generation was at 13,096 megawatts at 1:45 a.m.
in Berlin, according to data from European Energy Exchange AG in
Leipzig, Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
