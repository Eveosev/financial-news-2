Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) , Finland’s only oil
refiner, fell the most in six months in Helsinki trading after
profit missed analyst estimates.  Neste Oil declined as much as 7.9 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Aug. 2. The shares were down 6.6 percent at
11.10 euros at 10:43 a.m. local time. About 1.4 million shares
have been traded so far, more than 60 percent above the three-
month average.  Fourth-quarter earnings at the Espoo, Finland-based company
rose to 21 million euros from a loss of 23 million euros a year
earlier, it said today. That fell short of the average estimate
of 68.5 million euros by seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The company made “good progress” in renewable fuels
during 2012, Chief Executive Officer Matti Lievonen said in a
statement. The unit posted a comparable operating loss of 2
million euros in the fourth quarter.  Neste Oil sees comparable operating profit improving this
year both group-wide and in renewable fuels, the latter also
becoming positive. The company proposed raising the dividend to
38 euro cents a share, up from 35 cents a year ago. A three-week
maintenance shutdown in its Singapore facility will reduce
renewable fuel sales volumes during the first quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
