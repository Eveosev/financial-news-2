The New York Giants released
linebacker  Michael Boley , who spent the past four seasons with
the National Football League team and was their leading tackler
in a 2012 Super Bowl victory.  Boley, 30, was set to earn a base salary of $4.25 million
during the 2013 NFL season.  Boley appeared in all 16 regular-season games for New York
this past season, with 11 starts. He had three interceptions and
two fumble recoveries, and the Giants said he was fourth on the
team with 84 tackles.  “Michael came in and learned our defense quickly and he
added speed, coupled with big-play ability, to our defensive
unit,” Giants general manager  Jerry Reese  said in a statement.
“He also played an important role in helping us win Super Bowl
XLVI. I wish him well as he moves forward in his career.”  Boley joined New York as a free agent in 2009 after four
seasons with the Atlanta Falcons and appeared in 57 games with
the Giants, including 50 starts. He had a team-high 10 tackles
in the Giants’ 21-17 Super Bowl victory against the New England
Patriots after the 2011 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
