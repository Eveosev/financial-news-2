The leu weakened for a second day
after  Romania ’s central bank lifted a cap on the size of its
weekly repurchase agreement auctions, increasing the supply of
the currency to commercial banks.  The leu slid the most in a week as the Banca Nationala a
Romaniei increased the limit to 10 billion lei ($3 billion)
yesterday, from 9 billion lei a week earlier on record demand at
38.5 billion lei. That is the largest amount the central bank
has put up for sale at a repo auction since October. Romania’s
interest rate remained unchanged at a record low 5.25 percent,
matching the estimates of all 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The leu’s decline is “augmented by the central bank’s
loosening liquidity by hiking the repo cap,” analysts at
Bucharest-based  BRD-Groupe Societe Generale (BRD)  SA wrote in a note
today.  Romania’s currency depreciated as much as 0.3 percent
against the euro, the most on an intraday basis since Jan. 28,
before paring its loss to 0.1 percent at 4.3779 by 5:10 p.m. in
Bucharest. The leu has gained 3.5 percent in the past two
months. Yields on euro-denominated bonds due 2019 declined two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 4.208 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  raised 500 million lei in one-year
bills and 737 million lei in three-year bonds yesterday. Demand
declined to 857 million lei from 2.9 billion lei at a previous
sale of the three-year bonds on Jan. 14, according to the
central bank’s data. Yields fell to 5.51 percent for T-bills and
to 5.69 percent for the notes.  “Contrary to our expectations, local bond inflows were
much weaker than previous tenders on risk-off sentiment,” the
BRD analysts said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
