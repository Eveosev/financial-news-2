Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, should rebrand products to get approval from South
Africa’s antitrust authority for its planned takeover of  Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) ’s baby nutrition division, the regulator recommended.  Nestle should license existing Pfizer infant formula
products to be sold by a third party for 20 years under a
different brand to avoid an increase in infant formula prices
resulting from the merger, the country’s Competition Commission
said in a statement today. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company
will make its arguments tomorrow in a hearing before the
Competition Tribunal, which will rule on the matter.  Competitors have told the commission the proposed deal
raises “serious competition concerns,” the regulator said.
Nestle would be able to reintroduce the Pfizer products under
their original brands after the 20-year period, according to the
commission’s recommendation.  Nestle is seeking international approval for the
acquisition, which will give it access to more customers in
developing nations such as  China . Mexico’s antitrust regulator
blocked the deal in its domestic market in November, forcing a
divestment of assets in that market. Chinese and Australian
officials cleared the transaction in their countries that same
month.  “Nestle won’t oppose the conditions set out by the
commission,” Ravi Pillay, a spokesman for Nestle  South Africa ,
said by phone from Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
