3M Co. (MMM)  authorized a stock buyback
program of as much as $7.5 billion and increased the quarterly
dividend by 7.6 percent.  The new dividend of 63.5 cents a share is payable on March
12 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 15, the St. Paul,
Minnesota-based company said today in a statement. The payout
had been set at 59 cents.  3M gave no end date for the stock-repurchase program, which
replaces an existing $7 billion plan from 2011. Jacqueline Berry, a 3M spokeswoman, said she couldn’t say immediately how
many shares had been bought back under the previous program.  “These actions reflect both our confidence in 3M’s future
and our commitment to return significant cash to our
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
