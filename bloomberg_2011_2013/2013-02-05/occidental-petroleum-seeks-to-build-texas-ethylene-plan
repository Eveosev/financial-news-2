Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  applied to
build an ethylene plant in  Texas , the latest company to propose
new capacity for the region as booming shale gas supplies cut
costs for U.S. chemical makers.  The plant in Ingleside near Corpus Christi would have the
capacity to produce 1.2 billion pounds a year of ethylene, Los
Angeles-based Occidental said in an  application  to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Construction would start in
December 2014 with production beginning in February 2017,
according to the application on the EPA’s website. The plant
would create 123 jobs.  Occidental, the largest onshore crude-oil producer in the
continental U.S., is also the world’s biggest maker of vinyl
chloride. It plans to use some of the ethylene from the
Ingleside project to make vinyl chloride monomer, an ingredient
in vinyl products, at an existing plant nearby. Vinyl is used in
items such as PVC pipe and vinyl siding.  Dow Chemical Co. and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. are
among other chemical producers who have proposed plants to make
ethylene from natural gas liquids such as ethane, the price of
which hit a multiyear low last month. Hydraulic fracturing, also
known as fracking, has increased supplies of NGLs, which are
converted to ethylene used in plastics, antifreeze and hundreds
of other applications.  Melissa Schoeb, an Occidental spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for additional details of the
proposed plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
