Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  rose in
Lisbon trading on speculation that  Portugal ’s biggest publicly
traded lender will follow its rivals in reporting a yearly
profit on gains from selling sovereign-debt holdings.  Espirito Santo, which is scheduled to report its 2012
earnings after the stock market closes today, advanced as much
as 3.1 percent and was 2.3 percent higher at 1.053 euros as of
10:52 a.m. in the Portuguese capital, recovering some of a 4.7
percent drop yesterday.  Optimism about the earnings report “may be boosting the
stock today,” said Diana Gomes, a trader at Orey iTrade in
Lisbon.  Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Lisbon-based Caixa Banco de
Investimento, forecasts the lender will post net income of 101.9
million euros ($137.9 million), compared with a loss of 108.8
million euros the previous year.  “We estimate gains from financial operations to reach
148.2 million euros, benefiting from the sale of part of the
bank’s sovereign-debt portfolio,” Rodrigues said in a Feb. 1
report.  Banco BPI SA, (BPI)  the nation’s fifth-biggest bank, climbed 2.4
percent to 1.28 euros. Banco BPI said on Jan. 30 that it had net
income of 249 million euros last year, compared with a loss of
285 million euros in 2011, helped by a gain of 150 million euros
from the sale of Portuguese sovereign bonds in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
