Colombia may reduce spending and use
the proceeds to pay down foreign debt as part of the nation’s
plan to weaken the local currency, Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said.  Colombia is “considering some adjustment in general
spending that will allow us to save and use those savings to
prepay external debt,” Cardenas said today in an interview with
Javeriana Radio.  Gains in the peso are making the nation’s coffee, flower
and banana exporters less competitive and hurting job growth in
a country with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, the highest in
Latin America. The peso jumped 9.7 percent last year, the
biggest gain after the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint among
world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso was little changed at 1,786.87 per U.S. dollar at
the close today in Bogota and has declined 1 percent in the past
month. It touched 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest level since
July 2011.  The central bank announced Jan. 28 that it will boost daily
dollar purchases in the foreign-exchange market to at least $30
million and buy $3 billion between February and May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
