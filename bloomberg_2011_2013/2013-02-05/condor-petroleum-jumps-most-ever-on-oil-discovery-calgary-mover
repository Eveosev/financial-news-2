Condor Petroleum Inc. (CPI) , a Calgary-
based oil and gas producer, soared the most since it became a
public company after discovering oil in Kazakhstan.  Condor, which produces about 400 to 500 barrels of oil a
day in the Central Asian country, surged as much as 43 percent
to 60 Canadian cents in Toronto, the most intraday since April
12, 2011. The shares were up 36 percent to 57 cents at 10:54
a.m. today after rising 16 percent in the year through
yesterday.  Don Streu, Condor’s chief executive officer, said the
company has about three weeks of drilling to go before it can
evaluate the size of the discovery at the Kiyaktysai well in the
Zharkamys West 1 territory in  Kazakhstan .  “After it warms up a bit we’ll bring it onto production,
probably in the June time period we’ll go into 90-day test
production,” Streu said in an interview from Calgary. “We
started production last year. This is a larger discovery we’ll
be able to build on and continue to grow.”  Condor, which has a market value of C$201 million, has been
selling its product domestically, and plans to begin exporting
to  Europe ,  Russia  and  China  next year, Streu said.  The company holds 100 percent exploration rights to the
2,610 square kilometer (1,008 square miles) Zharkamys territory
in western Kazakhstan. Condor is focusing its operations in
Europe, and has been selling its Canadian assets, Streu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
