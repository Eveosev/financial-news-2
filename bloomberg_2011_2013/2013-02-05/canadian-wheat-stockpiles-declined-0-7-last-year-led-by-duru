Canadian wheat stockpiles fell 0.7
percent last year as commercial storage of durum declined,
 Statistics Canada  said.  Total wheat inventories fell to 20.69 million metric tons
as of Dec. 31 from 20.83 million tons a year earlier, the
Ottawa-based agency said today. Stockpiles of durum wheat, used
to make pasta, fell 4.1 percent to 3.83 million tons.  Canadian wheat output rose 7.6 percent in 2012 to 27.2
million metric tons as favorable weather boosted production,
Statistics Canada said Dec. 5. Wheat stockpiles on farms rose
1.7 percent to 16.5 million metric tons while commercial stocks
fell 9.1 percent to 4.2 million metric tons.  Supplies of canola plunged 23.6 percent to 7.37 million
tons, with the third straight decline bringing stockpiles to a
six-year low.  Barley inventories 7.2 percent from a year earlier to 5.09
million tons, Statistics Canada said.  The report was based on a survey of 10,435 farmers, which
was taken from Jan. 4 to Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
