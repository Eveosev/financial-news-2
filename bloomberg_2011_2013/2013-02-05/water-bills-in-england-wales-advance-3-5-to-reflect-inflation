Household water and sewage bills in
England and  Wales  will rise by about 13 pounds ($20.50), or 3.5
percent, a year starting in April to keep pace with inflation.  The average annual bill will be 388 pounds, taking into
account inflation of 3 percent, regulator Ofwat said today in a
 statement  on its website. Tariffs vary depending on supplier and
whether homes have a water meter.  Ofwat in 2009 announced charging levels for 2010-2015,
deciding on fees that were 10 percent lower than requested by
water companies amid customer pressure for cheaper tariffs. The
rate of inflation is added to bills annually.  The increase in fees will help pay for a 25 billion-pound
investment program to improve reliability and prevent sewer
flooding, according to the regulator.  “If companies fall short in delivering their investment
promises, we will take action,” Regina Finn, Ofwat chief
executive officer, said in the statement. The watchdog made
companies pay out 550 million pounds for underperformance in the
past seven years, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
