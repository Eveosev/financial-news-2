U.K. stocks  advanced, rebounding from
the biggest retreat in almost three months, as companies from
 ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  to  BP Plc (BP/)  reported results that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  ARM surged to a 12-year high after the designer of chips
for Apple Inc.’s products posted a 19 percent increase in
fourth-quarter revenue. BP added 1.4 percent as  Europe ’s second-
biggest oil company reported adjusted profit that beat
projections.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  increased 3.4 percent, reversing an
earlier selloff.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 35.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,282.76 at the close of trading in London. The gauge lost 1.6
percent yesterday as banks fell with Spanish and Italian bonds
amid signs of political uncertainty in Europe’s weakest
economies. The index is still up 6.5 percent in 2013, the best
start to a year since 1998.  “The earnings season in the U.S. is going OK and I would
expect Europe to reflect that,”  Tim Harris , who manages about
$25 billion as chief investment officer at Lloyds TSB Private
Banking Ltd. in London, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
with Francine Lacqua. “The market is in a phase of reparation
now. We are rebuilding balance sheets.”  Some 74 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index have reported  profit  that beat analysts’ estimates since
Jan. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Volume Gains  The FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.6 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.4 percent in Dublin. The volume of
shares changing hands on the benchmark FTSE 100 was 8.6 percent
higher than the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares also advanced today as U.K. services unexpectedly
grew at the fastest pace in fourth months in January, easing
concern the economy is heading for a triple-dip recession. A
gauge of activity surged to 51.5 from 48.9 in December, Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  ARM advanced 4.4 percent to 931 pence, the highest level
since March 2000. The chip designer reported a jump in fourth-
quarter sales to 164.2 million pounds ($258 million) as demand
for smartphones and tablets surged. Analysts had predicted 152.4
million pounds, according to the average of 18 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  BP gained 6.65 pence to 468.7 pence, paring yesterday’s 2.2
percent decline, after reporting fourth-quarter profit of $4
billion, adjusted for one-time items and changes in inventory.
That beat the $3.7 billion average  analyst estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey.  BP Production  The company, which is the second-largest stock in the FTSE
100 by  weighting , said underlying oil and gas production,
stripping out the impact from divestments, should increase this
year after being little changed in 2012.  BG Group jumped 38 pence to 1,142 pence after new Chief
Executive Officer Chris Finlayson gave a presentation to
analysts following the release of the company’s earnings.  The stock earlier fell as much as 3.4 percent after the
U.K.’s third-largest oil and gas company reported a 29 percent
drop in profit and scrapped its 1 million-barrel-a-day
production target for 2015.  “The new CEO came across as very pragmatic and credible,”
 Jason Kenney , an analyst at Banco Santander SA in Edinburgh,
wrote in a note to clients. “This will likely have gone down
well with analysts and investors despite the reset of targets
and conservative outlook. We are encouraged by the new sense of
reality at BG Group.”  RBS Rises  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  led a rebound in banks,
climbing 2.7 percent to 337.5 pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose 1.3
percent to 295.25 pence even as the lender set aside an
additional 1 billion pounds to cover misselling of payment-
protection insurance.  A gauge of U.K. banks  slumped 2.2 percent yesterday as
rising bond yields in Spain and  Italy  reignited concern about
the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/)  rallied 5.8 percent to 734.5 pence
before the retail broker reports first-half earnings tomorrow.
The volume of stock changing hands was 132 percent of the three-
month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/)  dropped 1.9 percent to 707.5 pence, for
the biggest decline in the FTSE 100 today. Panmure Gordon & Co.
lowered its recommendation on the shares to hold from buy before
the medical-device company posts earnings on Thursday.  Centrica Plc (CNA)  slipped 1.1 percent to 345.1 pence as Bank of
America Corp. downgraded the utility to underperform, the
equivalent of a sell rating, from neutral. The analysts cited
“heightened reinvestment risk” after the company announced a
500 million-pound share buyback yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
