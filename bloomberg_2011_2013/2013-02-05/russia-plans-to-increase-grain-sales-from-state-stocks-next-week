Russia , the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, will increase grain sales from
stockpiles in the European part of the country next week, Prime
Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  said.  More than 1.5 million metric tons of state grain has been
sold since sales began on Oct. 23 last year, he said at a
government grain meeting on the outskirts of Moscow today. The
cereal came from silos in the Asian part of the country.  The government has been selling state grain in an attempt
to reduce domestic prices and ensure there’s enough for millers
and livestock farms after drought in 2012 curbed production.
Russia harvested 70.7 million tons of grain in 2012-13, 25
percent less than the year-earlier period, according to state
statistics.  Russia expects to have 7.7 million tons of carryover
stocks, suggesting a 2.3 million ton shortfall, by the start of
the new season on July 1, Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov
said. At least 10 million tons of stockpiles are needed to
ensure sufficient supplies for the coming year. That compares
with 19.4 million tons carried over in the year-earlier period.  To date, Russia’s exported 13.5 million tons of grains,
Fedorov said. Shipments are expected to reach 14.8 million tons
this marketing year, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  About 500,000 tons of grain, 1.5 times more than a year
earlier, was imported in the July through December period,
Fedorov said. Another 800,000 tons may be shipped to the country
by the end of the season on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
