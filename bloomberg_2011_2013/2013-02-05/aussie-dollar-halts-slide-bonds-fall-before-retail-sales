Australia’s dollar fell to the lowest
this year after data showed the nation’s retail sales
unexpectedly dropped for a third month, adding to prospects the
Reserve Bank will cut interest rates next month.  The so-called Aussie slid against all of its major peers
after the central bank left the cash-rate at a half-century low
yesterday and said the inflation outlook “would afford scope to
ease policy further.” New Zealand’s dollar touched the
strongest since July 2010 versus its Australian peer after
Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., said whole-milk
powder prices rose and before a report that may show the smaller
nation’s jobless rate fell.  “Retail numbers came in on the weak side,” said  Callum Henderson , the Singapore-based global head of currency research
at Standard Chartered Plc. “While the RBA is on hold, that set
of data is likely to add to expectations for further easing
later this year.”  The Aussie declined 0.3 percent to $1.0356 at 5:26 p.m. in
Sydney and touched $1.0342, the lowest since Dec. 25. It slid
0.2 percent to 97.11 yen, after touching 97.44 yesterday, the
highest since August 2008. It declined 0.3 percent to NZ$1.2263,
after reaching NZ$1.2247, the lowest since July 2010.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar bought 84.45 U.S. cents from
84.53 yesterday. It touched 79.42 yen, the highest since July
2008, before trading 0.1 percent higher at 79.19.  Retail Sales  Retail sales  in Australia fell 0.2 percent in December from
the previous month, capping their longest stretch of declines in
13 years, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 0.3
percent growth.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight
cash rate target at 3 percent yesterday, in line with economists
forecasts. Interest-rate swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show
traders see a 55 percent chance the RBA will lower the benchmark
rate on March 5.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds rose 3 basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.52 percent.  The  unemployment rate  probably rose to 5.5 percent in
January from 5.4 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists before the data tomorrow.  N.Z. Jobless  “If the Australian labor force data tomorrow disappoints,
we would expect market expectations for next month’s rate cut to
lift a little” said  Peter Dragicevich , a currency economist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. “We expect the New
Zealand dollar to outperform the Aussie.”  New Zealand’s currency was supported before a report
tomorrow forecast to show the country’s unemployment fell.
Economists in a Bloomberg poll  expect  the statistics bureau will
say the jobless rate declined to 7.1 percent in the fourth-
quarter from 7.3 percent in the previous period.  Milk powder for April delivery rose 5.8 percent, according
to a trade-weighted index on Fonterra’s GlobalDairyTrade
website. The near-term contract for New Zealand product was
$3,446 a metric ton, the highest price since Oct. 16. Fonterra
is the world’s biggest dairy exporter.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, was at 2.93 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
