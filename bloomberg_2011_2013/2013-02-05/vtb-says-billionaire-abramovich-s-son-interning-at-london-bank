     Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-largest
lender, said billionaire Roman Abramovich’s son is working as an
intern at its  London  investment bank.  “Arkady Abramovich has passed a rigorous selection process
and joined VTB Capital’s internship program,” the bank said in
an e-mailed statement.  His internship was reported earlier today by Vedomosti. The
younger Abramovich, 19, controls the investment firm ARA Capital
Ltd., which is involved in acquiring oil and gas assets in
Russia and the former Soviet Union.  In 2011, he purchased 26
percent of energy investor Crosby Asset Management Co.  His father owns London’s Chelsea Football Club and has a
fortune of over $14 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
Abramovich has invested in Evraz Group SA and Highland Gold
Mining Ltd. after selling his stake in oil producer OAO Sibneft
to state-controlled OAO Gazprom for $13.1 billion in 2005.  VTB Capital bankers have previously helped arrange bond
sales for Evraz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
