Oil rebounded after the biggest
decline in two months as U.S. service industries expanded at a
better-than-expected pace in January, signaling growth in 90
percent of the  U.S. economy  and stronger demand for crude.  Oil advanced 0.5 percent as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses reached
55.2, beating the estimate of 55 in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The spread between crude in New York and London
widened to the most in almost six weeks. The 50-day moving
average of front-month New York futures traded above the 200-day
average for a third day, a sign prices may extend their rally.  “We’ve had a good set of economic indicators,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “We are in a bull market. It’s a
combination of things that are all pushing up  oil prices .”  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for March delivery rose
47 cents to settle at $96.64 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices dropped the most since Dec. 6 yesterday.
Trading was 10 percent above the 100-day average at 4:32 p.m.
Prices have gained 5.2 percent this year.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported oil inventories increased 3.63 million
barrels last week to 371.8 million. Oil was up 48 cents, or 0.5
percent, at $96.65 at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading. The
contract traded at $96.64 before the report was released.  Brent oil for March settlement climbed 92 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $116.52 on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Trading volume was 39 percent above the
100-day average.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI strengthened
for a fifth day to $19.88, the widest spread since Dec. 27 based
on settlement prices. It was $19.43 yesterday. The gap has grown
since  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  said Jan. 31 that capacity
on the Seaway pipeline to the  Gulf Coast  from Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
will have limitations until late 2013.  Services in the U.S. expanded at about the same pace in
January as in December, when the index reached a 10-month high
of 55.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based ISM reported. Readings above
50 indicate expansion.  Oil futures rose to an intraday high of $97.07 a barrel
after European services output shrank less than initially
estimated last month. The European services index rose to 48.6
in January, above an  initial estimate  of 48.3, according to
London-based Markit Economics. The gauge has shown a contraction
for 12 months.  Consumption Totals  The U.S. and the 27 members of the European Union accounted
for 37 percent of global oil demand in 2011, the last year for
which estimates are available, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy. China used another 11 percent of the
world’s oil.  The China’s services industry grew at the fastest pace in
four months in January, according to the  Purchasing Managers ’
Index of China published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. China is the world’s second-largest oil-
consuming country, after the U.S.  WTI’s 50-day moving average rose to $91.47, above the 200-
day average of $90.88 and the 100-day average of $90.52. A so-
called golden cross is formed when a short-term moving average
breaks above a long-term average, indicating a  bull market  is on
the horizon, said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in New York.  “You’ll see another rally come in a week or two,” he
said.  Equity Rebound  Oil increased along with equities and the euro.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1 percent after
falling the most since November yesterday.  “Crude oil is following equities,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago. “We are
seeing a rebound from yesterday’s selloff.”  The euro strengthened 0.5 percent against the dollar. The
currency fell the most in a month yesterday. A stronger euro and
weaker dollar increase oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative. The currency has gained 3 percent against the
dollar this year.  “The euro has reversed its declines, and a stronger euro
benefits crude prices,” said Tom Doremus, an analyst at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “People take oil’s
pull-back as buying opportunities.”  U.S. crude stockpiles probably increased for a third week,
up 2.65 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg
survey before an Energy Information Administration report
tomorrow in Washington.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 511,846
contracts as of 4:32 p.m. It totaled 443,143 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
