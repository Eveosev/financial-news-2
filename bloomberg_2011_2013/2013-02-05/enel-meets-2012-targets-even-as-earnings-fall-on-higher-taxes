Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s biggest utility,
met earnings and debt targets even as the economic slowdown and
higher taxes spurred a 5 percent decline in full-year profit.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization fell to 16.7 billion euros ($22.6 billion) from
17.6 billion euros the previous year, the Rome-based company
said today in a statement. That was in line with the 16.6
billion-euro estimate of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Revenue rose 6 percent to 84.9 billion euros.  Net debt met a company target of 42.9 billion euros. The
company had previously forecast full-year earnings of at least
16.5 billion euros.  Enel met Ebitda and net debt targets “despite a
particularly unfavorable macroeconomic and regulatory
environment,” Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said in the
statement. “We expect this economic cycle to continue
throughout 2013, mainly in Italy and Spain.”  Earnings were hurt by lower power-generation margins after
Italy increased a profit tax on electricity generators to 10.5
percent from 6.5 percent in August as part of austerity
measures. The company is investing in developing markets to
offset weaker performance in Italy and Spain where the economic
crisis has curbed power demand.  “Conti has done an incredible job keeping earnings and
debt targets despite Enel’s heavy presence in Italy and Spain
which are the hardest hit markets economically,” said
 Alessandro Frigerio , a  fund manager  at RMJ Sgr in Milan. “What
we need to know now is how he will keep things steady in the
continuing downturn.”  Enel rose 1.5 percent to 3.038 euros as of 4:15 p.m. in
Milan trading, increasing its market value to 28.6 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
