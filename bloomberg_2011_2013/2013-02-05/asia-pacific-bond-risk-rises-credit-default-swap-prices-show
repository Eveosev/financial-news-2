 The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced five basis points to 120.5
basis points as of 8:35 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its highest
close in more than two months, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose four basis points to
122.5 as of 11:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised to rise three basis points
this month, after retreating for a fifth straight month in
January, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed two basis points to
132 basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure is on track for its highest close
since Feb. 1, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
