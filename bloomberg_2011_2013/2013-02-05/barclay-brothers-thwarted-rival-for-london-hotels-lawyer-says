David and  Frederick Barclay  rode
“roughshod” over an Irish developer’s legal right to buy
shares as they gained control of three luxury London hotels,
Patrick McKillen’s lawyer said in the U.K. Court of Appeal.  The brothers, billionaire owners of the  Daily Telegraph ,
deliberately took steps to deprive McKillen of first refusal to
buy shares from a former investor in Coroin Ltd., which owns
Claridge’s, the Berkeley and the Connaught, his lawyer  Peter Goldsmith  said today.  “It is quite astonishing, I dare even to say grotesque
that he was not given the opportunity to bid for the shares,”
Goldsmith said. McKillen owns a 36 percent stake in Coroin.  The Barclays bought 800 million euros ($1.08 billion) of
the hotel company’s debt from Ireland’s National Asset
Management Agency in 2011 through a holding company called
Maybourne Finance Ltd. giving them control of Coroin. McKillen’s
original suit, accusing the brothers of acting illegally in
their bid for Coroin, was thrown out by Judge David Richards in
August 2012.  “The judge looked at this in a blinkered and unrealistic
way,” said Goldsmith, the former U.K. Attorney General.  McKillen’s arguments “materially misstate the factual
position and findings of the judge,” Kenneth MacLean,
representing the Barclays’ businesses, said in written
arguments.  The case is: McKillen v Misland (Cyprus) Investments Ltd. &
Ors., U.K. Court of Appeal, Civil Division, case no.
