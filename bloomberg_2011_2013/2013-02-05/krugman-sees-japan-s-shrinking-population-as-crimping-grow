Nobel Prize-winning economist  Paul Krugman  said Japan’s  slow growth  results from the country’s
shortage of people and the output increase of the working-age
population is “not that bad.”  “Japan has a big long-term problem, which is basically a
shortage of Japanese,” the Princeton University economics
professor said in an interview on  Bloomberg Radio ’s “Taking
Stock” with Pimm Fox yesterday. “They have terrible
 demography . Once you take that into account, their growth per
working-age person is not that bad.”  Japan’s population last year declined by 212,000, the
biggest drop on record, according to an estimate by the nation’s
health ministry. That’s the largest reduction since the ministry
started recording the data in 1947 and a sixth straight year of
declines.  The number of births fell by 18,000 to a record low of 1.03
million last year, the Japanese health ministry said last month.
About 26 percent of  Japan  is older than 65, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Every time the Japanese did spend more, their economy
perked up,” Krugman said. “Every time they pulled back it fell
back.”  Japan’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 3.5
percent pace in the third quarter of last year.  Last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government said it
would spend 10.3 trillion yen ($110 billion) to boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
