Czech retail sales fell the most in
three years in December, affected by fewer working days, as the
central bank debates whether it needs to ease monetary
conditions further by weakening the koruna.  Retail sales  decreased 5.1 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 1.8 percent drop in November, the Prague-based
statistics office said in a statement on its website today.
Retail sales fell 0.4 percent when adjusted for the working-day
difference, compared with a 3.5 percent decline in the previous
month, the office said.  The economy is suffering from weakening domestic demand as
households and businesses cut spending due to government
austerity programs and the euro area’s debt crisis. The central
bank cut the benchmark rate to effectively zero last year, while
several policy makers have said the bank may sell the koruna if
it needs to further relax conditions as the economic  recession 
risks stretching into the country’s longest ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
