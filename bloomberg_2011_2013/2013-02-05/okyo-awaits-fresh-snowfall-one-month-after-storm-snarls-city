Tokyo trains were delayed and
expressway traffic slowed as  snow  started falling in the
Japanese capital, with 5 centimeters (2 inches) forecast by
tomorrow morning.  Rains that began overnight were expected to change to heavy
snow today, the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said on its website.
About 5 centimeters is expected to fall in the city by 6 a.m.
local time tomorrow, according to the agency, which warned of
icy roads and snow accumulation on tree limbs and power lines.  East Japan Railway Co. (9020)  reduced services along its Tokyo-
area commuter routes, including the Yamanote line that circles
the city, the company said on its  website .  Some expressways reduced speed limits to 50 kilometers an
hour (30 miles an hour) from 80 kilometers an hour, NHK
television reported.  Tokyo’s first snowfall on Jan. 14 brought seven centimeters
of snow, prompting  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  and  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) 
to cancel hundreds of domestic flights. More than 100,000
passengers were affected, the airlines said. The snowfall closed
highways, including one running through  Tokyo ’s Shinjuku
district, and brought traffic in many parts of the city to a
crawl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
