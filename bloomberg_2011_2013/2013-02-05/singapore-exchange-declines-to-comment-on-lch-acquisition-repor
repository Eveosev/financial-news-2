Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) , operator of
Southeast Asia’s biggest stock market, declined to comment on a
Financial Times report that it is in talks with LCH.Clearnet.  Singapore Exchange is in negotiations to buy a stake in LCH
Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest clearinghouse, or to become part
of the deal in which the London Stock Exchange Group Plc is set
to take a controlling 60 percent, the FT reported, citing three
people familiar with the situation.  “As the Asian Gateway, SGX is open to partnerships and
alliances for the benefit of shareholders, the company and our
customers,” Carolyn Lim, an SGX spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
“However, we do not comment on media reports or speculation.”  Singapore Exchange  failed in a 2010 bid to purchase
 Australia ’s main bourse operator, ASX Ltd. The London Stock
Exchange provisionally agreed to pay 15 euros a share for a
majority stake in LCH.Clearnet in December as the two companies
extended the deadline for takeover negotiations until Jan. 31.  LSE scrapped its $3.4 billion bid for TMX Group Inc., owner
of the Toronto Stock Exchange, in June 2011 after failing to win
support from TMX shareholders. SGX’s $8.8 billion bid for ASX
Ltd. collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said in
April 2011 the deal wasn’t in the national interest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
