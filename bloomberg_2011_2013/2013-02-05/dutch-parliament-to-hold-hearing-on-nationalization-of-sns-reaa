Dutch lawmakers will question the
central bank on its role in supervising  SNS Reaal NV (SR) , which was
nationalized last week.  The inquiry, prompted by a Feb. 3 letter from Henk Nijboer
of the Labor Party and Mark Harbers of the Liberal Party VVD,
was backed by a majority of lawmakers. Parliament also decided
to question the bank’s board of directors and its auditor. The
hearing will be preceded by a debate tomorrow between lawmakers
and Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem. The date for the
hearing has yet to be set.  “A lot of questions will remain unanswered during the
debate,” Wouter Koolmees of the Democrats said in parliament in
the Hague today.  The Dutch central bank will attend the inquiry, according
to spokeswoman Flore Kraaijeveld. “We are willing to fulfill
the wish of parliament to give a clarification in a hearing,”
Kraaijeveld said in a telephone interview today.  SNS Reaal, the fourth-largest lender in the Netherlands,
was nationalized on Feb. 1 after real-estate losses brought the
company to the brink of collapse. The move will cost taxpayers
3.7 billion euros ($5.1 billion) as capital is injected into the
bank and an earlier aid package is written down. The
Netherlands’ budget deficit will widen by 0.6 percentage points
in 2013, Dijsselbloem said on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
