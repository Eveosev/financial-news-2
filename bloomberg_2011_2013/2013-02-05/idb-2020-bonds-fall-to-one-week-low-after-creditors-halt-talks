IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)  2020 bonds dropped,
sending the yield to the highest level in more than a week after
bondholders halted debt settlement talks.  Government bonds  rose.  The yield on IDB’s 5.1 percent notes maturing December 2020
soared 85 basis points, or 0.85 percentage points, to 52.93
percent, the highest since Jan. 27 at 2:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
yield jumped 46.7 percentage points last year. The yield on the
4.25 percent benchmark government bonds due in 2023 fell three
basis points to 4.09 percent.  Debt talks were suspended after bondholders criticized a
decision by IDB parent Ganden Holdings Ltd. to give businessman
Eduardo Elsztain more time to exercise an investment option if a
deal with creditors isn’t reached by Feb. 20. The breakdown in
negotiations comes as the IDB seeks funds through means such as
asset sales, including a stake in Clal Industries & Investments
Ltd., to avoid defaulting on 2 billion shekels ($542 million) of
debt.  “There is uncertainty about Elsztain exercising the
investment as it is not clear if the company will be able to
come to an agreement with bondholders,” said Raz Mor, a
corporate debt analyst at DS Securities & Investments Ltd. in
 Tel Aviv . “Further it is difficult to see how IDB will be able
to raise more funds to repay debt.”  One-Sided  IDB bondholders may resume talks only after details of the
accord with Elsztain are clarified and IDB pledges not to take
more one-sided decisions, according to a text message today from
creditors representative Eran Yoels. Elsztain, an Argentine
businessman, agreed in September to pay $25 million for 10
percent of Ganden Holdings, with the option of investing another
$75 million by Feb. 20. The agreement now gives him until April
10 to decide whether to make the additional investment.  IDB said it expected negotiations to “last a few more
weeks,” according to an e-mailed statement. “We will continue
to do every effort to reach a fair debt settlement in a short
period of time.”  Standard & Poor’s Maalot on Jan. 17 cut IDB Development
Corp’s rating, a unit of the company, by three levels to ilB,
five levels below investment grade, citing “weak” funding and
unsustainable high leverage. IDB Development may fall 1 billion
shekels short of cash to cover debt and costs in 2014, S&P said.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose for a fourth day,
increasing 0.1 percent to 282.76. The two-year break-even rate,
the yield difference between the inflation-linked bonds and
fixed-rate government debt of similar maturity, declined three
basis points to 221, implying an average annual inflation rate
of 2.21 percent.  The shekel was little changed at 3.6907 a dollar. One-year
 interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for
rates over the period, fell three basis points to 1.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
