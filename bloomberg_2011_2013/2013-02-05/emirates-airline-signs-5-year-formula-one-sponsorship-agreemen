Emirates Airline agreed to sponsor
Formula One for five years, giving it a “strong branding
presence” at 15 races, the auto racing series said on its
website.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed on the formula1.com
website. The Financial Times reported the agreement is “one of
the biggest in motor sport” and is worth about $200 million.  The deal won’t include races which have airline sponsors
such as Bahrain and  Abu Dhabi .  The 19-race season  opens with a
race in  Melbourne  on March 17.  Emirates Airline, the world’s largest airline by
international traffic, is owned by the Dubai government and
sponsors other sports properties including the ATP tennis tour,
and the Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain soccer teams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
