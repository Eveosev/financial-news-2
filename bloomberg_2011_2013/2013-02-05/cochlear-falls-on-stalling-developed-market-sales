Cochlear Ltd. (COH) , maker of the world’s
top-selling ear implant, fell by the most in 16 months in Sydney
trading after announcing stalling growth in developed markets
that contribute more than 80 percent of sales.  The stock  dropped  as much as 7.8 percent to A$74.20, headed
for the biggest loss since September 2011, before trading at
A$74.72 at 12:22 p.m. The company today reported 1 percent
growth in its Americas sales and a 2 percent decline in  Europe ,
Middle East and  Africa  for the six months ended Dec. 31.  The “flat result shows market share loss” in developed
markets,  Andrew Goodsall , an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a note
to clients. The company derives more than 40 percent of its
revenues from each the Americas and Europe region in the
financial year ended June 30, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Cochlear, formed more than three decades ago to develop a
so-called bionic ear invented by Melbourne researcher  Graeme
Clark , announced first-half  net income  of A$77.7 million ($81
million). That’s about 4.9 percent below the A$81.7 million
average of five  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Cochlear’s Nucleus CI500 series of ear implants were pulled
from the market in September 2011 after tiny cracks enabled
water to enter the units, causing them to malfunction. The
Sydney-based company said in October 2011 that the recall costs
could reach A$150 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
