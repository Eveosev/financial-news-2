U.K. inflation expectations rose to
the highest level in 21 months amid speculation  Mark Carney  will
expand monetary policy and spur price rises when he takes over
as  Bank of England  governor in July.  The so-called break-even rate increased for a fifth day
before Carney testifies to U.K. lawmakers this week after
telling the  World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos,
 Switzerland , last month that policy in developed countries isn’t
“maxed out.” Ten-year bonds fell after an industry report
showed U.K. services expanded in January, undermining demand for
fixed-income assets. The pound weakened against the euro.  “In the last week or so the outperformance of inflation-
linked gilts has accelerated and that’s partly to do with
Carney,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London . “People are expecting him to be quite
dovish. His appearance in front of the Treasury Select Committee
will be important for providing clues. It’s understandable that
break-evens have rallied but more from here will be difficult.”  The 10-year  break-even rate , derived from the yield
difference between gilts and inflation-linked securities, added
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.24 percentage
points at 4:32 p.m. in London after reaching 3.27 percentage
points, the most since April 14, 2011.  Carney, currently Governor of the  Bank of Canada , will
testify before U.K. lawmakers in London on Feb. 7, five months
before he succeeds  Mervyn King . Under King, the central bank cut
its benchmark  interest rate  to a record-low 0.5 percent and
started a bond-buying facility that had purchased 375 billion
pounds ($587 billion) of assets by November.  Linker Sale  The U.K. sold 1.1 billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds
due in March 2024 today at a record-low real yield of minus
0.844 percent, compared with minus 0.583 percent at the previous
auction on Dec. 13. Investors submitted bids for 1.97 times the
amount allotted, versus 2.37 times in December.  The securities allow retirement savings to keep pace with
inflation because the principal and coupon payments are adjusted
for rising prices.  U.K. inflation-linked gilts have returned 4.1 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. That compares with a loss of 1.8 percent
for  government bonds  not linked to inflation.  Ten-year gilt yields climbed toward the highest level since
April as the growth in U.K. services eased speculation the
economy is headed for a triple-dip recession.  The yield rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 2.12 percent after increasing to 2.17 percent yesterday, the
most since April 20. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September
2022 dropped 0.385, or 3.85 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount,
to 96.78.  Pound Drops  The pound weakened 1.2 percent to 86.75 pence per euro
after strengthening as much as 0.2 percent following the release
of the services data. The U.K. currency dropped 0.6 to $1.564,
after falling to $1.5647, the least since Aug. 16.  Sterling has depreciated 4.2 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro rose 3.2 percent and the dollar dropped 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
