India ’s rupee weakened for a second
day on renewed concern the debt crisis in  Europe , the nation’s
largest trading partner, will worsen.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is struggling to
impose austerity and restore confidence amid calls for him to
resign on corruption allegations, while Italian polls showed
Silvio Berlusconi has closed the gap on his rival even as he
appeals a four-year prison sentence for tax fraud. Overseas
investors have bought $4.6 billion more Indian shares than they
sold this year, exchange data show, and the rupee will advance
over the next few weeks as the buying continues, according to
Westpac Banking Corp.  “The wobbles in Europe are a timely reminder that the
region is not out of the woods just yet,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac in  Singapore .
“That’s weighing on sentiment in Asia today.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 53.3350 per dollar as of
9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 52.9150 yesterday, the strongest level
since Oct. 18. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.74 percent.  The European Central Bank meets on Feb. 7, while euro-area
leaders gather for a summit the same day. The European Union
accounted for 17.2 percent of India’s exports in the six months
through September 2011, according to the latest data available
from the commerce ministry.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.33 per
dollar, compared with 54.22 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.14 versus 54.05. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
