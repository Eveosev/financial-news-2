Petroplus Holding AG’s Petit-Couronne
oil refinery in Normandy has attracted five bids, two of which
are “serious,” French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg
said.  Offers from Swiss investor Terrae and Egyptian energy
company Arabiyya Lel Istithmaraat “appear serious and
financed,” the minister said in an e-mailed statement today.
The government has worked with the potential acquirers to “save
jobs and refining capacity.”  A Rouen court had set a deadline of today for offers to
take over the 154,000-barrel-a-day refinery that was put in
administration after Zug, Switzerland-based Petroplus filed for
insolvency in January 2012. The plant was the fourth French
crude processor to halt operations in about two years as
European refining profits dwindled.  The government may take a minority stake in Petit-Couronne
to help keep the “money-losing” site running, Montebourg said
earlier.  French unions have fought to keep the plant open. It
employs about 470 workers.  “The government has made jobs a priority, we’re going to
hold them to it,” Yvon Scornet, a union representative, said in
a statement today.  The Rouen court last year rejected offers from Dubai-based
Netoil Inc. and Alafandi Petroleum Group for Petit-Couronne,
saying the bidders didn’t respond to questions about their
technical and financial capacities. The refinery ran for about
six months last year under an agreement with  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. (RDSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
