Australia ’s dollar fell against all
of its major peers, erasing earlier gains, after the central
bank signaled it’s prepared to cut  interest rates  to a record-
low this year after holding them unchanged today.  The inflation outlook “would afford scope to ease policy
further, should that be necessary to support demand,” the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia said in a statement today after
today’s policy decision. Australia’s bonds rallied and New
Zealand’s dollar fell as declines in global stocks demand
boosted demand for haven assets.  “Aussie selling pressure stems from the comments that the
RBA made that inflation outlook gives scope for further
easing,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . “The market has taken that to mean
the RBA is sitting ready to ease.”  RBC expects the next interest rate cut to come in the
second quarter, according to Trinh.  The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to $1.0404 at 4:50 p.m. in
Sydney from yesterday, after earlier climbing as much as 0.2
percent. It declined 0.3 percent to 96.12 yen, after touching
97.08 in New York, the highest since August 2008. New Zealand’s
kiwi dollar slid 0.1 percent to 84.20 U.S. cents from yesterday.
It was down 0.1 percent at 77.80 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds fell 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 3.49 percent from
yesterday, when it touched 3.61 percent, the highest level since
May 2.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks lost 0.9 percent,
following a 1.2 percent decline in the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  yesterday. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  dropped 1.5 percent
yesterday.  RBA Decision  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board kept the overnight
cash rate target at 3 percent, in line with forecasts by 24 of
the 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The Board’s view is that with inflation likely to be
consistent with the target, and with growth likely to be a
little below trend over the coming year, an accommodative stance
of monetary policy is appropriate,” the RBA said.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 50 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark rate at
its next meeting on March 5.  Losses in the so-called Aussie were limited after reports
showed the country’s trade deficit narrowed and  house prices 
grew more than economists estimated.  Australia’s imports  outpaced  exports by A$427 million ($444
million) in December, compared with a revised A$2.79 billion
shortfall in November, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
today. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an A$800 million deficit.  House Prices  Government data also showed an  index  measuring the weighted
average of house prices in eight major cities advanced 1.6
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month
period, when it fell a revised 0.1 percent. That compared with a
0.3 percent rise estimated by economists.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  and the Australian Industry
Group said today the performance of services  index  rose to 45.3
in January compared with 43.2 in December. The 50 level divides
an expansion and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
