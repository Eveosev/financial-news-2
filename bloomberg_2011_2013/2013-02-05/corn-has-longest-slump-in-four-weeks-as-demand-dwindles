Corn futures fell, capping the
longest slump in four weeks, on signs of waning consumption of
the grain, the biggest U.S. crop. Soybeans rose.  In the week ended Jan. 25, corn inspected for export
plunged to the lowest since July 2003, and production of grain-
based  ethanol  fell to the smallest since at least June 2010,
separate government reports have shown. Corn reserves as of
Sept. 1 may be 616 million bushels, topping a Department of
Agriculture forecast last month of 602 million, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  “Export demand is very poor, and more ethanol plants are
closing because of declining profit margins,” Greg Grow, the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “U.S. corn supplies are
starting to look a little more plentiful with the slowdown in
consumption.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to close
at $7.29 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest drop for a most-active contract since Jan. 23. The grain
declined for the third straight session, the longest slump since
Jan. 4.  The USDA will update its inventory estimates on Feb. 8.
U.S. and world soybean inventories may be reduced as dry weather
shrinks  Argentina ’s crop, boosting demand for U.S. supplies, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$14.955 a bushel. Yesterday, the price reached $14.98, the
highest since Dec. 17.  Corn was valued at $76.5 billion in 2011, followed by
soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
