European (SXXP)  stocks climbed the most in
almost four weeks as companies from Munich Re to  BP Plc (BP/)  beat
earnings estimates and a measure of euro-area services output
shrank less than forecast.  Munich Re rose the most since July after the world’s
biggest reinsurer said it will increase its dividend for 2012.
 Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  surged to a record price after confirming it
held talks with Liberty Global Inc. Royal KPN NV retreated the
most in more than 11 years after saying it will sell 4 billion
euros ($5.4 billion) of shares.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 0.6 percent to 285.56 at
the close in London. European stocks dropped the most since Oct.
23 yesterday amid signs the region’s debt crisis will deepen.
The  benchmark  has gained 2.1 percent this year, and is trading
at 12.2 times its companies’ estimated earnings, up from 9.8
times in June, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The reporting season so far in the U.S. and in Europe has
generally been good, expectations have been beaten, and
commentary about the year ahead has been more upbeat than people
had expected,” Matthew Beesley, who helps oversee $3 billion of
assets as head of global equities at Henderson Global Investors
Holdings Ltd. in London, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview with  Mark Barton . “Yesterday was just an excuse to
sell off, markets were looking for a reason to take profit.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent and
 France ’s CAC 40 jumped 1 percent.  Germany ’s DAX advanced 0.4
percent.  Services Industry  An  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
services industry of the 17 countries that use the euro rose to
48.6 in January from 47.8 in December, Markit Economics said in
a report today. The London-based research company had initially
estimated a reading of 48.3 for the measure. A reading below 50
means that activity contracted.  About 55 percent of the 151  western European companies  that
have reported earnings since Jan. 8 beat analysts’ projections
for profit, according to Bloomberg data. Of the 177 that have
posted sales, 54 percent exceeded forecasts.  Munich Re  rose 3.9 percent to 138.95 euros after saying it
will increase its dividend for 2012 to 7 euros a share from 6.25
euros. The company also reported preliminary net income of 480
million euros, beating the 448.3 million-euro  average estimate 
of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It made a profit of 627
million euros a year earlier.  BP, BG  BP Plc added 1.4 percent to 468.7 pence. Europe’s second-
largest oil producer reported earnings adjusted for one-off
items and changes in inventory of $4 billion, more than the $3.7
billion  average estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BG Group Plc advanced 3.4 percent to 1,142 pence,
rebounding from an earlier slide of as much as 3.4 percent.

January, delivered a “very good performance” in the U.K. oil
and gas company’s quarterly results presentation today,  Jason Kenney , an analyst at Banco Santander SA in London, wrote in a
note to clients.  Virgin Media climbed 17 percent to 2,889 pence, the biggest
rally since its London listing in Oct. 2009. The U.K.’s second-
largest pay-television provider didn’t provide details of its
talks with Liberty Media. The Financial Times reported today
that the cable-TV business owned by  John Malone  will soon make a
bid for Virgin Media. The company, whose shareholders include

exceeding the 877 million-krona average of 13 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  gained 4.4 percent to 931 pence, its
highest price in almost 13 years. The designer of chips for
Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPad said revenue in the  fourth quarter 
rose 19 percent to 164.2 million pounds ($257 million). The
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had called for
152.4 million pounds.  KPN (KPN)  slumped 16 percent to 3.45 euros after the biggest

kronor. The profit margin in the company’s Russian business,
which accounts for 30 percent of sales, may fall this year,
