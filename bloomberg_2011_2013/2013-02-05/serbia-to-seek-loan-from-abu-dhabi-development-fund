Serbia will apply for a $100 million
loan from  Abu Dhabi Fund for Development  to help farmers expand
water channels and low-voltage networks to their land, as well
as buy new machinery to boost output.  The government will immediately submit the request,
allowing the board of managers of the Abu Dhabi-based lender to
consider and approve the funds in March, the  Finance Ministry  in
Belgrade said in an e-mailed statement today.  Farmers would be getting 10-year loans with a three-year
grace period and “a very low  interest rate ,” Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said in the statement. If the first loan is
successful, “the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development will continue
with the same-size financial assistance in the coming years,”
the ministry added.  Serbia, increasingly looking east for cash and investments,
has agreed with Abu Dhabi-based Al Dahra Agricultural Co to form
a company next month that will invest about 300 million euros
($406.9 million) in food production and exports from the Balkan
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
