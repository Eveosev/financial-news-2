Lee Jih-chu, deputy minister of
Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, will become the
chairwoman of  Chunghwa Post Co. , the biggest holder of  savings
accounts  in Taiwan.  Lee, 52, announced her new post at a commission briefing
today in Taipei.  The appointment is part of President Ma Ying-jeou’s effort
to introduce new leadership into his Cabinet, beginning with the
appointment of Jiang Yi-huah as new premier, as he battles a 14
percent approval rating. Ma has this month named new ministers
and re-appointed Central bank Governor Perng Fai-Nan to a fourth
five-year term.  Chunghwa Post was incorporated on January 2003 and is
wholly owned by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, according to its 2011 annual report. The
cumulative balance in Postal Savings 32.7 million accounts stood
at NT$4.72 trillion ($160 billion) at the end of 2011.  Calls to Chunghwa Post’s public relations office were
unanswered after normal business hours.  Lee, who has been vice chairwoman of the  FSC  since 2008,
has pushed for greater cross-strait investment in the banking,
insurance and brokerage industries. Regulators in  Taiwan  and
 China  signed an accord in November 2009 to promote greater
cooperation in financial markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
