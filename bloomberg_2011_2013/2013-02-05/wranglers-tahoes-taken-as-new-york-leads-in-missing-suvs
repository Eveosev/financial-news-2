The New York metropolitan area leads
the U.S. in unrecovered thefts of  sport utility vehicles , which
are broken down for parts or packed in shipping containers and
exported to other countries.  Thieves stole 2,438 SUVs from Jan. 1, 2008, through June
30, 2012, in the region, the most thefts in the U.S., and 725
were never recovered, the National Insurance Crime Bureau said
in a report issued today. That’s nearly four times as many
missing SUVs than in any other U.S. metro area. The region
includes  New York City , northern New Jersey and  Long Island .  Consumer demand for SUVs makes them lucrative for car
thieves who target densely populated metro areas because of the
access to  luxury vehicles  and proximity to major ports.  General
Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Tahoe and Chrysler Group LLC’s Jeep
Wrangler were the least-recovered SUVs, the report shows.  “If there’s a lot of interest in a car, thieves like it,”
said Frank Scafidi, a spokesman at the National Insurance Crime
Bureau. “People aren’t going to go through the trouble of
exporting things that won’t bring a high premium on the other
end.”  Chrysler’s Jeep Wrangler is a top seller for the automaker
that set a record for global deliveries in 2012 as demand
strengthened in the U.S. and nearly doubled in Asia.  The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach region in Florida
followed New York with 193 unrecovered thefts, and the Los
Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana,  California , area came in third
with 157. New York State had the most unrecovered thefts with
480, followed by Texas with 395 and California with 339.  There were 19,961 SUV thefts nationwide, according to the
report, and approximately 15 percent of those were unrecovered.
California led the way in total SUV thefts with 3,003 in the
period. Texas followed with 1,826 and Florida was next with
1,784.  To contact the reporter on this story:
