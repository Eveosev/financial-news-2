Gasoline in New York Harbor weakened
versus futures on speculation that  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  will
restart a fluid catalytic cracker in  Pennsylvania  this week.  The catalytic cracker, which was initially expected to be
offline for 10 days to 14 days, has been shut since December to
address issues with a slurry oil circuit, said Trebor Banstetter, a spokesman for Delta in Atlanta. Slurry oil is a
byproduct of a catalytic cracker, heavy gasoil is broken down
into lighter products. Slurry can be used as feedstock for
cokers and hydrocrackers and blended into residual fuel.  The  Trainer refinery  operated by Deltaâ€™s Monroe Energy LLC
subsidiary is the third-largest on the East Coast, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The plant has the capacity to process as much
as 185,000 barrels a day and has a catalytic cracking capacity
of 75,000 barrels daily.  Reformulated  84-octane gasoline  in  New York  Harbor weakened

traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:15 p.m. The
futures were at  parity  over the past two trading days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Supplies of motor gasoline in the Central Atlantic region
encompassing New York Harbor climbed to  29 million  in the week
