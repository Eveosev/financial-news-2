China ’s property stocks rose to the
highest in almost three years on optimism their sales will pick
up after the biggest developer traded on the nation’s stock
markets said it sold more homes in January.  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index advanced 4.8
percent at the close to the highest since April 16, 2010.  China
Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest developer on mainland exchanges, jumped
3.6 percent to 12.33 yuan in Shenzhen, while  China State
Construction Engineering Corp. (601668)  surged 9.7 percent to 4.06 yuan,
the largest advance since Oct. 14, 2009.  “Investors are expecting good sales numbers from more
developers to come after yesterday’s Vanke announcement,” said
Dai Fang, a Shanghai-based property analyst at Zheshang
Securities Co. “In general, investors are pretty optimistic
about the property sales outlook.”  Developers have put more properties on the market since the
Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said in December
that it would support demand from residents seeking bigger homes
this year, said  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the country’s biggest real
estate website owner. China’s January new home prices posted the
largest gain in two years, it said.  Vanke said sales rose 56 percent last month from a year ago
to 19.1 billion  yuan  ($3.1 billion), while Shimao Property
Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer, said sales
more than quadrupled to 4.1 billion yuan.  Evergrande Real Estate
Group Ltd. (3333) , China’s biggest developer by sales volume, said its
January sales more than tripled.  Land sales in China’s 10 major cities jumped 263 percent to
56.2 billion yuan in January from last year, China Daily
reported today, citing data from Shanghai E-house Real Estate
Research Institute.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
