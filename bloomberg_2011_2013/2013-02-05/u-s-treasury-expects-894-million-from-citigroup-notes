The  U.S. Treasury  Department said it
had priced an offering of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  subordinated notes and
expects to receive $894 million in proceeds.  The notes were issued in exchange for Citigroup securities
previously held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the
Treasury said in a statement today. Those original securities
were issued in 2009 to the FDIC, which transferred them to the
Treasury on Dec. 28. The department exchanged the securities for
subordinated notes yesterday.  The proceeds would add to taxpayer returns from the $45
billion rescue of New York-based Citigroup, which almost
collapsed in 2008 amid losses tied to subprime mortgages.
Including the Treasury’s expected return from the offering, the
department received more than $58.4 billion in repayments and
other income from the bailout, which was part of the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, or TARP.  “Today’s transaction is part of our continuing efforts to
wind down TARP’s bank investment programs, which helped
stabilize our economy during a severe financial panic and
delivered a profit for taxpayers,” Timothy Massad, the
Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial stability, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
