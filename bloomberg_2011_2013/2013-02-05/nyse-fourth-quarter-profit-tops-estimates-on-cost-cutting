NYSE Euronext, the U.S. exchange
operator being bought by  IntercontinentalExchange (ICE)  Inc., reported
fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates after the
company cut costs.  Net income fell 75 percent to $28 million from $110 million
a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Earnings excluding some items were 43 cents a share,
compared with the  38-cent mean estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The projections ranged from 35 cents to 42 cents.  IntercontinentalExchange, a 12-year-old energy and
commodity futures bourse, agreed in December to acquire NYSE,
the owner of the largest American equity exchange, in an $8.2
billion deal set to close in the second half of this year. The
deal could bring benefits from cross-selling services or an
initial public offering of its Euronext business, Chief
Executive Officer  Duncan Niederauer  said on a conference call
with analysts today.  “NYSE shares are tied to ICE stock price, but better
revenues and faster cost saves could bode well for combined
company, giving both names an upward bias on these results,”  Ed Ditmire , a New York-based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd.,
wrote in a note after today’s report.  The  shares  rose 1 percent to $35.22 today, closing at the
highest level since July 2011. The shares have risen for the
past nine days, the longest winning streak since 2006. Shares of
IntercontinentalExchange, known as ICE, added 1.6 percent to
$143.54, its highest level since May 2008. The Bloomberg World
Exchanges Index has climbed 11 percent this year.  Stock Trading  Earnings at the 220-year-old NYSE have fallen for the past
four quarters as U.S. stock trading slumped 18 percent in 2012
and options volume slowed from a record. The company has been
cutting  costs  in a plan known as Project 14 meant to eliminate
$250 million of expenses by the end of 2014, after European
regulators barred the exchange from a planned merger with
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  in February 2012.  Operating costs in 2013 will be $1.53 billion, with core
expenses $200 million lower than in 2011, the company said
today.  Capital expenditures  will be $150 million, down from $191
million in 2012.  The company also plans to refinance its debt, saving $15
million this year and $24 million in 2014, Chief Financial
Officer Michael Geltzeiler said on the call.  Cost Cuts  Expenses fell 5.8 percent to $392 million last quarter,
according to the release today. The cost cuts from debt
refinancing and the Project 14 efficiency measures helped offset
an 11 percent drop in net revenue, which excludes rebates paid
and fees collected from some traders, the company said.  Stock-trading and listings revenue fell 10 percent and
derivatives revenue declined 14 percent during the quarter,
according to today’s statement.  U.S. exchange-listed equity  volume  averaged 6.42 billion a
day in 2012, down from 7.8 billion in 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Options trading in the U.S. slowed to a daily
average of 15.9 million contracts from a ninth-consecutive
record of 18.1 million the previous year, data from the Chicago-
based OCC show.  NYSE submitted antitrust filings and a proxy statement to
the Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to the deal
with IntercontinentalExchange last month. Niederauer said on the
call that he’s “cautiously optimistic” the deal will close as
planned later this year.  Regulatory Approval  The companies are focused on obtaining regulatory approval,
Niederauer said.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and ICE said in December that
they plan to explore an IPO for Euronext, which operates bourses
in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam.  “We certainly see further upside for investors from
revenue synergies,” Niederauer, who will be president of the
combined company after the merger, said today. “Any IPO of
Euronext would occur as soon after the close as practical, but
as you would expect our focus right now is on the approval
process for the merger.”  Under the terms of the deal, NYSE shareholders can elect to
take $33.12 in cash, 0.2581 share of IntercontinentalExchange or
a mix of $11.27 in cash and 0.1703 stock. The transaction is
expected to increase earnings by more than 15 percent in the
first year and achieve $450 million in estimated cost savings,
the majority of which will be achieved in the second year after
the deal closes.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , NYSE’s smaller equity-exchange and
U.S.-listings rival, said Jan. 31 that  fourth-quarter earnings 
exceeded estimates after the company cut costs.  Analysts project Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange
will say tomorrow that earnings declined 1 percent the last
three months of 2012, while  Deutsche Boerse , based in  Frankfurt ,
said today 2012 adjusted preliminary net income was about 660
million euros ($893.84 million) on net revenue of 1.93 billion
euros.  --:
