Copper declined for the first time in
three days on speculation that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen,
derailing the global economic recovery and eroding demand for
industrial metals.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent
to $8,270.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and was
at $8,284.75 at 11:25 a.m. in Tokyo. The price touched $8,346
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 5. Futures for delivery
in May were little changed at 59,900 yuan ($9,615) a ton on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Spanish Premier  Mariano Rajoy  faces opposition calls to
resign amid contested reports about illegal payments, and
Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi narrowed the front-runner’s lead
before elections this month. The  dollar  strengthened against the
euro, reducing the appeal of raw materials as alternative
investments.  “Renewed concern over Europe’s debt crisis and the
dollar’s strength provided copper an opportunity to take a
breath after reaching a four-month high,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co. in Seoul. The
 European Central Bank  meets on Feb. 7 while euro-area leaders
gather for a summit on Feb. 7-8.  “We could see prices push still higher as we near the
Lunar New Year holiday in China, with copper potentially
rallying to $8,430 in the next week,” analysts led by  Mark Pervan  at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said in a
report today. Still “we don’t expect these gains to last and
may see a retracement back to $8,150 soon after the holiday.”  Copper for delivery in March was little changed at $3.765 a
pound on the Comex in New York. On the LME, zinc fell 1 percent
to $2,163 a ton after touching $2,190 yesterday, the highest
since Jan. 27, 2012 and nickel declined 0.8 percent to $18,573 a
ton after reaching $18,770 yesterday, a four-month high.
