Australia  posted its narrowest trade
deficit in 10 months and  home prices  jumped by the most in 2 1/2
years, supporting the case for the central bank to leave
 interest rates  unchanged today.  Imports outpaced exports  by A$427 million ($446 million),
led by stronger iron-ore shipments, from a revised A$2.79
billion deficit in November, the Bureau of Statistics said in a
report in Sydney today. A separate report showed  house prices 
advanced 1.6 percent in the three months through December, the
most since mid-2010.  Investors are pricing in a 78 percent chance central bank
Governor  Glenn Stevens  will leave the overnight cash-rate target
at 3 percent, pausing after six reductions totaling 1.75
percentage points since November 2011. The  Reserve Bank  of
Australia releases its first monetary policy decision of the
year at 2:30 p.m. in Sydney.  “The data are pretty positive,” said Alvin Pontoh, an
Asia-Pacific strategist at TD Securities Inc. in  Singapore .’’
“The increase in  house prices  certainly supports the RBA
remaining on hold.”  The Australian dollar rose to $1.0444 at 12:30 p.m. in
Sydney, from $1.0442 before the data were released.  The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 24
economists was for a trade shortfall of A$800 million. For the
house-price report, the median forecast of 15 economists was a
0.3 percent rise.  Iron Ore, Coal  Today’s report showed exports rose 3 percent to A$25.4
billion, led by a 12 percent gain in metal ores and minerals,
and a 5 percent advance in coal, coke and briquettes. Imports
slumped 6 percent to A$25.8 billion on a 35 percent plunge in
industrial transport equipment, according to the report.  The RBA has lowered the benchmark borrowing cost to a level
that matches a half-century low reached during the global
recession of 2009 to revive industries struggling with a local
dollar that’s gained almost 50 percent against the U.S. currency
since 2008.  Prices of the nation’s key export,  iron ore , have rebounded
since reaching a three-year low on Sept. 5 after China announced
spending on new subways and roads.  Australia’s economy has been driven by a resource bonanza
for iron ore, coal and natural gas that is bringing record
investment in projects. The nation’s unemployment rate, at 5.4
percent in November, is lower than 7.9 percent in the U.S.  The report on house prices showed a 2.3 percent gain in
Sydney, a 2.9 percent improvement in Perth and a 2.6 percent
advance in Darwin in the fourth quarter from the prior three
months. Prices declined 1.4 percent in Hobart, the only one of
the eight capital cities to record a drop, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
