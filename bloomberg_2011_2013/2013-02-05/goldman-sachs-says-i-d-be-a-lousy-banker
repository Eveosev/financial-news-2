Ever wonder if you have what it takes to work at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.? A  career quiz  on its website, mentioned today in Politico's  Morning Money  newsletter, might give you a good idea, if you don't mind answering a few goofy questions. Goldman would first like to know a little bit about your pedigree. What college did you attend? What degree did you earn? And where would you like to work? I didn't go to Harvard, but my  alma mater  did want to be Harvard on the Potomac. No big deal. I tried both schools, and entered different majors, and the quiz results turned out the same both times. Â  There are 14 multiple choice questions, most about careers seemingly more exciting than finance (but maybe you think  Microsoft Excel is awesome ): Based on my answers, Goldman Sachs thinks I'd thrive in technology, the executive office or global investment research. I'm least suited for investment banking, investment management and merchant banking. You can "let your friends know where you fit at Goldman Sachs" by posting the quiz results to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google+. Or, if you think you might actually want to pursue one of those career paths, there's an iPhone app to guide you through Goldman's recruiting process. I think I'll stick with editing.
