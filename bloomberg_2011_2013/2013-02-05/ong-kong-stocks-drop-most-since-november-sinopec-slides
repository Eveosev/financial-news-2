known, fell 6.4 percent after saying it will raise HK$24 billion
($3.1 billion) in its biggest share sale since listing in 2000.

above the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of mainland
companies slumped 2.8 percent to 11,813.39.  “Sinopec placement was negative news to trigger the
morning sell-off, but in the afternoon there was heavy selling
of local property shares,” said  Steven Leung , a Hong Kong-based
institutional sales director at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. “Lots of
people are taking profits and worrying there will be measures
from the Hong Kong government to cool down the local property
market.”  Hong Kong’s market will be shut for three days next week
for the Lunar New Year holidays, while markets in mainland China
will be closed for the whole week. The Hang Seng Index rose for
a fifth straight month in January, the longest such streak since

compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2
percent. The  S&P 500  sank 1.2 percent yesterday, its biggest
decline since November, as bond yields in Spain and Italy
soared. Spanish Premier  Mariano Rajoy  faces calls to resign amid
contested reports about illegal payments, and Italy’s Silvio
Berlusconi narrowed the front-runner’s lead before elections
this month.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that gets more than three-
quarter of its revenue from Europe, dropped 2.1 percent to
HK$10.30.  HSBC slid 2.7 percent to HK$85.45.  The Hang Seng Index has traded above its 50-day average
since September and some of this year’s biggest gainers were
among shares that fell the most today. Bank of China Ltd., which
advanced 14 percent in 2013, dropped 3.8 percent to HK$3.79.
Bank of Communications Co. fell 3.3 percent. Shares of the

less than yesterday’s close, according to a filing after the
market closed yesterday. The company plans to use the money for
“general corporate purposes,” it said in the statement,
without giving more details.  A measure of property developers had the  biggest drop  among
the Hang Seng Index’s four industry groups. Sun Hung Kai slid
3.2 percent to HK$121.30. New World Development Co., which
recorded the biggest gain in the  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP)  in
2012, retreated 4 percent to HK$13.84.  Property Market  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority can roll out a sixth
package of measures if necessary to rein in the property market
after already using tools such as limits on mortgage terms, HKMA

said, echoing a warning in December from the  International
Monetary Fund .  Futures on the Hang Seng Index declined 2.3 percent to
