Nottingham Forest manager  Alex McLeish  left the second-division English  soccer club  today after
a month in charge.  The 54-year-old leaves with the team in 11th place in the
Championship, 22 points behind leader Cardiff. His departure was
announced in an e-mail from the  League Managers Association ,
which represents coaches. McLeish joined Forest Dec. 27.  “Both parties entered into the relationship in good faith,
however, there was a difference in the understanding of the
development strategy of the football club and it was felt by
both parties that we should part company,” McLeish said in the
statement.   The former Aberdeen player was fired by  Aston Villa  in May
after 11 months in charge. He had joined Villa from cross-town
rival Birmingham, which he took over in 2007. Birmingham was
relegated in 2008, and returned to the Premier League in 2009.
It went back down again in 2011, the same year as the club’s 2-1
victory in the League Cup final over Arsenal.  He led the Scottish national side for 10 months in 2007,
and was manager of Rangers for 5 seasons, starting in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
