Vinci SA (DG) , Europe’s biggest builder,
reported a drop in 2012 profitability amid falling sales in
markets such as Poland and said business will stagnate this year
because of the economic slump.  Net income as a percentage of sales dropped to 5 percent
from 5.2 percent a year earlier, the company, based in the Paris
suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, said in a statement today.  The company said it may face lower traffic at its French
highways because of rising unemployment, while infrastructure
orders from cash-strapped European local governments and
utilities may fall. To counter that, it agreed in December to
buy Portuguese airport operator ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA
for 3.1 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to benefit from growing
travel to Latin America and some African destinations.  “The economic climate is expected to remain difficult in
2013, especially in Europe,” Vinci said. “The group is
expecting business to be flat in 2013, before taking ANA or any
other new acquisitions into account.”  Net income rose 0.7 percent last year to 1.92 billion
euros, compared with a 1.93 billion-euro average of six analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s backlog rose 2.3 percent to 31.3 billion
euros as of Dec. 31. Vinci plans to pay a  dividend  of 1.77 euros
a share this year, unchanged from last year.  “If trends observed at the end of 2012 continue, there
could be a downturn in order intake, due to the group’s emphasis
on margins rather than volume for project selection,” Vinci
said.  Full-year sales rose 4.5 percent to 38.6 billion euros,
helped by acquisitions and the stronger euro. Analysts had
estimated 38.4 billion euros. Fourth-quarter sales climbed 3.6
percent. Excluding  acquisitions  and currency swings, revenue
dropped 0.3 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
