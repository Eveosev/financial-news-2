China National Petroleum Corp., the
nation’s biggest oil and gas explorer, produced 1.81 million
metric tons of crude at its Oman project last year.  The output at  Block 5  was almost nine times as much as in
2002, when the company first signed a 50 percent production-
sharing contract to develop the site, the company said in its
in-house newsletter today. The production is equivalent to
36,000 barrels a day. Block 5 covers the Daleel and Mezoon oil
fields and is jointly operated by China National Oil and Gas
Exploration & Development Corp., CNPC Hong Kong Ltd. and Oman MB
Group, according to CNPC’s website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
