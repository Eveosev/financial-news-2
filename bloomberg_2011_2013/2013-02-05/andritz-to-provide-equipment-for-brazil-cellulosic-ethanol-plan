Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of hydropower turbines, will furnish equipment to
Brazilian sugar-cane research agency Centro de Tecnologia
Canavieira for an 80 million-real ($40 million) plant that will
produce cellulosic ethanol fuel from sugar-cane waste.  The gear will use steam to expose cellulose in fibrous
biomass to enzymes that break it down into fermentable sugars,
Robson Cintra de Freitas, director of business and new
technology at Piracicaba, Brazil-based CTC, said today in a
telephone interview.  CTC expects to sign a contract with Austria’s Andritz this
month, he said, without revealing the value of the deal. The
company is in talks with biotechnology companies including
 Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  and  Codexis Inc. (CDXS)  to supply enzymes. Finnish
engineering company Poyry Oyj will build the plant.  Construction is expected to begin in July and the
demonstration plant will start producing fuel in the middle of
next year, he said. It will be added to an existing mill in the
city of Sao Manoel. Alstom SA is the biggest supplier of
hydropower equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
