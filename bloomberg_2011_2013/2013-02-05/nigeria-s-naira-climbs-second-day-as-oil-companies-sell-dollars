Nigeria’s naira climbed for a second
day on speculation that  oil companies  operating in the West
African country sold dollars to fund local operations.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer strengthened
less than 0.1 percent to 157.21 per dollar by 2:50 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Some sales by oil companies provided some support,” Sewa
Wusu, the Lagos-based head of research at Sterling Capital Ltd.,
said by phone today. Foreign inflows into a scheduled central
bank Treasury bill sale tomorrow will probably add to the
naira’s gains, he said.  Oil companies periodically sell dollars to lenders to meet
local spending needs and are the second-biggest source of
foreign currency after the Abuja-based central bank’s twice-
weekly auctions, which are used to help stabilize the naira.  Banks bought the entire  $150 million  offered yesterday. The
regulator sold $120 million on Jan. 30, the smallest amount in
three auctions. The central bank said Jan. 30 it will sell 184.3
billion naira of T-bills tomorrow.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined eight basis points to 11.12 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 rose two
basis points to 4.07 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.2 percent to 1.9055 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
