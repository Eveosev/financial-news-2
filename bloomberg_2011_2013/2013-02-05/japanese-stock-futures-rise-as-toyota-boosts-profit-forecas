Japanese stock futures rose after
Toyota Motor Corp. raised its profit forecast to a five-year
high and the yen weakened to the lowest level since May 2010,
boosting the earnings outlook for exporters. Australian shares
gained.  American Depositary Receipts of Toyota, the world’s largest
carmaker, climbed 2.1 percent after increasing its full-year net
income estimate by 10 percent to 860 billion yen ($1.2 billion).
ADRs of  Canon Inc. , the camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
sales overseas, gained 2.6 percent as the yen weakened against
the dollar. Atlas Iron Ltd., an Australian iron ore producer,
rose 4.5 percent as metals prices advanced.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 11,275 in Chicago yesterday, up from 11,080 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
11,250 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index  gained 0.6 percent. New Zealand’s market is closed for a
public holiday.  “Japan’s recent strong equity market performance has
substantially further to run as the market further discounts the
positive impact of Abenomics,”  Jonathan Garner , chief Asia and
emerging-market strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, wrote
in a report to clients where he advised global investors to
favor Japanese stocks over U.S. and European shares. “We expect
the market to trade more on positive earnings revisions, rather
than purely tracking yen weakness.”  Yen Weakens  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s calls for monetary policy
easing have helped the yen weaken against all other currencies
since mid-November, driving the Topix Index on Feb. 4 to the
highest level since March 2011. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa yesterday said he will step down on March 19, three
weeks before his term was due to expire, accelerating a
leadership transition that may aid Abe’s campaign for aggressive
easing. The yen fell to 93.69 per dollar as of 7:52 a.m. in
Tokyo, the lowest level since May 2010.  Of the 177 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 62 percent have exceeded  profit expectations . Some 52
percent missed sales projections, the data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The Topix trades at 1.11 times book value, compared with
2.07 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and 1.47 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent. The gauge rose 1
percent yesterday, rebounding from the biggest loss of the year
for benchmark indexes, as earnings topped forecasts and Dell
Inc. agreed to be taken private in the largest leveraged buyout
since the financial crisis.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.2 percent to 97.66 in New
York yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
