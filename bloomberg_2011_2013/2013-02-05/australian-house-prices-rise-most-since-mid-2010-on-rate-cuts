Australian  house prices  rose last
quarter by the most since June 2010 as lower interest rates
lured buyers back into the market.  An index measuring the weighted average of prices for
established houses in eight major cities advanced 1.6 percent
from the previous three months, when it fell a revised 0.1
percent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
today. The  median estimate  of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was a 0.3 percent rise. Prices rose 2.1 percent
from a year earlier.  Standard variable home-loan costs were at about 6.45
percent as of Jan. 31, the lowest since November 2009, after the
Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its cash rate by 1.75
percentage points from November 2011 to December. Governor Glenn Stevens will probably keep borrowing costs unchanged at today’s
meeting as an improved global outlook boosts Australian
commodity prices, a survey of economists showed.  “Prices were boosted substantially in the fourth quarter
by greater turnover in the top end of the market,” Stephen
Walters, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief economist in  Australia  who
predicted a 0.8 percent increase, said in a research report
before the release.  Prices rose 2.3 percent in Sydney, 2.9 percent in Perth and
2.6 percent in Darwin in the fourth quarter from the prior three
months, the report showed. Prices declined 1.4 percent in
Hobart, the only one of the eight capital cities to record a
drop, it showed.  The local dollar traded at $1.0455 at 11:43 a.m. in Sydney,
compared with $1.0442 before the report.  The RBA reduced its overnight cash-rate target to 3 percent
in December, matching a half-century low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
