Air France-KLM (AF)  Group wants to narrow
the number of bidders for its CityJet unit to two by the end of
next month after whittling down the group of possible suitors to
six from 10, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.  The offers are for the entire business, including the
CityJet name, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the process is confidential. The Paris-based company
wants to have one financial bidder and another from the aviation
industry on its shortlist, the person said.  “The Air  France  KLM Group is studying different options
for CityJet as indicated in the past,” spokeswoman Brigitte Barrand said today by telephone. She declined additional comment
on the selection process.  Air France-KLM,  Europe ’s biggest airline, has been
revamping its regional operations in an effort to end years of
losses. Its  Brit Air (IAG) , Regional and Airlinair are being folded
into a single unit called HOP!, which was unveiled last month.  CityJet is based in Dublin. The airline serves London City
airport from 22 destinations across Europe, including Amsterdam,
Paris, Dresden, Milan and Florence. CityJet employs 85 people in
France and is based in Dublin.  The Irish Times first reported the plan of having two final
bidders today, citing CityJet employee representatives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
