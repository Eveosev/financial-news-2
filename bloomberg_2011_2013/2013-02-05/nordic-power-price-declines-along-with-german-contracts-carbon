Nordic electricity climbed after
European Union carbon advanced, and the price for power
delivered tomorrow rose.  The benchmark near-quarter electricity contract gained as
much as 1.3 percent to 36.40 euros ($47.92) a megawatt-hour, the
highest since Jan. 24, and traded at 36.20 euros as of 2:49 p.m.
on the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.  Electricity for delivery around the clock tomorrow will
cost 39.40 euros a megawatt-hour on average, following today’s
auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. That’s 6.3
percent higher than yesterday’s price for today, and also
exceeds the financial contract for tomorrow on Nasdaq OMX, which
closed at 38.75 euros. Forward contracts frequently track
movements in prompt prices.  EU carbon permits for December gained as much as 4.4
percent to 4.51 euros a metric ton, after earlier falling to a
low of 4.03 euros on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .
Emission prices can influence generating costs at coal and gas-
fed plants.  Average Nordic temperatures for the next 15 days may be 4
degrees Celsius below seasonal average, Danish energy trading
company Energi Danmark A/S said today on its website. Lower
temperatures trigger higher demand for electric heating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
