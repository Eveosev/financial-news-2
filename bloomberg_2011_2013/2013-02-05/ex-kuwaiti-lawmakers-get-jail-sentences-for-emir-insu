A Kuwaiti court sentenced three
former lawmakers to three years each in prison for insulting the
country’s ruler at a public gathering last year, a human rights
lawyer said today.  Khalid Al-Tahoos, Falah Al-Sawagh and Bader Al-Dahoom, all
members of  Kuwait ’s opposition movement, were sentenced by the
criminal court to “three years with hard labor and with
immediate effect,” Mohammed Al-Humaidi, director of the Kuwait
Society for Human Rights, said by phone from Kuwait City.  The verdict follows reports on Feb. 3 that a Kuwaiti man
was sentenced to five years in prison for Twitter posts that
insulted Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. The emir is
protected under the country’s Constitution. Kuwaiti authorities
should ensure people are “free to peacefully express their
opinions, including about the electoral law, the elections and
the emir,” Amnesty International said in November.  “We are a country led by the rule of law and our
constitution holds our emir to be inviolable,” the Ministry of
Information said in an e-mailed statement after the court
ruling. “If our citizens wish to amend the constitution there
is a straightforward legal way to do this, but we will not
selectively enforce our laws.”  Kuwait’s broad-based opposition movement held a series of
public rallies last year calling for political reforms.
Opposition mounted after the emir said in October he asked the
government to change the electoral system to “bolster the
democratic process” and safeguard national unity. The move
sparked Kuwait’s most violent street protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
