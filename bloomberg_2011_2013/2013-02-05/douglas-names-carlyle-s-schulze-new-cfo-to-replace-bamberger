Douglas Holding AG (DOU) , the German
cosmetics firm owned by Advent International Corp., named a
Carlyle Group executive as chief financial officer after
releasing six-year veteran Burkhard Bamberger from the role.  Dennis Schulze, 43, joins after Bamberger reached a
“mutual” agreement with the company’s supervisory board to
leave, the Hagen-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Schulze managed German, Austrian and Swiss operations at
Carlyle, which he joined in 1999, Douglas said.  Schulze’s “expertise and his extensive experience will
contribute significantly to the successful development of our
company,” Joern Kreke, Douglas’s supervisory board chairman and
the father of Chief Executive Officer Henning Kreke, said in the
statement.  Advent, the U.S. buyout firm that owns French fashion brand
Gerard Darel, made a bid for Douglas in October, capping almost
a year of talks with the founding family to take the German
cosmetics retailer private. The private-equity firm said in
January it owned a 96.1 percent stake in Douglas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
