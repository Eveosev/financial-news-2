Foreign Affairs Minister  John Baird 
said the Canadian government will toughen its anti-bribery
legislation.  Canada will introduce amendments to existing laws that
prohibit bribing foreign officials to eliminate certain
exemptions, broaden the number of companies covered and almost
triple maximum jail terms to 14 years, Baird said in a
statement.  The changes come less than two weeks after Griffiths Energy
International Inc. said it had reached a settlement with federal
prosecutors over payments the company made to a public official
from  Chad , agreeing to pay a fine of C$10.4 million ($10.4
million). Griffiths said it voluntarily disclosed the payments,
made between 2009 and 2011, after they were discovered by the
companyâ€™s new management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
