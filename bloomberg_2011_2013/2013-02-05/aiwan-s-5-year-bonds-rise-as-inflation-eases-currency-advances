Taiwan’s government bonds advanced,
with the five-year yield touching a one-week low, after
inflation slowed more than analysts forecast. The local dollar
was little changed.  Consumer prices  rose 1.15 percent in January from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in 11 months, the statistics bureau
said in Taipei today. The median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey was 1.4 percent. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell
from an 18-month high on renewed concern about  Europe ’s debt
crisis as Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to
impose austerity and restore confidence amid calls to resign on
corruption allegations. Taiwan’s debt and equity markets will be
shut for Lunar New Year holidays starting Feb. 7.  “Looks like consumer prices will stay at a relatively low
level for a while,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in
Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co. in Taipei. “Trading volume has
dropped a lot as traders are clearing their positions before the
holidays.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 fell
one basis point to 0.901 percent, the lowest level since Jan.
28, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The Taiwan dollar was at NT$29.585 against its U.S.
counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.70
on Jan. 29, the weakest level in more than four months. The
central bank has sold the local currency near the close on most
days in the past 10 months, according to traders who asked not
to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected swings used to price options, dropped one basis
points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.39 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
