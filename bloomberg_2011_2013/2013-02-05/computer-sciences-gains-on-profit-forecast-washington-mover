Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , the manager
of networks for NASA and the U.S. Navy, surged to the highest
price in more than a year after boosting its forecast for fiscal
2013 profit.  Earnings from continuing operations will reach $2.50 to
$2.70 a share in the current fiscal year, which ends in March,
 Falls Church , Virginia-based Computer Sciences said today in a
statement. That compared with the $2.52 average estimate of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and with the company’s earlier
forecast of $2.30 to $2.50.  Computer Sciences has been firing workers and seeking ways
to manage its contracts more efficiently to improve  cash flow .
Profit  margins  in all three of the company’s divisions - managed
services sector, business solutions and services, and North
American public sector - rose in the fiscal third quarter from a
year earlier.  Third-quarter  profit  from continuing operations was 90
cents a share, topping the 65-cent average estimate. Sales in
the quarter reached $3.78 billion, compared with the $3.73
billion estimate.  Computer Sciences  rose  9.2 percent to $45.75 in  New York ,
the highest closing price since May 2011. The shares had climbed
4.6 percent this year through yesterday, compared with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 4.9 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
