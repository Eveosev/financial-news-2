High temperatures may reach into the
50s Fahrenheit (10 to 15 Celsius) next week in New York and
other Northeastern cities, damping the need for heating fuels.  Readings from  New Hampshire  to  North Carolina  may be 8 to
14 degrees above normal from Feb. 10 to Feb. 14 and 5 to 7
degrees higher in the rest of the eastern U.S. and Canada,
according to MDA Weather Systems.  “While the East has seen some relatively cool, cold
temperatures relative to normal over the past few days, a
significant transition will be seen over the next few days and
by the weekend,” said Travis Hartman, energy weather manager
and meteorologist for MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  February demand usually accounts for about 23 percent of
seasonal heating totals. The warmer weather moving out of the
Midwest and into East will create “widespread energy demand
destruction for natural gas and other home heating fuels,”
Hartman said.  The high temperature on Feb. 11 in  New York  is expected to
reach 56, according to MDA. Boston may have 53; Philadelphia,
59; Cincinnati, 57; and  Washington , 63.  The warmer weather may peak earlier in the Midwest, with
Chicago reaching 47 and St. Louis 59 on Feb. 10.  Temperatures from the Midwest to Northeast will probably
remain at least 3 to 4 degrees above normal from Feb. 15 to Feb.
19, according to MDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
