China’s stocks  rose for a seventh day
after the nation’s biggest property developer reported a jump in
sales and as investors bought shares of industrial companies
that lagged behind during a bull-market rally.  China  Vanke Co. gained 3.6 percent, helping to drive a
gauge of  real-estate stocks  to the highest level since April
2010. China CNR Corp. and CSR Corp., the two biggest
trainmakers, jumped by the daily maximum 10 percent limit.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  dropped 2.1 percent after the refiner
said it plans to sell shares in  Hong Kong .  “It’s a bull market and buying is extending to all
sectors,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment
officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages $120
million. “Railway and industrial stocks are moving because they
are laggards during a recent market rally that’s mainly being
driven by financials.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,433.13
at the close, the highest level since May 8. The index has risen
24 percent from a three-year low on Dec. 3, signaling a bull
market to some investors, on signs economic growth is
accelerating. The gauge is valued at 13.4 times reported profit,
the highest level since September 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s still lower than the measure’s seven-year
average multiple of 21.4, the data show.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.9 percent to 2,771.68 today,
while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong dropped 2.2 percent. Chinese companies
traded on the mainland are priced at the biggest premium to Hong
Kong-listed counterparts since Oct. 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Mainland markets will be closed all of
next week for the Lunar New Year holidays.  Developers Jump  A  measure  of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite
advanced 4.8 percent, the most among the five industry groups.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer,
gained 3.6 percent to 12.33 yuan after reporting January sales
increased 36 percent from the previous month. Poly Real Estate,
the second largest, rose 2.2 percent to 13.42 yuan.  China
Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) , the third largest, climbed
3.6 percent to 28.45 yuan.  Investors expect developers to announce positive sales
after Vanke reported a sales increase, said Dai Fang, an analyst
at Zheshang Securities Co., in a phone interview today.  CSR, the nation’s biggest train maker, jumped 10 percent to
5.24 yuan. CNR, the second largest, surged 10 percent to 4.97
yuan. CSR had fallen 7.9 percent through yesterday over the past
one month while CNR dropped 3 percent. The Shanghai Composite
had advanced 6.6 percent in the same period.  Lagging Performances  The consumer-staples gauge in the CSI 300 surged 4.1
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Consumer staples
have been worst performer during the  bull market  for Chinese
stocks with a gain of 7.9 percent through yesterday.  The Shanghai index’s bull-market rally has driven the gauge
into a so-called golden cross, a chart pattern that has
historically preceded gains in the subsequent month.  The Shanghai gauge’s 50-day  moving average  rose to 2,193.09
yesterday, above the 200-day mean of 2,191.08. A golden cross
occurs when the shorter-term average rises above the longer one
while both are increasing. On all five occasions that this
phenomenon occurred since 1996, the measure climbed by an
average 6.3 percent in the month that followed.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 16 percent
higher than the 30-day average, according to Bloomberg data. The
30-day volatility was 17.5, compared with 16.9 over the past
year.  Sinopec Drops  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today that its
non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for January climbed
to 54 from the previous month’s reading of 51.7. The
government’s services PMI climbed to 56.2 in January from 56.1
in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Sinopec slid 2.1 percent to 6.90  yuan . The shares plunged
6.4 percent in Hong Kong. The company plans to sell H shares at
$8.45 apiece, a 9.5 percent discount to the level they closed at
yesterday. The  company -- which will use the cash for “general
corporate purposes,” according to the filing -- may buy $8
billion of assets outside of China from its parent, the Wall
Street Journal reported last month.  “Usually a discount is offered when the market is bad and
this one is a bit too big given their share prices have posted
quite some gains since September,” Michael Ding, lead manager
of the China Region Fund at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which
oversees $2.2 billion, said in a telephone interview from  San
Antonio ,  Texas . “It looks like they need funds for investment
and working capital.”  China Life Insurance Co. (601628)  led declines for insurers on
concern about the industry’s premium income growth. China Life,
the biggest insurer, slid 3.1 percent to 20.36 yuan. New China
Life Insurance Co. lost 1.4 percent to 30.45 yuan.  China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. (601601)  fell 2.4 percent to 22.14 yuan.  “Insurance companies’ January premium income growth may
rise less than 10 percent from a year earlier and that’s lower
than market expectations,” said Liu Jun, an insurance analyst
at Changjiang Securities Co. in Wuhan. “That’s pressuring
insurance stocks that have made decent gains recently.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
