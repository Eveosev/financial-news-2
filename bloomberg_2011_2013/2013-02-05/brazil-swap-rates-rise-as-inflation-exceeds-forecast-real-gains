Brazil ’s swap rates climbed to a
four-month high after a report showed inflation was faster than
forecast, fueling speculation that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs to contain price gains.  Swap rates due in January 2016 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 8.58 percent at 9:44 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 4. The
real appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9905 per dollar.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported that its IGP-DI
index of producer, consumer and construction prices rose 0.31
percent in January, more than the 0.26 percent median forecast
of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation is still worrisome,”  Pedro Tuesta , a senior
economist who covers Latin America at 4Cast Inc., said in an
interview from New York.  The outlook for inflation is getting worse in the “short
term” while the economic recovery was less intense than
expected, the central bank said in minutes of its Jan. 15-16
policy meeting. The board held the  target lending rate  at a
record low 7.25 percent.  The real rallied to a level beyond 2 per U.S. dollar on
Jan. 28 for the first time since July after the central bank
intervened by selling $1.85 billion of foreign-exchange swaps as
inflation accelerated.  Annual inflation has exceeded the 4.5 percent midpoint of
the central bank’s target range for 28 consecutive months. The
IPCA index of consumer prices rose 5.84 percent in December from
a year earlier, quickening from the 5.53 percent annual pace in
the prior month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
