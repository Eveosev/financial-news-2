Gilt futures may decline to the
lowest level in 10 months after dropping below so-called
support, UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  The 10-year contract broke through 115.75 yesterday, the
low set on Jan. 4, opening the way for a decline to another area
of support around 111.77, said  Richard Adcock , a technical
strategist in  London .  “Fresh selling pressure developed in gilts yesterday to
extend the rejection from the recent highs, seeing a break but
no close below the Jan. 4 low of 115.75, which was the immediate
support focus,” Adcock wrote today in a note to clients. With
“the ongoing bearish trend and momentum falling, we anticipate
this level giving way on a closing basis soon, confirming the
risk of further downside.”  The futures contract expiring in March fell 0.2 percent to
116.12 at 4:03 p.m. in London after dropping to 115.61
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last
time it traded below 111.77 was on March 21.  The moving average convergence/divergence pattern, or MACD,
which tracks the difference between a shorter- and longer-term
moving average, is suggesting further declines as it remains
below zero, Adcock wrote. The MACD was minus 0.4 today.  Investors should place a bet the March contract will extend
losses, starting at 116.60 and targeting 111.80, with an
automatic instruction to exit the trade if the price rises to
116.80, Adcock wrote.  Support refers to an area on a price graph where technical
analysts predict buy orders will be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
