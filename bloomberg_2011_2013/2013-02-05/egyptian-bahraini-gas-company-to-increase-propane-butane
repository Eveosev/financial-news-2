Egyptian Bahraini Gas Derivatives Co.
plans to increase production at its complex in the  Gulf of Suez 
to the maximum capacity of 123,000 metric tons of propane and
13,000 metric tons of butane a year, the Egyptian Oil Ministry
said, without giving a time frame.  The $125 million project, which uses an input of 150
million cubic feet of gas a day, has supplied the state-run
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. with 1,500 tons of butane since
it opened in August 2012, according to an e-mailed statement
today. Butane canisters are subsidized in the local market and
are used for cooking and heating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
