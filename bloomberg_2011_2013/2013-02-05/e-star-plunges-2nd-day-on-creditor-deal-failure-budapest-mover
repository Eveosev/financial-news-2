E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , the
Hungarian energy company that filed for bankruptcy protection in
December, tumbled for a second day after failing to agree with
creditors on an extension of payment deadlines.  The shares slumped 15 percent to 189 forint by the close in
Budapest, extending the decline in the past two days to 28
percent, the most since Dec. 12. The stock hit a record low of
99 forint on Jan. 23.  E-Star, which was dropped from the benchmark BUX stock
index after the bankruptcy filing, said its creditors rejected a
proposal to extend the payment deadline by 120 days, according
to a statement to the Budapest Stock Exchange after the close
yesterday. The announcement is negative for shareholders, Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker
unit, wrote in a research report today.  “We believe E-Star’s bondholders, particularly
institutional bondholders, will stick to their proposal of
capital increase, which would basically lead to a huge dilution
in current shareholders’ ownership,” Szentirmai wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
