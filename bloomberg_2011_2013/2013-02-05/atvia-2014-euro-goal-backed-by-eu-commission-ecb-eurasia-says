Latvia’s goal to adopt the euro next
January has political support from the European Commission and
the  European Central Bank  as the Baltic nation “more than”
meets the entry terms, according to Eurasia Group.  Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis will probably submit
Latvia’s bid for euro accession in the coming weeks, analysts
Otilia Simkova in London and Mujtaba Rahman in  New York  wrote
today in an e-mailed note. Risks of opposition parties stalling
the process with a referendum are limited, they said.  “In Brussels and Frankfurt, support for Latvian euro
adoption on Jan. 1, 2014 remains robust,” Simkova and Rahman
wrote. “Given the ongoing euro-zone crisis, the ability of the
Latvian government to demonstrate that all the relevant fiscal
and monetary policy Maastricht Convergence Criteria have been
met is of significant symbolic and political importance and
shouldn’t be underestimated.”  Latvia , which exited a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.2 billion)
bailout last year, is vying to follow neighboring  Estonia  by
becoming the 18th euro-area member and meets all the criteria it
needs to do so, Dombrovskis said Jan. 31. The commission and the
ECB make recommendations on whether a country meets the
necessary entry terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
