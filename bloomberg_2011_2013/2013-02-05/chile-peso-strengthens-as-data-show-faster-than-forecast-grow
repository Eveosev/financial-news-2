Chile’s peso edged higher, its first
advance in four trading sessions, after data showed the economy
grew faster than analysts forecast in December.  The peso added as much as 0.3 percent before closing at
472.88 per dollar, up less than 0.1 percent on the day.  Chilean economic activity expanded 1.2 percent in December
from November on a seasonally-adjusted basis and 4.7 percent
from a year earlier. Economists  had estimated  activity increased
0.5 percent in December from November.  “The economic activity number was better than expected,”
said Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA. “Markets are recovering
today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
