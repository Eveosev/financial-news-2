SK Telecom Co. (017670) ,  South Korea ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, more than doubled fourth-quarter profit
after selling real estate and a stake in steelmaker  Posco. (005490)   Net income  jumped to 519.1 billion won ($477 million) from
195.5 billion won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said
in a regulatory filing today. It  raised  727 billion won selling
property and about 1 percent of Posco.  Sales rose 6 percent to 4.2 trillion won, helped by new
Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, technology that boosts connection
speeds. The completion of the LTE network rollout means the
carrier will pare capital spending this year.  “LTE subscribers will continue to increase this year,”
Kim Jang Won, a Seoul-based IBK Securities’ analyst, said ahead
of the earnings statement. “That will eventually translate into
a higher top line.”  South Korean telecommunications companies may also pare
marketing this year after the regulator last month ordered
temporary halts to the enrollment of new subscribers, Kim said.
The Korea Communications Commission fined SK Telecom 6.9 billion
won and banned it from signing up new customers for 22 days
starting Jan. 31.  KT (030200)  Corp. and  LG Uplus Corp. (032640)  were also
penalized.  SK Telecom’s fourth-quarter operating profit rose 38
percent to 544.6 billion won. The company was expected to report
net income of 546.4 billion won, based on the average of 16
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  KT Profit  KT, the country’s second-largest mobile-phone, said last
week that net income fell 55 percent drop to 93.6 billion won in
the quarter. The carrier is also LTE networks.  SK Telecom  rose  1.2 percent to close at 174,500 won in
Seoul trading. The benchmark Kospi index declined 0.8 percent.  The company expects sales of 17.2 trillion won, compared
with last year’s tally of 16.3 trillion won, it said.  Capital
spending  will probably drop to 2.1 trillion won from 2.86
trillion won.  The carrier has 7.53 million LTE subscribers at the end of
last year. It introduced the service in July 2011. The company
offers a number of LTE-enabled smartphones, including Apple
Inc.’s iPhone 5 and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy S III.  To contact the reporter on this story:
