Cal Bank Ltd. (CAL) , a lender in Ghana,
rose to the highest in more than four years after saying profit
more than tripled in 2012.  The stock gained 3.5 percent to 59 pesewas as of 12:24 p.m.
in the capital, Accra, the highest intraday price since November
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income surged to 51.7 million cedis ($27 million) from
16.9 million cedis a year earlier, the lender said in a
statement yesterday. Net interest income, the money banks make
from loans, advanced to 85.1 million cedis from 41.4 million
cedis in 2011, it said.  “We were expecting the results to be good but the actuals
have beaten our expectations,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, a
stock trader at  Merban Stockbrokers Ltd.  in Accra, said by
phone.  There’s still demand for the stock, Gyamfi said, which may
advance to as high as 80 pesewas, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
