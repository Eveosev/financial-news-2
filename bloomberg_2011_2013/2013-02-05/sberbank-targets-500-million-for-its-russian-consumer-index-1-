OAO Sberbank seeks to attract as much
as $500 million into a new index showcasing the performance of
consumer companies over commodity producers in Russia, the
world’s biggest oil and gas exporter.  The  Sberbank CIB Ivanov index  of 24 stocks will be priced
daily and rebalanced quarterly, the state-run bank said today.
Its global markets team will trade the index.  “We’re hoping for significant interest from  exchange
traded funds ,”  Ovanes Oganisian , a strategist at Sberbank
Investment Research, told reporters today in Moscow. “We could
see $200 million to $500 million inflows in the first year.”  Russia is set to overtake  Germany  as  Europe ’s biggest
consumer market and become the world’s fourth-largest by volume
by 2020, according to Andy Smith, the bank’s head of equity
research. Investors are overlooking consumer companies because
two-thirds of the market is made up of commodity stocks, he said
at the briefing.  Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, food retailer OAO Magnit
and potash producer OAO Uralkali are tied for the largest
weighting in the index. Sberbank has climbed 16 percent this
year, while Magnit has surged 20 percent. Uralkali gained 0.1
percent. The 50-stock Micex Index,  Russia ’s biggest, has risen
4.3 percent.  The Ivanov Index returned more than 300 percent when back-
tested over the past decade compared with 267 percent for a
benchmark, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
