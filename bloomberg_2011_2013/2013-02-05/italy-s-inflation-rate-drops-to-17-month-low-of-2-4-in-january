Italy’s  inflation rate  based on
European Union measurements dropped to 2.4 percent in January as
the country’s recession deepened, Rome-based national statistics
office Istat said in a preliminary report today.  The rate was the lowest since Aug. 2011 and less than the
2.6 percent forecast by economists, according to the median of
16 predictions in a Bloomberg News survey. In the month,
consumer prices  dropped  2 percent as retailers offered seasonal
discounts, Istat said.  Based on Italian methodology,  prices  rose 0.2 percent from
December and  gained  2.2 percent  from a year earlier , Istat said
today. Gasoline prices rose 0.1 percent from the previous month
and 3.1 percent from a year earlier.  Today’s figures were based on a revised basket of goods and
services Istat uses to measure the monthly changes in consumer
prices. New entries included natural gas for transportation and
a larger number of smart phones and electronic book readers than
in the old basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
