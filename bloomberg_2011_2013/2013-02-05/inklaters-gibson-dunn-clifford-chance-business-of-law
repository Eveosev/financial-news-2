lawyer Richard Ernest in the firm’s Dubai office as a partner.
Ernest was previously a partner in the Abu Dhabi office of
 Clifford Chance  LLP.  “Richard is one of the most talented young finance
partners in the Gulf region,” said Ken Doran, Chairman and
Managing Partner of Gibson Dunn. “His addition will help us
continue to expand our global finance practice and to help our
clients with their most important and complex financings.”  “Our Dubai office has market leading capabilities in M&A
and corporate transactions, litigation and commercial
arbitration, and fund formation and alternative investing ,”
Paul Harter, partner in charge of the Dubai office said in a
statement. “Richard’s addition rounds out the firm’s  Middle
East  offering and adds more depth to our premier global finance
practice.”  Ernest practices includes advising lenders and
borrowers/investors on finance transactions such as the
financing of domestic and cross-border acquisitions and general
corporate lending. He is also experienced in leveraged and
structured finance, project and ECA-backed finance, acquisition
finance, real estate finance, and restructurings and workouts.
Ernest moved to Clifford Chance’s Abu Dhabi office in January
2008 to help establish it, the firm said.  Gibson Dunn  has more than 1,000 lawyers at 17 offices in
the Americas,  Europe , the Middle East and  Asia .  News  Barclays’s GC Harding, Finance Director Lucas Will Retire  Barclays Plc (BARC)  General Counsel Mark Harding will retire, the
London-based company said Feb. 3 in a  statement . Finance
Director Chris Lucas, who is under investigation by the U.K.’s
Financial Services Authority, will also retire as soon as a
successor is named, the bank said.  Lucas and Harding will remain in their positions until
successors are appointed, the bank said. Citing the seniority of
the two roles, it said the process is likely to take
“considerable time” to complete. Harding has been the bank’s
general counsel since 2003.  Lucas, 52, has been Barclays’s finance director for almost
six years. He was one of four past and present Barclays
employees being investigated by the FSA about whether the bank
adequately disclosed fees it agreed to pay to the Qatar
Investment Authority when it sought to raise money from
investors including the sovereign-wealth fund.  His departure follows that of the company’s three top
executives, who stepped down last year after the bank was fined
290 million pounds ($455 million) for manipulating the Libor
benchmark interest rate.  After the departures of  Bob Diamond  as chief executive
officer, Marcus Agius as chairman and Jerry del Missier as chief
operating officer, “this is a complete clearing of the stables,
and it will be interesting to see who they hire,” said
 Christopher Wheeler , a London-based analyst at Mediobanca SpA
who  rates  Barclays outperform. “Will it be someone squeaky
clean, or someone punchy who will develop the business?”  For more, click here.  Moulton Picked to Lead Pennsylvania Probe Into Sandusky Case  H. Geoffrey Moulton Jr. was named to lead  Pennsylvania ’s
internal probe into the case against Jerry Sandusky, the former
Pennsylvania State University assistant football coach convicted
last year of child sex abuse.  Moulton, a former federal prosecutor and associate
professor of law at Widener Law, “will assist us in providing a
comprehensive and independent examination of the facts
surrounding the handling of the Sandusky investigation,” state
Attorney General Kathleen Kane said by e-mail. The findings of
the investigation will be made public, Kane said.  Sandusky, 69, was convicted in June of 45 criminal counts
and sentenced to at least 30 years in prison. The case led to
the firings of Penn State President  Graham Spanier  and  Joe Paterno , who headed the school’s football program for 46 years.  After winning her party’s nomination last year, Kane made
reviewing the attorney general office’s handling of the Sandusky
case a key issue. The former Lackawanna County prosecutor and
mother of two children is the first woman and first Democrat
elected to the state’s top law-enforcement office.  Deals  Oracle Agrees to Buy Acme Packet for $2.1 Billion in Cash  Weil Gotshall and Manges LLP and GTC Law Group advised
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , the second-largest maker of business applications,
on its agreement to acquire  Acme Packet Inc. (APKT)  for $2.1 billion,

partner Keith Flaum led its team. Additional partners included
 New York  tax partner Helyn Goldstein, New York executive
compensation and employee benefits partner Amy Rubin, and New

person familiar with the deal said.  The Bingham deal team for Acme was led by Boston corporate
partners Julio Vega and John Utzschneider. Additional partners

Cogill, tax and employee benefits; Bill Berkowitz, antitrust and
trade regulation; Jeff DuRocher, tax and employee benefits; Doug Schwarz, labor and employment practice; and  Mark Robinson ,

acquisitions since 2005 as Chief Executive Officer  Larry Ellison 
works to augment its traditional business applications that run
over companies’ own servers with cloud-computing products it can
deliver over the Web. Acme’s tools help securely deliver voice,
video and data over Internet protocol networks, pushing Oracle
deeper into networking technology -- a market that’s benefiting
from the boom in mobile devices.  For more, click here.  Firm News  Clifford Chance London Banking Litigator Moves to Hong Kong  Clifford Chance LLP announced that its London head of
