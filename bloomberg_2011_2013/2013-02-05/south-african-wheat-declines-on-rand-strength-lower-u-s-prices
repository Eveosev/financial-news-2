South African wheat futures dropped
for a third day, the longest losing streak in more than a month,
as the rand gained against the dollar and prices of the grain
fell slightly in the U.S. yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract,
decreased 0.6 percent to 3,582 rand ($403) a metric ton, the
longest falling streak since Dec. 13, by the close on the South
African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.  The rand gained 0.4 percent to 8.8783 per dollar by 1:50
p.m. in Johannesburg after the nation’s statistics agency said
the  unemployment rate  fell to 24.9 percent in the fourth
quarter.  Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.3 percent to $7.63 a
bushel by yesterday’s close on the Chicago Board of Trade. It
was little changed at $7.6350 a bushel at 11:48 p.m. in  London .  “The rand recovered and the prices for wheat in America
fell a bit last night and we follow them,” Theo Venter, an
analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by
phone.  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for July delivery, declined 1 percent to 1,972
rand a ton, the lowest since June 19, while the white variety
increased 0.3 percent to 2,061 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
