The euro may rally to its highest
level against the yen in more than three years after breaking
through a 2011 high, according to JPMorgan Chase and Co.  The 17-nation currency will target a level of 127.95/128.50
yen per euro, near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
decline from the June 2009 peak, Niall O’Connor, a technical
analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a note to clients. The
shared currency, which has gained 23 percent versus the yen
during the past three months, will find support at 123.20 after
breaking through “the important 123.35 high from 2011,”
O’Connor said.  “The yen weakness story is very much still intact and
there is no sign of a reversal,” O’Connor said in a telephone
interview from  New York . “One twenty-eight is the next big
target zone.”  The euro gained 1.5 percent to 126.72 at 12:20 p.m. in New
York after falling as much as 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
intra-day drop since Jan. 2. The euro last reached 128.50 yen on
Jan. 20, 2010.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
