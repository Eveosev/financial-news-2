The New Zealand dollar approached a
17-month high against the dollar before the release of data
forecast to show unemployment declined in the South Pacific
island nation.  The Australian dollar fell against the majority of its 16
most-traded peers after the central bank said the inflation
outlook allowed scope for further interest-rate cuts. Both the
Australian and New Zealand dollars surged to four-year highs
against the yen after  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
announced that he will exit his post on March 19, almost three
weeks before his term was due.  The Aussie “surged to new 2008 highs against the yen as
hearty investor appetite for risk helped overshadow expectations
of still lower Reserve Bank lending rates this year,” wrote  Joe Manimbo , a market strategist at Western Union Business
Solutions, in a note to clients. “Against a resurgent euro and
a strong kiwi dollar, however, the Aussie turned lower.”  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.2
percent to 84.47 cents per U.S. dollar yesterday in New York
after touching 84.66, almost the highest since September 2011.
The kiwi gained 1.5 percent to 79.05 yen after reaching 79.15,
the most since 2008. The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $1.0391, and
gained 0.8 percent to 97.24 yen after touching 97.44, the
strongest also since 2008.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.4
percent.  Unemployment Rate  The kiwi rose as New Zealand’s unemployment rate was
forecast to decline to 7.1 percent from 7.3 percent, according
to median forecast of eight economists polled by Bloomberg News.  The Australian dollar slid after the central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at the half-century low of 3
percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show
traders see a 53 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark
rate at its next meeting on March 5.  The yen weakened after Shirakawa told reporters in  Tokyo 
that he would leave at the same time as two deputy governors on
March 19, accelerating a leadership transition that may aid
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for aggressive easing. He
was scheduled to step down on April 8.  “The early departure of Shirakawa means that the early
April Bank of  Japan  meeting is going to be significant,”
 Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at BNP
Parnibas SA in New York, said in a telephone interview.  The Aussie fell 1.2 percent during the past three months
among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi gained 1.1
percent. The yen fell 17 percent to lead decliners while the
greenback dropped 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
