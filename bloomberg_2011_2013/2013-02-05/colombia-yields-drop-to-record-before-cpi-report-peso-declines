Colombian peso bond yields fell to a
record low before a government report that is forecast to show
annual inflation slowed last month.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.19 percent at the close of trading in Bogota,
according to the central bank. The yield was the lowest since
the securities were first issued in 2009.  Consumer prices  rose 2.22 percent in January from a year
earlier after a 2.44 percent increase in the prior month,
according to the median forecast of 25 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is due to publish the
monthly report at 7 p.m. in Bogota. Slower inflation boosts
returns on fixed-rate bonds.  “The market is expecting inflation to surprise on the low
side,” Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at brokerage Corredores
Asociados SA in Bogota, said in a phone interview. “Yields have
been falling ahead of the report.”  The peso closed little changed at 1,786.87 per  U.S. dollar 
and has weakened 0.9 percent in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
