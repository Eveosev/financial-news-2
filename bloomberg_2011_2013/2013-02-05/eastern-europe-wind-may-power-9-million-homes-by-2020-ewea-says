Wind turbines  in central and eastern
Europe may power 9 million homes by the end of this decade if
local governments take steps to encourage investments, the
European Wind Energy Association said in a study.  Twelve nations in the region including Poland and Romania
plan to raise installed wind power capacity to 16 gigawatts by
2020 from 6.4 gigawatts at the end of 2012, EWEA said today in
an e-mailed statement. Turkey seeks to increase capacity to 20
gigawatts from 2.3 gigawatts now within the next decade.  “Wind energy in Central and Eastern Europe, including
Turkey, will substantially reduce the fossil fuel dependency of
the power sectors,” said Christian Kjaer, head of the lobby
group. “Some countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Bulgaria are without stable renewable energy legislation.
Investors and banks will withdraw unless governments put in
place long-term renewable energy policies.”  Companies such as  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  are seeking to tap sales in  emerging markets  in
Eastern European nations, which are adding generation capacity
while driving down carbon emissions.  GE said today it will supply seven wind turbines worth
about $30 million to Energia Verde Ventuno Srl, a Romanian
private company, for a project in the southeastern Romanian
county of Tulcea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
