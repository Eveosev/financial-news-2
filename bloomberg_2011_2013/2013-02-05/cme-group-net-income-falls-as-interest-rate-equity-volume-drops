CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, said fourth-quarter profit fell, compared with a
year-earlier period that included a $528 million Illinois state
tax benefit.  Net income dropped to $166.8 million, or 50 cents a share,
from $746 million, or $2.25 a share, a year earlier, Chicago-
based CME said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.
Excluding charges of $43.5 million related to the state income
tax and other items, profit was 63 cents per share, falling
short of the average estimate of 64 cents in a Bloomberg survey
of analysts. CME Group split its  stock  five-for-one in July.  Average daily volume in the quarter fell 13 percent, led by
equity index, energy and  interest rate  contracts, CME Group said
last month. Volume may fall 2 percent this year and not pick up
until the end of 2014,  Niamh Alexander , an analyst at KBW Inc.
in  New York  said in December note to clients. She expected the
company to earn 63 cents a share.  Revenue fell 10.3 percent to $661 million last quarter,
from $737 million a year ago, the company said.  CME Group  shares  have risen 8.2 percent over the past year.
They gained 1.5 percent to $59.18 today in New York.  (CME Group will hold a conference call for analysts and
