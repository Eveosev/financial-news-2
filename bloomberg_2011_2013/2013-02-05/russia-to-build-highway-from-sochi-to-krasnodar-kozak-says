Russia plans to spend as much as 600
billion rubles ($20 billion) to build a highway from Sochi, the
Black Sea city that will host 2014 Winter Olympics, to regional
capital Krasnodar 290 kilometers (180 miles) to the north.  The road design will be financed after the end of the
 Olympic Games  from unused funds allocated for arranging the
competition, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak told reporters
in Moscow today.  President  Vladimir Putin  has sought to attract events such
as the soccer  World Cup  and this weekâ€™s Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit. Russia has spent about 660 billion rubles on
preparations for the APEC forum in Vladivostok and will invest
300 billion rubles in the World Cup in 2018.  Russia has spent about $50 billion on preparations for the
Winter Olympics and developing regional infrastructure,
according to Kozak. The government plans to ensure the Sochi
infrastructure will continue to be used after the Games, with
the stadium built for the opening ceremony earmarked for
training Russian soccer teams and hosting World Cup matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
