Natural gas futures climbed to the
highest price in more than a week on forecasts of unusually cold
weather that will stoke demand for the heating fuel.  Gas rose 2.5 percent as forecasters including Commodity
Weather Group LLC said below-normal temperatures will sweep into
parts of the Midwest over the next 11 to 15 days. The decline in
 U.S. inventories  in the first 13 weeks of this heating season
was 34 percent higher than the same period a year ago, when the
U.S. was in the middle of the fourth-warmest winter on record.  “There is some cold in the forecast for the Midwest and
that, obviously, with  Chicago  being one of the largest space-
heating demand markets for gas, is supportive,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting group in
Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “As of February, the bulls are running
out of winter, or weather spikes, to spur demand.”  Natural gas for March delivery gained 8.4 cents to settle
at $3.399 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price since Jan. 25.
Trading volume was 26 percent below the 100-day average at 2:44
p.m. The futures have gained 36 percent from a year ago.  March $3.70 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 1 cent higher at 2.2 cents on
volume of 886 contracts as of 3:33 p.m. Calls accounted for 51
percent of options volume.  “The higher bias is due to extended  weather forecasts  that
are showing a cold trend, after the warm-up that is about to
occur over the weekend into next week,”  Mike Fitzpatrick ,
editor of the Energy OverView newsletter in New York, wrote
today. “As the warm-up comes into focus, look for prices to
react lower.”  Gas extended gains after a midday update to government
models showed colder weather for the Midwest and the East in the
11- to 15-day period, said Jim Southard, a meteorologist with
Frontier Weather Inc. in Tulsa,  Oklahoma . The latest model runs
show temperatures in the regions may be 15 to 20 degrees below
normal on the coldest days, “but it’s a long way out so it’s
not by any means a certainty yet,” he said.  Below Normal  The low in Chicago on Feb. 15 may be 10 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 13 Celsius) and  Dallas  may be 29 degrees, 12 below the
usual reading for both cities, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania. About 50 percent of U.S. households
use gas for heating.  PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the 13-state Eastern
U.S. power grid from  New Jersey  into  Illinois , expects peak
hourly demand on Feb. 10 to drop to 93,556 megawatts for the
hour ending at 7 p.m., the  least  for that hour since Jan. 19,
before climbing to 102,736 megawatts the next day, data from the
grid operator show.  Gas inventories probably fell by 130 billion cubic feet
last week, according to the median of four analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average decline for the
period is 165 billion, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  Supply Report  Stockpiles totaled 2.802 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended Jan. 25, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier, the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said last week. The
year-over-year  deficit  was the widest since July 2011. A  surplus 
to the five-year average climbed to 12.2 percent from 10.7
percent for the week ended Jan. 4.  U.S. marketed gas output in will increase 0.9 percent to
69.84 billion cubic feet a day in 2013, according to the EIA.
Production will set a record for the sixth straight year, led by
gains at shale reserves.  Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and
horizontal drilling, which can bisect more pockets of gas than
vertical wells, have made it more economical to extract the fuel
from rock formations such as the Marcellus in the Northeast.  Some of the gains in shale gas output may be offset by a
drop in drilling elsewhere in the U.S. The  gas-rig count  fell by
6 last week to 428, the least since Dec. 14, Baker Hughes Inc.
said Feb. 1. The number was down 43 percent from a year earlier.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 10 months of last year, on pace to be
the highest annual level since 1991, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
