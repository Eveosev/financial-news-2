The pound advanced against the dollar
after a report showed the U.K. services sector unexpectedly
expanded last month.  Sterling climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5804 at 9:33 a.m. London
time and was little changed at 85.69 pence per euro.  Gilts fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year security up
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
