Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSGIQ) , the
largest U.S. tanker operator, won approval to borrow
$25 million to maintain ships and to make payments to two
lenders that funded construction of its vessels.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
said today he would approve the loans after a group of
Overseas’s lenders dropped their opposition to the financing.  “It’s been a bit of a journey to get here,” James L. Bromley, an attorney for Overseas with  Cleary Gottlieb Steen &
Hamilton LLP , said in court.  The New York-based company filed for bankruptcy last year
after global shipping rates fell and the company gave up trying
to win a federal loan guarantee. Overseas listed assets of $4.15
billion and debt of $2.67 billion in a Chapter 11 filing.  The case is In re Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., 12-
bk-20000,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
