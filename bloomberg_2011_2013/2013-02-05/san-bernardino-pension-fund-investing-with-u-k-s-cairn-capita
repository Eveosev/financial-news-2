California ’s San Bernardino County
Employees’ Retirement Association said it’s investing in a deal
with Cairn Capital Ltd., the U.K. firm that’s selling the first
European collateralized loan obligation since 2011.  Nicole Dailey, a spokeswoman for the pension fund known as
 SBCERA , declined to say whether the 300.5 million-euro ($407
million) CLO, a high-risk debt instrument popular before the
financial crisis, is the Cairn deal her firm is invested in.  Two CLOs have been sold in Europe since 2008 as investors
shunned hard-to-value assets in the worst credit crisis since
the 1930s. The market has been quicker to recover in the U.S.,
where issuance more than quadrupled to $55.4 billion in 2012 and
is forecast by  Wells Fargo & Co . to reach $80 billion this year.  Adam Bradbery, a London-based spokesman for  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) , which is arranging Cairn’s CLO, and a Cairn official
declined to comment.  Deutsche Bank AG arranged a CLO for European Capital
Management in 2011, and Intermediate Capital Group Plc completed
a deal a year earlier.  The most junior notes in the Cairn CLO will total 60
million euros, a person familiar with the terms said last month,
asking not to be identified because the transaction is private.
CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporters on this story:
