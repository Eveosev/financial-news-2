Los Angeles Lakers forward Metta World Peace was suspended for tonight’s game against the
Brooklyn Nets for grabbing an opponent around the neck and
striking him in the jaw.  Stu Jackson, the National Basketball Association’s
executive vice president of basketball operations, announced the
ban today in an e-mailed statement.  World Peace and Detroit Pistons guard  Brandon Knight 
tangled underneath the basket in the first half of the Lakers’
98-97 win at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan two nights
ago. World Peace was assessed a flagrant foul after his left
hand struck Knight in the face.  World Peace, 33, is averaging 13.2 points and 5.7 rebounds
per game this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
