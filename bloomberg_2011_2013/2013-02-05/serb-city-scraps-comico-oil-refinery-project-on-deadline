Smederevo, a Serbian city, will seek
new investors for its industrial area after Comico Oil failed to
pay land lease for the location where it planned a $250 million
oil refinery.  Comico Oil, the Serbian unit of U.S.-Dutch Comico Overseas,
missed its third and final deadline yesterday to pay 652 million
dinars ($7.93 million) for a 99-year lease, Jasna Avramovic, the
mayor of the city located 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of
Belgrade, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
