Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO) , the
largest offshore rig contractor in the U.S., fell the most in
more than a year after forecasting more downtime for its vessels
in 2013 than analysts expected.  Diamond Offshore  declined  3.5 percent to $73.77 at 10:30
a.m., after falling as much as 6.7 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since August 2011. The Houston-based company is 50 percent
owned by  Loews Corp. (L) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company estimated its rigs wouldn’t be available for
1,383 days this year as they undergo maintenance and other work,
according to a filing after the close of regular trading
yesterday. That’s 32 percent higher than the 1,050 days expected
by Luke Lemoine, an analyst at Capital One Southcoast in  New
Orleans .  “Downtime was more than people were expecting,” Lemoine
said in a phone interview. He rates the shares an add, which
means investors should buy the stock, and owns none. “This is
the first time they actually quantified the number of days.
That’s what’s sending the stock down.”  Downtime should be “much lower” in 2014, Chief Executive
Officer Larry Dickerson said on an earnings conference call
today. The company reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit of
$1.40 a share, 28 percent more than the average of 35 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
