Canadian  stocks  rose, after the
benchmark index followed global equities lower yesterday, as
BlackBerry surged and energy shares rallied amid a recovery in
 oil prices .  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research in Motion, jumped
9.3 percent after wireless carrier BCE Inc. said the Z10
smartphone has attracted record orders. Westjet Airlines Ltd.
advanced 1.4 percent on record capacity levels in January. New
Gold Inc. added 0.7 percent after reporting that fourth-quarter
gold production climbed.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 27.57
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,745.19 at 10:35 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge dropped 0.4 percent yesterday. It has gained
2.5 percent this year.  Global equities rebounded today after yesterday’s slump
sparked by renewed concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
intensify. Italian two-year notes recovered after yields reached
a one-month high. Oil advanced 0.8 percent after the biggest
loss in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
