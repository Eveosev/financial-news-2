Total SA (FP)  entered exclusive talks to
sell the TIGF natural gas network in southwestern  France  to  Snam
SpA (SRG) , Electricite de France SA and the Government of  Singapore 
Investment Corp. for 2.4 billion euros ($3.26 billion).  The selected group will “support TIGF in its further
development, while meeting commitments made to TIGF’s employees
and partners,” Paris-based Total said in a statement yesterday.
The unit, which has 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) of pipelines
and more than a fifth of the country’s storage capacity, drew
seven initial bids, Total Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Christophe de Margerie said in November.  Total, Europe’s third-biggest oil company, is seeking a
buyer for the gas network as part of a plan to sell $15 billion
to $20 billion of assets from 2012 to 2014 to raise cash for
exploration and production. Total follows  BP Plc (BP/)  and others in
stepping up sales to bolster the balance sheet while shifting
its investment focus.  If completed at that price, it would be Total’s biggest
sale by value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total
agreed to sell a stake in a Nigerian oil block to China
Petrochemical Corp. last year for $2.5 billion. It also sold its
stake in a Colombian field and pipelines to  Sinochem
International Corp. (600500)  for $1 billion.  Snam owns Italy’s biggest gas distribution network, EDF is
France’s state-controlled utility and the investment company
manages Singapore’s long-term foreign reserves. Snam holds 45
percent of the bidding group, Singapore has 35 percent and EDF
has 20 percent, using a fund established for dismantling its
nuclear power plants.  Total has begun talks with unions about keeping jobs,
benefits and TIGF’s headquarters in Pau, it said. The unit has
almost 500 employees and carries 13 percent of the total volume
of gas transported in France.  TIGF reported sales of more than 350 million euros in 2011.  The announcement about talks was released after the close
of regular trading. Total rose 1.2 percent to 39.45 euros at the
close in Paris yesterday.  BP and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are the two largest European
oil companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
