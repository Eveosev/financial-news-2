French President  Francois Hollande ’s
approval rating jumped this month from a record low, improving
for the first time since he took office after sending troops to
 Mali  to battle Islamist rebels.  Support for Hollande rose 6 points from a January survey to
43 percent, according to an Ifop poll for  Paris Match  today.  Record-high debt , jobless claims at close to a 15-year high
and efforts to cut the public deficit to 3 percent of gross
domestic product this year sent Hollande’s popularity plunging
in recent months.  Both the Mali deployment that started last month and
Hollande’s agreement with labor unions to increase workers’
flexibility helped the Socialist president counter perceptions
that he is indecisive and lacked authority.  “The French military intervention is what triggered
Hollande’s rebound in French public opinion,” Ifop pollster
Frederic Dabi wrote in an e-mailed analysis.  Besides foreign policy, Dabi said, “other indicators to
evaluate his popularity are stable, even if positive judgment on
his economic policy remains at a minority of 48 percent.”  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s approval rating rose 4
percent to 45 percent, Ifop reported.  Ifop interviewed 1,026 respondents age 18 or more by
telephone Jan. 31 to Feb. 1. The poll has a margin of error of
1.8 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
