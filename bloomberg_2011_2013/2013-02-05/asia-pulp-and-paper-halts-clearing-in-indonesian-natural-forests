Asia Pulp & Paper Group said it
halted all its suppliers from clearing natural forests as of
February, accelerating its pledge to use only farmed trees by
two years.  The Sinar Mas Group unit has suspended all forest clearing
as of Feb. 1, while non-profit organizations including the
Forest Trust identify areas that will no longer be harvested and
others that can be developed into plantations, it said in a
statement in Jakarta today.  The company said in June 2012 it planned to be entirely
reliant on raw materials from plantations by 2015, after
Greenpeace International accused it in May of clearing natural
rain forests to supply its mills and logging in areas considered
to be among the last habitat of the Sumatran tiger, which is
protected under international conservation programs.  Asia Pulp produces more than 18 million tons of paper and
pulp products each year, the company said in today’s statement.
That compares with the 2 million tons produced every year by
Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd., which also
operates plantations in Indonesia and  China , according to the
company’s website.  The paper producer will halt purchases and other contracts
with any supplier that isn’t complying with the commitments, it
said, adding that it has enough plantations to meet its long-
term production goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
