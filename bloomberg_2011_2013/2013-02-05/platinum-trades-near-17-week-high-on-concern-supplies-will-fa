Platinum futures rose to a 17-week
high on mounting concern that global demand may outpace
supplies. Palladium jumped to the highest since September 2011,
and gold declined.  The platinum industry is “in crisis,” Anglo American Plc
Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Carroll said today in Cape Town,
South Africa. Her company controls Johannesburg-based Anglo
American Platinum, the world’s biggest producer, which yesterday
reported a 2012 loss as production of refined metal dropped.  “Investors are getting very worried about future
supplies,”  Miguel Perez-Santalla , a vice president at New York-
based BullionVault, said in a telephone interview. “People are
watching every development in the region very closely.”  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,707.20 an ounce at 1:21
p.m. Earlier, the price reached $1,711, the highest for a most-
active contract since Oct. 9. The metal has gained 11 percent
this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 1 percent to
$765.45 on the Nymex. Earlier, the price reached $769, the
highest since Sept. 6, 2011. The metal has climbed 8.8 percent
this year.  Platinum and palladium are used in jewelry and pollution-
control devices for vehicles.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,673.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Last week, the precious metal gained 0.7 percent, while the
dollar retreated 0.8 percent against a basket of six major
currencies. A weaker greenback may help gold advance to $1,725,
according to  Alan Knuckman , the chief market strategist at
Chicago-based Optionshop.  Imports into mainland China from Hong Kong almost doubled
to an all-time high last year. Mainland China imported 834,502
kilograms (834.5 metric tons), including scrap and coins,
compared with about 431,215 kilograms in 2011, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data from the Census and
Statistics Department of the Hong Kong government.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$31.875 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter for this story:
