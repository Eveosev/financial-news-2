The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a disbursement of $51.4 million for  Armenia  after
completing a fifth review of the country’s economy.  The loan is part of a three-year, $403 million accord
agreed with the Washington-based lender in June 2010, it said
today in a report.  Armenia’s economic growth is forecast to slow to 4.3
percent this year compared to 6.2 percent last year, the fund
said in the report. The country’s budget deficit is expected to
widen to 2.6 percent this year from 2.1 percent in 2012 and
inflation will remain about 4 percent this year, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
