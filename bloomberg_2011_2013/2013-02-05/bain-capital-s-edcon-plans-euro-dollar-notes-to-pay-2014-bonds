Edcon Holdings (Pty) Ltd., the South
African clothing retailer controlled by private-equity firm Bain
Capital LLC, will issue euro- and dollar-bonds and buy back
existing notes to repay debt maturing next year.  South Africa ’s largest fashion retailer will tender for 700
million euros ($946 million) of the outstanding 1.14 billion
floating-rate bonds due in June 2014, the company said in a
statement today. It offered a total 325 million euros of 9.5
percent notes denominated in euro and dollars maturing in 2018
to investors, it said.  Edcon will use part of the proceeds from selling its 8.8-
billion rand ($992 million) debtors book to Barclays Plc’s  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA)  together with a 4.12-billion rand term loan facility
it negotiated with local and international banks, to fund the
buyback, the company said.  Bain, based in  Boston , bought Edcon in May 2007 for 25
billion rand in an effort to tap rising consumer spending in
 Africa ’s biggest economy. The retailer, which owns the Top Shop
brand in South Africa and had 1,218 stores at the end of 2012,
has 25.3 billion rand in debt of which 13.8 billion rand will
mature next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Same-store sales probably declined by 3.4 percent to 3.5
percent in the 13 weeks through Dec. 29, Chief Executive Officer
Jurgen Schreiber said yesterday. The decrease reflected lower
sales at its discount division, store disruption during
refurbishment of 72 stores and lower mobile phone sales, Mark Bower, chief financial officer, said.  The yield on the Edcon’s 9.5 percent 317-million euro bond
due March 2018 rose 38 basis points, or 0.38 percentage point,
to 9.96 percent, the highest since Jan. 7, by 4:40 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
