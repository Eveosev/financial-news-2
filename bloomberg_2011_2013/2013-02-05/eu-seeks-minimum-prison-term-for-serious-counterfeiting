The European Union wants to require
minimum prison terms of at least six months for “serious”
counterfeiting offenses, according to new plans released today.  “The euro is the world’s second-most important currency
and we will take all necessary steps to stop it from being
targeted by criminals,” said EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding in a statement.  Mandatory prison terms for offenders are part of a broader
effort to stamp out counterfeiting put forward by the Brussels-
based European Commission. The proposals also call for more law
enforcement cooperation and for common definitions of crimes and
sanctions across the EU.  Under the proposal, offences involving at least 10,000
euros ($13,500) or other “particularly serious” circumstances
would trigger prison terms of six months to eight years.
Offences involving at least 5,000 euros would also draw jail
terms, and offences involving lesser amounts could be handled
using other penalties, such as fines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
