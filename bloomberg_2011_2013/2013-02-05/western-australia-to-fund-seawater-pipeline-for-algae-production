Western Australia state agreed to
fund a A$10 million ($10.4 million) pipeline that will carry
seawater to companies in the Pilbara region that make products
from algae.  The pipeline will initially support Hayward, California-
based Aurora Algae Inc., which is investing A$86 million in a
facility that will produce biodiesel, Omega-3 fatty acids for
health supplements, and protein-rich biomass for aquaculture and
animal feed, the state government said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “It has already been recognized that the Pilbara is
ideally suited for the development of an algae industry,”
Premier  Colin Barnett  said in the statement. “This common user
infrastructure will deliver benefits beyond encouraging the
investment of Aurora Algae, with the seawater resource capable
of supporting further investment by other industrial users.”  The Pilbara region is the world’s biggest  iron ore 
exporting area. Aurora’s production facility will help cut
 carbon emissions  by the  mining industry  and support local supply
of diesel, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
