Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell from the highest level in almost nine months on
concern that demand for the construction material is weaker in
the  spot market .  Rebar for delivery in May fell by as much as 0.9 percent to
4,185 yuan ($671) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
before trading at 4,199 at 10:03 a.m. local time. The contract
rose to 4,235 yuan yesterday, the highest since May 7.  The average spot  price  for rebar rose 2.9 percent in the
past month, lagging behind the 5.2 percent gain in futures
prices. The gap between the two prices has become too wide,
encouraging selling of futures before the Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday beginning Feb. 9, Zhang Xin, analyst at Yongan Futures
Co., said in a report today.  “The bulls’ excuse for a rally in the futures prices was a
rosy demand outlook,” Zhang said. “Despite signs of economic
recovery, investors are still unsure whether rebar demand will
really turn around after the holiday.”  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose for a fourth day
yesterday, advancing 0.7 percent to $154.20 a dry ton, according
to The Steel Index Ltd. The average spot  price  for rebar gained
0.7 percent to 3,782  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
