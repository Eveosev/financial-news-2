State governments in the U.S. lost
$39.8 billion in 2011 because of offshore  tax avoidance ,
according to a study released today.  About two-thirds of the lost revenue is from corporations,
which can shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions outside the
U.S. and avoid paying taxes until they bring the money home. The
report was issued by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a
Washington-based consumer group that often opposes banks and
insurance companies.  The report shows that states, like the federal government,
are harmed by “tax trickery” of multinational corporations,
said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat on the tax-
writing House Ways and Means Committee.  “We have the means with which to close these loopholes,”
he said on a conference call with reporters timed to the
report’s release. “What we now need is the will.”  California,  New York  and  New Jersey , all of which have
income taxes, lost a combined $15 billion, the report said. The
report suggested that states “decouple” from the federal tax
system so corporate maneuvers to reduce U.S. taxable income
don’t automatically affect states.  President  Barack Obama  has called for limits on companies’
ability to defer U.S. taxes on profits they earn outside the
country. Those proposals haven’t advanced in Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
