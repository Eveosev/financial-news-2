Pig prices rose in southern countries
of the European Union and were unchanged in the north of the
bloc, according to industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in  Spain , the EU’s second-biggest producer, rose
to 1.742 euros ($2.36) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 1.725 euros
last week, while in  Germany , the biggest pork supplier, prices
were unchanged at 1.596 euros a kilogram, Damme, Germany-based
ISN wrote in an online  report  today.  Pork accounts for about half of the meat eaten in the EU.
Per-capita consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is set to
fall to 40.26 kilograms this year from 41.15 kilograms in 2012
due to the economic downturn and high levels of unemployment,
the EU forecast in January.  “France and Spain reported some clearly declining
slaughter weights, which is an indication of an increasingly
tight supply,” ISN wrote.  In  France , the EU’s third-biggest pig producer, prices
climbed to 1.571 euros a kilogram from 1.568 euros, while in
 Italy  they rose to 1.899 euros from 1.892 euros. Dutch, Belgian,
Austrian and Danish pig prices were unchanged.  In the north of the EU, a lot of pig carcasses “are still
going into the freezing works, in the hope of rising meat prices
as the year progresses,” ISN wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
