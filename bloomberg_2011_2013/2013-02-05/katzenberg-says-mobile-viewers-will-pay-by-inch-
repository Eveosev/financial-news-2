Hollywood studios will eventually
charge less for entertainment streamed to small devices, basing
prices on screen size,  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)  Chief
Executive Officer  Jeffrey Katzenberg  predicted.  People will pay less to watch movies and television shows
on a mobile phone than to see it in a theater, Katzenberg said
today at the Founders Forum  conference  on digital media in Los
Angeles. The move would create higher consumption in developing
markets, such as India, where cell phones are widely used for
entertainment, he said.  “People will pay by the square inch,” Katzenberg said.
“If a cell phone version is 75 cents, you’ll get 350 million
people in India to pay that.”  Studios are looking for ways to increase home-video sales
in international markets. Foreign sales of movie tickets already
outstrips revenue in the U.S. and Canada by a two-to-one margin.
International sales in 2011 were $22.4 billion, compared to
$10.2 billion in the U.S.,  according  to the  Motion Picture
Association  of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
