The euro may exceed $1.40 “well
before” the end of 2013 as the European Central Bank shrinks
its balance sheet while other central banks expand theirs,
according to Axel Merk of Merk Investments LLC.  The shared currency has appreciated as banks have made
early repayments of the first tranche of ECB loans taken under
so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operations a year ago, said
Merk, founder and president of Palo Alto, California-based Merk
Investments. This has come amid signals the euro region’s
economy is improving, he said.  “We can breach $1.40 without there being a particularly
euphoric interpretation of what’s happening in the euro zone,”
Merk said in a telephone interview. “This is all just part of a
normalization process. The key difference between the ECB and
other central banks is that rather than printing money to boost
economic growth, the ECB has a demand-driven balance sheet.”  The objective of Merk’s $553 million  Hard Currency Fund (MERKX)  is
to protect against the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative
to other currencies. The fund has gained 1.68 percent in the
past year, ranking it in the 80th percentile versus its peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 17-nation currency rose 0.5 percent to $1.3584 at 1:05
p.m. in New York, after reaching $1.3711 on Feb. 1, the
strongest level since November 2011. The euro has gained 2.9
percent versus the greenback this year, making it the third-best
performer among the greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  Fed, Japan  The Federal Reserve said last week it will continue to
purchase $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month to
spur growth and lower unemployment in the U.S. Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration took office in December on
a platform of greater monetary stimulus and a reversal of yen
strength that has hurt export competitiveness.  The ECB meets Feb. 7.  An increase by the euro past $1.40 may be challenged by
investors selling the euro to take profits on gains, Merk wrote
today in a client note.  The premium for one-year options granting the right to sell
the euro against the dollar relative to those allowing for
purchases reached 0.98 percentage point on Feb. 1, the least
since November 2009, based on closing prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from a 2012 high of 3.96 percentage
points on May 23, the 25-delta risk reversal rate shows.  “The drivers for the euro to be substantially higher are
firmly in place,” Merk said. “$1.40 is just a short-term step
that the euro will be taking.”  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
 services industries  of the 17 countries that use the euro rose
to 48.6 in January from 47.8 in December, Markit Economics said
in a report today. The London-based research company had
initially estimated a reading of 48.3 for the measure. A reading
below 50 signals contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
