President  Barack Obama  will urge
Congress to delay automatic spending cuts scheduled to take
effect on March 1 to avoid the economic effects of a sudden drop
in U.S. government spending.  Obama will speak at 1:15 p.m. at the White House today and
ask Congress for a delay in “deep, indiscriminate cuts to
domestic and defense programs,” the White House said in a
statement.  “Uncertainty around the sequester is already having a
negative impact on our economic growth,” the statement said.
Allowing it to take effect “would cost hundreds of thousands of
American jobs and have devastating impacts on our economy,” it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
