South  Korea ’s won weakened as data
showed global investors cut their stock holdings last month amid
concern the yen’s slump will erode profits at companies such as
Samsung Electronics Co. Government bonds advanced.  Overseas funds pulled 1.9 trillion won ($1.7 billion) from
local shares, the most since May, and 912 billion won from
local-currency bonds, the Financial Supervisory Service said
today. The won had its best rally in 14 months yesterday as the
government said it expected a “very firm” response from the
 United Nations  to the North Korean nuclear threat.  “The won level is more affected by real money flows in
stocks and bonds and a lot of this is happening because of the
recent dollar-yen moves,” said Kim Dong Young, a currency
trader at Industrial Bank of Korea in  Seoul . The  North Korea 
threat has a lesser effect on the market, he said.  The won dropped 0.2 percent to 1,087.40 per dollar as of
10:44 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
rallied 1.2 percent yesterday, the most since December 2011. The
currency may trade between 1,080 and 1,120 this month, Kim said.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 26 basis points, or
0.26 percentage point, to 7.7 percent.  The won fell 0.3 percent to 11.76 per yen, after touching
11.72 earlier, the strongest level since April 2010. It has
appreciated more than 15 percent against the Japanese currency
in the past three months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “European and U.S. investors led net sales since mid-
January on fears of weaker corporate earnings from the strong
won,” the South Korean regulator said in a statement today.  North Korea  Samsung, the biggest smartphone maker, said on Jan. 25 that
the won’s strength could erode its operating profit by 3
trillion won this year. The stock fell 1 percent today, taking
its decline this month to 1.7 percent.  A third atomic experiment by Kim Jong Un’s regime would be
met with a “very firm and strong” response by the United
Nations, Kim Sook,  South Korea ’s ambassador to the UN, told
reporters in  New York  yesterday.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due December
2015 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.75
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
