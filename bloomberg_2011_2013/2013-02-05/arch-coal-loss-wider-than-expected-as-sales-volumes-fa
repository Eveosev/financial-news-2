Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) , the country’s fourth-
largest producer of the fuel, reported quarterly revenue and a
loss that were worse than expected after sales volumes declined
15 percent on weaker demand.  The fourth-quarter net loss was $295.4 million, or $1.39 a
share, compared with net income of $70.9 million, or 33 cents, a
year earlier, St. Louis-based Arch said in a statement today.
Excluding an asset writedown and other items, the loss was 42
cents a share, missing the 14-cent average of 23 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue fell to $968.2 million from $1.23 billion a year
earlier, missing the $1.01 billion average of 15 estimates. Arch
fell 4 percent to $6.65 at 9:17 a.m. in  New York  before the
start of regular trading.  Arch sells thermal coal used to generate electricity and
metallurgical coal, a steelmaking raw material. Domestic thermal
coal demand tumbled last year amid mild weather and as prices
for natural gas, a competing fuel, dropped to the lowest in a
decade. Arch, which has now reported four straight quarterly
adjusted losses, said today its coal sales will be 133 million
to 144 million tons of coal in 2013. Volumes dropped to 141
million tons from 155 million tons.  Peabody Energy Corp. is the country’s largest coal producer
by sales, followed by Alpha Natural Resources Inc. and Consol
Energy Inc.  (Arch scheduled a conference call at 11 a.m. New York time,
