The ruble retreated for a second day
as oil traded close to a weekly low and concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will deepen curbed appetite for riskier assets.  The ruble fell 0.2 percent against the dollar by 11.30 a.m.
in Moscow to 30.1325, the lowest level in a week. The currency
gained 0.1 percent against the euro to 40.5885, leaving it
unchanged against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket
at 34.8363, 19 kopeks weaker than the level at which traders say
the regulator may intervene to curb gains.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s main export, declined 0.2 percent in
 New York  $95.95 per barrel. Data today may show retail sales in
the euro area slid in December, while the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research said the U.K. economy faces risks
of prolonged stagnation.  “Deterioration in global  market sentiment  might have a
sharp negative impact on the ruble,” VTB analysts Maxim Oreshkin and Anton Nikitin wrote in an e-mailed note.  The ruble has strengthened 0.9 percent against the dollar
this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The ruble’s retreat is temporary and part of an overdue
correction,  Denis Korshilov , head of fixed income, currencies
and commodities at Citigroup Inc., said by phone from Moscow.
The ruble may test 34.90 rubles versus the basket level before
rallying he said.  “It’s not a turnaround,” Korshilov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
