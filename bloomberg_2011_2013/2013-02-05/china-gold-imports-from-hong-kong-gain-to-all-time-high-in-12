Gold imports into mainland China from
Hong Kong surged 94 percent to an all-time high last year as
rising incomes in the world’s second-largest economy underpinned
increased demand and helped the metal to post a 12th annual gain.  Mainland China imported 834,502 kilograms (834.5 metric
tons), including scrap and coins, compared with about 431,215
kilograms in 2011, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
data from Hong Kong’s Census and Statistics Department. Imports
in December rose to a monthly record of 114,405 kilograms,
according to data from the department yesterday.  China was expected to displace India as the world’s biggest
gold consumer last year, according to a forecast in November
from the producer-funded World Gold Council. Rising consumption
in the country may help to offset concern that the metal’s bull
run may be coming to an end as the global economy recovers. Spot
gold is little changed so far this year, while the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials has risen 4.4 percent.  The increase in gold imports last year “was largely a
result of income growth,”  Jiang Shu , a senior analyst at
Industrial Bank Co. Ltd., said from Shanghai before the data was
released. “The Chinese are becoming more wealthy.”  Economic growth in China, the world’s largest gold producer,
has boosted the country’s consumption of everything from copper
to energy and farm commodities. The nation, which snapped a
seven-quarter slowdown in the final quarter of last year, is the
world’s largest base-metals user, the biggest importer of
soybeans and the top crude-oil consumer after the U.S.  All-Time High  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,670.20 an ounce at
2:44 p.m. in Singapore after losing 0.3 percent this year. The
price hit a record $1,921.15 in September 2011.  Cash bullion  of
99.99 percent purity was at 337.16 yuan a gram on the Shanghai
Gold Exchange.  Spot gold fell in January for a fourth monthly loss, and
investors’ holdings in  exchange-traded products  declined as
improving economic data from the U.S. to Europe and China
signaled that the global recovery was gaining traction. Credit
Suisse Group AG said last week that it’s increasingly probable
that the price peak in 2011 was bullion’s top.  The imports in December compared with 90,764 kilograms in
November, and were more than double the 38,650 kilograms a year
earlier, according to the data. Net imports, after deducting
flows from China to Hong Kong, were 84,687 kilograms in December,
compared with 61,787 kilograms a month earlier. China doesn’t
publish such data.  Higher Incomes  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China more than tripled
to 310,861 kilograms in 2012 from about 95,529 kilograms a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations. Shipments were
29,718 kilograms in December, up from 28,978 kilograms in
November, a separate statistics department  statement  showed.  China’s urban per capita disposable income rose 12.6
percent in nominal terms in 2012 to 24,565 yuan, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Jan. 18. Per capital rural net
income increased 13.5 percent in nominal terms, and 10.7 percent
in real terms, to 7,917 yuan, the bureau said. The economy may
expand 8.1 percent this year from 7.9 percent in 2012, according
to the median of analysts’ forecasts tracked by Bloomberg.  “We see demand continuing to be robust into 2013,” said
Wang Xiaoli, chief investment strategist at CITICS Futures Co.,
a unit of China’s biggest listed brokerage. “The economy will
recover, albeit slowly, while real interest rates will remain
low and central banks will continue to accumulate. These are all
bullish for gold.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
