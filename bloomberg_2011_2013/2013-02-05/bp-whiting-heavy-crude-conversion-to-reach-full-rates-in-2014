BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery in Indiana
won’t be able to process heavy Canadian crude at full rates
until 2014, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in the
company’s fourth-quarter earnings call.  The largest crude unit at the refinery won’t come back
online until the middle of 2013 after it was shut in November
for an upgrade to process less-expensive heavy oil, Dudley said.
The other units involved in the project -- a coker, gas oil
hydrotreater and sulfur recovery unit -- will come online in
sequence over the following six to nine months.  “We do anticipate 2014 will be the first year we get the
full benefits of it,” Dudley said.  The completion of work on the 225,000-barrel-a-day crude
unit, known as Pipestill 12, was pushed back to between June 1
and Aug. 15 from the original estimate of March, a person
familiar with operations said Dec. 14.  Canadian producers are counting on the Whiting conversion
project to help relieve a glut of crude in Alberta that
depressed prices there $42.50 below U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate on Dec. 14.  If the refinery takes six to nine months to start the coker
after the crude unit is back online, that will mean it runs more
light, sweet crude and less heavy, said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consulting
company in London.  “This is more bearish for Canadian crude,” Sen said.
“They thought they were going to be able to send their crude
down to Whiting in Q3, now it’s going to be 2014.”  Western Canada Select oil in Alberta was at $28.75 below
WTI at 12:08 p.m.  New York  time today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
