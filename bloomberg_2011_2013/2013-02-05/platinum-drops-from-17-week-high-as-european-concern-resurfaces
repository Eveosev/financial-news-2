Platinum fell from the highest level
in almost four months and palladium declined on renewed concern
that Europe’s debt crisis may curb the global economic recovery.
Gold advanced for a third day.  Platinum for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,689.25 an ounce and was at $1,694.12 by 2:39 p.m. in
 Singapore . The price reached $1,707.87 yesterday, the highest
since Oct. 9, on expectations that demand will pick up even as
supply drops on production cutbacks. Spot gold rose 0.2 percent
to $1,676.32 an ounce.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields rose to a seven-week high
yesterday, prompting a fall in global equity markets. Platinum
production will drop 2.7 percent to 5.68 million ounces this
year, the least since 2000, according to Barclays Plc, which
raised its shortage estimate sixfold last month after
Johannesburg-based Anglo American Platinum Ltd. said it plans to
idle shafts. Demand from carmakers, the biggest consumer, will
increase 0.5 percent in 2013, Barclays says.  “We haven’t heard that much about  Europe  lately, and
there’s been a shift in focus,” said Alexandra Knight, an
analyst at National Australia Bank Ltd. The problems “are re-
emerging and worrying investors a little bit,” she said.  Concern about supply sent platinum prices above gold in
January for the first time since April. Holdings in exchange-
traded products backed by platinum climbed to a record last
month. The metal has climbed 10 percent this year and palladium
has gained 6.4 percent, while gold is little changed.  Palladium dropped as much as 1.5 percent to $746.75 an
ounce and was at $749.75. The price reached $762.25 yesterday,
the highest level since September 2011.  Gold for April delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,671.20 on the Comex and was little changed at $1,676.80. Cash
bullion of 99.99 percent purity rose 0.2 percent to 337.42  yuan 
a gram ($1,682.82 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold Exchange.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $31.745
an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
