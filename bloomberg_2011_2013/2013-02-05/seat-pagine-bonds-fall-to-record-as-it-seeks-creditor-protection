Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG) ’s bonds
plunged to a record low after Italy’s largest directory
publisher said it can’t pay debt coming due this year and sought
protection from its creditors.  Seat Pagine’s 550 million euros ($746 million) of 10.5
percent senior bonds due January 2017 and redeemable by the
company next year fell 9.5 cents, or 29 percent, to 23.5 cents
as of 12:22 p.m. in London, according to Bloomberg generic
prices. The notes have lost more than 60 percent of their value
in the past three weeks.  Standard & Poor’s  cut the ratings of the Turin-based
company for the second time in a week on Feb. 1 after it missed
a coupon payment. S&P downgraded the publisher to “Selective
Default” from CC and said it may downgrade again, to D, if other
financial obligations are missed.  Seat Pagine restructured its debt in September, swapping
1.3 billion euros of junior-ranking bonds into shares and
refinancing 686 million euros of loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
