Wheat fell to a three-week low on
speculation that U.S. stockpiles are higher than the government
estimated last month.  Inventories may total 717 million bushels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. That compares with 716 million forecast
by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  in January. The agency
will update its supply and demand outlook on Feb. 8. The
government may also raise its estimate for stockpiles of corn, a
competing grain used to make  animal feed , the survey of at least
29 analysts showed.  “The traders don’t have a willingness to buy wheat,”
Dennis DeLaughter, a market analyst at grain broker Vantage RM
in Houston, said in a telephone interview. “Wheat is not a fun
market. The USDA report is going to have some impact on
prices.”  Wheat futures for March delivery slumped 0.9 percent to
$7.5625 a bushel at 10:49 a.m on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $7.5175, the lowest since Jan. 11.  Rainfall in the southern U.S. Great Plains may boost crops
and alleviate dry conditions caused by the worst drought since
the 1930s Dust Bowl era, Telvent DTN said in a report today.
Some precipitation may fall in parts of  Texas ,  Oklahoma  and
 Kansas , the biggest U.S. producer of winter wheat.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
