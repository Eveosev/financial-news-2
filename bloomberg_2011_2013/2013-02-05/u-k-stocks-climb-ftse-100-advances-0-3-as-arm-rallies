U.K. stocks climbed, rebounding from
yesterday’s biggest selloff in three months, as ARM Holdings Plc
reported sales that topped analyst estimates.  The FTSE 100 Index gained 15.9 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,262.74 at 8:19 a.m. in  London . The gauge yesterday sank 1.6
percent as Spanish and Italian bonds fell amid signs of
political uncertainty in Europe’s weakest economies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
