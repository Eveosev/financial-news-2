French President  Francois Hollande 
and German opposition leader  Peer Steinbrueck  criticized U.K.
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s proposal to hold a referendum on
European Union membership.  Cameron’s plan, announced last month, is to begin a
renegotiation of Britain’s EU membership, seeking to repatriate
unspecified powers, if he wins the 2015 general election. He
would then hold a referendum on the results by the end of 2017.  Speaking to the European Parliament today in Strasbourg,
France, Hollande said Europe cannot be reduced to a market, a
currency, or a set of rules or treaties. He ruled out each
country helping itself to European policies on an “a la carte”
basis. Steinbrueck, who heads Germany’s Social Democratic Party,
said later he agreed with that view.  “This is a very risky strategy,” he told journalists in
London after a meeting with U.K. opposition leader  Ed Miliband .
“It will cause a lot of uncertainties. It’s very important to
have a heavyweight like the U.K. in the EU.”  Hollande pleaded for a “differentiated Europe” in which
smaller groups of countries unite around specific policies. He
gave the examples of the euro, the passport-free travel zone and
a proposed financial-transaction tax -- three things Britain
isn’t taking part in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
