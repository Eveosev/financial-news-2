The owner of the iPhone trademark in
 Brazil ,  IGB Eletronica SA (IGBR3) , said it would consider selling the
naming rights to  Apple (AAPL)  Inc.  “We’re open to a dialogue for anything, anytime,” Eugenio Emilio Staub, chairman of IGB, said in an interview in Sao
Paulo, adding that the company hasn’t been contacted by Apple.
“We’re not radicals.”  IGB’s Gradiente brand filed to register the trademark in
2000 and was awarded the rights in 2008. While Apple has sold
its globally known mobile phone in Brazil for several years,
Gradiente started selling its iPhone in December.  Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported today that the
institute responsible for granting trademarks in Brazil
confirmed that the exclusive rights to the name for mobile
phones still belong to Gradiente, without saying where it got
the information. The decision, originally set to be published
today, will be announced on Feb. 13. Staub said he hasn’t been
informed of any decisions regarding the trademark.  Marcelo Chimento, the spokesman for the institute known as
INPI, in a telephone interview confirmed that a ruling had been
made, though he declined to disclose the decision. He said it’s
“difficult” to grant approval to Apple’s request to use the
trademark.  Apple spokesman Steve Dowling had no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
