Hog futures fell, heading for the
longest stretch of losses this year, on signs that U.S. pork
supplies are outpacing demand. Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale  pork  fell 1.2 percent yesterday, while spot  hogs 
slumped 2.6 percent, the biggest slide since Dec. 10, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers have processed
419,000 hogs this week, up 1.7 percent from a week earlier. Pork
inventories rose 14 percent last year, the latest government
figures show.  “We do have a lot of pork in cold storage,”  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “We still have
to work through a lot of pork, a lot of supplies.”  Hog futures for April settlement dropped 0.7 percent to
87.75 cents a pound at 9:31 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price be the third straight decline,
the longest slump since Dec. 31.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.3235 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement climbed 0.4
percent to $1.4945 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
