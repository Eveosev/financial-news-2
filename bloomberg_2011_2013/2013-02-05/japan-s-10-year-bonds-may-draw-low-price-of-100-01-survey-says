     Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) --Japan’s sale of 2.4 trillion yen ($26
billion) in 10-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted price of
100.01, according to the median forecast of 13 traders surveyed
by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.8 percent
bonds ranged from 100.00 to 100.04, according to the survey.  Four traders said 100.01, another four reported 100.02,
three said 100.00 and one each said 100.03 and 100.04.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
