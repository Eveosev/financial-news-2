Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, may produce 1.06 billion liters
(280 million gallons) of ethanol from the next sugarcane crop,
29 percent more than this season, Valor Economico SA reported.  Petrobras Biocombustivel SA expects production to increase
because it’s planted more sugar cane and better weather this
year will boost yield, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said  today ,
citing Miguel Rossetto, chief executive officer of the state-run
oil company’s biofuel arm. Brazil’s next harvest begins in
April.  The company operates nine mills in Brazil with its partners
 Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3) , Guarani SA and  Total SA (FP) , according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
