 ETH Bioenergia, the biofuels unit of
Brazilian construction company Odebrecht SA, will invest 1.3
billion reais ($653.2 million) next crop season, mostly in new
sugar-cane fields, O Estado de Sao Paulo reported.  ETH Bioenergia expects to process 26 million metric tons of
cane next harvest, 30 percent more than the present crop, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said  today , citing the company’s
president Luiz de Mendonca.  Brazil ’s sugar-cane harvest begins
in April.  The company will announce later today that it will change
its name to Odebrecht Agroindustrial, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
