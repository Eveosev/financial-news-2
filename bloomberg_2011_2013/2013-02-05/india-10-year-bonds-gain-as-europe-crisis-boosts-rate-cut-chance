India’s benchmark bonds due 2022
advanced, pushing the yield down from a one-month high, as fresh
concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen added to speculation
the central bank will cut borrowing costs again.  Spanish 10-year bond yields rose to a seven-week high
yesterday as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to impose
austerity and restore confidence amid corruption allegations.
The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered  interest rates  for the first
time since April last week and cut the amount of deposits
lenders must set aside as reserves.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.93 percent as of
10:17 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate of 7.94 percent yesterday was the highest since
Jan. 3.  “Renewed  European debt crisis  concerns would affect the
global outlook,” said Rees Kam, a strategist at SJS Markets
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based financial services company that
specializes in fixed income. “That reinforces rate-cut
expectations. Inflation has slowed quite a fair bit in India.”  Wholesale prices  rose 7.18 percent in December, the least
in three years, the government reported last month.  “There is an increasing likelihood of inflation remaining
range-bound around current levels going into 2013-2014,” the
RBI said in a statement on Jan. 29. “This provides space,
albeit limited, for monetary policy to give greater emphasis to
growth risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
