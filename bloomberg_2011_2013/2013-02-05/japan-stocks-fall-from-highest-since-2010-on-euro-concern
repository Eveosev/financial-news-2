Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average retreating from its highest in 32 months, as
Hitachi Ltd. and Fujikura Ltd. cut their forecasts and concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis deepened.  Hitachi, a maker of electronics and machinery, declined 6.4
percent, while cable-manufacturer Fujikura tumbled 7.3 percent.
 Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a producer of imaging equipment
that gets 28 percent of its sales in Europe, dropped 3.1
percent.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202)  led gains on the Nikkei 225
after  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  recommended the shares.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  slid 1.2 percent before posting earnings at the
close.  The Nikkei 225 lost 1.9 percent to 11,046.92 in Tokyo after
yesterday closing at its highest since April 15, 2010. Volume
was about 65 percent above the 30-day average for the time of a
day. The broader Topix Index fell 1.7 percent to 939.70, with
about four stocks dropping for each that gained.  “Investors are using the European issue as an excuse to
adjust their positions,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s third-largest bank by market value. “Investors are also
paying attention to factors for individual stocks.”  The Topix has surged 30 percent since Nov. 14, when
national elections were announced on optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s new government will take steps to fight deflation.
The gauge is trading at 1.11 times  book value , compared with
2.07 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.47 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Of the 159 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 61 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 52
percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Lower Expectations  Hitachi (6501)  dropped 6.4 percent to 531 yen. The company trimmed
its net-income forecast after missing estimates for third-
quarter operating profit. Fujikura slid 7.3 percent to 266 yen
after cutting its profit projection to zero for the fiscal year
from an earlier outlook of a 2 billion yen gain.  Toyota fell 1.2 percent to 4,540 yen. After the close, the
world’s biggest carmaker raised its profit forecast as the
falling yen boosted the value of overseas sales.  Japan Airlines Co. jumped 5.1 percent to 4,010 yen, the
most since the carrier re-listed in 2012, after forecasting
profit that beat analysts’ estimates. JAL said demand for travel
to Europe and the U.S. outweighed the grounding of its Boeing
Co. 787s amid safety concerns.  European Woes  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent today. The gauge
fell 1.2 percent yesterday, while the Stoxx Europe 600 slid 1.5
percent. Spanish Premier  Mariano Rajoy  is facing calls to resign
amid contested reports about illegal payments, and  Italy ’s
Silvio Berlusconi narrowed the front-runner’s lead before
elections this month.  “European nations are working on fiscal rehabilitation,
but concerns will mount about debt reduction measures if their
political leaderships get shaky,” said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Konica Minolta  dropped 3.1 percent to 722 yen. Shimano
Inc., a maker of bicycle parts that depends on Europe for 36
percent of its sales, fell 1.8 percent to 6,090 yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass jumped 18 percent to 118 yen after Daiwa
upgraded its rating to buy, saying restructuring benefits are
appearing gradually.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index added 1.3 percent
to 23.96, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.9 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
