NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
mobile-phone service in  Latin America  under the Nextel brand,
dropped the most in almost three months after forecasting 2013
sales that fall short of analysts’ estimates.  Revenue will reach $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion this year,
Reston, Virginia-based NII said in a statement. That compares
with the $6.1 billion average estimate of 13 analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  NII is struggling to hold on to subscribers as it converts
its network to newer technology to better compete with America
Movil SAB and  Telefonica SA. (TEF)  The Nextel carrier said its
customer base expanded 6 percent in 2012 for a total of 11.4
million, The number will expand this year by a “mid-single
digit” percentage, NII said.  NII  fell  8.6 percent to $5.83 at the close in  New York , the
largest decline since Nov. 13. The shares have dropped 18
percent this year, compared to a 6.2 percent gain for the
Russell 1,000 Index.  The company also announced plans to sell $400 million in
bonds due 2019, saying it would use the funding for purposes
including network upgrades, acquisitions, capital investments or
refinancing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
