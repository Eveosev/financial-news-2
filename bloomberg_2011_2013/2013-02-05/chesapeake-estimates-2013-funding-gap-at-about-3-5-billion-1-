Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the U.S.
natural gas producer that asked its chief executive officer to
resign last week, estimated its spending commitments will exceed
 cash flow  by about $3.5 billion this year.  Chesapeake plans to sell oilfields, gas-processing plants
and other assets to cover the funding gap and repay debt,
Jeffrey Mobley, vice president of  investor relations , said
during a presentation at a Credit Suisse Group AG conference
today.  CEO Aubrey McClendon agreed on Jan. 29 to step down by
April 1 from the company he co-founded 23 years ago after
slumping gas prices erased profits, worsened Chesapeake’s debt
load and triggered job cuts and asset sales. The company’s $13.6
billion market value is less than half its $35.6 billion peak
from 2008 and a fraction of the $100 billion estimate that
McClendon pegged as its true value during a March interview.  The Oklahoma City-based company expects to announce
transactions involving holdings in the Mississippi Lime
formation in Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as the Eagle Ford
Shale in Texas, early this year, Mobley said.  He declined to estimate the potential value of those
pending deals and said the company will be “less proscriptive”
about asset values in the future.  Chesapeake rose 2.1 percent to $20.54 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
