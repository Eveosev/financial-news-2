Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards dropped,
snapping a five-day advance, as some investors judged recent
gains excessive.  Agreements to buy the currency in 30 days reached a two-
month high of 9,660 per dollar yesterday, 0.1 percent more
expensive than the spot price, which closed at 9,671, prices
from local banks show. The rupiah’s implied volatility, which
measures expected exchange-rate swings used to price options,
was steady at 6.5 percent for a second day.  Government bonds 
were little changed before a report today that may show economic
growth exceeded 6 percent for a ninth quarter.  “This is an expected brief correction after the forwards
rose considerably,” said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at
PT Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “The rupiah has stabilized and
it will start to show a strengthening trend. We expect it to
slowly head toward 9,500, possibly in this quarter.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.2 percent to
9,700 per dollar as of 8:54 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The spot rate declined 0.3 percent to 9,699,
according to prices from local banks.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,679 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .
Today’s rate will be published at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
was little changed at 5.27 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show.  The economy expanded 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
from 6.17 percent in the previous period, according to the
median estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before data
due at 11:00 a.m. in Jakarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
