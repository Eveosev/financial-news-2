India’s service industries expanded
at the fastest pace in a year in January, a private survey
showed, after the government overhauled policies to revive
economic growth.  The purchasing managers’ index rose to 57.5 from 55.6 in
December, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in a
statement today. A number above 50 indicates growth. Services
account for about 57 percent of gross domestic product,  Finance
Ministry  data shows.  The government has opened India’s economy to more foreign
investment since September, stepped up efforts to curb fiscal
and trade gaps and tried to speed up road, rail and port
projects. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  aims to bolster the
weakest economic expansion in a decade, a slowdown that led to a
central bank  interest-rate cut  last month.  “A pick up in services needs to be backed up by a lift in
industry and there is no indication of that as of now,”
 Dharmakirti Joshi , chief economist at Crisil Ltd., said before
the release. “Inflation pressure is still there and it is
something to watch out for.”  Indian GDP my climb as little as 5.7 percent in the year
through March 2013, the least since 2002-2003, according to the
Finance Ministry.  Inflation eased to a three-year low of 7.18 percent in
December, while remaining the fastest in the BRIC group of major
emerging nations that also includes Brazil, Russia and China.
The  Reserve Bank  of India cut the repurchase rate to 7.75
percent from 8 percent on Jan. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
