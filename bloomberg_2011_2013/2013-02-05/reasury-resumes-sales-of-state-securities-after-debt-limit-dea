The U.S. Treasury Department said it
is resuming the sales of state and local government series
Treasury securities today, after President  Barack Obama  signed
legislation temporarily suspending the debt limit.  The Treasury had stopped selling the state securities on
Dec. 28 as the U.S. approached the debt ceiling, the department
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
