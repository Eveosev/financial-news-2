Coffee exports from India, Asia’s
third-biggest supplier, may decline for a second straight year
as an economic slowdown in Europe cuts demand and as damage from
pest attacks reduces the harvest.  Shipments may drop below 300,000 metric tons this year from
310,886 tons in 2012,  Ramesh Rajah , president of the Coffee
Exporters Association of India, said by phone from Bangalore.
Exports fell 9.4 percent last year, the first annual drop in
three years, according to data from the  Coffee Board of India .  A drop in Indian supplies may help limit a 39 percent slump
in arabica prices in the past year in New York and cut costs for
Starbucks Corp. and Nestle SA.  Stockpiles  monitored by ICE
Futures U.S. reached 2.63 million bags of 60 kilograms each on
Feb. 1, the highest since March 2010. Slowdowns in Italy, Russia
and Spain, India’s main buyers, curbed demand for the commodity
brewed by specialty coffee makers.  “The order book is thinner this year because the economies
of the main markets aren’t faring well and buyers are
aggressively searching for cheaper coffee,” Rajah said.
“Arabica exports from India will be lower as prices have come
down sharply and shippers don’t want to sell at these prices.”  The euro-area economy shrank 0.1 percent in the third
quarter after a 0.2 percent  contraction  in the three previous
months. Gross domestic product probably fell another 0.4 percent
from October to December and will stagnate in the first quarter
of 2013, according to a Bloomberg survey. Europe accounted for
38.3 percent of the global green coffee consumption in 2012,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Pest Attacks  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks. Robusta beans, used in
instant coffee, are harvested in Asia and parts of Africa. India
produces both the varieties.  Arabica for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1.4365 a
pound in New York at 4:51 p.m. in Mumbai, while robusta for
delivery in the same month was little changed at $2,065 a ton in
London.  The coffee crop in India may decline this year because of
pest attacks caused by dry weather during the flowering period
and rains during the harvest, Rajah said. Output may drop to
310,000 tons in the year started Oct. 1 from a record of 314,000
tons a year earlier, he said.  “The weather was very unusual last year,” he said. “Late
rains has led to the delay in arrival of the new crop by three-
four weeks and the crop is just coming into the market.”  Pest attacks like the white stem borer due to dry weather
after blossoming reduced productivity, he said.  India shipped 21,557 tons of coffee in January, comprising
of 6,689 tons of arabica, 6,257 tons of robusta beans and 8,611
tons of instant coffee, data from the board showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
