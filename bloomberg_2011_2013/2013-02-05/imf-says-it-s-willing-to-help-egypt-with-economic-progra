The International Monetary Fund said
it’s willing to provide aid to Egypt to support a program that
“addresses the current economic and financial challenges” and
will discuss a possible mission to Cairo.  “We understand that the Egyptian authorities are still
working on revising their economic program,” IMF spokeswoman
Wafa Amr said in an e-mail today. “Once we receive the
authorities’ updated economic program, we will discuss with the
authorities the timing of a possible mission to Cairo.”  The IMF “remains committed to support Egypt and its
people,” Amr said. “We are willing to provide financial
assistance for an economic program that addresses the current
economic and financial challenges, is socially balanced, and has
broad ownership so that it can be implemented by the
government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
