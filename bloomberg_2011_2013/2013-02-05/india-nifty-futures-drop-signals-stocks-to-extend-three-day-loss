Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped for the fourth
day amid renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis. Consumer
goods companies and industrials led the decline.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.5 percent
to 19,659.82 at the close in Mumbai.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , India’s biggest
cigarette maker, and  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the
world’s largest oil-refining complex, were the biggest drag on
the gauge.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped
1.6 percent.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the largest power-
equipment maker, fell for the third day.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 1.4 percent amid renewed
concern about the European crisis as rates on Spanish and
Italian debt rose. The European Union took in 17.2 percent of
India’s exports in the six months ended September 2011, making
it India’s top trading partner, data from the government show.
The Sensex rose to a two-year high of 20,103.53 on Jan. 25.  “Some investors are taking money off the table in the hope
they can buy later at a better price, and the news from  Europe 
helped them,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Investments &
Advisors Ltd., which has about $100 million in assets, said by
phone from  New Delhi . “The next big trigger is the Union
Budget, which will give investors a road map of how the
government plans to finance the fiscal deficit.”  The Sensex has climbed 1.2 percent in 2013, extending last
year’s 26 percent advance, as foreign funds bought shares amid
government efforts to reduce subsidies, allow higher foreign
investment in retailing and aviation, and hasten infrastructure
projects to revive  economic growth  and improve public finances.
Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings reduced their outlooks on
India’s rating, currently at the lowest investment-grade level,
to negative in 2012 and said the large fiscal deficits and debt
are constraining ratings.  FMCG Index  ITC dropped 1.6 percent to 302.45 rupees, a second day of
losses.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , India’s biggest home-products
maker, declined 1.2 percent to 461.5 rupees. The BSE India Fast
Moving Consumer Goods Index dropped for a second day, losing 1
percent. The 10-member gauge surged 47 percent last year.  Reliance slid 1.4 percent to 874.75 rupees. Tata Motors,
the best performing stock on the Sensex last year, slid 1.6
percent to 287.2 rupees. Bharat Heavy plunged 2.6 percent to
211.4 rupees.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest
copper and zinc producer, lost 1.9 percent to 107.7 rupees.  The  BSE Capital Goods Index (BSETCG)  fell for the seventh day.  Volumes on the Sensex were 8 percent less than the 30-day
average today. The  S&P CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock
Exchange of  India  slid 0.5 percent to 5,956.90. Its February
futures settled at 5,974.90. India VIX, which gauges the cost
protection against losses in the Nifty, added 1.9 percent.  Taiwan, Indonesia  Overseas investors have bought $4.58 billion of domestic
shares this year, a record for the period. They  bought  $24.5
billion in 2012, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, helping the Sensex to its biggest  annual gain  since
2009 last year.  China, Indonesia and Taiwan may receive more inflows than
India this year, Herald van der Linde, head of equity strategy
for Asia Pacific at HSBC Global Research, said in Mumbai today.
Foreigners have bought a net $793 million of Indonesian stocks
in 2013 and plowed a net $1.32 billion into Taiwan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, which excludes China.  “Equity mutual funds are overweight on Indian equities and
underweight on China, Taiwan and Indonesia,” Linde said.
“Those countries will see larger inflow. We won’t see outflows
from India but it may not benefit as much as these countries.”  Indian stocks are the “most overbought” among  emerging
markets  in Asia, with cumulative net overseas buying at 1.7
percent of market value, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note
yesterday. Emerging Asia does not appear to be overbought by
foreign investors because of the $1.8 billion of outflows in
 South Korea , according to the report.  The Sensex trades at 13.6 times  estimated earnings  for the
year ending in March 2014, the highest level since February
2012. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at 11 times,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
