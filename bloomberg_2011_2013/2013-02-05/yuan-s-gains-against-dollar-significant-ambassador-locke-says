The  yuan  has “appreciated
significantly” against the dollar in the past several years and
the U.S. wants continued, faster gains, U.S. Ambassador to China
Gary Locke said.  Because China’s inflation rate is higher than in the U.S.,
there has been “significant movement of the currency,” Locke
said today in Hong Kong in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “Of course we in America would like it to continue
to appreciate and much faster.”  The value of the yuan has been a sore spot in ties between
the world’s two biggest economies for years. While members of
the  U.S. Congress  have accused China of deliberately suppressing
the yuan’s value at a cost to American jobs,  President  Barack Obama ’s administration in November declined to label the country
a currency manipulator.  The yuan has gained about 9.6 percent in nominal terms
since People’s Bank of China removed the currency from a two-
year-old peg to the dollar in June 2010. With higher inflation
in China, the real gains have been larger.  Locke said China and the U.S. are committed to closer ties
and he sees the relationship “getting stronger than ever
before.”  “Both sides are committed to even closer collaboration and
partnership,” he said.  On cybersecurity, Locke said the U.S. is “engaging with
the Chinese on this at very, very high levels.” His comments
followed reports last week that the  New York  Times and the Wall
Street Journal had been victims of hacking attacks originating
in China.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
