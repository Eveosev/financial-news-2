Rubber fell from a 10-month high as
renewed concern about European debt crisis pushed global stocks
lower and rallied the yen, reducing investor appetite for the
commodity used to make tires.  The contract for delivery in July dropped as much as 1.5
percent to 328.3 yen a kilogram ($3,553 a metric ton) before
trading at 329.5 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 12:04
p.m. local time. It closed at 333.3 yen yesterday, the highest
settlement price for the most-active contract since March 28.  Spanish 10-year yields are at a seven-week high as the
nation’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to impose
austerity and restore confidence amid calls to resign on
corruption allegations. Rates on Italian debt rose as polls
showed  Silvio Berlusconi  had closed the gap on his rival before
elections this month even as he appeals a four-year prison
sentence for  tax fraud .  “Political turmoil in Spain and Italy caused  risk
aversion ,” Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company
Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo, said in an e-mail today.  The yen advanced to 92.42 per dollar, cutting the appeal of
yen-denominated contracts, as European concerns boosted investor
demand for haven. It dropped to 93.18 per dollar yesterday, the
lowest level since May 2010.  Losses in futures were limited on speculation that China,
the world’s largest consumer, may step up purchases before the
Lunar New Year holiday next week, Niimura said.  Rubber for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to 26,890  yuan 
($4,312) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board gained 2.1 percent to 98.90 baht ($3.32) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the country’s Rubber Research
Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
