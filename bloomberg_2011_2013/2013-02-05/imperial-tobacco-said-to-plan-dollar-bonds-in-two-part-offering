Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) , the maker
of West and Davidoff cigarettes, issued $2.25 billion of bonds
in its first long-term, dollar-denominated debt sale since 1999.  The company’s $1.25 billion of 2.05 percent, five-year debt
yields 120 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $1 billion of 3.5 percent, 10-year securities has a relative
yield of 150 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The bonds are its first benchmark issue, typically at least
$500 million, in the U.S. since it sold $600 million of 7.125
percent, 10-year debt that matured in April 2009, Bloomberg data
show.  Proceeds will be used for working capital, share
repurchases and to refinance, repay or repurchase debt, as well
as for general corporate purposes, according to a person
familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley managed today’s offering for the Bristol,
England-based company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
