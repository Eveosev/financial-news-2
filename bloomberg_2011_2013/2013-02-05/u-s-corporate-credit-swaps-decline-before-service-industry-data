A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell before data that may show the service industry in the U.S.
grew in January and a day after the measure rose the most in
five weeks.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.2
basis points to a mid-price of 89 basis points at 8:08 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge
increased 4.1 basis points yesterday, the most since Dec. 28.  An expanding services segment, which is the biggest part of
the economy, may ease investor concern that companies’ ability
to repay debt will be hampered. The Institute for Supply
Management’s  non-manufacturing index  is estimated to follow
December’s 55.7 reading, the highest level in 10 months,
according to the median forecast of 76 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The data will be released at 10 a.m. in New York.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
