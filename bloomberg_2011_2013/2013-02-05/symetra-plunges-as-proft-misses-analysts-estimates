Symetra Financial Corp. (SYA) , the insurer
that counts  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  among its
largest  shareholders , declined the most since 2011 after fourth-
quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Symetra dropped 9.1 percent to $12.43 at 12:41 p.m. in New
York. The Bellevue, Washington-based company had advanced about
37 percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  Net income fell to $31 million, or 22 cents a share, from
$73.7 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, as claims costs
climbed at the benefits and individual-life segments, the
company said in statement yesterday. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was 24 cents a share, compared
with the 34-cent average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “Fourth-quarter operating earnings are well below our
expectations,” Sandler O’Neil & Partners LP analysts led by
Edward Shields said in a note. Shields has a hold rating on the
company.  Berkshire and  White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. (WTM)  are the
two top Symetra shareholders, and each company has a stake of
about 15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
