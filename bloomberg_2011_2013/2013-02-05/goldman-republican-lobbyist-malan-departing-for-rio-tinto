A senior Republican lobbyist at
 Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc. is leaving the bank for a job with  Rio
Tinto  Group, the world’s second biggest mining company.  Todd Malan, 46, will be vice president of external affairs
for the U.S. and  South America  at the mining company. He will
handle regulatory and legislative issues, and work with
institutions like the World Bank and the International Finance
Corp.  Malan joined Goldman Sachs in 2008 as the bank, long known
as a breeding ground for Treasury secretaries and top White
House aides, became a symbol of Wall Street greed during the
subprime loan meltdown. He was part of a new lobbying team
brought in to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis.  Along with running Goldman Sachs’s Political Action
Committee, Malan lobbied on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that
overhauled U.S. financial regulation. He also worked on the
bank’s defense of subprime loan investigations by the Senate
 Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations and the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC case in July
2010 for $550 million.  At London-based Rio, one of Malan’s first tasks will be
helping the company in  Washington  as it seeks to protect an
estimated $14 billion investment in a Mongolian  copper mine  that
has come under fire from the government there.  Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said Malan
“was an invaluable part of our D.C. team and will be a terrific
asset for Rio.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
