Individual investors bought shares of
less volatile companies and took protective measures by hedging
their holdings last month as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
reached a five-year high,  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  said.  “We’re seeing a step back here,”  Steve Quirk , senior vice
president of TD Ameritrade’s trader group, said yesterday by
telephone. “Some of our clients are saying, ‘I’ve had some
pretty nice appreciation in my portfolio. I’m going to wind it
down a bit here.’ We love to see that. That means they’re being
prudent in their judgment.”  A gauge of investor sentiment compiled by the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company showed bullishness among individual
investors declined. The Investor Movement Index, a  gauge  that
tracks sentiment by analyzing trading from a sample of the
firm’s six million retail client accounts, fell to 4.71 last
month from 4.94 in December, based on a Feb. 4 statement from
the online brokerage. That is still higher than the average
since January 2010 of 4.56.  Investors poured money into equities last month as the  S&P
500  capped its best January since 1997 after companies posted
better-than-estimated profits and lawmakers reached a budget
compromise. About $16.1 billion went into domestic equity mutual
funds in the three weeks through Jan. 23,  data  from Investment
Company Institute show. That’s after investors pulled more than
$600 billion from U.S. funds since 2007, Washington-based ICI
data show.  Ameritrade’s measure of investor sentiment has climbed 37
percent since the beginning of 2012. When the gauge hit a record
of 5.56 in June 2011, the S&P 500 dropped as much as 19 percent
from July through October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
