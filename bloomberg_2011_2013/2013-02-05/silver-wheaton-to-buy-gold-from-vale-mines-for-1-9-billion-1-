Silver Wheaton Corp. , which resells
precious metals bought from mining companies, agreed to acquire
gold mined by Vale SA in Brazil and Canada for $1.9 billion in
cash and 10 million share warrants.  Silver Wheaton will buy gold equal to 25 percent of the
life-of-mine gold production of Vale’s Salobo project in Brazil,
Vancouver-based Silver Wheaton said in a statement today. It
will also get 70 percent of the gold output from mines in
Sudbury, Ontario, over 20 years.  Silver Wheaton typically offers upfront payments to help
mining companies fund their projects in exchange for a discount
on the silver and gold output that it buys. Chief Executive
Officer  Randy Smallwood  said Jan. 30 that some of the world’s
largest miners have become more interested in the financing that
his company has to offer.  “While we have traditionally focused on silver, we have
never been averse to strategically adding ‘the right’ gold
streams to our portfolio,” Smallwood said in today’s statement.  The warrants have a $65 strike price and a term of 10
years. Silver Wheaton said Scotiabank and BMO Capital Markets
will arrange and underwrite two new credit facilities worth a
combined $2.5 billion to replace an existing $400 million
facility. The new facilities and the company’s cash on hand will
fund the Vale deal, it said.  The deal increases Silver Wheaton’s gold production by
110,000 ounces annually for the next 20 years, the company said.
It will also boost gold’s share of Silver Wheaton’s revenue to
25 percent during the next five years from 12 percent now.  Silver Wheaton will produce 33.5 million ounces of silver
equivalent in 2013 including 145,000 ounces of gold, rising to
53 million silver equivalent ounces in 2017, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
