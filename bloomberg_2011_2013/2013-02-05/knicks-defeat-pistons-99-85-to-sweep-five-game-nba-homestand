The  New York Knicks  rolled to a 99-85

five-game National Basketball Association homestand.  Carmelo Anthony scored 27 points for the Knicks, while

the road.  Amar’e Stoudemire added 20 points for the Knicks, whose
victory followed home wins against Sacramento, Milwaukee,
Orlando and Atlanta. New York, which leads the Eastern
Conference’s  Atlantic Division , next plays tomorrow at
Washington and then Feb. 8 at the Minnesota Timberwolves.  The Miami Heat (31-14) stayed a half-game ahead of the
Knicks for the best record in the East by beating the Charlotte
Bobcats 99-94. LeBron James hit 13 of his 14 shot attempts in
scoring 31 points, along with eight rebounds and eight assists.  The Indiana Pacers topped Chicago 111-101 to tie the Bulls
atop the Eastern Conference’s Central Division with 29-19
records.  Also yesterday, the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Dallas
Mavericks 112-91 and the Washington Wizards rolled to a 98-90
