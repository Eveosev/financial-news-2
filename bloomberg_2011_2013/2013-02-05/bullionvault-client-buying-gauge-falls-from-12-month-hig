BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index showed client purchases slowed in January
from a 12-month high.  The gauge fell to 54.9 from 58.3 in December, the London-
based company said today in an e-mailed report. A reading above
50 means more buyers than sellers. Gold slipped 0.7 percent in
January, a fourth straight monthly drop and the worst run since
May. It traded at $1,674.45 an ounce by 7:31 a.m. in London.  Prices gained for a 12th successive year in 2012, the
longest winning streak in at least nine decades, as central
banks from the U.S. to  China  pledged more steps to boost
economic growth. Global equities reached a 20-month high in
January on mounting confidence a recovery is accelerating.
Investors own a near-record 2,614.8 metric tons of gold through
 exchange-traded products , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Independent investors are giving only half a cheer to the
flood of conflicting economic data,” Adrian Ash, head of
research at BullionVault, said in the report. “Savers’ anxiety
levels have eased. But the need for long-term crisis insurance
remains clear and present.”  BullionVault’s customers own about 1.12 billion pounds
($1.76 billion) of gold, the company said. The metal is stored
in vaults in London, Zurich and  New York .  To contact the reporter for this story:
