Romaniaâ€™s Supreme Defense Council
approved today a plan to sell a majority stake in rail freight
company CFR Marfa SA,  Mediafax  reported, citing Finance Minister
Daniel Chitoiu.  Romania plans to auction off CFR Marfa to a strategic
investor by mid-June to meet pledges to the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union, Chitoiu said, according to
the newswire.  Investors interested in acquiring the stake will have to
pay a deposit of 10 million euros ($14 million) to participate
in the auction, Mediafax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
