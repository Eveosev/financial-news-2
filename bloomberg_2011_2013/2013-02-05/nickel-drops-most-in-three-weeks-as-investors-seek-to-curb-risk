Nickel fell in  London  for the first
time in three sessions on signs that the highest inventories
since 2010 will leave ample supplies, as mining projects boost
production of the metal used to make stainless steel.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
climbed 7.8 percent this year, signaling demand is lagging
behind output. Inventories reached 150,906 metric tons
yesterday, the highest since April 2010. Rising demand from
 China , which produces about 44 percent of the world’s stainless
steel, won’t be enough to lift prices, Commerzbank AG said.  “Supply will no doubt easily keep pace with demand, as a
number of major mining projects are currently being
commissioned,” analysts including  Daniel Briesemann  at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt said in a report today. “We therefore
see limited scope for the price of nickel to rise,”  Nickel for delivery in three months declined 0.1 percent to
settle at $18,700 a metric ton at 6:59 p.m. in London. In the
past 12 months, prices are down 12 percent, the most among six
metals tracked by the exchange’s LMEX Index.  Zinc also fell in London, while tin and lead advanced.
Aluminum was little changed.  In New York, copper futures for March delivery gained less
than 0.1 percent to close at $3.77 a pound on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
