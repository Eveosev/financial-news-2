An Armenian presidential candidate
who was wounded in a shooting last week won’t seek to postpone
elections scheduled for Feb. 18.  Paruyr Hayrikyan, who had bullet fragments removed from his
right shoulder after the incident on Jan. 31, has decided to
continue campaigning, his lawyer, Levon Baghdasaryan, told a new
conference today. He has the right to request a two-week delay
under  Armenia ’s constitution.  Hayrikyan, 63, is one of eight candidates running for the
presidency in the sixth elections since the former Soviet
republic’s independence in 1991. He had 4 percent backing,
according to a Gallup International Association poll of 1,020
people last week that had a 3.1 percentage points margin of
error. President Serzh Sargsyan is poised to win the vote with
66 percent support.  Armenia’s National Security Service is investigating the
attempt on Hayrikyan’s life.  To contact the reporter on this story:
