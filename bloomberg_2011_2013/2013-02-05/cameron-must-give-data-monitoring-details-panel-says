U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
must give more details of his government’s plans to monitor
phone calls and e-mail traffic to convince voters the powers are
necessary, a panel of lawmakers said.  Police and intelligence agencies have been seeking powers
to collect information showing the time, location and duration
of a mobile-phone call or the existence of an e-mail. Civil-
liberties campaigners say the proposals are too intrusive,
putting ordinary people at risk of being spied upon.  Parliament’s cross-party  Intelligence and Security
Committee , which is examining the government’s Draft
Communications Bill, said in a report published in  London  today
that it recognizes how vital intelligence agencies find access
to data.  “Nevertheless, we consider that the government needs to
give more details on its proposals if the public and Parliament
are to be convinced of the necessity of the bill,” the
lawmakers said in the report.  Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg , the leader of Cameron’s
Liberal Democrat coalition partners, has also called on the
premier and Home Secretary Theresa May to reconsider the plans,
saying the concerns over civil liberties mean a “fundamental
rethink” is needed.  Clegg’s intervention last year set up another possible
clash within a coalition that’s grown increasingly strained
since coming to power in May 2010. The Liberal Democrats and
Cameron’s Conservatives have been at odds over press regulation,
taxation, electoral reform and relations with the European
Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
