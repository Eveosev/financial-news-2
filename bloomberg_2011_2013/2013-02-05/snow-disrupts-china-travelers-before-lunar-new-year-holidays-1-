Snow and rain in eastern  China 
blocked highway traffic today, leading to more road accidents as
people returned to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year
holidays next week.  Highway traffic in Shandong was “paralyzed” due to snow
as more than one hundred toll gates in the province were closed
as of 1:35 p.m. today, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
on its microblog. In  Henan province , seven people died and 46
were injured in three traffic accidents, Xinhua said separately.  The 2012 Lunar New Year period generated more than 3
billion passenger trips in China, Xinhua reported last year. As
rain, snow and fog increases, people on the roads should be more
cautious amid the peak traffic period before the holidays, the
China Meteorological Administration said today.  Central and eastern China will continue to be covered by
rain and snow tomorrow as another cold front arrives, leading to
a drop in temperature, the meteorological bureau said in an e-
mail today.  Twelve people died when a coach designed for 19 passengers
and carrying 34 overturned and crashed in Guizhou province in
the southwest yesterday, Xinhua said. Authorities canceled or
planned alternate routes for 13 coach lines today, mainly those
leaving Beijing via mountain roads, Xinhua said separately.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
