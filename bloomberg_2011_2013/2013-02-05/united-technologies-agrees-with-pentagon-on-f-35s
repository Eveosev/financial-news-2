United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  and the
Pentagon have reached an “agreement in principle” for the
company to produce the next batch of engines for the F-35
fighter, the Defense Department’s largest weapons program.  The company’s Pratt & Whitney unit will supply 32 engines,
spare parts and engineering support for the fifth lot of the
Joint Strike Fighter made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , according to
a Pentagon statement.  The Pentagon didn’t announce a value for the contract. The
Pentagon estimates that engine work on the F-35 is valued at
about $63.8 billion of the $395.7 billion research and
acquisition program for the fighter.  “Reaching this agreement is fair and beneficial to the
government and Pratt & Whitney,” said Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon’s F-35 program executive officer.  “Engine
prices have decreased, and I appreciate everyone’s commitment to
drive cost out of the program.”  Matthew Bates, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said in an
e-mailed statement that “we offered significant cost reduction
over” the fourth production contract, and “we leaned forward
to assume 100 percent risk for any cost overruns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
