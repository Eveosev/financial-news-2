Egypt ’s top religious officials
rejected what they described as Iranian attempts to extend the
reach of Shiite Islam into Sunni nations, and voiced objections
over perceived insults to the descendants of the  Prophet
Muhammad .  The exchange, aired during a visit by Iranian President
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  to al-Azhar, the Sunni world’s pre-eminent
religious institution, underscored the divide between Shiite
Iran and Sunni Egypt -- two nations whose ideological rifts
precede the political tensions that Ahmadinejad’s visit is
partly aimed at bridging.  Ahmadinejad, in a televised press conference, said he hoped
the trip marked a new start in the relations between Egypt and
Iran. Minutes later, he was frowning as an adviser to the head
of al-Azhar briefed reporters on the discussion. Grand Sheikh
Ahmed el-Tayeb reportedly asked Ahmadinejad to issue religious
edicts criminalizing insults to the prophet’s wife and his
immediate successors, who have factored prominently in
centuries-old rifts between Shiites and Sunnis.  He also stressed the need to not interfere in the internal
affairs of Bahrain, whose king is a Sunni ruling over a Shiite
majority, according to an e-mailed statement from the
institution.  Ahmadinejad’s arrival in Cairo marked the first visit by an
Iranian president to Egypt since the 1979 revolution in  Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
