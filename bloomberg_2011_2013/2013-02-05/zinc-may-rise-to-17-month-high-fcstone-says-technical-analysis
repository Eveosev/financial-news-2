Zinc may rise to the highest since
September 2011 if prices are able to break out of a so-called
double-top formation, according to technical analysis by INTL
FCStone Inc.  The attached chart shows the pattern, comprising the Jan. 3
high of $2,187.25 a metric ton and yesterday’s one-year peak of
$2,190. While a double-top formation is usually a bearish
indicator, if prices close above the Jan. 3 high for at least
two days, it would break the trend, said  Edward Meir , an analyst
at INTL FCStone in  New York .  “There does seem to be a double-top formation on the
charts at $2,187, but if prices manage to clear it, we could
have a breakout on our hands,” Meir said in a report yesterday.
Prices may climb to $2,280 by the end of the month, he said.  A double top consists of two well-defined peaks with a
moderate valley in between.  Zinc for delivery in three months climbed 0.4 percent
yesterday to $2,185 on the LME. Prices rose 3.1 percent in
January, a third straight gain, as global inventories declined.
The metal is used in stainless steel.  “Supplies are tightening up a bit, and metals in general
are holding up pretty well,” Meir said in a telephone
interview.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
