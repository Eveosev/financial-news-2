Taiwan’s financial regulator said it
has  approved  Chinatrust Commercial Bank to sell the first yuan-
denominated bonds on the island, which is seeking to become an
offshore hub for the currency.  The planned sale by the lender, Taiwan’s biggest credit-
card issuer and a unit of  Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. (2891) ,
would raise the equivalent of NT$5 billion ($169 million) and is
pending central bank approval. The bonds are expected to be sold
after the Lunar New Year holiday, which ends Feb. 17, Jean Chiu,
deputy director general of the Financial Supervisory
Commission’s banking bureau said at a press conference today in
Taipei. The maturity of the debt would be two to five years.  Issuance of yuan notes in Taiwan, dubbed Formosa bonds by
the commission, follows an August agreement with China that
paved the way for clearing of the currency on the island and
interbank trading. Taiwan’s central bank announced today 45
lenders have opened accounts with the Bank of China’s Taipei
office and that  yuan  may be deposited at the island’s lenders
from tomorrow.  Taipei-based Mega International Commercial Bank Co. has
plans to apply for a yuan  bond issue  in Taiwan, the FSC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
