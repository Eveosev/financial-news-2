Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH) , the auto-parts
maker, reached its highest closing price in a week after
reporting fourth-quarter results that exceeded estimates.  Delphi  gained  1.4 percent to $39.34 in New York, the
highest closing price since Jan. 29. Delphi has increased 2.8
percent this year after rising 78 percent last year.  The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  increased 13 percent in 2012.  Excluding some restructuring and acquisition costs, Delphi
said in a statement it had a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a
share, exceeding the 87-cent average of 14 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Delphi reported quarterly net income of
$136 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $290 million, or 88
cents, a year earlier.  Delphi is cutting jobs and closing plants, primarily in
 Europe . The Troy, Michigan-based company said restructuring
costs will now total about $300 million from $250 million
previously. About 75 percent of the expenses are in Europe. The
company said it recorded about $170 million in such expenses in
the fourth quarter, with most of the rest to occur this year.  “Maintaining and improving our lean operating structure is
of paramount importance to us,” Chief Executive Officer Rodney O’Neal said in the statement.  Europe, a large market for Delphi, is mired in its worst
sales slowdown in 19 years. Automakers including  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  have announced plans to close plants to
curb losses on the continent. Revenue for the quarter fell 3.4
percent to $3.77 billion, because of lower vehicle production in
Europe. That matched the average of 11 estimates.  The company, in slides for an conference call, today
forecast 2013 per-share adjusted profit of $4.12 to $4.38.  Delphi, registered in Gillingham, U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
