Attempts by central banks to
support their economies with record-low  interest rates  may push
institutions like pension funds to make riskier investments, an
International Monetary Fund official said today.  “It is a concern,” said Laura Kodres, an assistant
director in the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department,
told reporters in Washington today. “The low interest rates
environment has a lot of other effects besides lowering interest
rates to consumers.”  Central banks from the U.S. to the euro area have cut
benchmark interest rates below 1 percent, leaving  JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 
& Co.’s average rate for developed nations at 0.52 percent.
Economists at the New York-based bank predict it will reach 0.34
percent by the end of the year.  “Widespread evidence suggests that a prolonged period of
low short-term interest rates encourages excessive risk taking”
by financial institutions, the IMF wrote in a  chapter  of its
Global Financial Stability report released today.  While the low rates can encourage credit, at some point
they will force companies into riskier activities to pay a
better return to holders of insurance policies or pensioners,
Kodres said. The IMF will monitor what type of vulnerabilities
that adds to the financial system over time, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
