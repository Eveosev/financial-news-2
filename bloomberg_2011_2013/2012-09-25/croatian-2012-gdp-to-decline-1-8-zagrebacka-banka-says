Croatia’s economy will contract 1.8
percent this year, as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis continues
to plague industry and investment, said  Zagrebacka Banka d.d. , a
unit of Italy’s  UniCredit SpA. (UCG)   The economic output will grow 0.5 percent next year, as the
country’s European Union membership is expected to strengthen
investment, Hrvoje Dolenec, chief economist of the Zagreb-based
bank, said in an emailed statement.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which is set to become the
European Union’s 28th member in July 2013, is struggling to
revive its economy after two years of recession and a period of
stagnation in 2011. Economic output fell 2.2. percent in the
second quarter of the year, after dropping 1.3 percent from the
three months through March.  The  World Bank  estimated Croatia’s economy will shrink 1
percent in 2012, while the  central bank  on July 9 revised its
forecast to a 1.6 percent contraction from a 1 percent decline
forecast in May. The  government  in August said the economy will
stagnate this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
