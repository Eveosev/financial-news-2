David Einhorn ’s Greenlight Capital
Inc. suffered in the past year by favoring gold-mining stocks
over the precious metal, a strategy that  Scotia Capital  Inc.
recommended last week.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, two exchange-traded
funds that Greenlight was buying in the third quarter of last
year have declined since Sept. 30, 2011. Gold has risen about 9
percent during the same period in  New York  trading. Einhorn
declined to comment on the performance.  Greenlight has stayed with one of the funds, the  Market
Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) , which invests in the metal’s biggest
producers. The New York-based hedge fund is the third-largest
shareholder even after cutting its stake by 17 percent in the
second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The other ETF is also one of Van Eck Associates Corp.’s
Market Vectors funds and tracks smaller mining companies, known
as juniors. Greenlight finished last year’s third quarter with
1.9 million shares and sold all of them in the first half of
this year, according to filings.  “There is a case to be made that the equities should start
to outperform bullion,” Tanya Jakusconek, an analyst at Scotia
Capital, wrote in a Sept. 20 report. Capital-spending cutbacks
may lead to greater cash flow for many producers, the Toronto-
based analyst wrote.  Five gold-mining stocks have the equivalent of buy ratings
from Jakusconek, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They
are Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., Barrick Gold Corp., Eldorado Gold
Corp., Goldcorp Inc. and Iamgold Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
