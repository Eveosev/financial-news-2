Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the
world’s biggest wind-turbine maker, renewed contracts to service
192 megawatts of machines for  Italy ’s FRI-EL Green Power SpA.  Vestas signed 15-year contracts to service 110 turbines at
four wind-power plants in the Italian regions of Campania,
Apulia, Sardinia and Basilicata, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement, without disclosing terms.  Vestas is seeking to expand its services unit as profit
margins from maintaining turbines are higher than from selling
them. In August, the company predicted a margin before interest
and tax of 17 percent from its services division in 2012,
compared with a zero to 4 percent margin for the whole business.  Revenue from servicing machines will climb 21 percent this
year to 850 million euros ($1.1 billion), according to a
forecast from the Aarhus, Denmark-based manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
