New York University  faculty and
neighborhood organizations sued  New York City  for approving a
university plan to expand in  Greenwich Village .  Violations overlooked in the plan include illegal
manipulation of restrictive deeds, destruction of parkland and
playgrounds and failure to adequately consider the environmental
impact, according to a filing yesterday in state court in
 Manhattan .  NYU’s intended expansion, known as the Sexton Plan after
the university’s president, John Sexton, is a $6 billion project
comprising almost 2 million square feet, according to the
filing.  “The City Planning Commission and the City Council bought
NYU’s premise that they needed to expand in its core in the
Village community in order to become a so-called world class
university,” Mark Crispin Miller, an NYU professor of media and
culture, said in a statement. “The Sexton Plan has nothing to
do with education; it’s a land grab and nothing more, and the
city failed to hold NYU accountable.”  In August, tenants of rent-stabilized apartments at
Washington Square Village filed a suit in  New York  State Supreme
Court in Manhattan against NYU. The tenants sought a court order
to stop the university from taking action to eliminate a two-
acre park and a commercial strip and garden.  The case is Weinstein v. Harvey, 103844-2012, State Supreme
Court of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
