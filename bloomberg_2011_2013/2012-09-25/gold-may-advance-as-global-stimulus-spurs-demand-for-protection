Gold futures rose the most in more
than a week on speculation that moves by central banks to
bolster their economies will spur demand for the metal as a
store of value.  The  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of U.S.
monetary stimulus on Sept. 13, and the  Bank of Japan  said last
week it will add to a fund that buys assets. Gold may rise to
$2,000 an ounce next year mainly on economic risks,  Eugen Weinberg , the head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, said today at a Bloomberg LiveINSIGHTS conference.  “Gold is rising on all the announcements we have heard
from various central banks,” Fred Schoenstein, a trader at
Heraeus Precious Metals Management in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “The trend remains bullish.”  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,774.70 an ounce at 10:50 a.m. A
close at that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since Sept. 13.  Kazakhstan expanded its  gold reserves  for a 13th
consecutive month in August, buying 1.4 metric tons, data on the
International Monetary Fund’s website showed.  South Korea  bought
16 tons in July, and Paraguay purchased 7.5 tons that month, the
data show.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$34.27 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
