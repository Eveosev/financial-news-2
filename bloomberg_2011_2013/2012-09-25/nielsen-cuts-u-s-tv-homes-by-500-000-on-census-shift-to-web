The number of U.S. TV households
fell by 500,000, reflecting the popularity of online viewing and
results of the 2010 census, according to Nielsen, producer of
the weekly ratings that help set advertising prices.  The adjustment in U.S. TV households to 114.2 million took
effect Aug. 27 and will apply to the television season starting
this week, New York-based  Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN)  said today in an
e-mailed statement.  “We have had no household formation over the past several
years, and I believe there is a modest amount of cord-cutting
happening in younger households and in lower-income
households,” said  Paul Sweeney , Bloomberg Industries’ director
of North American research.  Nielsen said it’s working with TV and advertising clients
on what should constitute a TV home and how to account for new
products such as tablet computers. It has already begun
incorporating online viewing into ratings. This is the second
straight year it has reduced the number of homes with TVs. In
May 2011, Nielsen adjusted the number to 114.7 million, a 1
percent drop and the first decline since 1990.  In the past year, three of the four largest broadcast
networks experienced drops in audiences ranging from 2 percent
to more than 8 percent.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC, bolstered by the
Olympics and football, increased its viewership by 19 percent,
according to Nielsen data.  Nielsen said its estimates for the 2012-2013 season are the
first to reflect demographic details from the 2010 census,
including age, sex, ethnicity and ethnic households. For that
reason, the reduction amounts to an adjustment rather than one-
year population changes.  “To the extent that there is cord-cutting, over-the-top
companies such as Hulu and  Netflix (NFLX)  are benefiting,” Sweeney
said. “These households then fall out of Nielsen’s total
household mix.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
