Lotto24 (LO24)  AG, the online lottery
broker spun off from  Tipp24 SE (TIM) , surged in Frankfurt trading
after the company became one of the first private operators to
gain a permit for state-run lotteries.  Lotto24 rose as much as 17 percent to 3.75 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since Sept. 6. The shares traded at 3.60
euros euros as of 12:39 p.m. The stock, which started trading on
July 3, initially sold for 2.50 euros each in a rights offer.  The license, which runs for five years, allows Lotto24 to
broker state-run lotteries online, according to a statement by
the company late yesterday. The permit is valid for all of
 Germany  with the exception of North-Rhine Westphalia, the
country’s most populous state, and Schleswig-Holstein.  “This permit is a fundamental precondition for the
functioning of our business model,” Frank Schwarz, a spokesman
for Lotto24 in Hamburg, said. “We should get online nationwide
in 2013, and this is when the business becomes operational and
substantial revenue starts coming in.”  Further permits are required to advertise Lotto24’s product
range on television, radio, press and Internet across the
country, Schwarz said. The company expects to receive these
permits by November 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
