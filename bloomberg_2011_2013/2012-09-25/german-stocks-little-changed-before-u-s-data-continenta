Most  German stocks  rose after a
report showed U.S.  consumer confidence  advanced more than
estimated in September and  house prices  gained more than
forecast in July.  Suedzucker AG (SZU)  added 3.4 percent after it reported a 62
percent increase in first-half operating profit and raised its
2013 forecast.  Lotto24 (LO24)  AG surged 9.3 percent after it gained a
permit to broker state-run lotteries online.  Continental AG (CON)  fell
4 percent as Schaeffler AG sold a 10.4 percent stake in the tire
producer.  Daimler AG (DAI)  slid 1.6 percent after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its profit estimates for German carmakers.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 0.2 percent to 7,425.11 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt . Nineteen of the gauge’s 30 members
rose, while 11 fell. The measure has  rallied 24 percent  from
this year’s low on June 5 as European Central Bank policy makers
approved an unlimited bond-buying program and the  Federal
Reserve  started a third round of asset purchases. The broader
HDAX Index also gained 0.2 percent today.  “Consumer confidence and housing prices both surprising on
the positive side gives a positive indicator for equity
investors to run with moving towards the end of the quarter,”
said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser who helps manage 70
million euros ($91 million) at Schroeder Equities GmbH in
Munich.  Stocks fell 0.5 percent yesterday as German business
sentiment missed estimates, optimism among Chinese manufacturers
declined, and  Germany  and  France  clashed over the timing of
oversight of the region’s banks.  Consumer Confidence  Confidence among American consumers rose more than forecast
in September to a seven-month high. The Conference Board’s  index 
increased to 70.3 this month from 61.3 in August, figures from
the New York-based private research group showed today. The
September figure exceeded the most optimistic projection of
economists, whose median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called
for 63.1.  Home prices  in the U.S. climbed more than forecast in July
from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property
values in 20 cities increased 1.2 percent from July 2011, the
biggest 12-month advance since August 2010, a report from the
group showed today in  New York . The  median  forecast of 24
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.05 percent gain.  The Chinese central bank added a record 290 billion  yuan 
($46 billion) to the financial system today by using reverse-
 repurchase agreements , seeking to address a cash squeeze in the
run-up to a weeklong holiday.  Greece  faces a financing gap that won’t be solved by budget
measures being discussed because a weak economy and delayed
privatizations have worsened its fiscal situation, International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said at the
Peterson Institute for International Economics in  Washington 
yesterday.  Suedzucker Advances  Suedzucker gained 3.4 percent to 28.55 euros. The producer
of sugar, starch and bakery additives reported a 62 percent
increase in first-half operating profit to 562 million euros,
driven mostly by its sugar unit. The company also increased its
revenue and operating profit forecast for 2013.  Lotto24 surged 9.3 percent to 3.50 euros. The online
lottery broker spun off from  Tipp24 SE (TIM)  became one of the first
private operators to gain a permit for state-run lotteries.  The license, which runs for five years, is valid for all of
Germany with the exception of North-Rhine Westphalia, the
country’s most populous state, and Schleswig-Holstein.  RWE AG (RWE)  added 1.3 percent to 35.50 euros. Germany’s second-
largest utility was removed from UBS AG’s least preferred list.  Continental Falls  Continental dropped 4 percent to 78.22 euros, its biggest
decline in three months. Schaeffler, a German industrial
bearings maker, sold a 10.4 percent stake in Continental for 1.6
billion euros to cut debt after a failed takeover of the tire
producer.  A gauge of carmakers was the  worst performer  on the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index. Goldman Sachs cut its 2012-2014 profit
estimates for German carmakers citing deterioration in European
premium car pricing since the second quarter.  Daimler, the world’s third-largest maker of luxury cars,
lost 1.6 percent to 39.46 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,
the biggest maker of luxury cars, fell 1.4 percent to 58.81
euros.  Preferred shares of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  retreated 1.7 percent to
152.25 euros. Europe’s largest carmaker said the second half
will be more difficult as the region’s economy deteriorates.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  dropped 1.8 percent to 9.77 euros. The
stock was cut to hold from buy at Jefferies Group Inc.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  plunged 6.1 percent to 5.11 euros,
its biggest drop in three months. Europe’s second-largest
semiconductor maker said it sees first-quarter sales falling as
much as 10 percent from the previous quarter. The company said
