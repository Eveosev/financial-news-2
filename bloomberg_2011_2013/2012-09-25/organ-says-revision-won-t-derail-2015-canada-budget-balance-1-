Canada ’s Deputy Finance Minister
Michael Horgan said the federal government is on track to
balance its budget by 2015 as planned even as it prepares
revisions to its fiscal plan.  “There will be some adjustment to those numbers,” Horgan
said at a conference today in  New York , referring to the
government’s annual fiscal update that may be presented in
coming weeks. “We are essentially on track for getting back
into surplus by 2015.”  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said last month the
government may need to revise its deficit targets amid risks to
the global recovery.  “The current global economic environment means there is
downward risk to the fiscal track presented in budget 2012,”
Flaherty told reporters Aug. 31 in Toronto, saying the  European
debt crisis  is the key risk to Canada’s economy, as well as
sluggish U.S. growth.  Flaherty’s March 29 fiscal plan, which forecasts surpluses
beginning in 2015, projects the deficit for the fiscal year that
began in April will drop to C$21.1 billion ($21.6 billion) from
an estimated shortfall of C$24.9 billion for the 2011 fiscal
year.  While the plan, which forecast surpluses beginning in 2015,
projects nominal GDP growth of 4.6 percent this year, economists
at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  are projecting 3.4 percent growth. Nominal
GDP is a better predictor of the tax base and revenue because it
includes changes in prices.  The budget  built in a C$3 billion cushion for revenue by
assuming output would be about C$20 billion below consensus of
private-sector forecasts.  Horgan spoke at Euromoney’s Canadian Debt Capital Markets
Investor Forum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
