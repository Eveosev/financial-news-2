Flowering for the 2013 coffee crop
should be of “good intensity” in  Brazil , the largest producer
of the bean, weather consultant Somar Meteorologia said.  The 2012 coffee harvest is almost finished, and next week’s
expected rain may help start flowering for the 2013 crop, Somar
said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
