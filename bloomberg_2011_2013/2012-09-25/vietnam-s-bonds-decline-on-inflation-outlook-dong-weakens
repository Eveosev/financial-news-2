Vietnam ’s government bonds dropped
for a second day on speculation investors trimmed purchases on
concern that faster inflation will erode returns from debt
securities. The dong weakened.  “There’s almost no trading these days since most investors
wanted to wait for a clearer view of  interest rates  given that
inflation seemed to pick up again,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head
of the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi.  Gains in  consumer prices  quickened to 6.48 percent in
September from a year earlier, after rising 5.04 percent in
August, the General Statistics Office said in Hanoi today. The
median estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 5.15 percent increase. Prices gained 2.2 percent from last
month, the most since May 2011.  The benchmark  five-year  bond yield added five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.08 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong weakened to 20,875 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,868 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
