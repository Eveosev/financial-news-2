The  New York Cosmos  will play home
games at Hofstra University’s 13,000-seat stadium on Long Island
when they return to the  North American Soccer League  in 2013
after a 28-year absence.  The Cosmos played two of their first three seasons at
Hofstra in Hempstead, New York, in 1972-73, before moving to
Downing Stadium in New York City and then Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford,  New Jersey , where international stars such as Pele
and  Franz Beckenbauer  helped win five NASL championships.  “Hofstra is the perfect place for us to return to the
pitch,” Cosmos Chairman Seamus O’Brien said in a statement.
“The stadium is part of Cosmos history and lore, and is located
in the heartland of our great fan base on Long Island.”  The NASL is a second-tier professional league in the U.S.
under  Major League Soccer  and has nine other teams, including
two Canadian franchises and one in Puerto Rico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
