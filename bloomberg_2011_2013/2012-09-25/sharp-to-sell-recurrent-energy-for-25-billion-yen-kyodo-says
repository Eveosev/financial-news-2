Sharp Corp. (6753)  plans to sell Recurrent
Energy LLC for 25 billion yen ($321 million) as part of a
restructuring plan, the Kyodo News agency said today.  Osaka-based Sharp paid $305 million in 2010 for a 100
percent stake in Recurrent Energy, a solar project developer.
The San Francisco-based company has a portfolio of 500 megawatts
of solar projects awarded and a development pipeline of 2.5
gigawatts, according to a company  website .  The sale is included in a restructuring at Sharp that will
include the elimination of 10,966 jobs by the end of March 2014,
Kyodo said. Sharp spokeswoman  Miyuki Nakayama  declined to
comment on the Kyodo report.  Sharp entered the solar market in 1959 when it began
developing solar cells, according to the company’s  website . Four
years later, Sharp began mass output and in 2008 became the
world’s first to achieve cumulative production of 2 gigawatts of
solar cells, according to a history posted on Sharp’s website.  The Japanese company is part of a group behind  Italy ’s
largest solar manufacturing facility in Sicily. The venture
between Enel Green Power, the renewables unit of Italian utility
Enel SpA, Sharp, and STMicroelectronics NV was inaugurated in
2011 with an initial production capacity of 160 megawatts a
year.  As part of Sharp’s reorganization, the company’s two main
banks plan to back a revival package from the Japanese
television maker and will contribute about 360 billion yen in
loans, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. plan to approve the package presented yesterday by
Sept. 30, the people said, asking not to be identified before an
announcement. Resona Holdings Inc. and Nippon Life Insurance Co.
may join in providing the loans, Kyodo reported yesterday,
without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
