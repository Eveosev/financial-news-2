Iron-ore  prices, down 25 percent
this year, probably won’t rebound as the economy slows in China,
the world’s biggest importer and steelmaker, according to Shale-
Inland Holdings LLC.  Prices for steel, which have dropped 10 percent in 2012,
also won’t recover, said Craig Bouchard, the chief executive
officer of Shale-Inland, which fabricates and distributes
metals.  China’s economy  will grow less than analysts expect, at 5
percent to 6 percent in 2013, Bouchard said. That compares with
a Bloomberg survey of as many as 45 analysts, which showed a
median forecast of 7.7 percent growth this year and 8 percent in
2013. There’s a 50 percent chance that the U.S. will slide into
a recession next year as  consumer spending  ebbs, he said.  “There’s not going to be a recovery in steel in the next
six months,” Bouchard, who founded Schiller Park, Illinois-
based Shale-Inland in 2010, said in a telephone interview. “You
can’t expect a recovery in iron-ore prices until we see a
recovery in the world economy.”  The North America  price  for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark
metal used in cars, trucks and appliances, fell 2.8 percent in
the week ended yesterday to $629.17 a short ton, according to
data from Steel Business Briefing. Iron ore for immediate
delivery was unchanged yesterday at $103.70 a metric ton,
according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
