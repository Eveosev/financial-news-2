DirecTV, the largest U.S.
satellite-television provider, reached an intraday record in  New
York  trading after Hudson Square Research advised buying the
shares to take advantage of growth in  Latin America .  The shares climbed 0.6 percent to $53.01 at the close in
New York, pushing its gains for the year to 24 percent. DirecTV
rose as much as 4.7 percent to $55.17 earlier in the session,
reaching the highest intraday level since 1985, when its
predecessor company was controlled by General Motors Corp. The
stock failed to reach its Sept. 13 record close of $54.19.  While U.S. subscribers fell last quarter for the first time
in company history, Latin American quarterly gains have set six
straight records, capped by last quarter’s 645,000 new
customers. Hudson Square raised its estimate for third-quarter
Latin American subscriber additions to 650,000 from 500,000 and
increased its 2013 estimate to 2.5 million.  “I don’t see any reason why the numbers they’ve put up the
last few quarters are going to change,”  Todd Rethemeier , an
analyst at Hudson Square in New York, said in an interview. Only
about 30 percent of Latin American households have cable or
satellite subscriptions, leaving room for growth, Rethemeier
wrote in a note to clients. He previously had a neutral rating
on the shares.  DirecTV hasn’t seen a slowdown in subscriber additions in
 Brazil , its biggest Latin American market, Chief Executive
Officer Mike White said Sept. 21 at an investor conference. He
said he doesn’t expect Brazil state government officials to
approve a tax increase on video service when they meet Sept. 28.
The measure would force DirecTV to either increase prices or
absorb the cost of the tax, hurting profit margins.  DirecTV (DTV)  will “do fine” in the third quarter in terms of
U.S. subscriber additions, White said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
