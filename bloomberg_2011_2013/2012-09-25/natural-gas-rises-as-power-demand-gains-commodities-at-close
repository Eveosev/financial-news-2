The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.1 percent to settle at 658.66
at 4 p.m. in  New York , led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  advanced 0.5
percent to 1,620.32.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas gained for the third time in four sessions on
speculation that increased demand from electricity generators
because of fuel switching will help reduce a supply glut.  Power plants  have consumed 27.3 billion cubic feet of gas a
day this month, up 21 percent from a year ago, data from LCI
Energy Insight in El Paso,  Texas , show. A surplus has been cut
as electricity generators burned more gas instead of coal.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas futures for
October delivery increased 3.1 percent to $2.924 per million
British thermal units.  U.K. gas for next-day delivery advanced as Gassco AS said
supply from its Kollsnes processing plant in  Norway  will be cut
by 40 million cubic meters a day.  The price rose 0.9 percent to 61 pence a therm at 4:53 p.m.
London time. Month-ahead gas climbed 1 percent to 59.53 pence a
therm. That’s equivalent to $9.66 per million Btu. A therm is
100,000 Btu.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for the second time in three sessions as
signs of stabilization in  China’s economy  and further recovery
in U.S. housing brightened prospects for metal demand.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December
delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $3.7585 a pound.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.1 percent to $8,275 a metric ton ($3.75 a pound).
Aluminum, tin, nickel, zinc and lead also gained.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar gained the most in two weeks on speculation that
adverse weather in  Brazil , the world’s top exporter, and  India 
may limit global supplies.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, raw sugar for March
delivery climbed 2.2 percent to 20.72 cents a pound, the biggest

$2,483 a metric ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery increased 0.8
percent to $1.7365 a pound.  Orange juice  for November delivery declined 3.3 percent to
$1.1445 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
72.33 cents a pound.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline advanced as U.S. home prices rose more than
expected in July and  consumer confidence  jumped to a seven-month
high in September.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for October delivery rose
1.7 percent to $2.9671 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for October delivery gained 0.3 percent
to $3.1086 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose on speculation that moves by central
banks to bolster their economies will spur demand for the metal
as a store of value.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery climbed
0.1 percent to $1,766.40 an ounce.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$33.948 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for January delivery rose

slowing demand from U.S. meatpackers as beef prices drop.  On the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
December delivery fell 2 percent to $1.258 a pound, the biggest
drop since April 24.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement declined 1.5
percent to $1.46525 a pound, the biggest drop since July 25.  Hog futures for December settlement slid 0.9 percent to
74.65 cents a pound.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell to a seven-week low as Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said a new stimulus
program probably won’t boost the economy.  On the Nymex, oil futures for November delivery dropped 0.6
percent to $91.37 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 2.  Brent oil for November settlement rose 0.6 percent to
$110.45 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures exchange.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold North Sea Forties crude at a
