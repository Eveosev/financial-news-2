India ’s 10-year bonds declined on
concern the government will overshoot its borrowing target to
finance its budget as slowing growth hurts revenue.  Yields rose before the government introduces its borrowing
calendar for the second half of the fiscal year by Sept. 30.
Sovereign debt issuance will exceed the 5.69 trillion rupee
($107 billion) goal for the year ending March 31 by 500 billion
rupees, according to the median of eight estimates compiled by
 Bloomberg News .  “Investors are concerned about the debt supplies,” said
R.S Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of fixed-income and
currencies at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (SBBJ)  in Mumbai. “Yields
will rise more if the borrowing exceeds expectations.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.17 percent in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system.  The  finance ministry  is due to sell 150 billion rupees of
bonds on Sept. 28, taking government borrowings in the first six
months of this fiscal year to 3.7 trillion rupees, or 65 percent
of the full-year target, according to central bank data. Revenue
was 1.69 trillion rupees in the April-July period, 18 percent of
the budget estimate, the data show.  Analysts predict Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  will fail to
rein in the  budget deficit  as planned to 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product this fiscal year from 5.8 percent in the
preceding 12 months.  ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. forecasts a 6.1
percent deficit, while Nomura Holdings Inc. and Anand Rathi
Financial Services Ltd. project a 5.8 percent shortfall.  Fitch
Ratings  and the Indian unit of Daiwa Asset Management Co. expect
a gap of 5.7 percent of GDP.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose 2 basis
points to 7.71 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
