Bakken crude weakened to the
smallest premium over West Texas Intermediate oil in three weeks
as  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  apportioned deliveries on pipelines in the
region.  Enbridge said Sept. 21 that shippers would have to cut
requests to transport oil by 8 percent on two pipelines from
Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin; by 10 percent on a line
connecting Superior to Sarnia, Ontario; and by 15 percent on a
line connecting Superior to the Griffith-Hartsdale area in
 Indiana .  The Bakken formation covers most of  North Dakota  and
portions of Montana and Saskatchewan. Smaller pipeline systems
in the area connect producers to Enbridge’s lines.  Bakken’s premium to WTI, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell $2
to $1 a barrel at 4:01 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest premium since Sept. 4.  West Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 20 cents to
$13 a barrel. Syncrude remained unchanged with a premium of
$7.50 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium rose 15 cents to $21 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet fell 50 cents to an $18.75-a-
barrel premium.  Mars Blend rose 25 cents to $12.75 a barrel more than WTI.
Poseidon oil widened its premium by $1.10 to $12.35 a barrel.
Souther Green Canyon gained 20 cents to $11.50 over WTI.  Thunder
Horse ’s premium narrowed 50 cents to $19.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
