Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down the most in two weeks, on speculation policy makers
will cut borrowing costs as soon as this week.  The central bank lowered the  overnight lending rate  in
August for a second straight month, reducing it by a quarter-
percentage point to 4.75 percent. Banco de la Republica will
next decide on monetary policy Sept. 28.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due in May 2014 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 4.88 percent, according to the central bank, the biggest drop
on a closing basis since Sept. 6. The price rose 0.087 centavo
to 106.648 centavos per peso.  “Some are still betting on another cut,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores Asociados SA in Bogota.
“We’ll probably see a lot of volatility in the short end of the
bond curve until the rate decision.”  Colombia’s central bank will lower the target rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent in its next meeting,
according to 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Twenty
economists forecast borrowing costs will remain unchanged.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,796.95 per  U.S.
dollar , extending its rally this year to 7.9 percent. The
currency has fallen 0.7 percent in the third quarter.  Banco de la Republica should continue to buy dollars at the
current pace during the fourth quarter, Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters yesterday in Bogota. The
government will reinforce the central bank’s actions with dollar
purchases of its own, he said.  The central bank said Aug. 24 it would boost dollar
purchases to $700 million by the end of September, or an average
of $28 million a day. That is up from the minimum
$20 million a day that the bank has said it will buy until at
least Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
