China ’s first  aircraft carrier ,
built with the hull of an unfinished Soviet-era ship, was handed
over to the navy and formally commissioned this morning, the
 defense ministry  said.  The 65,000-ton vessel, named the Liaoning, enters operation
after months of sea trials amid a dispute with Japan over
islands claimed by both sides. Chinese President  Hu Jintao  and
Premier  Wen Jiabao  visited the ship today after it was
commissioned, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  The carrier will enhance China’s warfighting and defense
capabilities and “promote international peace and common
development,” China’s  Defense Ministry  said in a statement on
its website today. China has the world’s second-largest defense
budget after the U.S. and depends on maritime commerce to ship
its goods across oceans and to import oil from countries
including  Saudi Arabia , Iran and Venezuela.  “It is natural that China should have its own aircraft
carrier,” Rear Admiral Yang Yi, the former director of the
Institute for Strategic Studies at the military’s National
Defense University, said in an editorial in today’s English-
language  China Daily  newspaper. “While China is facing the
threat of various external security challenges, the development
of its aircraft carrier has become the common aspiration and
will of the entire nation.”  The dispute over the islands sparked street protests and
saw China deploy patrol vessels to waters surrounding them. The
People’s Liberation Army Navy commissioned the carrier today in
a ceremony at Dalian Port in China’s Liaoning province, the
Xinhua News Agency reported.  Battle Carrier  The ship, about two-thirds the size of the U.S. Navy’s
newest aircraft carriers, was originally intended to be the
 Soviet Union ’s second main battle carrier when construction
began in the 1980s, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence said
in a 2009 report. Dubbed the Varyag, it was still unfinished
when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Its sister ship, the
Admiral Kuznetsov, is the Russian navy’s flagship.  Ukraine inherited the Varyag and sold it to China in 1998.
The hull arrived in 2002 in Dalian, site of China’s largest
shipyard, the report said. In 2009 it was in plain view during
its refurbishing in drydock about 600 meters from an IKEA
furniture store.  Carrier flight operations require years of training. China
built a mockup of the Varyag on the side of a lake in the inland
city of Wuhan to train flight crews. The U.S. has 11 carriers on
active duty and two, the Gerald R. Ford and  John F. Kennedy ,
under construction, according to the Navy’s website. All but one
of the U.S. carriers displace at least 100,000 tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
