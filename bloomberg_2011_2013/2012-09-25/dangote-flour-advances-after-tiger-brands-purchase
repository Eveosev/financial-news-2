Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, climbed to the highest in more than a year after  Tiger
Brands Ltd. (TBS)  of  South Africa  received approval for a plan to buy
a majority stake in the company.  Dangote Flour  advanced  5 percent to 8.48 naira, the highest
level since Sept. 5, 2011, at the close in Lagos, the commercial
capital.  Tiger Brands, South Africa’s largest food company, got
approval from Nigeria’s Securities & Exchange Commission to pay
30.1 billion naira ($190 million) for a majority stake in
Dangote Flour from Dangote Industries Ltd., owned by billionaire
Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man.  Tiger will pay 9.50 naira a share in cash on Oct. 1 to
acquire 63.35 percent of the flour mills business, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Dangote
Flour has 30 percent market share in flour and 40 percent in
pasta in the West African nation, it said.  Dangote Flour is Tiger’s third acquisition in Nigeria since
April 2011, according to the statement. Tiger wants to increase
revenue from outside South Africa to 30 percent over the next
five to 10 years, Chief Executive Officer Peter Matlare said on
May 22.  The Lagos-based  company’s stock  has surged 70 percent this
year, compared with the 26 percent gain by the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
