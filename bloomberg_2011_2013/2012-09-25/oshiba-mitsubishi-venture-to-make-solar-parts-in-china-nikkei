Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric
Industrial Systems Corp. will produce power conditioners for
solar power generation in China and India, the Nikkei newspaper

Corp. (6503)  plans to set up production sites for conditioners for
large-scale solar power stations in China in 2013 and India in
2014, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The company plans to manufacture about 10 power
conditioners a month in each country, according to the paper.  Power conditioners convert direct current from solar panels
