Former Bank of England policy maker
 David Blanchflower  said the next governor of the central bank 
should be someone with “clean hands” after recent banking-
industry scandals appeared to have ruled out several candidates.  “We’re going to have to find somebody who is a manager and
who has clean hands,” he said in an interview with Maryam
Nemazee on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” program.  “It’s
a big job.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  this month
formally began his search to replace central bank governor
 Mervyn King , who steps down in June. Business Secretary Vince
Cable said yesterday King’s successor must be someone
“understanding the banking system but independent of it. ”  “A number of people whose names were in the hat who were
on the betting list now look to have dropped away,” said
Blanchflower, who is a Bloomberg Television contributing editor.
“There are issues about people who were involved in the
crisis.”  Blanchflower said the two top candidates for the job are
Financial Services Authority Chairman  Adair Turner  and the
former head of the U.K. civil service, Gus O’Donnell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
