The  European Investment Bank  is
considering a 50 million-euro ($65 million) loan for Liberia
Electricity Corp. to restore a hydropower plant.  The 180 million-euro project in Montserrado County includes
rebuilding  power lines  to carry electricity from the 64-megawatt
Mount Coffee plant on the St. Paul River to the capital
Monrovia, the EIB said today in a  statement  on its website.  The West African nation is seeking to rebuild
infrastructure destroyed in civil wars between 1989 and 2003.
The country currently produces 23 megawatts of electricity for a
population of 4.1 million people, one of the lowest per capita
rates in the world, according to Liberia’s finance ministry.  The project will also power neighboring countries at a
later stage when regional links are installed, the European
Union’s lending arm said in the statement. Liberia’s finance
ministry said Sept. 7 the government was in talks with the EIB,
Germany and  Norway  about the project.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
