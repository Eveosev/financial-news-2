Morgan Stanley (MS)  dropped the Smith
Barney name from its brokerage joint venture, changing the brand
to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management after buying an additional
piece of the unit from  Citigroup Inc. (C)   The name change comes three years after the joint venture
was formed and two months after Morgan Stanley completed the
integration of the two units, the New York-based firm said today
in a statement. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  said in June that the name would be changed.  “The Smith Barney name stood for investment excellence for
three-quarters of a century, and Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management will provide the first-class service that has
distinguished Morgan Stanley as a firm for more than 75 years,”
Gorman said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
