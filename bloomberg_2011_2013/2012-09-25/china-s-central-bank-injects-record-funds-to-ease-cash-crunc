China ’s central bank added a record
290 billion  yuan  ($46 billion) to the financial system using
reverse-repurchase agreements, seeking to address a cash squeeze
in the run-up to a weeklong holiday.  The People’s Bank of China conducted 190 billion yuan of
28-day reverse  repos  and offered 100 billion yuan of 14-day
 contracts , according to a trader at a primary dealer required to
bid at the auctions. Today’s total is the highest for a single
day in Bloomberg data going back to 2004.  “Record amounts of reverse repos are to meet the surge in
cash demand before the quarter-end and the holidays,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co.,
the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “As the central bank steps
up adding funds through reverse repos, it’s unlikely to cut the
reserve ratio this month.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 19 basis points to 4.70 percent as
of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
4.75 percent, the highest level since June 28.  The central bank kept the yields on 28- and 14-day reverse
repos unchanged at 3.6 percent and 3.45 percent, respectively,
the trader said. China’s financial markets will be shut from Oct.
1 to Oct. 5 for the National day and mid-autumn holidays.  Reserve Cuts  China’s monetary authority also auctioned 40 billion yuan
of six-month treasury deposits to commercial banks on behalf of
the Ministry of Finance at a yield of 4.32 percent, according to
a different trader. That compared with yesterday’s  six-month 
Shanghai interbank offered rate of 4.09 percent.  The PBOC lowered the amount of cash lenders must set aside
as  reserves  in May to 20 percent, the second reduction this year.  China’s one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed
to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.18 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 dropped five basis points to 3.23 percent, data from the
Interbank Funding Center shows.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Amit Prakash  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
