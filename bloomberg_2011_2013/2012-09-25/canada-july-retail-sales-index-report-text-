 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales rose 0.7% to $39.0 billion in July, more than
offsetting the decline in June. Gains were reported in 8 of 11
subsectors, representing 72% of total retail trade. The increase
was led by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers, and
general merchandise stores.  In volume terms, retail sales rose 0.6%.  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased 1.7% in
July. Higher receipts at new car dealers (+1.7%) accounted for
