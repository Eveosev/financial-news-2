Finland’s economy will contract
less than forecast this year, the PTT Research Institute
forecast.  Gross domestic product will shrink 0.4 percent this year,
compared with a March prediction of 0.9 percent, the Helsinki-
based institute said. The economy will expand 0.8 percent next
year, compared with an estimate for 2.3 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
