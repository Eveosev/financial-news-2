The  Arab Monetary Fund  has granted
Morocco 1.64 billion dirhams ($190 million) in financing to help
with the country’s balance of payments and support trade with
other Arab nations, the state-run Maghreb Arabe Presse reported.  The Abu Dhabi-based fund granted Morocco a 1 billion dirham
loan to support its balance of payments and a 637.5 million
dirham loan to finance trade with Arab nations, MAP said today.  “The Arab Monetary Fund supports the government’s strategy
that aims to reduce the deficit of the balance of payments and
strengthen the level of foreign exchange reserves, while
supporting the competitiveness of our exports to Arab
countries,” Finance Minister Nizar Baraka was quoted as saying
by MAP.  To contact the reporter on this story: Aida Alami via Cairo +2-
