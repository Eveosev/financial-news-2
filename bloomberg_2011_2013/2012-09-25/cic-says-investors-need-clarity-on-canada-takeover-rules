Investors need clarity on  Canada ’s
foreign takeover rules, said Felix Chee, China Investment
Corp.’s chief representative in Canada.  Chee told a conference in Ottawa today that the lack of
clarity on foreign investment rules benefits the Canadian
government. Canada is reviewing the $15.1 billion bid by  Cnooc
Ltd. (883)  for  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , a Calgary-based energy producer. Chee said
Cnooc’s 100 percent bid for Nexen makes approval more difficult.
Canada reviews most foreign takeovers to make sure they provide
a net benefit to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
