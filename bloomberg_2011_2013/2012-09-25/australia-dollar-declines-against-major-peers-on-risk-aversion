The Australian dollar fell with
crude oil and stocks after a U.S. official said the Federal
Reserve’s new bond-buying program likely won’t boost economic
growth, fueling an investor shift from higher-risk assets.  The Aussie dropped against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said
that economic research indicates additional asset purchases are
“unlikely to reduce long-term interest rates by a significant
amount” and that lowering rates “by a few more basis points”
won’t spur growth and hiring. The  New Zealand dollar  fell versus
its U.S. peer amid speculation a political clash in Spain may
impede attempts to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  The Australian dollar is “down on global growth
concerns,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of
 Nova Scotia  in Toronto, said in a note to clients. “The problem
from here is growth but equally important is global central-bank
policy.”  Australia’s currency fell 0.4 percent to $1.0387 yesterday
in New York after earlier gaining as much as 0.4 percent. It
decreased 0.4 percent to 80.82 yen.  The so-called kiwi declined 0.2 percent to 82.16 U.S. cents
after rising as much as 0.7 percent. It fell 0.2 percent to
63.93 yen.  The Aussie has weakened 1.8 percent in the past month, the
worst performance among 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. New Zealand’s currency fell 0.2
over the same period. The  U.S. dollar  dropped 1.7 percent, the
second-largest decline, while the euro’s 1.8 increase led
gainers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
