Banks in Mauritius are under
pressure from a rise in non-performing loans in the tourism and
construction industries and this contributed to the decision to
maintain  interest rates , central bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  Impaired credit rose to 5.3 percent of outstanding loans in
the quarter through June from 4.6 percent in the prior period,
according to Bank of Mauritius data released today.  Non-performing loans in the  construction industry , which
has total loans of 62 billion rupees ($2 billion) or 24 percent
of outstanding credit, increased to 7.9 percent from 5.4
percent, according to the central bank. Non-performing loans in
the hotel industry, which has total loans of 43 billion rupees,
rose to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent.  “We are witnessing degradation in non-performing loans;
it’s quite fast,” Bheenick told reporters today in Port Louis,
the capital, after the Monetary Policy Committee kept its
benchmark interest rate at 4.9 percent. “The central bank
should be very vigilant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
