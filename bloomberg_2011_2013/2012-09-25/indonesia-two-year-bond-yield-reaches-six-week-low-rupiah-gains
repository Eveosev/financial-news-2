Indonesian bonds fell for a sixth
day, pushing the yield to a two-week high, after demand declined
at a government debt auction today. The rupiah was steady.  The  finance ministry  sold 5.3 trillion rupiah ($553
million) of bonds and bills, exceeding its goal of 5 trillion
rupiah, according to a statement on the debt management office’s
website. Investors bid for 2.4 times the amount offered,
compared with 2.8 times at the previous auction. Global funds
pared holdings of local debt by  1.02 trillion rupiah  in the last
two days of last week, official data show.  “The demand at the auction was lower compared to the
previous sale and this damped any positive sentiment,” said
Dini Anggraeni, a fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas
in Jakarta. “The market is still uncertain, so many investors
tend to wait and see instead of bidding.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.99
percent, the highest level since Sept. 7, closing prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The rupiah traded at 9,588 per dollar, after closing at
9,592 yesterday, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, to 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
