Peru sol-denominated bonds fell,
pushing up yields the most in 12 months, on concern steps by
U.S. and European policy makers to shore up their economies
won’t prevent global growth from slowing.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 4.38 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price fell 1.13 centimos to 122.67 centimos
per sol.  U.S. stocks declined as Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said the bond-buying
program announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost
growth or hiring. Spanish borrowing costs rose at a debt sale
and the  International Monetary Fund  said Greece’s outlook
worsened. Emerging-market debt yields increased yesterday as
data from Germany signaled the global slump is deepening.  Higher Peruvian bond yields follow “the ebb and flow of
risk sentiment, which remains acutely tied to what’s going on in
Spain and Greece,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin
America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in  New York .  The sol was little changed at 2.5950 per U.S. dollar,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Peru’s central bank
bought $60 million in the spot currency market today and paid an
average 2.5962 soles per  U.S. dollar .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose one basis point to 3.67
percent, according to Bloomberg prices. The bond’s price fell
0.16 cent to 146.30 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
