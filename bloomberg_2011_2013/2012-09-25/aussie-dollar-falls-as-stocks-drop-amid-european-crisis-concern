The Australian dollar fell to a
two-week low and domestic bonds advanced as concern political
clashes are hampering attempts to resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis
sapped demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie touched the weakest in almost three
weeks against the yen after Artur Mas, the president of
Catalonia, called early elections and said  Spain ’s richest
region should seek “self-determination.” The country’s Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is struggling to persuade his compatriots
to accept the deepest austerity measures on record.  New
Zealand ’s dollar declined after the nation posted a  trade
deficit  that was bigger than economists estimated.  “What’s happening in Europe has made investors nervous,
and they want to take risk off the table,” said Hans Kunnen,
chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “News out of
Europe was unsettling and doesn’t provide a positive outlook.
Investors reacted to that by selling off equities and selling
off the Aussie dollar.”  The Australian currency fell to $1.0342, the weakest since
Sept. 11, before trading at $1.0345 at 4:42 p.m. in Sydney, 0.4
percent below yesterday’s close. It slid 0.5 percent to 80.43
yen after earlier touching 80.38 yen, the lowest since Sept. 6.  Australia ’s government bonds  advanced , pushing the yield on
the 10-year security down by as much as 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 3.05 percent, the lowest since Sept. 6.
Yields on the two-year government note touched 2.51 percent, the
lowest since July 27.  The Aussie dollar has weakened 2 percent in the past month,
the worst performance among 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. New Zealand’s currency fell 0.3
percent over the same period.  N.Z. Trade  The so-called kiwi dropped against most of its 16 major
peers, including a 0.3 percent drop to 81.95 U.S. cents and a
0.3 percent slide to 63.72 yen, after falling to as low as 63.63
yen, the weakest level since Sept. 12.  A report from New Zealand’s statistics office showed
imports exceeded exports by NZ$866 million ($710 million) in the
12 months through August, compared with a revised NZ$768 million
in the year ended July 31.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, rose three basis points to 2.68 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks fell 1.4 percent,
following yesterday’s 1.1 percent decline in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Losses in the kiwi were limited after Auckland-based
Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy
exporter, said it increased full-year earnings amid record flows
of milk from its New Zealand suppliers.  Barclays Plc revised its forecasts for the New Zealand and
Australian dollars and now expects the kiwi to rise to 84 U.S.
cents and the Aussie to $1.06 in the coming month. It previously
predicted a rise to 83 U.S. cents and to $1.05 respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
