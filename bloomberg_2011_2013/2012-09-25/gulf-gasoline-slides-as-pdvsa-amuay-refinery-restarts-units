Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened
against futures as  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  said its Amuay
refinery is operating at half of capacity and 80 percent of
units have returned to service after an Aug. 25 explosion.  The refinery is processing 360,000 barrels of crude a day
out of a capacity of 645,000 barrels and expects to restart a
final distillation unit “soon,” Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez 
told reporters today in Caracas. PDVSA, as the state oil company
is known, is also planning to add 80,000 barrels a day of
processing to the plant, he said.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2 cents to 10.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 3:52 p.m.
The premium for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast
trimmed 0.75 cent to 3.20 cents a barrel.  New York Harbor reformulated gasoline’s premium narrowed
0.75 cent to 15 cents a gallon at 3:54 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
