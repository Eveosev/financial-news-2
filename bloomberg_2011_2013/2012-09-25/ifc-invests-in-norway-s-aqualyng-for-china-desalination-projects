International Finance Corp., a
lending arm of the  World Bank , is helping fight a water shortage
problem in China with its first investment in the country’s
desalination sector.  IFC said it invested $12 million in Aqualyng Holding AS and
that the Norwegian company will use the funds to build
desalination plants in areas of China experiencing water
scarcity.  It’s the IFC’s first investment in China’s emerging
seawater desalination industry. “Our investment in Aqualyng
underscores our commitment to help China address water
shortages, which seriously affects more than 100 cities in the
country and millions of people,” IFC Director for  East Asia  and
the Pacific Sergio Pimenta said in a statement from Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
