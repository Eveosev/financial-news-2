Wine sales by the world’s five
largest auction houses total more than $30 million so far this
month amid demand for top Burgundies and as the Liv-ex 100 index
rose 0.4 percent in August after declining since February.  The month’s top lots included six magnums of Romanee Conti
Domaine de la Romanee Conti 1997 Burgundy, which fetched
HK$915,000 ($118,000) at a Zachys  Hong Kong  sale on Sept. 7.  Following are results of auctions in September and earlier
this year by the five biggest houses: Acker Merrall & Condit,
Christie’s International,  Sotheby’s (BID) , Hart Davis Hart and Zachys.
Internet-only auctions sales aren’t included.
