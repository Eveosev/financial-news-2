Sugar futures gained the most in
two weeks on speculation that adverse weather in  Brazil , the
world’s top exporter, and  India  may limit global supplies. Cocoa
and coffee also advanced.  Sugar-cane output in India, the second-biggest grower, will
drop 6.2 percent in the year starting Oct. 1 as dry weather cuts
yields, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said yesterday. Growing
regions in Brazil will get rain this week that may delay
fieldwork, Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia said.  The market “is moving higher on continued skepticism of
the Indian crop prospects” and “more rain in Brazil that could
once again delay the harvest,” Christopher Narayanan, the head
of agricultural commodity research in New York at Societe
Generale SA, said in an e-mail.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 2.2 percent to settle
at 20.72 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. That marked the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Sept. 7. The commodity has dropped 11 percent this year.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose 1.5 percent to
$2,483 a metric ton in  New York , the biggest increase since
Sept. 5. The price has gained 18 percent in 2012.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery climbed 0.8
percent to $1.7365 a pound. The price has slumped 23 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
