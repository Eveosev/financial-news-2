Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will increase  duties  on most oil shipments abroad by
6.4 percent from Oct. 1, reaching the highest rate since June
after Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export duty will rise to $418.90 a metric ton,
or about $57.15 a barrel, from $393.80 a ton in September,
according an order signed by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  and
published today in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the state newspaper.  The government plans to review the current export duty
structure by the first quarter of next year to stimulate output
and meet President  Vladimir Putin ’s goal of more than 10 million
barrels a day for at least a decade. Production climbed to a
post-Soviet high of 10.37 million barrels a day in August,
according to the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades will increase to $210.10 a ton from $191.30 this
month. The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the
standard duty, will reach $41.80 in October.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged $113.98 a barrel during the
most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry
adviser, said by phone on Sept. 17. In the previous monitoring
period, it averaged $108.25, according to the ministry.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as  fuel oil , will climb to $276.40 a ton next
month from $259.90 in September. A gasoline tax imposed from May
2011 to counter domestic shortages will increase to $377 a ton
from $354.40 this month. That is 90 percent of the crude oil
duty.  The government will raise the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $172.50 a ton in October
from $76.20 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
