John N. Beck II, a marketer of so-
called get-rich-quick systems, filed for  bankruptcy protection 
after a federal court imposed a lifetime ban that put him out of
the infomercial and telemarketing businesses.  Beck listed assets of as much as $10 million and debt of as
much as $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Oakland, California.  A court  ordered  Beck and other marketers of three systems
including “John Beck’s Free & Clear Real Estate System” to pay
$478 million for deceiving close to 1 million consumers, the
Federal Trade Commission said in an Aug. 23 statement.  “The court found that despite the marketers’ easy-money
claims for the systems, which cost $39.95 each, nearly all the
consumers who bought them lost money,” the FTC said.  The case is In re John N. Beck II, 12-47882,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of California (Oakland). The
FTC case is Federal Trade Commission v. John Beck Amazing
Profits LLC, 09-CV-4719, U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California ( Los Angeles ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
