Libya ’s exports of natural gas
through the subsea pipeline to Italy dropped to 6 billion cubic
meters a year from 8 billion before the uprising in the North
African state last year, the chairman of the Mellitah gas
processing plant said.  Libyan consumption doubled to 4 billion cubic meters,
reducing the volume of gas available for exports, Najmi Karim
said at a conference today in Tripoli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
