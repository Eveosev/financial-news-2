Turkey ’s Cabinet sought approval
from parliament to extend a mandate for ground troops to be sent
into Iraq to fight Kurdish militants, Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Arinc said.  Parliament will reconvene from its summer holiday on Oct. 1
and is expected to give priority to a one-year extension of the
mandate for cross-border attacks, which expires on Oct. 17,
Arinc told reporters in Ankara late yesterday.  Militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK, who are
based in northern Iraq and fight for autonomy in Turkey’s
largely Kurdish southeast, have stepped up their attacks in
recent months.  Turkey has sent troops into Iraq on several occasions since
the Kurdish conflict began almost three decades ago, most
recently in 2008. The incursions failed to prevent the militants
returning to border areas after the withdrawal of the Turkish
soldiers. Air attacks on PKK targets in northern  Iraq  are
carried out more frequently, including in the past month.  Turkish troops are engaged in a major offensive to clear
pockets of militants in the mountainous southeast before winter
sets in, Hurriyet newspaper said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
