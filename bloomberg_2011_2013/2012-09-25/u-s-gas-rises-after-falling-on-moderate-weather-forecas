Natural gas futures extended gains
in  New York  on speculation that increased demand from
electricity generators because of fuel switching will help
reduce a supply surplus.  Natural gas for October delivery rose as much as 1 percent
to $2.952 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and sold for
$2.944 at 11 a.m. Singapore time. The more-actively traded
November contract rose as much as 0.6 percent to $3.124.  The October contract, which expires today, increased 8.7
cents yesterday to $2.924 per million Btu, the highest
settlement price since Sept. 14. The futures are down 1.5
percent this year.  Power plants  have consumed 27.3 billion cubic feet of gas a
day this month, up 21 percent from the same period a year ago,
data from LCI Energy Insight in El Paso, Texas, show. A supply
glut has eased as electricity generators burned more gas instead
of coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
