Crude oil call options increased
more than puts on speculation that prices will rise.  Implied volatility on calls protecting against a 10 percent
rise climbed to 31.2 percent from 30.8 percent yesterday. Puts

Bloomberg at 3:20 p.m.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.47 percent as of 2:31 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 31.02 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 56 cents to settle at
$91.37 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
