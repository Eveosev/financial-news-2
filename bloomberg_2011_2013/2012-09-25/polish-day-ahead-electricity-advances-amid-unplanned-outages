Polish power for next-day delivery
advanced amid unplanned outages of generating units.  Power for tomorrow  increased 1.2 percent to 193.37 zloty
($60.68) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since Sept. 18.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility, had an unplanned halt at
a 380-megawatt Belchatow facility, the company said today. In
addition,  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  and  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  halted two
power units with a combined capacity of 353 megawatts due to
unspecified malfunctions, according to PSE Operator SA, which
runs the grid.  Next-day contracts on the Czech and Slovak markets settled
8.5 percent higher at 49.18 euros ($63.75) a megawatt-hour in a
daily auction, according to the countries’ market operators.
Electricity for the next day in  Hungary  slumped 16 percent to
52.59 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
