Zimbabwe Platinum Mines, a unit of
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , faces at least $33.8 million in
tax liabilities from revised revenue-authority assessments.  “The company may be liable for additional interest and
penalties,” Guernsey-based Zimplats said today in a statement.  The company’s budget contribution in direct and employee
taxes in the fourth quarter ended June 30 was $23 million, the
company said July 31. It produced 182,100 ounces of platinum
“in matte” from three underground mines for the fiscal year.  Zimbabwe has been pushing mining companies to meet rules to
sell 51 percent of domestic operations to locals. Zimplats said
in March it presented an acceptable plan. Empowerment Minister
 Saviour Kasukuwere  said on Sept. 19 platinum mining companies
including Zimplats were compliant. Impala declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
