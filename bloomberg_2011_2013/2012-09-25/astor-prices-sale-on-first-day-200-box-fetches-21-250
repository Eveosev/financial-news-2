A bronze figure of a six-headed
Tibetan deity that belonged to Brooke Astor and was expected to
sell for $2,500 to $3,500 went for $134,500 yesterday at
 Sotheby’s. (BID)   “I was going to bid on it, but it went through the roof,”
said Philip Marshall, Astor’s grandson, as a two-day auction of
the  New York  philanthropist’s property got under way. “It’s her
provenance.”  The items come from Astor’s former Park Avenue duplex and
Westchester mansion, Holly Hill. The proceeds will benefit her
favorite charities, including the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art,
the  New York Public Library , the  Animal Medical Center  and New
York schools. Astor died in 2007 at the age of 105.  The auction house estimated that the 901 lots would tally
between $6.6 million and $9.7 million. Sales reached $6.7
million by the end of the first of four parts.  The top lot yesterday was “A Memlook Bey,  Egypt ,” an 1868
oil on panel by John Frederick Lewis, which fetched $1.6
million, more than three times its high estimate of $500,000.  The prices include the buyer’s premium; the estimates do
not.  A drawing by Giovanni Antoni Canal, known as Canaletto,
sold for $1.2 million, surging past its presale estimate range
of $300,000 to $500,000.  “The Deer and the Lady, with Punchinello” by Giovanni
Domenico Tiepolo brought $722,500, also surpassing its high
estimate.  Bargains Fade  Items that seemed like bargains before the sale quickly
rose in price. A giltwood box shaped as a pile of logs was
estimated between $200 and $400; it sold for $21,250. A small
ivory elephant adorned with rubies, emeralds and gold fetched
$68,500, more than 10 times its low estimate.  A lot comprising two Chinese famille-rose boxes and covers
of the Qianlong period fetched $494,500, almost 50 times their
low estimate of $10,000.”  Astor’s numerous dog paintings and jewels are coming on the
auction block today.  A Bulgari diamond necklace featuring 13 emerald drops is
estimated between $250,000 and $350,000. An enlarged photograph
of Astor wearing the necklace while standing next to former
President  Lyndon B. Johnson  at a Plaza Hotel dinner dance was
hung in the salesroom, along with photos of Astor and former
President  Bill Clinton  and  Princess Diana .  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on country
