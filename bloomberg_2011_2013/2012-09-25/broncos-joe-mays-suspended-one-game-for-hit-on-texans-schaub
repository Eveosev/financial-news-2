Denver Broncos linebacker Joe Mays
was suspended for one game and fined $50,000 by the  National
Football League  for a hit that left Houston Texans quarterback
 Matt Schaub  missing a chunk of his left ear.  Mays will miss Denver’s Sept. 30 home game against the
Oakland Raiders, and isn’t permitted to practice with the
Broncos this week or be at the team’s facility. The fifth-year
player started the Broncos’ first three games.  Mays received a roughing-the-passer penalty for his hit to
Schaub’s head during the third quarter of the Texans’ 31-25 win
over the Broncos on Sept. 23. A bloodied Schaub came out for one
play after that hit and then returned to throw his fourth
touchdown pass of the game about 10 minutes later.  “I just lost a little piece of my ear,” Schaub told
reporters after the game. “I was bleeding and my helmet came
off so I had to come out for a play, but I was fine.”  Mays, 27, apologized to Schaub after the game. Mays was
fined $7,875 by the NFL last week for a roughing-the-passer
penalty against Atlanta Falcons quarterback  Matt Ryan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
