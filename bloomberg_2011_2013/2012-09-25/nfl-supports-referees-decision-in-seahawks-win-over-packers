The  National Football League  said
it supported the referees’ decision that gave the  Seattle 
Seahawks a 14-12 final-play victory last night over the  Green
Bay Packers .  With the Seahawks trailing 12-7 on fourth down from the
Packers’ 24-yard line, quarterback Russell Wilson lofted a pass
into the end zone that was grabbed by Green Bay defender M.D.
Jennings. As the Packers’ safety brought the ball to his chest,
Seahawks receiver Golden Tate reached in and grabbed it as both
players fell to the ground.  One official ruled it a touchdown for the Seahawks, while a
second standing behind the play gave the signal for a touchback
because of an interception. The play stood as a touchdown, even
after a video review on the field.  The NFL said the officials missed a pass interference call
on Tate while the ball was in the air, but that the video showed
a simultaneous catch.  NFL rules state that if two players gain control of a ball
simultaneously, the offensive team retains possession. Televised  replays indicated that Jennings had control of the ball before
Tate reached in to grab it. The rules say a catch isn’t
simultaneous if one player gains control first and a second
player then gains joint possession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
