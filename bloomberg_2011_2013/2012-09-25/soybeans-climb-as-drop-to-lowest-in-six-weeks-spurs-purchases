Soybeans rose on speculation that a
slump to the lowest price in six weeks may boost demand from
importers. Corn and wheat climbed.  Soybeans fell 9.4 percent since the U.S. drought spurred a
jump to a record $17.89 a bushel Sept. 4, as harvesting
accelerated and demand slowed. U.S. exporters sold less than a
third of the soybeans in the week ended Sept. 13 than a week
earlier, the government said Sept. 20.  China , the world’s
biggest soybean buyer, cut imports by 0.8 percent in August,
compared with a year earlier, after boosting purchases 9.5
percent in July, the Beijing-based Customs General
Administration said Sept. 21.  “The bean market has been soft as of late as traders eye
better-than-expected yields throughout much of the Corn Belt,”
Joseph Vaclavik, the president of Standard Grain Inc. in
 Chicago , said today in an e-mailed report. “Chatter of China
soybean purchases this morning” supported the market, he said.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
$16.2375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:47 p.m. in
 London . Prices fell to $15.9025 yesterday, the lowest since Aug.
14. Corn for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $7.49 a
bushel.  About 22 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was  harvested  as
of Sept. 23, more than the previous five-year average of 8
percent, the USDA said yesterday. Thirty-nine percent of corn
was harvested, above the five-year average of 13 percent.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.6 percent to $8.9725 a
bushel in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat
rose 0.6 percent to 262 euros ($339.62) a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. The price is up 34 percent this year on speculation that
 Russia , last season’s third-largest shipper, will institute
export restrictions after dry weather hurt crops this year.  Russian Prices  Prices of Russian wheat for export climbed to about $340
per ton this week, reaching the highest since the collapse of
the  Soviet Union  more than two decades ago, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies, or Ikar, said today.  Egypt , the
world’s biggest wheat importer, bought 235,000 tons of the grain
from Russia, France and Ukraine in a tender Sept. 13.  “The market continues to look to Egyptian tenders for
further confirmation of an already well-telegraphed Russian exit
from the market,” Jaime Nolan-Miralles, a commodity risk
manager with INTL FCStone Inc. in Dublin, said in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
