Serbia appointed three central bank
vice-governors today, confirming two current members and naming
one new official, seven weeks after amending legislation that
gave parliament control of the institution.  Parliament approved  Diana Dragutinovic  and Ana Gligorijevic, who were already serving as vice-governors, while
Veselin Pjescic will be in charge of monetary operations,
according to today’s voting results from the Belgrade based
legislature. Dragutinovic will remain in charge of financial
stability and Gligorijevic international relations.  Serbia restored parliamentary control of the Narodna Banka
Srbije for the first time since the ouster of  Slobodan Milosevic 
in 2000, a move criticized by the International Monetary Fund,
the  World Bank  and the European Union, Serbia’s three biggest
lenders and investors.  As a result, the former governor, one vice-governor and
four of five council members resigned. Parliament appointed
Jorgovanka Tabakovic, vice president of the ruling Progressive
Party, as the governor on Aug. 6. The law, adopted on Aug. 4,
gave a 90-day deadline for all appointments, including members
of the Governor’s Council.  The IMF, which suspended a $1.3 billion precautionary loan
in February on evidence the government was slipping on agreed
deficit and debt targets, told  Serbia  on Sept. 14 it will watch
how the country manages its public finances and central bank
autonomy before agreeing to a new loan program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
