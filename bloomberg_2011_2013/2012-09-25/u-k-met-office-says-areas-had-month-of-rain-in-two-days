Heavy rains swamped parts of the
U.K. with more than a month’s worth of rain in the past two
days, and northern  England  is still at risk of further flooding.  Ravensworth, North Yorkshire, had 107.8 millimeters (4.2
inches) of precipitation from Sept. 23 at 1 a.m. until 8 a.m.
today, more than twice the amount the area normally receives in
all of September, the national weather forecaster said today in
a  report  on its website. The U.K. Environment Agency has issued
60 flood warnings and 151 alerts after river levels rose
following heavy rain, it said in a separate  statement .  “Our teams have been out around-the-clock over the last
few days to minimize the risks and prepare for flooding,” David
Jordan, director of operations at the Environment Agency, said
in the statement. “We urge people to keep up-to-date with the
weather forecast and remain prepared for flooding.”  Parts of Northumberland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria and
County Durham in northern England were still at risk of floods,
the Environment Agency said. More than 200 properties across the
country have flooded since yesterday.  “Large totals” of rain have been measured from  Northern
Ireland  to southwestern England, the  Met Office  said. More than
98 millimeters fell in Killylane in Northern Ireland since Sept.
23, and about 76 millimeters were reported in Clwyd, a county in
 Wales , it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
