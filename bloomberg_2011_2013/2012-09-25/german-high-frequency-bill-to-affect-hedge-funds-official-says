Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet
will vote on a bill tomorrow that limits high-frequency trading
even for market participants outside Germany and requires
automated orders to be marked as such, a government official
said.  High-frequency traders will have to seek authorization and
will be supervised under the legislation proposal, the official
told reporters in Berlin today on condition of anonymity because
the bill has not yet been published. High-frequency trade will
be curbed and market abuse will be punished, he said in Berlin.  Own-account high-frequency traders such as  hedge funds ,
which don’t need authorization at present, will be covered by
the new legislation, the official said. That would affect market
participants borrowing access to electronic trading systems from
others, he said.  Germany  is moving ahead of European attempts to regulate
high-frequency trading as it did in the case of short-selling
bans, the official said. Still, the government is seeking to
make German legislation compatible with later European rules, he
said.  Market participants will have to mark orders based on
algorithms for regulators to be better able to identify mistakes
and manipulation, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
