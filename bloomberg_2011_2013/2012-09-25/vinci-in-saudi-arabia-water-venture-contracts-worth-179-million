Vinci SA (DG) ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
said it won contracts worth at least 110 million pounds ($179
million) in a venture with Al Muhaidib Contracting Co. from
 Saudi Arabia ’s National Water Co. for a water-storing reservoir
and treated effluent lifting station.  The infrastructure upgrades in the Saudi kingdom are part
of a water initiative by the government that in this case
includes a two-year storage project and station that will
collect treated wastewater from existing plants in an
underground well and pumping station, Vinci Construction UK,
part of the Paris-based parent company, said in a statement.  The National Water Co. “has embarked on a robust program
to improve and develop the water and wastewater services in
major cities in the kingdom which include Riyadh, Jeddah, Mecca
and Taif,” its chief executive officer, Loay Al-Musallam, said
in the statement.  The contracts are for work on the Briman strategic water
reservoir and the Al Khumra lifting station, according to
today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
