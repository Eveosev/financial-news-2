The Philippines and China agreed to
prevent further worsening of their relations even as both
reiterated claims on a disputed territory, the Southeast Asian
nation’s Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said today.  “Irritants continue to be present,” Roxas told a
televised briefing in Manila, adding Chinese ships remain in
Scarborough Shoal, an area being claimed by both nations. Roxas
met with Vice President  Xi Jinping  last week and he said the
discussions ended with a mutual expression of sovereignty. Back-
door talks with China helped ease tensions, President  Benigno
Aquino  said on Sept. 21.  “I don’t expect much progress in the interim until that
leadership change has been completed,” Roxas said, referring to
China’s leadership transition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
