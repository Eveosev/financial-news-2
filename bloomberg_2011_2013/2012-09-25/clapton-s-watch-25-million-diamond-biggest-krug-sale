A diamond estimated at as much $25
million and a platinum  Patek Philippe  watch owned by  Eric Clapton  are to be auctioned in  Switzerland .  The Archduke Joseph Diamond is the star lot of a Christie’s
International sale at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues,
Geneva, on Nov. 13. The guitarist’s 1987 perpetual calendar
chronograph with moon phases is up for sale the day before
valued at 4 million Swiss francs ($4.27 million).  “The best diamonds have become extraordinarily valuable,”
Geoffrey Munn, managing director of the London-based jeweler
 Wartski , said in an interview. “There’s a sense at the moment
that money is like sand running through fingers and there’s a
scramble to buy jewels as a hedge.”  The diamond was originally sourced from the Golconda mines
in  India , which produced the 105.6-carat Koh-i-Noor of the U.K.
Crown Jewels.  Internally flawless and weighing 76.02 carats, this
colorless stone is the largest perfect Golconda diamond to have
appeared at auction, Christie’s said in an e-mailed statement.
It has a low estimate of $15 million.  The upper valuation of $328,861 per carat is a record for a
colorless diamond.  The diamond is named after Archduke Joseph August of
 Austria  (1872-1962), a member of the royal House of Habsburg,
whose family owned the stone until the 1930s.  It was last seen at auction in November 1993, when it sold
for 9.7 million Swiss francs. The identity of current owner
hasn’t been divulged by Christie’s.  Colored Diamonds  Though Golconda’s colorless stones are famed for their
purity, colored diamonds have so far set the highest auction
prices.  “They are rarer and more popular,” Munn said.  A 24.78-carat fancy intense pink diamond was bought by the
London jeweler  Laurence Graff  for a record 45.4 million Swiss
francs at a Sotheby’s sale in Geneva in November 2010.  In the Nov. 12 Christie’s sale, Patek Philippe dominates
the roster of high-value lots including Clapton’s watch and
another platinum chronometer with a similar valuation.  From a different owner, it was made in 1952 for J.B.
Champion, one of the Swiss watchmaker’s best-known clients.  Clapton is also selling a Gerhard Richter painting. The
1994 oil-on-canvas “Abstraktes Bild (809-4)” estimated at as
much as 12 million pounds ($19.4 million) in Sotheby’s
contemporary art auction in London on Oct. 12.  Krug Sale  The champagne house  Krug  will offer the largest consignment
of wines directly from its cellars at an auction in December.  Sotheby’s (BID)  Dec. 1 sale in  New York  will include 530 bottles
in various formats from the Reims-based champagne maker.
Spanning 40 years, the wines are estimated to raise a total
amount of $350,000 to $500,000.  The offering will include a 12-bottle case of 1990 Krug
Clos de Mesnil, priced at more than $20,000, and a single bottle
of the house’s 1961 “Collection” champagne, marked at $2,000
to $3,000.  Brient’s Art  Contemporary artworks owned by the French collector  Marcel
Brient  sold in Paris for 5.1 million euros ($6.6 million).  Sotheby’s was auctioning 78 pieces by French artists from
the Paris-based collector’s holdings on Sept. 24. The sale,
estimated to raise 2.5 million euros to 3 million euros, found
buyers for 94 percent of the lots.  Brient has amassed one of  France ’s most comprehensive and
eclectic private collections of contemporary art. He was among
the first to buy pieces by  Jeff Koons , Takashi Murakami and
Chinese “Political Pop” artists.  His attempts to open a private museum in a former factory
at Montreuil-sous-Bois, France, have been thwarted by technical
difficulties and legal disputes.  The night’s top price was the record 720,750 euros paid for
the 1969 blue-and-white painting “Study” by Simon Hantai, a
member of the avant-garde “Support/Surface” movement. Made by
folding and unfolding pigment-saturated canvas, it sold to a
telephone bidder, beating a high estimate of 350,000 euros.  A further 432,750 euros was given for an untitled 1987 Joan Mitchell diptych, valued at 120,000 euros to 180,000 euros. The
1960 sculpture “Tree” by Martial Raysse, made out of plastic
bottles, sold for 216,750 euros, just beating the low estimate.  Muse highlights include  Ryan Sutton  on New York dining,
 Rich Jaroslovsky  on technology and  Amanda Gordon’s  Scene Last
Night.  To contact the writer on the story:
