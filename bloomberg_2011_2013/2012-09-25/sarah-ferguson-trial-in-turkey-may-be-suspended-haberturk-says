The prosecution of Britain’s
Duchess of York for taking part in the secret filming of two
orphanages in  Turkey  in 2008 may be suspended because of changes
to the law, Haberturk said, citing a petition by her lawyer.  Sarah Ferguson , the former wife of Britain’s Prince Andrew,
should benefit from recent legal amendments that have reduced
prison terms for crimes committed through the media, giving the
court a reason to halt the trial, Haberturk said, citing
Ferguson’s lawyer Cansu Sahin.  Sahin said a proposed out-of-court settlement was still
being negotiated, Haberturk reported. If tried under the new
regulations, she would face a maximum of five years in prison,
subject to postponement unless she commits a repeat offense in
Turkey, the newspaper said. The previous law could have led to a
sentence of as much as 22.5 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
