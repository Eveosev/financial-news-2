KGHM SA, the European copper
producer with the biggest mine output, plans to change its
dividend policy, Puls Biznesu reported, citing CEO  Herbert Wirth .  KGHM may link its  payout  to free cash flow rather than net
income, the newspaper wrote. “Average dividend yield in the
industry is 3 percent to 6 percent maximum, compared to our more
than 20 percent,” Puls  cited  Wirth as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
