Life Partners Holdings Inc. and its
Life Partners unit won a ruling by a  Texas  judge that the
interests it sells in life insurance policy settlements aren’t
securities covered by state law.  Judge Stephen Yelenosky denied state Attorney General  Greg Abbott ’s bid for an order blocking the Waco-based businesses
from selling those policy interests after a two-day hearing at
the Travis County District Court in Austin. Yelenosky said he
would issue a written order later.  Abbott alleged in a lawsuit last month that Life Partners
was deceiving buyers of the settlement interests about the life
expectancies of people insured under the policies. The company
denied those claims and said two prior courts had already
decided the securities issue in its favor.  “I don’t think this is a security under Texas law,”
Yelenosky said before hearing any defense testimony at today’s
proceeding. “Maybe I understand why it should be a security,
but that’s not the question,” he said.  Scott Peden, president of Life Partners Inc. and general
counsel of Life Partners Holdings, said after the hearing,
“We’re very pleased with the result and are pleased to see that
justice was done.”  Peden and Chief Executive Officer Brian Pardo were also
named as defendants in the attorney general’s complaint.  Abbott will appeal the ruling, his spokeswoman, Lauren
Bean, said in an e-mailed statement.  “Life Partners is charged with defrauding thousands of
investors in violation of the Texas Securities Act. The
defendants are attempting to evade state oversight by arguing
that its products are not securities -- a claim that is
inconsistent with prior U.S. Supreme Court precedent,” Bean
said.  The case is Texas v.  Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI) , D-1-GV-
12-001128, District Court of Travis County, Texas, 201st
Judicial District (Austin).  To contact the reporter on this story:
