(Corrects month of  consumer confidence  report in first
paragraph.)  Gasoline advanced as U.S.  home
prices  rose more than expected in July and American consumer
confidence jumped to a seven-month high in September.  Futures gained as the S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property
values in 20 cities increased 1.2 percent from July 2011, the
biggest 12-month jump since August 2010, a report from the group
showed today in  New York . Gasoline widened gains after the
Conference Board’s  index  of consumer confidence increased to
70.3 from 61.3 in August.  “We’ve gotten a break in gasoline prices lately and now a
rebound in home prices and those two factors are making people
feel a little bit better,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 3.57 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.9533 a gallon at 11:29 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The  median  forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 1.1 percent gain in housing prices.  The group’s measure of  present conditions  increased to a
five-month high of 50.2 from 46.5 in August. The measure of
 expectations  for the next six months advanced to 83.7, the
highest since February, from 71.1.  The portion of respondents in the Conference Board survey
expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months
climbed to 18.5 percent, the highest since February, from 15.8
percent the previous month. The proportion of consumers who
expect their incomes to rise over the next six months rose to
16.3 percent, the highest level this year, from 16 percent in
August.  Stocks Gain  Stocks extended gains after the figures, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  advancing 0.4 percent to 1,462.29 at 11:17
a.m. in New York.  “That report was clearly bullish,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.
“Stocks ticked up and so did the oil market.”  Futures were up before the two reports as crude oil rose
after Fars, Iran’s state-run news agency, reported that Iran
fired four missiles in the  Persian Gulf  as part of a war game.
Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is scheduled to speak
before the UN tomorrow, said in a U.S. television interview
yesterday his nation will defend itself if attacked by Israel.  “The oil market was supported when we saw that Iran fired
some test missiles over the weekend,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Now, the
U.S. economic numbers have provided some measure of support to
the oil market.”  Regular gasoline at the pump rose 0.2 cent to $3.81 a
gallon yesterday, AAA  data  show. It was the first increase in 11
days. Prices reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  October-delivery heating oil advanced 1.67 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.1154 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
