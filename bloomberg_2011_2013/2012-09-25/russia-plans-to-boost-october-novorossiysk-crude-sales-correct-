(Corrects increase in first paragraph.)  Russia , the worldâ€™s largest energy
exporter, plans to boost crude shipments from Novorossiysk on
the  Black Sea  by 16 percent to the most in four months, a
preliminary loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Crude shipments from the port will be 3.74 million metric
tons next month, up from 3.226 million tons in September,
according to the schedule. The Novorossiysk shipments include
three 80,000-ton lots of Siberian Light grade. The remaining 32
cargoes, totaling 3.5 million tons, are Urals blend.  Russia will reduce Urals sales from the Baltic Sea port of
Primorsk to 56 Urals cargoes in October, the plan showed.  The shipping program for Primorsk comprises 55 cargoes of
100,000 tons each and one of 105,000 tons, for a total of 5.605
million tons. That is 300,000 tons less than this month.  Urals exports from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea  will be 21
cargoes totaling 2.1 million tons in October, up from 2 million
tons in September, the plan showed.  The final schedule will be released later this month.
Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
