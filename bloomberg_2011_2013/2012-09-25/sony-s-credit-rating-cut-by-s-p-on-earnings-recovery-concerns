Sony Corp. (6758) , reeling from four
straight annual  losses , had its  credit rating  lowered one level
by  Standard & Poor’s  because of concerns about an earnings
recovery by the Japanese consumer-electronics maker.  The company’s long-term  ratings  were lowered to BBB, S&P’s
second-lowest investment grade, from BBB+, the ratings company
said in a statement today. The outlook was set at negative,
reflecting a view that ratings may be cut again in the absence
of “solid signs of recovery” in Sony’s credit quality within a
year, S&P said.  Sony cut its annual profit forecast 33 percent last month
as it suffered from slowing demand and a strong yen. A recovery
in the earnings of Sony’s main consumer-electronics businesses
will remain slow, and there are downside risks in the
businesses, S&P said.  It’s the second downgrade for Sony this year by the S&P,
which cut the Tokyo-based company’s ratings in February one
level from A-.  Moody’s Investors Service on Aug. 6 placed the company’s
credit ratings on review for downgrade, citing weaker demand and
a stronger yen. The maker of Cyber-shot cameras and Bravia TVs
had its long-term rating already cut one level by Moody’s in
January.  Sony shares rose 0.2 percent to close at 969 yen in Tokyo
today, compared with a 0.3 percent advance by the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
