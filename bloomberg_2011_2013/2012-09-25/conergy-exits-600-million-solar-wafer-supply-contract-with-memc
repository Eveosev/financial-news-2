Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar
manufacturer that’s restructuring its operations, canceled a
supply agreement with  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  and will
pay a $21 million early-termination fee to the U.S. provider of
polysilicon wafers.  The agreement, which dates to 2007 and was supposed to run
until 2018, was worth about $600 million, Hamburg-based Conergy
said today in a statement. Conergy no longer produces solar
cells and doesn’t need to buy blank wafers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
