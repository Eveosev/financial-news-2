Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened on
speculation exporters are converting overseas earnings as the
end of the month approaches.  Government bonds  were steady.  Global funds bought $142 million more local stocks than
they sold today, taking net purchases in September to $1.8
billion, according to exchange data.  Industrial production  rose
1.89 percent last month from a year earlier, the most since
February, official data showed yesterday. Export orders declined
in August for a sixth month, a report showed last week.  “Volume’s a bit thin today, it’s mostly trade-related as
exporters sell the greenback,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-
exchange trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “Although
we’re seeing some improvements in industrial output data,
exports numbers need to turn positive as well to give sentiment
a boost.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.451 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency reached NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level
since May 3. One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1
percent to NT$29.340, a 0.4 percent premium to the spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 was 1.171 percent, compared with 1.175 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight money-
market rate  was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
