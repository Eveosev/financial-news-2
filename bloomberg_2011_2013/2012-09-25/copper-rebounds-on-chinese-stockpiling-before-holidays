Copper rallied from the lowest
level in more than a week as Chinese users bought the metal to
replenish stockpiles ahead of a week-long holiday.  The metal for delivery in three months climbed as much as
0.8 percent to $8,244 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange
before trading at $8,225 by 2:27 p.m. in Shanghai. December
futures rose 0.4 percent to $3.7445 a pound on the Comex.  “There is a bit of stockpiling need ahead of the long
holiday next week,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai
CIFCO Futures Co. “Copper seems to be capped in range-bound
trade with  China  and  Europe  being the main downside risks and a
global deficit this year underpinning prices.”  Markets in China will be closed next week for the National
Day holiday. A leading index for  China’s economy  rose 1.7
percent in August from July to 240.4, the biggest rise in seven
months, the Conference Board, a New York-based research group,
said in a statement today, citing a preliminary reading. That
compared with a revised 0.6 percent gain in the previous month.  Copper stockpiles in bonded warehouses in Shanghai are
about 650,000 tons, according to the median estimates from nine
traders, analysts and warehouse managers, with five saying the
current level is a record. The January-delivery contract rose
0.3 percent to 59,230  yuan  ($9,397) a ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange.  Aluminum, tin and nickel gained in London, while zinc
declined and lead was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
