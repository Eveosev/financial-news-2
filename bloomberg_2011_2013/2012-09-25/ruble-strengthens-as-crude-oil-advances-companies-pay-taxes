The ruble climbed as companies
bought the currency to pay taxes and oil advanced, boosting the
outlook for the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The ruble added 0.6 percent to 30.9600 by 7 p.m. in Moscow
and gained 0.3 percent versus the euro to 40.1050. The currency
was up 0.5 percent against the central bank’s target euro-dollar
basket.  Crude in  New York  rose 0.8 percent to $92.64 per barrel.
Oil and gas account for about 50 percent of  Russia ’s state
revenue. Russian companies are paying about 400 billion rubles
($12.9 billion) of taxes this week, including mineral extraction
and profit levies, according to Moscow-based ZAO Raiffeisenbank.  “The main factors influencing the ruble appreciation today
are the recovery of  oil prices  and exporters’ converting revenue
before tax payment,” Maria Pomelnikova, a macroeconomist at ZAO
Raiffeisenbank, said by e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.4405 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5975 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  fell four basis points to 206,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
three basis points to 7.610 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
