Oil fell to the lowest level in
seven weeks after a report showed rising U.S. stockpiles and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser 
said a new stimulus plan probably won’t boost economic growth.  Futures slid as much as 1.6 percent, temporarily falling
below $90 a barrel for the first time since Aug. 3 on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. The  American Petroleum Institute  said
crude supplies increased 335,000 barrels, a third weekly gain,
while Citigroup Inc. cut its global demand forecasts. Bond
purchases announced by the Fed this month probably won’t spur
expansion or hiring, Plosser said in a speech yesterday. Oil
surged to $100.42 a barrel on Sept. 14, its highest this year,
after the  Federal Open Market Committee  said it will undertake a
third round of quantitative easing.  “The quantitative easing euphoria has eased,” Ole Hansen,
senior manager of trading advisory at Saxo Bank A/S, said by
phone from Copenhagen. “Renewed worries, especially in  Spain ,
are putting the focus back onto global growth and the potential
for subdued demand for oil.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as $1.45 to $89.92
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $89.96 at 1:16 p.m. London time. Futures
slid 56 cents to $91.37 yesterday, the lowest close since Aug.
2. They are down 8.2 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement dropped $1.87, or 1.7
percent, to $108.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to West
Texas Intermediate in New York was at $18.62, compared with a
close of $19.08.  Crude Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles rose to 361.8 million barrels last
week, the highest since the week ended Aug. 24, the API said. An
Energy Department report today may show inventories climbed  1.9
million barrels , according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies gained 112,000 barrels last week, the API
said. They are projected to increase  500,000 barrels , according
to the survey. Distillate inventories, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, fell 483,000 barrels compared with a
forecast gain of 500,000.  The industry-funded API collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  Libya  is training former rebels to protect oil
installations across the North African nation, the head of the
country’s state oil company said.  Libya Recruits  The ministry of defense is training 10,339 citizens and
militiamen who took part in the revolt that ousted the regime of
 Muammar Qaddafi  last year, National Oil Corp. Chairman Nuri Berruien said yesterday in a telephone interview in the capital,
Tripoli. They will join an existing force of 2,500 security
workers by the end of the year, he said.  Citigroup cut its oil-demand outlook on a slowdown in
nations outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Consumption will climb to 89.7 million barrels a
day this year from 89.1 million in 2011, less than a July
projection of 90.1 million, Edward L. Morse, the bank’s global
head of commodities research in New York, said in an e-mailed
report yesterday. Demand in 2013 will rise to 90.7 million
barrels a day, compared with a previous estimate of 91 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
