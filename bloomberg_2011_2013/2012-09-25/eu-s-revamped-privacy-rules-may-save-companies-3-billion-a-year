Companies could save as much as 2.3
billion euros ($3 billion) in administrative costs thanks to
an overhaul of the European Union’s data-protection rules, the
EU’s justice chief said.  The proposed changes to the EU’s 17-year-old data
protection rules will allow companies to do business in  Europe 
based on “just one law” and the savings they could make “is
not peanuts,” EU Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  said in
prepared remarks for a speech in Dublin, Ireland, today.
Companies will save a further 130 million euros every year by
not having to notify authorities “each and every time data is
processed.”  Under the European Commission’s January proposal, companies
face fines as high as 2 percent of yearly global sales for
mishandling or losing personal data. The plans would also reduce
the number of regulators a company needs to contact for data-
protection issues across the region as the regulator of its home
base will become a “one-stop shop.” In practice, this will
mean that Ireland’s agency will be in charge of regulating
companies like  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB) , which run their
European operations from the country.  Ireland will take over the rotating EU presidency for six
months in January 2013.  “As home to many innovative firms dealing with a lot of
personal data, Ireland has a key role to play in shaping the new
rules,” Reding said in her speech. “I am very pleased to see
the priority Ireland wants to give these proposals during its
six-month stewardship of the EU next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
