Treasury 30-year bonds rose for a
seventh day, the longest streak in almost four years, after
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President  Charles Plosser  said
the central bank’s new debt purchases probably won’t boost
economic growth.  U.S. government securities advanced as risk appetite waned
amid bets  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening. Gains were tempered
by data showing U.S.  consumer confidence  and  home prices  climbed
and as the U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year debt in the first
of three note auctions this week totaling $99 billion. The Fed
said Sept. 13 it will buy $40 billion a month of mortgage-backed
securities to boost the economy and cut unemployment.  “The market is still bid, and we are seeing more of the
same with respect to concern over global growth,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New York  of government-debt
trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors. “The reality is we are
still looking at a very slow global growth and a lot of
uncertainty.”  The 30-year  bond yield  dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.85 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Its seven-day decline
was the longest since the eight days ended Dec. 4, 2008. The
price of the 2.75 percent security due in August 2042 rose 1, or
$10 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 03/32.  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  fell four basis points to
1.67 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 11. The current two-
year note  yield  was little changed at 0.26 percent.  Auction Yield  The auction of two-year notes drew a  yield  of 0.273
percent, matching the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The record sale
low was 0.220 in July. Today’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered,
was 3.60, versus an average of 3.78 at the past 10 sales.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.1 percent, after
rising 0.4 percent earlier.  Plosser said a speech today in Philadelphia that the new
bond buying probably won’t increase hiring and may hurt the
central bank’s credibility.  Economic research indicates that additional asset purchases
are “unlikely to reduce long-term interest rates by a
significant amount” and that lowering rates “by a few more
basis points” won’t spur growth and hiring, said Plosser, who
doesn’t have a vote on policy this year. The  U.S. economy   is
growing “at a moderate pace” and probably will expand by about
3 percent in 2013 and 2014, he said.  Mortgage Bonds  The Fed said Sept. 13 it will buy mortgage bonds until the
economic recovery is well-established. It also extended pledge
to keep its benchmark  interest rate  at virtually zero until 2015
to support economic growth and lower an  unemployment rate  stuck
above 8 percent for 43 months.  “The Fed’s decision to buy MBS has created some
interesting changes in market dynamics,” said Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc.,
which as a primary dealer is required to bid at U.S. debt
offerings. “The market is still trying to find its way in this
new environment.”  At today’s auction,  indirect bidders , an investor category
that includes foreign central banks, bought 27.2 percent of the
securities, compared with an average of 31.7 percent at the past
10 offerings.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly the sale, bought 17.5 percent, versus an
average of 11.6 percent for the past 10 auctions.  More Auctions  The Treasury is due to auction $35 billion of five-year
securities tomorrow and will sell $29 billion of seven-year
notes on Sept. 27.  Two-year notes have returned 0.2 percent this year,
compared with a 1.9 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 1.5 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall rose 9.8 percent.  Treasuries traded at the most expensive level in almost
three weeks. The 10-year term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed that includes expectations for interest
rates, growth and inflation, was negative 0.92 percent, the most
costly since Sept. 5. A negative reading indicates investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The
average for 2012 is negative 0.74 percent.  Bonds rallied earlier today after Spanish borrowing costs
rose at a debt sale, boosted speculation  Spain  may soon ask the
 European Central Bank   for a rescue through its bond-purchase
program. The  International Monetary Fund  said the outlook for
 Greece  worsened.  ‘At Forefront’  “Europe is still at the forefront as far as the concerns
for the market,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at the primary
dealer Societe Generale SA in New York.  Treasuries pared those gains after the Conference Board’s
index of consumer  confidence  increased to 70.3 in September, a
seven-month high, from 61.3 in August, figures from the New
York-based private research group showed today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 63.1.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 cities rose
1.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month
advance since August 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
