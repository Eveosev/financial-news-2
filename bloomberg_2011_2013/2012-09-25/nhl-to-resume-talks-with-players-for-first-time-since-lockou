The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ union will resume talks on a collective bargaining
agreement on Sept. 28, the first meeting since management
imposed a lockout.  The site for the meeting wasn’t disclosed in an e-mail from
NHL spokesman John Dellapina.  The two sides haven’t held a formal contract discussion
since Sept. 12, when the league and players rejected each
other’s latest proposals.  NHL owners locked out players on Sept. 16 following the
expiration of the league’s collective bargaining agreement. The
league then canceled preseason games through Sept. 30 and is
preparing for a four-day work week starting Oct. 1.  The regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 11.  The two sides are at odds over revenue sharing and player
compensation. The NHL made a record $3.2 billion in revenue last
season.  This is the third lockout in a North American sports league
since March 2011. The  National Football League  missed one
preseason game while negotiating a labor accord last year, and
the  National Basketball Association  canceled regular-season
games before an agreement was reached in late November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
