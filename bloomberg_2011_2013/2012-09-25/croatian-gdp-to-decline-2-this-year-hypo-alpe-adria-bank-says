Croatia’s economy will contract 2
percent this year, as industry and investment falter on  Europe ’s
crisis, the Croatian unit of  Austria ’s Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG said.  Gross domestic product next year will drop 1.5 percent,
while average inflation will be 3.1 percent in 2012 and slow to
2.8 percent in 2013, Hrvoje Stojic, Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank d.d.’s
chief economist, told a financial conference in Zagreb today.  “Despite the solid tourist season, we maintain the
forecast for a 2 percent contraction this year as investment
continues to decline and external circumstances are
deteriorating,” he said.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which is set to become the
European Union’s 28th member in July 2013, is struggling to
revive its economy after two years of recession and a period of
stagnation in 2011. Economic output fell 2.2 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, after dropping 1.3 percent
in the first three months.  The  World Bank  estimated Croatia’s economy will shrink 1
percent in 2012, while the  central bank  on July 9 revised its
forecast to a 1.6 percent contraction from a 1 percent decline
forecast in May. The  government  in August said the economy will
stagnate this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
