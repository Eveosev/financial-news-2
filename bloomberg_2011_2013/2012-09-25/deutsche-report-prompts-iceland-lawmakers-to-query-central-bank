Iceland’s legislature will summon
central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson to have him explain an
alleged exemption from the nation’s capital controls granted to
 Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   Parliament’s “committee chairman Helgi Hjorvar has agreed
to summon Governor Mar Gudmundsson before the committee,
although a date has yet to be set,” Lilja Mosesdottir, an
independent member of legislature in Reykjavik who sits on the
nation’s economy and commerce committee, said in a telephone
interview.  Morgunbladid, Iceland’s second-largest newspaper, on Sept.
19 reported that Deutsche Bank had been granted permission to
exchange 15 billion kronur ($122 million) in funds affected by
capital controls. The central bank published a statement the
same day saying the report was “mostly inaccurate.”  No flows that would have any “substantial effect” on the
krona exchange rate have been granted exemption from the capital
controls, the bank said. No foreign exchange has left the island
and the currency reserves haven’t been used to balance any such
transaction, the bank said.  When asked whether kronur affected by the  capital controls 
might have been exchanged without leaving the country, central
bank spokesman Stefan Stefansson declined to comment.
Morgunbladid reporter Hordur Aegisson said by phone last week
that the central bank’s comments won’t prompt him to retract his
article. Deutsche Bank spokesman Christian Streckert declined to
comment today and on the day the article was published.  Conflicting Reports  Parliament is now seeking formal assurance from the central
bank that the capital controls, put in place in 2008 after
Iceland’s banking meltdown sent the krona plunging 80 percent
against the euro offshore, are being unwound within the
framework approved by lawmakers.  Mosesdottir said she’s concerned that the central bank is
caving in to pressure from organizations with bigger financial
clout than Iceland. The nation’s gross domestic product reached
$13.5 billion last year, compared with Deutsche Bank’s market
value of almost $40 billion.  “The central bank needs to do better in its explanations
of what exemptions are available to the capital controls, in
order to avoid people getting the feeling that the controls are
governed with corruption,” Mosesdottir said.  Financial Clout  The central bank is seeking to phase out the controls
gradually through currency auctions by 2015. Iceland is unlikely
to return to a free-float krona and has signaled it will
probably switch to the euro after joining the European Union,
for which it started accession talks in 2010.  A working group consisting of members from the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank , the  International
Monetary Fund  and Icelandic officials are expected to deliver an
interim report on possibilities for removing the capital
controls by year end, Iceland’s  Finance Ministry  said today.  “Iceland is running out of time,” Mosesdottir said.
“There are parties and corporations like Deutsche Bank, whose
market cap is double Iceland’s GDP, that will do anything they
can to exchange their offshore kronur into foreign currencies,
to the detriment of Iceland’s economy. It’s time for Iceland to
sort this out -- we need to be brave.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
