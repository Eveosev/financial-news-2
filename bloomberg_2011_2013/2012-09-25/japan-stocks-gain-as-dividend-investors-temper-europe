Japanese  stocks  advanced as
investors bought shares ahead of deadline for dividend payments.
Gains were limited on concerns that Europe isn’t making progress
on resolving its sovereign debt crisis.  Nitto Denko Corp., one of more than 900 companies on the
Topix Index that will trade without rights to a dividend from
tomorrow, increased 3.3 percent.  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  climbed 4.9
percent on a report an Indian unit may increase car prices.
 Brother Industries Ltd. (6448) , a maker of  office equipment  that relies
on Europe for 28 percent of its sales, slid 1 percent after
German business confidence unexpectedly fell.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.3 percent to 9,091.54
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , after falling as much as 0.5
percent earlier today. Volume on the gauge was more than 20
percent above the 30-day average for the time of day. The
broader Topix Index gained 0.5 percent to 757.66, with three
shares advancing for each that fell.  “Today is the last day to have rights to receive dividends
as of the end of September, so investors are inclined to buy
shares after prices declined,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “What
happens from now on is the deteriorating German confidence will
spread to the real economy, and the euro region’s economy will
contract.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
