It wasn't  the Gettsyburg Address  -- unless it's poker faces we're comparing. Future historians aren't going to be parsing  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's speech   for hidden meanings, and rhetoricians won't be delighting in the majesty of its style and the compression of its effects. It inflamed no passions, as did  Mitt Romney 's words about the  "47 percent,"  and asserted no big idea or thesis, unless there was one contained in the homespun phrase  "money does not grow on trees." But even so, it was very unusual when  India 's introverted, technocratic prime minister appeared on the national channel,  Doordarshan , last week to defend  his government's recent decisions  to raise diesel prices and open up the retail sector to foreign investment. Barring state occasions such as  Independence Day , this was one of the few times in Singh's two terms in office that he had directly addressed the nation. Hundreds of thousands of Indians tuned in to hear his message, delivered, for maximum audience reach, first in a Punjabi-accented Hindi and then all over again in a flatter, colorless English. Singh explained that his government stood for the ''aam aadmi," or the common man, and for "inclusive growth" (a mantra of the current government). But hard decisions were necessary "to defend the national interest, and protect the long term future of our people." He made the decision to increase diesel prices to reduce the burden of huge fuel subsidies on the burgeoning fiscal deficit. The opening of organized retail to foreign investment wouldn't be a death blow to small shopkeepers, as is widely feared, but would instead generate "millions of good quality new jobs" while also reducing crop wastage, improving infrastructure in the creaking food chain and lowering prices for consumers. He reminded Indians of "what happened in 1991," when the Indian economy teetered on the edge of collapse, and said he had wished to act before things came to a similar pass again, now that "the  United States  and  Europe  are struggling to deal with an economic slowdown and financial crisis" and "even  China  is slowing down." Some of Singh's critics had accused him of choosing "good politics" over "good economics." He seemed to be refuting those critics when he concluded: Even if its appeal as oratory was minimal and its economics fairly elementary, Singh's address to the nation still made sense. It returned to Indians a sense of the contract between themselves and the government, demonstrated that their leaders wouldn't back down on decisions (last year, the government  rescinded a plan  to allow foreign investment in retail after coalition partners objected), and laid down a set of arguments that could be extended further by journalists and economists and answered by critics. Perhaps the two best long responses to Singh's speech, one in favor and the other against, came from the political scientist Ashutosh Varshney in the Indian Express and from Siddharth Varadarajan, the editor of the left-leaning Hindu. Varshney argued  that the furor over big multinationals capturing the Indian retail market was misguided, and that the real significance of the decision was in its consequences for rural income and consumption, both of which have fallen well behind urban growth in the two decades since the Indian economy was partially liberalized in 1991. In a piece called  "Rural welfare, not Walmart,"  he wrote: In the Hindu , Varadarajan called the government's action "a risky strategy born of panic" and made clear he dissented from the applause Singh "has garnered from editorialists, TV anchors and corporate leaders for being 'tough' and 'decisive.'" To Varadarajan's mind, the prime minister had succumbed to the pressure of foreign institutional investors and credit-rating companies to open up markets and boost investor sentiment. He wrote: And a big-picture perspective on the stakes of the government's recent decisions and the history of Indian economic reforms as spasms rather than continuous steps was offered by the economist Vivek Dehejia on the  New York  Times's India Ink blog. Asking  "Has Manmohan Singh Gambled Enough?"  Dehejia wrote: Meanwhile, many Indians would like to say to their reticent prime minister and his office: Why wait for a crisis to talk to us directly? Perhaps Singh, an economist by training, could next devise a short introductory course in economic concepts for national television. That would allow him to crack a smile, widen his appeal among the electorate in time for the next elections in 2014 and give his legacy an intellectual coherence and continuity that one currently has to infer from conjecture, hearsay or small speeches like the one he made on Sept. 21.
