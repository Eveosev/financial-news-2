Chile ’s peso advanced the most in
nearly three months as optimism in  China  and the U.S. spurred an
advance in commodities including copper, the South American
country’s biggest export.  The currency appreciated 1.3 percent to 469.97 per dollar
at 11:47 a.m. in Santiago. It was the biggest gain on a closing
basis since June 29. Copper for December delivery rose 0.8
percent to $3.7595 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  “Everything’s better: copper is up,” said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.
“That means dollar selling in the local market.”  Copper rose 0.5 percent today after a leading index for
 China’s economy  increased at a faster pace. The Asian country is
the biggest buyer of the metal from Chile. U.S.  consumer
confidence  beat the most optimistic forecast of any of the 73
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced their short peso position to a one-month low of $8.5
billion on Sept. 21, according to central bank data.  The peso fell 0.6 percent last week on bets the central
bank may try to weaken it after a rally to 469.50 per dollar.
The peso reached a year high of 467 on Sept. 14.  “There is clear interest in dollar selling near 475 and
476 and dollar buying near 470, where there are warning signals
that the central bank could intervene, but the sentiment in this
market is for a weaker dollar,” Donoso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
