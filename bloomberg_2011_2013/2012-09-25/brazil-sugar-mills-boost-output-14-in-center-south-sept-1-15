Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, rose 14 percent in
the first half of this month, industry group Unica said.  Output in the region increased to 3.14 million metric tons
between Sept. 1 and Sept. 15 from 2.76 million a year earlier,
Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed statement today. The
current crop year started April 1.  Mills in the Center South, where about a fifth of the
world’s sugar is produced, processed 42 million tons of cane in
the period, up from 37.2 million tons a year earlier. Ethanol
output rose 12 percent to 1.8 billion liters (475 million
gallons).  The region’s mills turned about 51.7 percent of the cane
into sugar in the first half of this month, up from 51.3 percent
a year earlier. The rest was processed into fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
