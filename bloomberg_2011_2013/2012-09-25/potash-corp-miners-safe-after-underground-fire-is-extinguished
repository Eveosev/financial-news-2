Twenty miners employed by  Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  are trapped underground while a fire
burns at the Rocanville mine in the Canadian province.  The 20 miners are safe and accounted for and firefighters
have the blaze under control, Bill Cooper, a spokesman for
Potash Corp., the worldâ€™s largest fertilizer producer, said in a
telephone interview today. The fire started just before 2 a.m.
local time at a wooden cable reel in the mine, Cooper said.  Farmers apply potash, a form of potassium, to their fields
to help strengthen plant root systems and to make crops more
resistant to drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
