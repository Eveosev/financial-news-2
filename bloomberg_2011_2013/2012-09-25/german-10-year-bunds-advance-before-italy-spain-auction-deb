Spanish and Italian  government
bonds  fell as demand declined when the two nations sold debt
today amid concern the region’s financial turmoil is worsening.  Spain ’s securities dropped for the first time in three days
as Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the
country needs to know how much the  European Central Bank  will
spend on debt purchases before it decides whether to ask for a
bailout. German two-year notes fell as ECB Governing Council
member Ewald Nowotny said he doesn’t see a need to cut  interest
rates  at the moment.  “Markets are likely to be looking for any indication of a
softening in investor appetite, through lower demand or rising
yields,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
 London . Rising yields at Spain’s bill sale “could potentially
be an indication of the growing sense of unease felt by
investors over the protracted bailout saga.”  Spain’s  two-year yield  climbed 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 3.16 percent at 4:19 p.m. London time. The
4.75 percent note due in July 2014 dropped 0.23, or 2.30 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,295) face amount, to 102.775. The 10-year
yield increased seven basis points to 5.76 percent.  Spanish borrowing costs increased as the nation sold three-
month bills at a yield of 1.203 percent, up from 0.946 percent
at the previous auction on Aug. 28. Demand dropped to 3.29 times
the amount allotted, from 3.35 times in August. The country also
sold six-month debt at 2.213 percent, versus 2.026 percent.  ‘Draghi Effect’  The increase in borrowing costs suggests “the ‘Draghi
effect’ may be beginning to wane,”  Richard McGuire , a fixed-
income strategist at Rabobank International in London, wrote in
a client note. “The longer Spain prevaricates on the bailout
front, the more this effect is likely,” he said.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced a bond-purchase plan
to Sept. 6 to cap borrowing costs in the euro area’s most
indebted nations.  Italy  attracted bids for 1.65 times the amount of two-year
zero-coupon notes it sold today, down from a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.95 at the previous auction on Aug. 28.  The yield on Italy’s  two-year note  climbed five basis
points to 2.30 percent, and the 10-year rate increased five
basis points to 5.10 percent.  German two-year notes dropped for a second day as Nowotny,
who heads  Austria ’s central bank, said “I see no need for
interest-rate changes.” He made the comments in a live internet
chat with Die Presse, an Austrian daily newspaper.  ECB Benchmark  The ECB cut its main refinancing rate in July to a record
0.75 percent and economists forecast another reduction by year-
end, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The implied yield on Euribor interest-rate futures for
December rose for a second day as traders pared bets that policy
makers would cut borrowing costs. The yield climbed two basis
points to 0.195 percent.  The German  two-year note  yield climbed three basis points
to 0.07 percent.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors demand to hold
10-year French bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds
widened to as much as 75 basis points, the most since Sept. 11.  Greece ’s financing gap will increase if it falls short of
targets for its budget deficit and state asset sales, according
to Alternate Finance Minister Christos Staikouras.  The ECB and other central banks in the euro area hold 28
billion euros of Greek bonds due by the end of 2016 that may
need to be rolled over given the country’s financing
constraints, Staikouras said in a written response to a
lawmaker’s question e-mailed by the  Finance Ministry .  The yield on  Greek 10-year bonds  fell as much as 13 basis
points to 19.31 percent, the lowest since March 23, before being
little changed at 19.43 percent.  Dutch Sale  The Netherlands sold 1.92 billion euros of bonds maturing
in 2033 at an average yield on 2.497 percent, compared with
2.342 percent at the previous auction on June 12.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by the Netherlands, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German bonds returned 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities added 2 percent, while Italy’s rose 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
