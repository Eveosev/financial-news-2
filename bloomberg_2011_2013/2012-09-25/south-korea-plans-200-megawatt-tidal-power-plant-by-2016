South Korea plans to build a tidal-
energy plant on the southern tip of the peninsula by 2016,
saving an estimated 330,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas
emissions a year.  South Jeolla province signed an initial agreement with
 Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP) , Korea Midland Power Co. and five
other companies to build the 200-megawatt plant in Jindo, the
provincial government said in an e-mailed statement without
giving cost estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
