Cattle futures tumbled the most in
five months on signs of slowing demand from U.S. meatpackers as
beef prices drop. Hogs also fell.  Slaughterhouses purchased 1.96 million animals from
feedlots last month, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a report on Sept. 21.
Thirteen analysts in a Bloomberg News survey forecast a 1.6
percent decline, on average. In the previous two sessions,
wholesale  beef prices  dropped 1.2 percent, the most since July
20.  “This cattle market is under a little bit of pressure,”
 Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma
City , said in a telephone interview. “We’re not marketing
cattle as well as we should have.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 2 percent to
settle at $1.258 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since
April 24. Earlier, the price tumbled by the CME limit of 3 cents
$1.254, the lowest since Aug. 30. The commodity has climbed 3.6
percent in 2012.  Yesterday, wholesale beef fell 0.3 percent to $1.9269 a
pound, the lowest since Sept. 14, government data show. The
price, little changed today at $1.9276, has dropped 1 percent
this year.  Spot  steers  averaged $1.2532 a pound last week, down 0.5
percent from a week earlier, USDA data show.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 1.5
percent to $1.46525 a pound on the CME, the biggest drop since
July 25.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.9 percent to
74.65 cents a pound. The price has dropped 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
