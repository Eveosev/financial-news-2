Turkey is seeking ways to block
Internet access to an anti-Islamic film that has sparked deadly
protests from the Middle East to Southeast Asia, Fethi Simsek,
chief of the state-run telecommunication board, said today.  “There is work to determine whether it is possible to
block these videos,” Simsek said by telephone. “They have not
been blocked yet.”  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  has ordered the
Transportation Ministry, which oversees Simsek’s board, to
conduct the necessary work to block access to the film, European
Union Minister  Egemen Bagis  told state-run TRT Turk television
today.  Simsek said his board has also received numerous complaints
about the film, which depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a
womanizer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
