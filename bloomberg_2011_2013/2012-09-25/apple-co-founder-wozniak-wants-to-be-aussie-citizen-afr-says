Apple Inc. (AAPL)  co-founder  Steve Wozniak 
wants to become an Australian citizen and lists the government’s
planned national broadband network as one of the factors behind
his decision, the Australian Financial Review reported.  Wozniak, who built the first  Apple computer  with  Steve Jobs 
and co-founded the company with him in 1976, told the newspaper
he supports the roll-out of the mainly fiber-optic network and
had discussed the project with Communications Minister Stephen Conroy.  “I support it very much,” the Financial Review cited
Wozniak, in Australia for the launch of the iPhone 5 and to
speak at business forums, as saying in an interview. “It’s one
of the reasons why I actually like this country and want to
become a citizen.”  Wozniak told a local radio station in Brisbane that he was
“underway to become an Australian citizen,” according to the
report. “It turns out I can keep my American citizenship,” he
told Brisbane’s 4BC breakfast radio, the newspaper said. “I
intend to call myself an Australian and feel an Australian, and
study the history and become as much of a real citizen here as I
can.”  Wozniak is chief scientist at  Fusion-io Inc. (FIO) , a Salt Lake
City-based maker of flash-memory technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
