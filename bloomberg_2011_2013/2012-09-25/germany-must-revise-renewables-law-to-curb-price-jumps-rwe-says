Germany  must change its renewable-
energy legislation to curb power-price gains and guarantee
security of supply, according to utility  RWE AG (RWE)  and European
Union Energy Commissioner  Guenther Oettinger .  Consumers can’t withstand more increases in electricity
costs caused by the so-called EEG subsidy system, RWE Chief
Executive Officer Peter Terium said today at a conference in
Cologne. The system will also be unable to ensure supply
security in the long term, he said.  The EEG program, which determines support given to wind and
solar-power producers and gives them priority access to the
grid, has helped expand renewable-energy output since  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s government announced the gradual phaseout of
nuclear generation last year. German consumers help pay for the
subsidies through a surcharge on their electricity bills.  Consumers may see that charge rise as high as 5.4 euro
cents a kilowatt-hour next year from 3.6 cents, Terium said. In
coming years it will increase by 1 cent a year on average, the
EU’s Oettinger said at the same conference.  EU nations need to coordinate the expansion of renewable-
energy generation and keep the pace of growth in check,
Oettinger said. The focus must be on the most efficient
renewable energies in the most appropriate regions, he said.  “We have to think market-based, European and systemic,”
Terium said.  EEG, or Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, is the Renewable
Energy Sources Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
