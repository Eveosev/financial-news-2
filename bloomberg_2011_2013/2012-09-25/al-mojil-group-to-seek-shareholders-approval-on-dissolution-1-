Mohammad Al-Mojil Group, a service
provider to the  construction industry , called a meeting of
shareholders to decide whether to dissolve the company.  The meeting will be held on Nov. 5, the company said today
in a  statement  on the Saudi bourse website. The shareholders can
also vote on a resolution authorizing the board to continue
managing the company, it said.  Saudi Arabia ’s market regulator suspended trading in Al-
Mojil’s shares on July 22 until the company released its second-
quarter financial results. A day earlier, Al-Mojil said it
delayed quarterly results after appointing a new auditor, then
on Aug. 29 it said it needed more time to declare them.  Al-Mojil said on Sept. 5 that it may announce a second-
quarter loss of 800 million riyals ($213 million), including 443
million riyals from projects at the al-Manifa refinery and King
Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, according to the
company statement on the Saudi bourse website. Liabilities now
exceed assets by 300 million riyals, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
