Following is the text of U.S.
 consumer confidence  from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had
declined in August, improved in September. The Index now stands
at 70.3 (1985=100), up from 61.3 in August. The Expectations
Index increased to 83.7 from 71.1. The Present Situation Index
rose to 50.2 from 46.5 last month.  The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a
probability-design random sample, is conducted for The
Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of
information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was September 13.  Says  Lynn Franco , Director of Economic Indicators at The
Conference Board: “The Consumer Confidence Index rebounded in
September and is back to levels seen earlier this year (71.6 in
February 2012). Consumers were more positive in their assessment
of current conditions, in particular the job market, and
considerably more optimistic about the short-term outlook for
business conditions, employment and their financial situation.
Despite continuing economic uncertainty, consumers are slightly
more optimistic than they have been in several months.”  Consumers’ appraisal of present-day conditions improved in
September. Those claiming business conditions are “good” edged
up to 15.5 percent from 15.3 percent, while those saying
business conditions are “bad” declined to 33.3 percent from 34.3
percent. Consumers’ assessment of the labor market was also more
upbeat. Those stating jobs are “plentiful” rose to 8.3 percent
from 7.2 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to get”
edged down to 39.9 percent from 40.6 percent.  Consumers were also more optimistic about the short-term
outlook in September. Those expecting business conditions to
improve over the next six months increased to 18.2 percent from
16.7 percent, while those anticipating business conditions to
worsen decreased to 13.8 percent from 17.6 percent. Consumers’
outlook for the labor market was also more favorable. Those
expecting more jobs in the months ahead increased to 18.5
percent from 15.8 percent, while those anticipating fewer jobs
declined to 18.5 percent from 23.7 percent. The proportion of
consumers expecting an increase in their incomes edged up to
16.3 percent from 16.0 percent.  The next release is scheduled for Tuesday, October 30,
2012, at 10:00 AM ET.  SOURCE: The Conference Board             http://www.conference -
