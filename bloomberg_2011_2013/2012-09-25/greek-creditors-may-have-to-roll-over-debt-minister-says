Greece’s financing gap will widen
if it falls short of targets for its budget deficit and state
asset sales, Alternate Finance Minister Christos Staikouras
said, reinforcing comments by International Monetary Fund chief
 Christine Lagarde .  The  European Central Bank  and other national central banks
in the euro area hold 28 billion euros ($36 billion) of Greek
 government bonds  maturing by the end of 2016 that may need to be
rolled over given the country’s financing constraints,
Staikouras said in a written response to a lawmaker’s question
e-mailed by the  Finance Ministry  in  Athens  today.  The ministry later clarified in another e-mailed statement
that it didn’t use the word “restructuring” and that “there
is no such plan.”  Greece faces a financing gap that won’t be closed by an
11.5 billion-euro package of budget cuts being discussed because
a weak economy and delayed privatizations have worsened its
fiscal situation, Lagarde said yesterday.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has struggled to broker an
agreement with the so-called troika, comprised of officials from
the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF, and his coalition
partners on the measures. The package will include more than 7
billion euros of cuts in wages, pensions and benefits in a
country battling a fifth year of recession and with nearly a
quarter of the workforce unemployed.  As part of that second package, private-sector investors
agreed to take a 53.5 percent loss in the face value of their
Greek bond holdings, reducing the country’s debt by 100 billion
euros, the largest debt restructuring in history.  Greece ’s debt-sustainability assessment for its second
bailout from the euro area and the IMF earlier this year assumed
that the nation would raise 7.6 billion euros from bond markets
in 2015 and 3 billion euros in 2016, Staikouras said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
