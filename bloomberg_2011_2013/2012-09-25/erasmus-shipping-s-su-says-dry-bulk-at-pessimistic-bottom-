Erasmus Shipping BV Chief Executive
Officer John Su comments on the outlook for Chinese shipyards
and the dry-bulk shipping market. He spoke today at a Marine
Money conference in Singapore and with reporters.  Athens-based  Erasmus , which arranges and manages ship
investment projects, is a venture between FinShip BV and Keen
Maritime Services Inc.  On Chinese shipyards:  “The private shipyards in  China  have a big challenge
because of the lack of orders and also from  cash flow  because
they have no orders. It’s going to be challenging for private
shipyards because they have no support from state or government
funds.  ‘‘We are seeing the collapse of the bubbles from the super
cycle in the shipping industry. When we saw the spark in bulk
shipping in 2010, people thought the crisis in shipping was over
but they were wrong. A lot of the shipyards made orders on their
own account. We will see major bankruptcies in private yards.’’  On Bulk-Shipping Demand:  ‘‘On the demand side of bulk-shipping, we are today at a
very, very pessimistic bottom. In recent weeks we haven’t been
able to find anyone to take long-term charters. This is worse
than in the past years.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
