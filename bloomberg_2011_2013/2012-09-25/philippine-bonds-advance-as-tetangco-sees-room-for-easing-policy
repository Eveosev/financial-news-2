Philippine bonds advanced after
Governor Amando Tetangco said the central bank has room to ease
monetary policy further should global economic conditions
deteriorate. The peso strengthened.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will adjust policy “as
appropriate,” Tetangco said in a text message yesterday, after
the bank held its  benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 3.75
percent this month following three cuts in 2012. The amount of
debt sold at the government’s regular weekly auctions will
probably be less in the three months through December than in
the current quarter, due to a retail bond sale of at least 60
billion pesos ($1.4 billion) next month, Deputy Treasurer
Eduardo Mendiola said today.  “There is still some room for further cuts,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist in Manila at  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO) 
“We’re facing a global slowdown and we need to ensure that that
growth will be sustained.”  The yield on the 4.75 percent bonds due September 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.70 percent as
of 4:41 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The government sold 9 billion pesos of 20-year notes
at a yield of 5.75 percent today.  Standard & Poor’s  raised its 2012 growth outlook for the
Philippines yesterday to 4.9 percent from 4.3 percent, while
cutting forecasts for China, India,  Singapore  and  South Korea .
The $225-billion Philippine  economy  grew by an average 6.1
percent per quarter in the first half of the year, heading for
its fastest annual expansion since 2010.  Policy makers remain “very watchful” of exchange-rate
swings as excessive volatility and prolonged movements in the
same direction pose concerns, Tetangco said in a Sept. 23 e-mail.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 41.735 per dollar in Manila,
data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. The currency gained 5.1
percent in 2012, the most in Asia after the  Singapore dollar ,
and touched a four-year high of 41.358 per dollar on Sept. 17.
One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 25 basis points to 5.25
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
