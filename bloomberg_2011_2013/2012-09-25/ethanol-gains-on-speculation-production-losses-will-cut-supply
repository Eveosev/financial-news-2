Ethanol futures advanced in Chicago
on speculation losses will prompt producers to idle output.  Prices gained a day after  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF) , a U.S.
ethanol producer partially owned by venture capitalists  David
Einhorn  and  Daniel Loeb , idled its 115 million-gallon-a-year
plant in Fairmont,  Minnesota , because of poor margins.  “There’s rumors of plants closing or at least cutting
rates,” said  Ian Jackson , an ethanol trader at SCB & Associates
in Chicago. “It’s the margins.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 1.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.263 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Sept. 19. Futures have climbed 2.7
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 3.5 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.305, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Ethanol in  New York  gained 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.29
a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel rose 0.5 cent to
$2.38.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 42 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Valero Restarts  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer and the largest U.S. refiner by processing capacity,
this month restarted idled mills in Albion, Nebraska, and
Linden, Indiana, after shutting them in June on unprofitable
returns.  Smaller companies may be forced to shut plants because they
don’t have the resources of a large producer such as Valero,
with 1.2 billion gallons of annual capacity, Jackson said.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 4.95 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.9671 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Gasoline widened its  premium  to ethanol to 70.4 cents, the
highest since May 31, from 66.7 yesterday, making the fuel more
attractive for blenders to use as they stand to pocket the
difference between the two.  Corn for December delivery dropped 1 cent to settle at
$7.4375 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 3.9 percent to 2.5 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
