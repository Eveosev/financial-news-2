Odd Molly International AB (ODD) , a
Swedish clothing designer, rose the most in over two weeks in
Stockholm trading after the company’s declining order trend was
reversed with next year’s summer collection.  The shares rose as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Sept. 6. Odd Molly had increased 9.1 percent to 27.50
kronor as of 9:37 a.m. local time. The company was the second-
biggest gainer on the  OMX Stockholm All-Share index .  Orders for the 2013 spring and summer collections are
valued at about 95 million kronor ($14.4 million) compared with
87 million kronor for the winter collection, marking a turn
around in order decline for the first time in three years, Odd
Molly said today in a statement. The company cut prices which
led to clients placing bigger orders, it said. Orders for the
2012 summer collection were valued at 114 million kronor.  “The order value still reflects continued cautiousness,”
Chief Executive Officer Anna Attemark said. “We see some
positive signs that confirm we’re doing the right thing, but it
takes time to reverse a negative trend and there’s still much
hard work left to be done.”  Odd Molly said it still sees a “significantly worse”
result this year than in 2011. The total order value for the
year is seen at about 207 million kronor, compared with sales of
292 million kronor in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
