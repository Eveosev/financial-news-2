Serbia ’s central bank will have to
deal with rising inflation in its next policy moves, even as the
economy contracts and unemployment expands, the  FREN  economic
institute said.  Inflation will exceed 10 percent by the end of 2012, with
 core inflation  picking up in the second and third quarters as
food costs rise after weak harvest, Milojko Arsic, FREN’s chief
economist, said at a presentation in Belgrade today. While the
economy “temporarily” emerged from a slump in the three months
through June, it will probably contract 1 percent this year, in
line with the government’s estimates, he said.  “Trying to support the economy with monetary expansion
would be counterproductive,” and taming inflation “should be
the priority of the Narodna Banka Srbije,” Arsic said.  The central bank kept its  benchmark  interest rate  at 10.5
percent this month, after three consecutive increases since
June. The bank targets an inflation rate of 4.5 percent this
year, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.  The economy may expand 2 percent in 2013 if western
European economies start to recover, Arsic said. Economic
activity in the second quarter was not sufficient to halt a
further increase in unemployment, already at 25.5 percent.  The Balkan nation may see its  credit rating  lowered again
by year-end given its high public debt and budget deficit, he
said. Standard & Poor’s cut Serbia’s ranking one step to BB-from
BB with negative outlook on Aug. 7, while  Fitch Ratings  revised
Serbia’s outlook to negative from stable on Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
