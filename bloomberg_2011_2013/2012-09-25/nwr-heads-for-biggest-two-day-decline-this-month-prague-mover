New World Resources Plc (NWR)  fell in its
worst two-day slump this month after European coal declined to a
two-month low yesterday and Barclays Plc cut its price forecast
for the fuel on increased supply.  The Czech mining company slid 1.6 percent to 89.30 koruna
by the close in  Prague , making it the second-worst performer in
the  PX (PX)  equity index. The stock has lost 2.4 percent this week,
the steepest back-to-back slump since Aug. 30.  Coal for next-year delivery fell 1.4 percent yesterday to
$97 a metric ton in the Netherlands, the lowest since July 25,
before rising 0.3 percent today. Barclays lowered its forecast
for the average price of the commodity this year to $93 in a
quarterly report to clients dated today, citing an economic
slowdown in China and power-plant closures in Europe.  “The main story in the global coal markets has been the
growth in supply, with all of the major exporters adding
volumes,” Barclays analysts led by  Trevor Sikorski  in London
wrote in the research note. In Europe, “upside to further coal
use is limited by the coming closures of coal plants and policy
issues around carbon pricing,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
