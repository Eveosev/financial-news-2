U.S. regulators need to quickly
decide whether to exempt foreign-exchange swaps and forwards
from Dodd-Frank Act rules to avoid uncertainty over which
companies must register as dealers, Representative  Barney Frank 
said in a letter to regulators.  “If Treasury ultimately plans to provide an exemption, it
would be a complete waste of time, effort and resources to force
companies which will ultimately be exempt to go through the
registration process, restructure their activities, or even
withdraw from the FX market solely because of inconsistencies
between your two agencies’ timetables,” Frank, a Massachusetts,
Democrat, wrote in a Sept. 21 letter to Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission Chairman Gary Gensler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
