Most Asian  stocks  outside Japan
fell after weaker German business confidence stoked concern that
Europe’s debt crisis is causing a broader economic slowdown.
Japanese shares rose ahead of a deadline for dividend payments.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
slipped 0.5 percent in Sydney on concern weaker global growth
will curb demand for raw materials. LG Electronics Inc., a South
Korean maker of mobile phones, dropped 5.4 percent after KTB
Securities lowered its estimate for the company’s profit
outlook.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-biggest construction-
equipment maker, lost 1 percent in Tokyo as competitor
Caterpillar Inc. cut its 2015 profit forecast.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  fell 0.2
percent to 438.30 as of 6:40 p.m. in  Hong Kong  after rising 0.1
percent. About seven stocks climbed for every five that
retreated. A measure that includes Japanese stocks climbed 0.1
percent, and is within 1 percent of a four-month high hit on
Sept. 19.  “We expect the  euro zone  to muddle through its tortuous
crisis-management process for a very long time,” said Benjamin Yeo, Singapore-based head of investment strategy at Barclays
Plc’s wealth-management unit, which handles about $285 billion.
“The region’s headwinds will remain a strong headwind for the
global economy.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 5 percent this quarter
through yesterday as central banks from Europe, the U.S., Japan
and China took action to stimulate economic growth.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed after rising as much as 0.3 percent today. The measure
yesterday fell for a third day, its longest decline in seven
weeks, as European leaders clashed on ways to stem the region’s
debt crisis and data from China and Germany signaled the global
economic slowdown is deepening.  Annual Gain  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has climbed 8.1 percent this
year compared with a 16 percent gain on the  S&P 500 Index  and a
12 percent jump on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The Asian
benchmark traded at 12.7 times estimated earnings compared with
14.1 for the S&P 500 and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed, rising less
than 1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 0.3
percent and South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.6 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.2 percent.
Securities firms gained after regulators sped up approvals for
foreign investors to buy domestic stocks.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.3 percent and the
broader Topix Index climbed 0.5 percent as investors bought
ahead of a deadline for dividend payments. More than 900
companies in the Topix will trade without the right to a
dividend tomorrow.  Business Confidence  Exporters to Europe declined in Japan and Hong Kong.
 Brother Industries Ltd. (6448) , a Japanese office-equipment maker that
gets almost 30 percent of sales from Europe, fell 1 percent to
778 yen.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes that
gets about a fifth of its revenue from Europe, lost 0.8 percent
to HK$11.98. LG, which gets about 78 percent of sales from
exports, fell 5.4 percent to 69,800 won.  Germany’s Ifo institute in Munich yesterday said its
business climate index dropped for a fifth straight month.  Germany’s governing coalition showed growing exasperation
with  Spain , with a senior ally of Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
saying Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  must stop
prevaricating and decide whether Spain needs a full rescue from
its debt. Meister’s comments underscore Europe’s crisis-fighting
stalemate amid discord over a banking union, Greece’s ongoing
debate on how to meet bailout commitments and foot-dragging by
Spain on possible aid.  Machinery Makers  BHP skipped 0.5 percent to A$33.25.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the
world’s third-largest mining company, slipped 1.8 percent to
A$53.97. Korea Zinc Co., retreated 3.2 percent to 460,000 won in
Seoul.  Telecom Corp. of  New Zealand  gained 1.9 percent to NZ$2.39.
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. advanced 0.3 percent to
S$3.33. Telecommunication shares posted the largest  gains  among
the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific index.  Komatsu Ltd. retreated 1 percent to 1,551 yen and  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Ltd. (6305)  slid 1 percent to 1,287 yen.
Caterpillar, the world’s biggest construction and mining
equipment maker, cut its profit forecast and said a global
recession remains possible.  LG Display Ltd. (034220)  fell 2.8 percent to 28,250 won in Seoul,
leading declines among suppliers to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , after the
smartphone and computer maker reported debut sales for the
iPhone 5 that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  Trading volume on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 was 12 percent above
its 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix fell 14 percent from a high for the year on March
27 through yesterday. The decline drove the dividend yield for
the gauge to 2.5 percent, more than three times the rate of the
benchmark 10-year government bond. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index yields just 1.16 times the government 10-year note, while
Germany’s DAX offers 2.24 times and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 pays
1.54 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
