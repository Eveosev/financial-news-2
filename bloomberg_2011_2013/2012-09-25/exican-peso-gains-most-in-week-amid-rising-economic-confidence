The peso advanced the most in a
week as better-than-forecast economic data in  Mexico  and the
U.S. bolstered the growth outlook.  Mexico’s peso appreciated 0.6 percent to 12.8392 per dollar
at 1:19 p.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally this year to
8.5 percent, the biggest among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S.
cities rose in July more than forecast, fueling optimism about
the world’s biggest economy, the destination of 80 percent of
Mexican exports. Mexico’s IGAE global economic indicator, a
measure of gross domestic product, showed an expansion of 4.7
percent in July.  The peso’s gain is “largely driven by better data prints
in the U.S., coupled with the latest IGAE release in Mexico that
further underscores” strong growth in the Latin American
country, Aryam Vazquez, an economist for global  emerging markets 
at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said in an e-mailed message.  Confidence among U.S. consumers rose in September to a
seven-month high, according to an index from the Conference
Board, a New York-based private research group, released today.  Yields on Mexican peso bonds due in 2024 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.43 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.13 centavo to
140.81 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
