The forint weakened for a second
day before  Hungary ’s central bank meets to decide whether to cut
its benchmark  interest rate  for a second month in a row.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 283.26 per
euro by 9:42 a.m. in Budapest. The yield on the government’s
benchmark three-year bonds was little changed at 6.685 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will reduce the two-week deposit
rate to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent, the second quarter-point
cut in as many months, according to 17 of 29 economists in a
 Bloomberg survey . Twelve forecast no change. The decision will
be announced at 2 p.m. in Budapest and the bank will release its
latest inflation report an hour later.  The market is “divided on the outcome” of the rates
meeting, Peter Karsai, a Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank
AG, wrote in an e-mail today. “In the deteriorating sentiment a
rate cut coupled with what probably won’t be too rosy an
inflation report would definitely get the currency sliding.”  Forward-rate agreements used to bet on interest in one
month rose four basis points to 6.645 percent. The FRAs traded
26 basis points below the Budapest Interbank Offered Rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
