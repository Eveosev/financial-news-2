(Corrects to remove reference to fiscal policy in third
paragraph.)  The  European Central Bank ’s bond
purchasing program could hinder a recovery in the euro zone if
it eases pressure on governments to implement reforms, German
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said in an interview with
Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.  Weidmann questioned whether bond-purchase programs are the
appropriate mechanism for solving structural problems, such as
the lack of competitiveness and loss of trust in an individual
country’s fiscal policies, according to the interview. Weidmann
was the only member of the ECB Governing Council to oppose the
so-called Outright Monetary Transactions program.  Weidmann said the ECB’s monetary policy runs the risk of
becoming dependent on political decisions. Maintaining  price
stability  is the bank’s primary purpose, he said.  In response to a newspaper report that he had considered
leaving the post, Weidmann said resignation wasn’t an option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
