Kraft Foods Group will replace
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) ,
according to a statement from the index provider.  The grocery company, which is due to be spun off from Kraft
Foods Inc. next month, will be added to the U.S. equity
benchmark after the close of trading on Oct. 1, the statement
said. Kraft Foods Inc., which is changing its name to Mondelez,
will remain in the index, S&P said.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc., the second-largest U.S. coal
producer, will be moved to the  S&P Midcap 400 Index (MID)  because its
market value is too low, S&P said. The company’s shares are
worth $1.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kraft shares added 1 percent to $41.78 at 5:31 p.m. in  New
York , while Alpha Natural fell 2 percent to $6.41 in after-hours
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
