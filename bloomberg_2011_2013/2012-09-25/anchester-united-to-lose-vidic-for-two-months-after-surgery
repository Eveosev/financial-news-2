Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic will miss as much as two months of the English Premier
League soccer season after an operation on his knee.  Vidic didn’t appear in United’s 2-1 win at Liverpool last
weekend because of tightness in his knee, and was operated on
this week, the club said today on its website.  “Further medical investigation revealed the underlying
problem,” the team said in the statement. “The central
defender was operated on this week and will be sidelined for
about eight weeks.”  The Serb, who is club captain, joined United in December
2005 and has played 248 times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
