President  Barack Obama  leads
Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  in Florida and  Ohio , two crucial
states for the challenger, according to a poll published today.  The  Washington Post survey  of likely voters gave Obama a
lead of 51 percent to 47 percent in Florida, the decisive state
for Republican  George W. Bush  in 2000, and a 52 percent to 44
percent lead in Ohio, a state captured by every Republican
candidate who won the White House.  The findings of the poll taken Sept. 19-23 were similar to
a Sept. 9-11 survey of likely voters taken by NBC News, the Wall
Street Journal and Marist College. That survey found Obama with
a 49 percent to 44 percent advantage in  Florida  and a 50 percent
to 43 percent edge in Ohio.  In the Post poll, Obama had an approval rating among
registered voters of 55 percent in Florida and 56 percent in
Ohio. Fifty-two percent in Florida and 53 percent in Ohio
approved of the way he was handling the economy.  In both states, 59 percent of registered voters had a
favorable impression of Obama; he was viewed unfavorably in
Florida by 40 percent and in Ohio by 39 percent. In Florida,
Romney was viewed favorably by 50 percent and unfavorably by 48
percent; in Ohio, 47 percent had a favorable impression of him
and 50 percent had an unfavorable one.  Economy, Medicare  Registered voters in Ohio said they would trust Obama over
Romney to do a better job on the economy by 50 percent to 43
percent, and on Medicare, the health-care program for the
elderly, by 56 percent to 37 percent. In Florida, Obama held a
49 percent to 45 percent edge on the economy and a 53 percent to
38 percent advantage on Medicare.  Romneyâ€™s running mate, Representative  Paul Ryan  of
 Wisconsin , is the sponsor of House-passed legislation that would
replace traditional Medicare with vouchers for either private
insurance or a government program with a cap on expenditures
when Americans now under 55 become eligible.  The former Massachusetts governor received higher marks
than Obama in Ohio, 45 percent to 43 percent, on who would do a
better job on handling the budget  deficit . Floridians chose the
incumbent, 49 percent to 45 percent.  The telephone survey was taken of 925 registered voters,
including 769 likely voters, in Florida; and of 934 registered
voters, including 759 likely voters, in Ohio. The margins of
error were plus or minus four percentage points for registered
voters in both states and 4.5 percentage points for likely
voters.  Among likely voters in Florida, 33 percent identified as
Democrats, 32 percent as Republicans and 31 percent as
independents; in Ohio, 37 percent identified as Democrats and 30
percent each as Republicans and independents. Exit polls in 2008
found 39 percent of the electorate identifying as Democrats and
32 percent as Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
