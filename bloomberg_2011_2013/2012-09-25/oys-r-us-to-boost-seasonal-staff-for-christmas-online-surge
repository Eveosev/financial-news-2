Toys “R” Us Inc. (TOYS) , the world’s
largest toy retailer, said it will hire an additional 5,000
temporary workers over the Christmas period at both its stores
and online distribution centers across the U.S.  The retailer will employ 45,000 temporary staff over the
holiday, compared with 40,000 last year, the Wayne, New Jersey-
based company said in a statement today. Hiring begins this week
and continues through December, the company said.  Toys “R” Us is seeking to boost sales with services such
as in-store collection of online orders and allowing shoppers to
pay for products over a period of time at no additional cost.
The retailer also introduced a “ Hot Toy Reservation ” program
where shoppers can reserve toys from the Top 50 list and collect
from a service desk if they pay a 20 percent deposit.  Jobs available over the holiday include managerial roles,
sales associates, inventory replenishment employees and
positions in the company’s 10 distribution centers.  Toys “R” Us, which has 876 stores in the U.S. and  Puerto
Rico , filed for an initial public offering in May 2010 to repay
debt, and the listing is still pending. Private-equity firms KKR
& Co. and Bain Capital LLC, along with Vornado Realty Trust,
bought the retailer in 2005 for $6.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
