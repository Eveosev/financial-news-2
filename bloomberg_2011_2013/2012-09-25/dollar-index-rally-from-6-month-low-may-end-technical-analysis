The  Dollar Index ’s rally from its
lowest level in more than six months may be near an end, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc said, citing trading patterns.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, declined from this year’s peak at 84.10 on
July 24 to 78.60 on Sept. 14, the weakest since Feb. 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index recovered to
as high as 79.77 on Sept. 24, but failed to advance beyond
79.90, the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its July-
to-September drop, the data show.  Recent gains “are kind of corrective,” said Greg Gibbs, a
Singapore-based senior currency strategist at RBS. “You’ll
presume that the Dollar Index is going to struggle to push much
above 80. The Sept. 14 low is a key support level,” he said,
referring to the price where there may be orders to buy.  The Dollar Index was little changed at 79.51 at 1:04 p.m.
in  Tokyo  from 79.52 yesterday. It has fallen 0.8 percent this
year, set for the  first annual loss  since 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. The 80 level was last seen on Sept. 12, when the
gauge climbed to as high as 80.02.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, as levels where there may be orders to
sell are known, indicates it may advance to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
