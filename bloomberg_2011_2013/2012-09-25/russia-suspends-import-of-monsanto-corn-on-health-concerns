Russia  has temporarily suspended
the import and sales of  Monsanto Co. (MON) ’s genetically-modified NK
603 corn until the country gets further information on the
safety of the products, the consumer safety watchdog said.  The watchdog, known as Rospotrebnadzor, asked scientists at
Russia’s Institute of Nutrition to review a French study, which
raised questions about the long-term effect of St. Louis-based
Monsanto’s NK 603 corn on rats, according to a statement on
Rospotrebnadzor’s  website  yesterday.  The safety of NK 603 corn is “well established,”
spokesman Tom Helscher wrote in an e-mailed statement. “Russia
is a net exporter of grain so the actual impact of their
temporary suspension, if any, is likely to be small.”  Russia separately asked European Commission authorities to
comment on the situation after the research was published,
according to the watchdog.  France  asked its national food-
security agency Anses to examine the study last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
