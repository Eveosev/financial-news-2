Egypt  sold 30 percent fewer
 repurchase agreements  than last week, as renewed demand from
foreign investors for  government bonds  eased funding pressure on
domestic banks. The dollar bonds fell for a second day.  The North African country accepted bids for 7 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.15 billion) of the seven-day repos, allowing
holders of  government securities  to sell them back to raise cash
for a week at 9.75 percent, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. Bids for the securities fell to 7.14 billion pounds
this week from 11.4 billion pounds last week.  Foreign investors took in “10 percent or more” of the
treasury bonds auctioned Sept. 23, Nidal Assr, head of the
central bank’s foreign-exchange management unit, said at a
conference in Cairo yesterday. Domestic banks had stepped up
their purchases of government debt after last year’s uprising
prompted foreign investors to dump their holdings.  The government’s local-currency borrowing costs have
tumbled this month as Qatar and Turkey pledged $4 billion in aid
and the government said it seeks to complete an agreement with
the  International Monetary Fund  for a loan of as much as $4.8
billion by the end of November. The average yield on   three
years  bonds slid 183 basis points, or 1.83 percentage points, at
yesterday’s sale to 14.02 percent  Overseas funds had cut their holdings of Egypt’s treasury
bills to 800 million pounds in June from 59.3 billion pounds
before the start of the January 2011 uprising, according to the
most recent data from the central bank.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 gained eight basis points to 5.82 percent at 4:12 p.m. in
Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
jumped 22 basis points yesterday, the most in two months, amid
concern discord among European leaders will stall efforts to
contain their region’s debt crisis.  The pound, subject to a managed float, was little changed
at 6.0905 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
