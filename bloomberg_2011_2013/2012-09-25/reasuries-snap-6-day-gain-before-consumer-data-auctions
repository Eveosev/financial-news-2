Treasury 10-year note yields
increased from a two-week low after reports showed U.S.  consumer
confidence  and home sales rose, diminishing the refuge appeal of
the securities from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  Bonds had rallied earlier for a seventh consecutive day,
the longest winning streak in 16 months, after Spanish borrowing
costs rose at a debt sale and the  International Monetary Fund 
said  Greece ’s outlook worsened. Treasury two-year notes being
sold today at a $35 billion offering were trading near their
record auction low.  “The market is sitting on a fence, trying to figure out
which way risk sentiment is going to break, said  Adrian Miller ,
a fixed-income strategist at GMP Securities LLC in New York.
“Last week and this week it’s about risk-off, and we’re not
sure about  Spain .”  The 10-year note  yield  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 11:46 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It fell earlier as
much as three basis points to 1.68 percent, the lowest level
since Sept. 11. The 1.625 percent note maturing in August 2022
declined 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 5/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields were little changed at 2.90 percent
after falling earlier to 2.86 percent.  Treasuries traded at almost the most expensive level in two
weeks. The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists
at the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation, was negative 0.90 percent. It reached negative
0.91 percent yesterday, the most costly since Sept. 10. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value. The average for 2012
is negative 0.74 percent.  Confidence Rises  The Conference Board’s index of  confidence  increased to
70.3 in September, a seven-month high, from 61.3 in August,
figures from the New York-based private research group showed
today. The September figure exceeded the most optimistic
projection of economists, whose median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey called for 63.1.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of  home prices  in 20 cities rose
1.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month
advance since August 2010, data from the group showed today in
New York.  Spain’s borrowing costs rose as it sold 4 billion euros
($5.16 billion) of bills at an auction in  Madrid  today, meeting
its maximum target, the Bank of Spain said. The yield on the
three-month debt it auctioned was 1.203 percent compared with
0.946 percent at a previous sale on Aug. 28, while the six-month
securities yielded 2.213 percent compared with 2.026 percent.  Europe ‘Forefront’  “ Europe  is still at the forefront as far as the concerns
for the market,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale
SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that are required
to bid at government debt auctions. “We’ve seen better buying
in the back end. The market’s also waiting for a reaction to
whether Spain will request a bailout.”  The auction results boosted speculation Spain may soon ask
the  European Central Bank  for a rescue through its bond-purchase
program. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de
Santamaria said the country needs to know how much the European
Central Bank will spend on debt purchases before it decides
whether to ask for a bailout.  IMF Director General  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday that
global growth will probably be weaker than the organization
projected in July.  Lagarde said the IMF expects global growth to be “a bit
weaker” than it projected in July. The fund had expected growth
of 3.5 percent this year and 3.9 percent in 2013. Greece faces a
financing gap that won’t be solved by budget measures discussed,
she added.  Volatility Falls  Treasuries rose yesterday as European leaders clashed on
ways to curb the euro region’s debt crisis, supporting demand
for the safest securities.  Market volatility was at a four-month low yesterday. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury
price swings based on options, declined to 57.50 basis points,
matching the lowest since May 7. That compared with averages of
74 basis points for 2012 and 94 for last year.  The Fed bought $4.7 billion of Treasuries today maturing
between November 2020 and August 2022 as part of its plan to
extend the average maturity of its holdings to cap borrowing
costs. Investors submitted $9.8 billion in offers.  The central bank said last week that it will expand its
holdings of long-term securities with open-ended purchases of
$40 billion of mortgage debt a month until the economic recovery
is well-established. The Fed also extended pledge to keep its
benchmark interest rate at virtually zero until 2015 to support
economic growth and reduce unemployment.  Note Auction  The two-year notes the Treasury is selling at 1 p.m. in  New
York  yielded 0.275 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with
0.273 percent at the previous sale of the securities on Aug. 28.
The record auction low of 0.220 percent was set in July.  Investors bid for 3.94 times the amount of two-year
securities sold  last  month, versus the average of 3.78 times for
the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , the category of buyers that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 22.3 percent of the securities,
the least this year.  Two-year notes have returned 0.2 percent this year through
yesterday, while 10-year Treasuries gained 3.6 percent, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares has surged 15
percent in the period, including reinvested dividends, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
