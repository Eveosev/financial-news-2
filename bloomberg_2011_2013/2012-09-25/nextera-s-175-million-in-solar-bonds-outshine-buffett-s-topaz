NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) ’s debt for two
Canadian solar projects was rated higher than bonds from  Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., the largest issuance
for a U.S. renewable-energy project without a federal guarantee.  DBRS gave a BBB rating to NextEra’s C$171.8 million ($175
million) bonds for the Sombra and Moore photovoltaic facilities
in St. Clair, Ontario, two levels above junk, in a Sept. 21
report. Debt for Buffett’s Topaz Solar Farm in California
received a BBB- rating from  Fitch Ratings , its lowest investment
grade.  “The key differentiator that allowed St. Clair to obtain a
higher rating is the absence of construction risk,” Joseph Salvatore, a New York-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, said today in an interview. “The St. Clair projects
went online in June, while Topaz isn’t scheduled to reach
commercial operation until 2015.”  NextEra’s two 20-megawatt facilities, known collectively as
St. Clair Holding Inc., supply electricity under a 20-year
contract to the Ontario Power Authority. Juno Beach, Florida-
based NextEra is the top U.S. operator of wind farms and solar
projects.  NextEra financed the C$194.8 million projects with a bridge
loan and equity, according to DBRS, a Toronto-based ratings
company, and plans to refinance them with proceeds from the
notes.  MidAmerican issued $850 million in debt in February for its
$2.4 billion Topaz Solar Farm in California. Both projects were
developed by Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest
U.S. solar manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
