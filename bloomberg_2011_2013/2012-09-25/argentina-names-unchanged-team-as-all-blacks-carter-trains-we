Argentina  coach Santiago Phelan
named an unchanged starting lineup to face  New Zealand  in the
fifth round of the Rugby Championship in  La Plata , retaining the
team that lost 23-19 in Australia 11 days ago.  In the only changes to the 22-man squad for that match,
Marcos Ayerza and Tomas Vellejos come in for Juan Pablo Orlandi
and Leonardo Senatore on the replacements’ bench.  Tournament newcomer Argentina is still without a win in the
southern hemisphere championship after losing its three away
games and tying South Africa 16-16 in Mendoza last month.  World champion New Zealand tops the standings with 16
points and can secure the inaugural title with a victory at the
Estadio Ciudad de La Plata on Sept. 29. All Blacks fly-half  Dan Carter  said he’s on track to return after missing the past two
matches because of a calf injury.  “First training back with the team today. Went well and
will see how I pull up,” Carter wrote on Twitter.  ARGENTINA: Lucas Gonzalez Amorosino, Gonzalo Camacho,
Marcelo Bosch, Santiago Fernandez, Horacio Agulla, Juan Martin
Hernandez, Martin Landajo, Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe
(captain), Juan Manuel Leguizamon, Julio Farias Cabello,
Patricio Albacete, Manuel Carizza, Juan Figallo, Eusebio
Guinazu, Rodrigo Roncero.  Replacements: Agustin Creevy, Marcos Ayerza, Tomas
Vallejos, Tomas Leonardi, Nicolas Vergallo, Martin Rodriguez,
Juan Imhoff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
