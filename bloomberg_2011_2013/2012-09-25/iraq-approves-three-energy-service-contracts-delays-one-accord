Iraq ’s Cabinet approved service
contracts for oil and gas exploration on blocks 8, 10 and 12,
and delayed a decision for Block 9, a government spokesman said.  The approval on Block 9 is delayed until the Oil Ministry
“completes procedures related to it,” Ali Al-Dabbagh said
today in an e-mailed statement, without providing details.  The government awarded three out of 12 blocks that were
offered in an energy auction in May, and later agreed to sell
rights for the oil Block 12 to Russia’s OAO Bashneft.  Russia’s OAO Lukoil and Inpex Corp. of Japan won a joint
bid to explore for crude in block 10 in southern Iraq, while
 Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL)  won rights to explore for natural gas in
Block 8 in eastern Iraq. Kuwait Energy Co.,  Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  and
Turkiye Petrolleri AO won a license to explore for oil in Block
9, located along the Iranian border.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to annual statistical data compiled by BP Plc that
include Canadian  oil sands . The country also has the Middle
East’s fifth-biggest deposits of natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
