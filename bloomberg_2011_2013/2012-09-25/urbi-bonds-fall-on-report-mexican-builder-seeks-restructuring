Bonds sold by Urbi Desarrollos
Urbanos SAB, the Mexican homebuilder that’s hemorrhaging cash,
tumbled on speculation it will seek to renegotiate debt.  Urbi bonds due in 2022 fell 6.1 cents to 87.28 cents on the
dollar as of 11:54 a.m. in  Mexico  City after Alberto Aguilar, a
columnist for El Universal newspaper,  reported  the company will
seek to change the terms on 20 billion pesos ($1.56 billion) of
debt. Notes from Desarrolladora Homex SAB, Mexico’s biggest
homebuilder, also dropped.  Alma Beltran, a press official with Urbi, said the company
isn’t engaged in restructuring talks while it pursues a plan to
scale back growth over the next six quarters and reverse the
negative free  cash flow  it reported in the second quarter. Urbi, 
Mexico’s third-largest homebuilder, is shrinking a rent-to-buy 
financing program that damped cash flow and refocusing its 
business on the country’s fastest growing metropolitan areas 
around the capital and in Guadalajara.  “It’s just rumors, but clearly the market is trading on
this possibility,” said Klaus Spielkamp, a fixed-income trader
at Bulltick Capital, a Miami-based brokerage that specializes in
Latin American debt.  Yields on the 2022 bonds soared 1.16 percentage point to
12.05 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Earlier in the day, they soared 2.19 percentage points to 13.08
percent, the highest since the bonds were issued in January.  “What we’re carrying out is a process of transforming the
business,” Beltran said in a telephone interview from Mexicali,
Mexico.  Urbi’s stock has plummeted 32 percent since it reported a
second-quarter loss of 125 million pesos on July 27. The shares
rose 0.5 percent to 7.76 pesos today.  Homex bonds due in 2020 fell 2.43 cents to 101.06 cents on
the dollar, sending yields up 45 basis points, or 0.45
percentage point, to 9.55 percent.  Vania Fueyo, a spokeswoman for Homex, said the bonds were
falling because of the report on Urbi, which is unrelated to
Homex.  “It’s a contagion effect,” she said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
