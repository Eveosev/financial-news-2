U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  told business leaders to expect a battle over Britain’s
relationship with the European Union in the coming months and
urged them to make the case against leaving the bloc.  In an after-dinner speech yesterday at his Liberal Democrat
Party’s annual conference in Brighton, on  England ’s south coast,
Clegg said the continuing crisis among countries using the
single European currency could lead them to turn in on
themselves and to calls for Britain to pull away.  “It is an illusion to think that there is a future for our
country economically and politically to somehow stand aside from
the fray,” Clegg said. “We’re compelled by our history to seek
to lead and not follow, to shape the debate.”  A former member of the European Parliament, Clegg leads the
most pro-European of the three main political parties. Their
coalition partners, the Conservatives, have been increasingly
hostile in the past decade, with almost a third of Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s lawmakers defying him in Parliament
last year to vote in favor of holding a referendum on Britain’s
continued membership of the EU.  Clegg told his audience that business should be arguing for
membership of the EU and that they should expect the issue to be
a live debate soon. “There will be catalysts to set it off in
the coming months,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
