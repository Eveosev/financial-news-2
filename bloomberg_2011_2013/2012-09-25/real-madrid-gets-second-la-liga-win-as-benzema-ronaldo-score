Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo
scored in each half as Real Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to
secure its second victory of the season in  Spain ’s La Liga.  Last night’s match between the Madrid rivals had been put
back a day after an electrical failure forced a postponement.
Benzema opened the scoring in the 13th minute and Ronaldo
added a 70th minute penalty kick to take his tally to 152 goals
in 152 matches for Real.  The victory lifted defending champion Real into seventh
place with seven points through five games.  Barcelona  tops the
standings with the maximum 15 points.  In yesterday’s other match, Sevilla scored twice in the
last 15 minutes to win 2-0 at Deportivo La Coruna and move into
fourth place after extending its unbeaten start to the season.
Mallorca, Malaga and Sevilla all have 11 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
