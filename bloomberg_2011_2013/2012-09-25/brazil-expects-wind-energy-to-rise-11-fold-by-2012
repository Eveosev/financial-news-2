Wind capacity in Brazil will rise
11-fold through 2021, faster than any other  power source ,
according to a government draft energy  report .  The Ministry of Mines and Energy expects 15.6 gigawatts of
wind capacity by 2021, compared to 1.4 gigawatts last year, it
said yesterday in the report.  Wind energy  has been the fastest
growing source in government auctions for contracts to supply
power since 2009, according to the report.  “Contracts signed during the last few years show that wind
farms have managed extremely competitive prices, which has
spurred the creation of a national industry for equipment to
serve the market,” according to the report.  Brazil expects capacity will grow 57 percent to 65.9
gigawatts by 2021, according to the report. There were 116.5
gigawatts of capacity connected to the grid last year, the
majority of which was generated by hydroelectric power.  The public has until Oct. 31 to comment on the energy plan,
the ministry said in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
