Total SA (FP)  lost its bid to overturn a
ruling holding it responsible for the 1999  oil spill  following
the sinking of a tanker it had hired.  France’s highest appeals court upheld a  decision  finding
Total,  Europe ’s third-largest oil company, criminally liable for
the spill, rejecting an independent prosecutor’s recommendation
to overturn the ruling.  The Erika, as the Maltese ship was named, leaked about
20,000 tons of fuel into the sea after the vessel sank off the
coast of northwest France in a storm in December 1999. The 24-
year-old tanker, carrying 30,000 tons of fuel, broke up in a
storm with waves as high as 14 meters. While an Italian ship-
safety inspector said the Erika was seaworthy, it was later
found to have a rusted hull. The spill killed thousands of birds
and polluted 400 kilometers (250 miles) of coastline.  Total spent 200 million euros ($260 million) for a clean-up
following the disaster and has paid 171 million euros to
affected communities and the French government under the 2008
verdict. Total didn’t try to recover the damages, saying it was
only concerned by the criminal finding and arguing to the court
that French law didn’t apply as the ship was foreign-owned and
sank outside French territorial waters.  Total could appeal the decision to the  European Court  of
 Human Rights , said Daniel Soulez-Lariviere, a lawyer for the
company. A spokeswoman for the company didn’t immediately return
calls for comment on the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
