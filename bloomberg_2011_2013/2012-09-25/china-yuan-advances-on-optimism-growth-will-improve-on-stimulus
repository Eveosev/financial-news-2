(Corrects strategist’s name in third paragraph)  China’s yuan advanced, snapping a
two-day decline, on optimism expansion in the world’s second-
largest economy is picking up from a three-year low as the
government accelerates infrastructure investments.  The currency traded near a five-month high after official
data showed new bank loans surged 30 percent in August, the most
since March, signaling Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s steps to spur growth
are taking effect. China approved proposals this month to build
2,018 kilometers (1,254 miles) of roads, nine sewage-treatment
plants, two waterway upgrades and five port and warehouse
projects. Demand for the yuan also rose as banks sold dollars to
raise cash ahead of next week’s holidays, according to  Frances
Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .  “We started to look for a little bit of  renminbi 
appreciation,” said Cliff Tan, a strategist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ in Hong Kong. “We haven’t been so bearish on the
Chinese economy. Fiscal spending will start to have an impact on
economic indicators within a month or two.”  The  yuan  gained 0.07 percent to 6.3049 per dollar at 10:43
a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency, which can trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the central bank’s daily fixing, touched 6.2945
on Sept. 20, the strongest level since April. The PBOC set the
 reference rate  0.03 percent weaker at 6.3430 per dollar today.  Improving Outlook  China’s 2012 expansion will surpass the 7.5 percent growth
target set earlier this year, Xinhua News Agency reported on
Sept. 15, citing Fan Jianping, director of the Economic
Projection Department at the State Information Center. Growth
will stabilize in the second half as the government takes steps
including faster approvals of major projects, Fan said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4180 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That was a 1.7 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell five basis points, 0.05
percentage point, to 1.30 percent. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan rose 0.05 percent to 6.3119.  To contact the reporters on this story:
