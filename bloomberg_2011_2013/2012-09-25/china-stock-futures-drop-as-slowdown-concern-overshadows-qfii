China’s stocks  dropped for the
first time in three days as concerns about slowing economic
growth overshadowed speculation the government is accelerating
measures to support the nation’s equities market.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  led a gauge of material producers to the
biggest slump among industry groups as rising copper inventories
signaled weak Chinese demand.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) 
paced declines for lenders on the prospect of a cash shortage as
the money market rate jumped to a three-month high.  Sichuan
Guodong Construction Co. (600321)  and Sichuan Expressway Co. rose more
than 4 percent after China National Radio said the provincial
government proposed $582 billion of projects.  “There’s no catalyst for the market and the economy is
still on a slowing trajectory,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager 
at Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in  Shanghai , which
manages $190 million. “Investment opportunities may come up in
the short term when stocks are oversold. There’s no big rally.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,029.29
at the close, after changing directions at least 10 times. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slipped 0.2 percent to 2,210.15. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
retreated 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  fell 0.3
percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 7.7 percent this year on
concern the government isn’t loosening monetary policy or
introducing stimulus policies fast enough to counter the
slowdown in the economy. It’s valued at 9.4 times estimated
earnings, compared with the average of 18 since Bloomberg began
compiling the  weekly data  in 2006. Thirty-day  volatility  was at
17.4 today, compared with this year’s average of 17. About 4.8
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 38 percent lower than
the daily average this year.  Growth Forecast Cut  Standard & Poor’s  cut its 2012 forecast for China’s growth
by half a percentage point to 7.5 percent, saying the government
has not introduced stimulus sufficient to sustain an 8 percent
growth rate. The government is concerned about re-igniting
inflation and a property bubble, the ratings company said in a
statement yesterday.  HSBC Holdings Plc lowered its 2012 target for the Shanghai
Composite to 2,100 to reflect slower growth, according to a
report today by Steven Sun, the head of China equity strategy.  “A cyclical market rebound may be in the cards for both
the A- and H-share markets if growth stabilises and the
transition of power goes smoothly,” he said.  A measure of material stocks lost 1.3 percent today, the
most among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups. Jiangxi Copper,
China’s biggest producer of the metal, dropped 1.5 percent to
21.88  yuan .  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. (000630) , the second
largest, retreated 1.7 percent to 18.98 yuan. Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd., the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, fell 1.6 percent to 4.86 yuan.  Repo Rate  Copper inventories at bonded warehouses in Shanghai
probably climbed to a record as import premiums dropped to a
four-month low, signaling demand in China may not be improving
as much as expected after a summer lull. Reserves were 650,000
metric tons, according to the median of nine estimates from
traders, analysts and warehouse managers, compiled by Bloomberg.  Construction Bank, the nation’s second-biggest listed
lender, dropped 0.5 percent to 3.83 yuan.  China Minsheng Banking
Corp. (600016) , the nation’s first privately owned bank, sank 0.7 percent
to 5.49 yuan. Huaxia Bank Co., partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG,
lost 0.6 percent to 7.86 yuan.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 19 basis points to 4.7 percent as
of 3:14 p.m. in Shanghai, the highest level since June 28,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  Road Show  The central bank added a record 290 billion yuan ($46
billion) to the financial system by using reverse-repurchase
agreements, seeking to address a cash squeeze in the run-up to a
weeklong holiday.  The government granted $9.2 billion quotas to qualified
foreign institutional investors this year through Sept. 19,
according to State Administration of Foreign Exchange statement
published on its website yesterday. The government had approved
a combined $30.8 billion in quotas as of Sept. 19 since the
start of the QFII program, the statement said.  The foreign exchange regulator said in May it plans to
quicken QFII approvals. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission in June said the government will cut the minimum
requirement on assets under management to $500 million from $5
billion, lowering the entry barrier for companies seeking a
license under the QFII program. About 75 percent of total QFII
assets are invested in yuan-denominated stocks, known as A
shares, with the rest in bonds and deposits, according to a CSRC
statement in April.  Sichuan Stocks  The  Shanghai Stock Exchange  completed a 10-day road show in
 North America  after visiting more than 30 institutional
investors in the U.S. and  Canada , the bourse said in a press
release yesterday. The main purpose of the road show was to
brief foreign investors on the latest developments in China’s
capital markets and changes in QFII rules, it said.  Sichuan Guodong jumped 9.9 percent to 2.44 yuan.  Sichuan
Expressway (601107)  gained 4.7 percent to 3.10 yuan. Sichuan Chuantou
Energy Co. added 2 percent to 6.70 yuan.  The western province of Sichuan proposed 2,242 projects,
the China National Radio reported yesterday after the market
closed, citing Tang Limin, the head of local development and
reform commission. The projects include ones in hydropower,
agricultural, transportation and energy industries, according to
the report.  A leading index for  China’s economy  rose at a faster pace
in August. The gauge gained 1.7 percent from July to 240.4, the
biggest rise in seven months, the  Conference Board , a New York-
based research group, said in a statement today, citing a
preliminary reading. That compared with a revised 0.6 percent
gain in the previous month.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
