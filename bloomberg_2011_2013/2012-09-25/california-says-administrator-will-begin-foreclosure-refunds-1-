A national administrator will begin
processing refunds for California borrowers who lost their homes
to foreclosure as part of a $25 billion nationwide mortgage-
foreclosure settlement.  Claim forms will be sent to about 432,584 California
borrowers whose homes were foreclosed from Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec.
31, 2011, and may be eligible for a settlement payment,
California Attorney General  Kamala Harris  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The national settlement administrator mailed notification
postcards to eligible borrowers last week, Harris said. The
deadline for all claims is Jan. 18.  The refunds stem from the $25 billion settlement that
Harris and officials with 48 other states reached with  Bank of
America Corp .,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  to end a probe of abusive
foreclosure practices stemming from the collapse of the housing
bubble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
