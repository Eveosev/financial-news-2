Kazatomprom,  Kazakhstan â€™s state-
owned uranium miner, may buy a stake in caustic-soda maker AO
Kaustik as it boosts self-sufficiency in ore processing.  Kazatomprom is studying buying as much as 40 percent of the
Pavlodar-based company, it said today in an e-mailed statement,
without providing further details.  The uranium producer said last year it was diversifying in
areas including renewable energy, rare-earth minerals and
chemicals. Caustic soda is used to aid uranium recovery once the
ore has been mined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
