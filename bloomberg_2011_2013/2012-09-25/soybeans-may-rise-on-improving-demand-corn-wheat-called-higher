What follows are opening calls for
U.S. oilseed and grain markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that a 9.9 percent price drop since reaching a
record on Sept. 4 will spur increased demand from overseas
buyers,  Tim Hannagan , a grain specialist for Alpari U.S. LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on speculation that the 12 percent drop in  cash  prices
during the past month will encourage farmers to store crops
rather than sell them to makers of animal feed and ethanol,
Hannagan said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
speculation that rising Russian grain prices may boost demand
for U.S. supplies, Hannagan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
