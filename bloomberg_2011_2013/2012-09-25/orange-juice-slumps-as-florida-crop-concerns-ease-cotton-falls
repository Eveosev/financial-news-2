Orange-juice futures fell, capping
the longest slump since July, as Florida weather concerns ease.
Cotton also dropped.  There are no weather threats in the Atlantic that could
hurt crops in Florida next week, the world’s second-biggest
citrus producer, Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist with MDA
Information Systems LLC said in an e-mail from Gaithersburg,
Maryland. The  hurricane season  runs through Nov. 30, with
activity typically peaking this month, according to MDA.  “We are starting to see the hurricane premium come out of
the market,”  Jimmy Tintle , the chief executive officer at
GreenKey Alternative Asset Services in Longwood, Florida, said
in an e-mail.  Orange juice for November delivery declined 3.3 percent to
close at $1.1445 a pound at 1:47 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Prices fell for four straight sessions, the longest slide
since July 23. Earlier, the contract slipped to $1.1355, the
lowest since Aug. 28.  Prices have dropped 6 percent this quarter as inventories
climbed in Brazil, the biggest citrus grower.  “A glut of orange juice will exist for the next cycle,”
 Shawn Hackett , the president of Hackett Financial Advisors Inc.
in  Boynton Beach , Florida, said in an e-mail.  Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
72.33 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
