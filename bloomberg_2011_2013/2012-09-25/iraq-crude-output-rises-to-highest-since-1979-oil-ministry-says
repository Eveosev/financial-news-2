Iraq crude output has risen to the
highest level since 1979, according to the Oil Ministry.  The nation is producing 3.328 million barrels a day, the
ministry said in a statement on the website of the official
National Media Center today. That includes 2.484 million barrels
a day from the oil hub of Basra in the south.  Iraq overtook  Iran  in June as the second-biggest oil
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
according to International Energy Agency data. Its daily crude
output was at 3.2 million barrels earlier this month, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said Sept. 15.  The Middle East nation’s average exports increased to 2.619
barrels a day, the Oil Ministry said today. Exports in August
climbed for a fourth month to 2.57 barrels a day, Falah al-Amri,
head of the State Oil Marketing Organization, said Sept. 1.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves,
according to  BP Plc (BP/)  statistics that include  Canada ’s oil sands.
The country plans to raise its oil export capacity to 2.9
million barrels a day in 2013, Luaibi said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
