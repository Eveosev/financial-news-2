The pound rose toward a one-year
high against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K
mortgage approvals increased last month, adding to signs the
nation’s economy is improving.  Sterling also gained versus the yen as draft guidelines for
Europe’s permanent rescue fund, the European Stability
Mechanism, showed it will invest in a broad range of assets,
reducing the chance that contagion will hurt the U.K. economy. A
U.K. report last week showed the  budget deficit  was smaller than
economists forecast. Gilts were little changed.  The pound rose as “sentiment improved in terms of the ESM
being able to invest in a broader range of assets,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at  Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce  in  London . “The U.K. housing data was also
marginally better.”  The U.K. currency appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.6241 at
4:28 p.m. London time after climbing to $1.6309 on Sept. 21, the
highest since Aug. 31, 2011. Sterling was little changed at
79.76 pence per euro after rising to 79.37 pence, the strongest
since Sept. 7.  U.K. mortgage approvals climbed to 30,533 last month, the
most since April, from 28,750 in July, the  British Bankers
Association  said. The budget deficit excluding government
support for banks was 14.4 billion pounds last month, the  Office
for National Statistics  said Sept. 21. The median of forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey was for a shortfall of 15 billion pounds.  Lending Plan  The  Bank of England  said today the nation’s lenders may be
able to borrow an initial 61 billion pounds under its plan to
boost credit to companies and households. The so-called Funding
for Lending Scheme is the latest in a series of measures to help
the economy fend off contagion from the  European debt crisis .  The ESM, set to go into operation next month, will keep at
least 15 percent of its maximum lending volume -- or 75 billion
euros ($97.2 billion) out of an ultimate 500 billion euros -- in
“assets of the highest creditworthiness,” according to the
guidelines obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The pound has strengthened 1.9 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro slid 3.1 percent and the
dollar weakened 3 percent.  The  10-year gilt  yield was at 1.82 percent after dropping
to 1.77 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 12. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 traded at a price of 99.35.  Gilts returned 2.5 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2.6 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 1.9 percent.  The U.K. sold 4 billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds
maturing in March 2052 at an equivalent real yield of 0.357
percent, the Debt Management Office said in a statement.  The U.K. 30-year  break-even  rate, a gauge of market
inflation expectations over the next three decades derived from
the yield difference between regular and index-linked bonds,
dropped as much as eight basis points to 2.80 percent today, the
least since July 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
