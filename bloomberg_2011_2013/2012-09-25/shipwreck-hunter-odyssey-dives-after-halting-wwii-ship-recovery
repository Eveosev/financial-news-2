Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX) , a
deep-ocean exploration company retrieving silver from
shipwrecks, fell the most in a year after halting the recovery
of two sunken cargoes until the weather improves next spring.  The shares declined 19 percent to $2.99 at 10:45 a.m. in
New York after dropping as much as 32 percent, the most intraday
since Sept. 21, 2011.  Recovery work on the SS Gairsoppa and the SS Mantola has
been suspended until the second quarter of 2013, the Tampa,
Florida-based company said in a statement today. The SS
Gairsoppa has yielded 1,218 silver ingots worth about $44
million at current prices, according to the statement.  The Gairsoppa is a British cargo ship that a German U-boat
sank in 1941 in the North Atlantic. The ship is 4,700 meters
(15,421 feet) below the ocean surface, about 300 miles (483
kilometers) off the coast of Ireland, and may hold 7 million
ounces of silver, Odyssey said last year. The company also plans
to recover silver from the Mantola, a British ship sunk by a
German submarine in 1917.  To contact the reporter on this story:
