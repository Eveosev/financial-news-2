Usina Boa Vista SA, a Brazilian
sugar-cane mill, will receive 360 million reais ($177.7 million)
from national development bank Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social to expand crop plantations and processing
capacity, O Estado de S. Paulo reported.  Usina Boa Vista, in the center west municipality of
Quirinopolis, will be able to crush 7 million metric tons of
cane in 2015, up from 2.5 million tons now, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said today. It cited Fabio Venturelli, president of
Nova Fronteira Bioenergia SA which controls the plant.  Nova Fronteira is a joint venture between sugar-cane
processor  Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3)  and state-controlled oil company
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
