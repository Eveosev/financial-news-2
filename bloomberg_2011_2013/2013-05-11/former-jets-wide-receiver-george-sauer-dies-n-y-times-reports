George Sauer Jr., a wide receiver for
the  New York  Jets when they upset the Baltimore Colts in the
1969 Super Bowl, died May 7 in Westerville,  Ohio , at the age of
69, the New York Times reported.  Sauer died of Alzheimer’s disease, said Dana Keifer, his
sister and only survivor, according to the Times.  Sauer caught eight passes from quarterback Joe Namath
during the Super Bowl after Don Maynard was injured. The
underdog Jets beat the Colts 16-7.  Sauer was a four-time All-Star in the American Football
League and played in the AFL and National Football League for
the Jets from 1965 through 1970. He appeared in 84 games and
caught 309 passes for 4,965 yards and 28 touchdowns.  He retired from the NFL at the end of the 1970 season at
the age of 27, saying he was disillusioned by the life of a
professional football player.  “When you get to the college and professional levels, the
coaches still treat you as an adolescent,” he said in an
interview in 1971 with the Institute for the Study of Sport and
Society, according to the Times. “They know damn well that you
were never given a chance to become responsible or self-disciplined. Even in the pros, you were told when to go to bed,
when to turn your lights off, when to wake up, when to eat and
what to eat.”  Born on Nov. 10, 1943, in Sheboygan,  Wisconsin , Sauer grew
up in Waco,  Texas , where he became a receiver at the University
of Texas. He was a member of Texas teams that went undefeated in
1963-64, winning the Cotton Bowl, and then defeated  Alabama  in
the 1965 Orange Bowl.  Skipping his last year of college eligibility, he joined
the Jets, where his father, George Sauer Sr., was the director
of player personnel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
