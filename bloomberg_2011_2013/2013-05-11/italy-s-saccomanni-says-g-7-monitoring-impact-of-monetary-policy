Italian Finance Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni said Group of Seven countries are on the watch for
any negative spillovers from loose  monetary policy .  Saccomanni, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg
Television, said that while currencies weren’t specifically
discussed at a meeting today of G-7 officials, there was broad
agreement that recent stimulus efforts by central banks are
aimed at bolstering growth and not weakening currencies.  “There is broad convergence that these monetary policy
actions are mostly designed to meet domestic objectives,”
Saccomanni said following a meeting of G-7 finance ministers at
Aylesbury near  London . “There is close attention that there are
no unintended consequences on other countries both via capital
flows or exchange rate movements.”  Global finance chiefs today reaffirmed their commitment not
to manipulate currencies, even as their central banks ramp up
stimulus measures to revive growth. The yen this week fell
beyond 100 per dollar for the first time since 2009, extending a
decline fueled by more aggressive monetary policy from the  Bank
of Japan .  Saccomanni also said G-7 officials endorsed  Italy ’s budget
plans, which includes reducing the deficit while looking for
ways stimulate growth.  “There was a broad support for the fact that we plan to
continue with this policy of fiscal consolidation and trying to
exit the excessive deficit procedure of the European Union,”
Saccomanni said, while also using “whatever room of maneuver
there is to support growth and particularly reduce unemployment
among the youth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
