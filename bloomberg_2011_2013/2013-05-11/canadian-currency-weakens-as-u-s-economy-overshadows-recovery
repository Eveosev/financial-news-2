Canada ’s dollar fell for the first
time in three weeks against its U.S. counterpart as commodity
prices weakened and the quickening pace of the American economy
overshadowed the nation’s recovery.  The currency slid yesterday and May 9 as a strengthening
 U.S. dollar  climbed against most of its 16 major counterparts
after American job gains spurred bets the  Federal Reserve  will
taper its stimulus. Canada’s dollar rose versus most major
peers. Canadian inflation slowed to zero in April, a report next
week is forecast to show.  “We’re seeing the U.S. dollar appreciating a lot over the
past few days and better sentiment regarding growth in the
U.S.,” Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York , said yesterday in a phone
interview. “It leads to a broad-based appreciation of the U.S.
dollar, but because Canada will benefit from long-term growth in
the U.S., the Canadian dollar is up more than peers.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2
percent to C$1.0100 per U.S. dollar this week in Toronto. It
touched C$1.0014 on May 9, the closest approach to parity since
February. One Canadian dollar buys 99.01 U.S. cents.  The nation’s government bonds fell, pushing yields on
benchmark  10-year debt  up 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage
point, to 1.89 percent. Yields touched 1.92 percent, the highest
level since March 15. The price of the 1.5 percent securities
due in June 2023 sank C$1.05 to C$96.50  Bond Auction  Three-year bond  yields increased six basis points to 1.13
percent and touched 1.14 percent, a six-week high. The  Bank of
Canada  will auction C$2.7 billion ($2.67 billion) of the debt on
May 15. The 1 percent securities mature in August 2016.  Futures traders pared bets that the Canadian dollar will
decline against the greenback, figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed yesterday.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the dollar compared with
those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was 51,916 on May 7,
compared with net shorts of 67,848 a week earlier.  The loonie has gained 1.7 percent this year against nine
other developed-nation currencies monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar has climbed 3.7
percent, while the yen has fallen 13 percent.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell for the
first time in four weeks, slipping 0.1 percent to $96.04 a
barrel in New York and touching $93.37, the lowest since May 2.
Spot gold dropped 1.5 percent to $1,448.55 an ounce.  Raw
materials  account for about half of the nation’s export revenue.  Slow Pace  The Canadian economy is expanding at the slowest pace since
2009 as the prices of exports such as oil and gold fall and
consumers cut spending. The Bank of Canada last month lowered
its growth outlook for this year to 1.5 percent from 2 percent
because of lower business investment and  government spending .  The U.S. dollar climbed May 9 after a Labor Department
report showed the number of Americans filing claims for jobless
benefits unexpectedly dropped last week to a five-year low. The
U.S.  jobless rate  fell to 7.5 percent in April, a four-year low,
and payrolls expanded by 165,000 jobs, more than forecast, a
government report showed May 3.  The data spurred speculation the Fed will slow earlier than
previously anticipated its $85 billion a month of bond purchases
under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  QE Bets  “The wider narrative to me seems there is a push into a
stronger U.S. dollar, especially with comments about the need to
taper QE,”  David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit, said yesterday by phone.  TD on April 19 lowered its year-end forecast for the loonie
to C$1.09 per U.S. dollar. The median projection in a Bloomberg
survey of 43 economists and strategists is for C$1.00.  Other central banks, including those of  Japan ,  Australia  and
the euro region, are pumping cash into their economies or
cutting  interest rates , prompting investors to seek higher-yielding assets.  Net  employment  in Canada rose by 12,500 jobs in April and
the  unemployment rate  was unchanged at 7.2 percent,  Statistics
Canada  said in Ottawa yesterday. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected a 15,000-position gain and 7.2 percent
unemployment.  Full-time (CANLFLNC)  employment increased by 36,000 in April
while part-time positions dropped by 23,600.  Canada’s consumer price index was unchanged last month,
compared with a 0.2 percent gain in March, economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast before the nation’s statistics agency
reports the data on May 17. The Bank of Canada’s inflation
target is 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
