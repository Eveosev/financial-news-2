Rutgers University  acknowledged it
erred in saying new men’s basketball coach Eddie Jordan was a
1977 health and physical education graduate of the school.  Jordan, 58, who was hired April 23 to replace the fired
Mike Rice, earned 103 credits from Rutgers between 1973 and
1985, said the registrar’s office, according to ESPN.
Deadspin.com, which first reported the discrepancy, said the
normal threshold for a degree is 110.  “I went back to Rutgers in 1984-85 as a voluntary
assistant to complete my studies,” Jordan said, according to
ESPN. “I didn’t walk. I didn’t get a diploma because I wasn’t
registered right. That’s it. I was 28 and didn’t take care of my
business. It was never an issue.”  Neither Rutgers nor the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  requires a head coach to hold a bachelor’s degree,
the school said yesterday in a statement.  Jordan played point guard for the Scarlet Knights from
1973-77 and was on the team the last time the school reached the
NCAA Final Four in 1976. He is the school’s career leader in
assists (585) and steals (220).  “His athletic skills and leadership and his professional
accomplishments have been a source of pride for Rutgers for more
than three decades,” the school said in a statement on the
athletic department website. “We are excited to have him as our
men’s basketball coach, and we look forward to many winning
seasons.”  Rice Fired  Rice was dismissed April 3, a day after video broadcast on
ESPN showed him pushing players, hurling balls at them and
yelling expletive-laden homophobic insults during team
practices.  His dismissal came three months after being fined $50,000
and suspended for three games for his behavior toward players
during team practices from 2010-12.  Jordan’s appointment followed two days of talks with school
officials including President Robert Barchi, the Star-Ledger of
Newark,  New Jersey , reported April 14. Barchi resisted pressure
from professors and state politicians to step down for his part
in the Rice scandal.  Jordan secured his first head-coaching role in the  National
Basketball Association  in March 1997 and went 33-64 over two
seasons before being fired by the  Sacramento Kings .  Losing Seasons  Following four seasons as an assistant with the  New Jersey
Nets , Jordan in 2003 took charge of the  Washington Wizards  and
led the team to the playoffs four times before being fired in
his sixth season with a 197-224 mark. He spent the 2009-10
season with the  Philadelphia 76ers , when they went 27-55, and
joined the  Los Angeles Lakers  as an assistant coach in 2012.  Jordan also had stints as an assistant coach at Rutgers,
 Boston College  and Old Dominion. He was an assistant to Bob
Wenzel when Rutgers last visited the NCAA tournament in 1991.  Jordan takes over a program that had a 15-16 record last
season and hasn’t had a winning season since it went 19-14 in
2005-06. The Scarlet Knights have had losing records in 17 of
the past 23 seasons.  Now in the Big Ten conference, the Scarlet Knights will
face sports powerhouses such as  Ohio State University  and the
University of Nebraska. At the same time, the switch will bring
Rutgers a share of Big Ten revenue -- $265 million in 2010 --
that may help to reduce the annual payment the university doles
out to the athletic department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
