Manchester United midfielder  Paul
Scholes  will retire for a second time at the end of this season,
the Premier League soccer champion said on its website.  Scholes, 38, previously retired after the 2010-11 season
but returned to action in January 2012. He’s made 715
appearances for United and won 11 league championships.  “Yes, I am finally hanging up my boots for good!” Scholes
said on United’s website. “Playing football is all I have ever
wanted to do, and so to have had such a long and successful
career at Manchester United, under the greatest manager of all
time, has been an honor.”  United manager  Alex Ferguson  announced this week he’s
retiring at season’s end after leading the club to its record-extending 20th English title. Everton’s  David Moyes  was named
his successor two days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
