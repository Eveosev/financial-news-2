China’s foreign exchange regulator
will abolish 24 regulations on the administration of funds for
foreign direct investment, in line with State Council orders to
cut red tape and increase transparency.  The rules cover matters including the re-investment of  yuan 
by foreign companies and property purchases by overseas
individuals, according to statements released in a circular on
the  website  of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
today.  The changes, effective May 13, are part of China’s efforts
to reform the policy framework on foreign direct investment,
outbound investment and the monitoring of capital, the regulator
said. “It will make the regulations on FDI simpler,
standardized and systematic,” it said.  The circular follows a revamp announced by the regulator in
December on currency management related to foreign investment.
The latest changes simplify and consolidate the registration of
foreign currencies, opening and use of accounts, receipt and
disbursement of capital and settlement, SAFE said.  In December,  China  scrapped a ceiling on investments by
overseas sovereign wealth funds and central banks in its capital
markets to encourage long-term foreign ownership and shore up
slumping equities.  --William Bi. Editors: Nerys Avery, Nathaniel Espino  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
