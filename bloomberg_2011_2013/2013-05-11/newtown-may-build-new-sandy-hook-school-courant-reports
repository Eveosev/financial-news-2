A committee of town leaders in
Newtown,  Connecticut , backed construction of a new Sandy Hook
Elementary School at the site of the mass shooting in December
that left 26 educators and children dead, the Hartford Courant
reported.  The school, which would cost about $60 million, needs board
of education specifications and decisions on funding, the
newspaper said. The  town  must provide a maximum price to the
state legislature by early June for bonding purposes, the
Courant said.  Residents will vote on the plans in a referendum, and
demolition of the old school could begin as early as January,
the newspaper said, citing Rob Sibley, Newtownâ€™s deputy planning
director.  Sandy Hook Elementary has about 450 students, and the new
building would be larger, the Courant said. Construction would
take about 19 months and first-graders of today could finish in
the new school in early 2016, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
