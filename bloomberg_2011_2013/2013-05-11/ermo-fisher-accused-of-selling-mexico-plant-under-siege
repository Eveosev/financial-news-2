Thermo Fisher  Scientific Inc. was
accused by the buyers of its laboratory furniture factory in
Reynosa,  Mexico , of failing to disclose that the plant was
“under siege” by the Gulf Cartel.  OpenGate Capital Group LLC accused Thermo Fisher of
fraudulent misrepresentation among other claims in a complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Los Angeles.  “The Reynosa facility was under siege and the subject of
repeated, near-daily security breaches by members of the Gulf
Cartel, an intimidating and violent criminal syndicate and drug
trafficking organization,” OpenGate Capital said in the
complaint.  OpenGate Capital, a private investment and acquisition
firm, said in October it had bought the Laboratory Workstations
business from Thermo Fisher.  Ron O’Brien, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Thermo Fisher, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is OpenGate Capital Group LLC v.  Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc. (TMO) , 13-03368, U.S. District Court, Central District
of California (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
