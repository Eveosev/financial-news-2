Saudi Arabian stocks rose to the
highest in almost a month, led by petrochemical and
telecommunications companies.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.2 percent to 7,220.42,
the highest since April 13, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.
 Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. (KAYAN) , a unit of Saudi Basic Industries
Corp., advanced the most in more than 5 weeks, while  Saudi
Telecom Co. (STC)  climbed to the highest in almost two months.  Yanbu
Cement Co. (YNCCO)  rallied to a level last seen on July 11 2006.  The gain in the benchmark index for a fourth consecutive
week has been mainly driven by “positive momentum, especially
in sectors that rely on domestic demand,” Turki Fadaak, head of
research and consultancy at Albilad Investment Co., said in an
e-mail. “I think that some of the sectors that increased
significantly since April 2 are ready for profit-taking.”  Kayan rose 1.8 percent to 11.4 riyals, and STC climbed 1.3
percent to 39.8 riyals. Yanbu Cement Co. added 1.8 percent to
70.75 riyals  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
