Treasury 10-year note yields rose the
most in two months as signs the  U.S. economy  is improving stoked
speculation that there is no need for the  Federal Reserve  to
ramp up monetary stimulus.  The benchmark notes  fell , pushing yields to the highest
level in six weeks, as the Fed and other central banks pump cash
into their economies or cut  interest rates , prompting money
managers to seek higher-yielding assets. Stronger-than-forecast
employment gains reported last week and fewer-than-projected
jobless claims helped the dollar rally versus the yen after
passing the 100 level on May 9. Consumer sentiment this month
may have reached the highest level this year, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “There is little doubt that the next Fed move will be less
easing, not more,” said Michael Mata, a  money manager  in
Atlanta at ING Investment Management Americas, which oversees
about $125 billion. “Fear of increases in balance-sheet
expansion have gone way down. The strong employment numbers
started to change that sentiment.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  climbed 16 basis points this week,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 1.9 percent in New York, after
reaching the highest level since March 26, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the biggest yield climb
since the week ended March 8. The 1.75 percent note due in May
2023 reached 98 21/32.  Market Trends  The benchmark yield traded above its 50-, 100- and 200-day
moving averages yesterday for the first time since March 25.
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  wrote in a
message on Twitter that the 30-year  bull market  for bonds
“likely ended” on April 29.  The yen fell beyond 101 per dollar yesterday for the first
time since April 2009 after a government report showed Japanese
investors boosted holdings of overseas bonds.  Japan ’s currency
dropped 2.7 percent to 101.62 per greenback.  “The yen move has taken other asset classes screaming with
it,” said  Eric Lascelles , the chief economist at Toronto-based
Royal Bank of Canada Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $280 billion. “We are expecting the yen to depreciate
further.”  Less Bullish  Hedge-fund managers and large speculators  cut  net-long
position in 10-year note futures in the week ending May 7 by 71
percent, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 37,956 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, compared with 132,044 contracts a week earlier.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are close to the
cheapest levels in a month relative to global peers with
comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on Treasuries was 49 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt May 9, just below
the 52 basis points reached on May 6, the cheapest level since
April 4. As recently as March 25, the gap was at 57 basis
points, the cheapest level since August 2011.  Government bonds  in Japan,  Germany  and the U.K. slumped and
the yen weakened.  “The time is right for some of these safe-haven markets to
see some unwinding,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “There
was a huge move in Japanese government bonds and also in stocks
and the dollar-yen. Yields are going to push higher in coming
months as there isn’t that sense of urgency that pushed them
toward record lows.”  Fed Policy  The U.S. central bank is buying Treasuries and mortgage
debt each month to support the economy by capping borrowing
costs. The  Bank of Japan  is purchasing more than 7 trillion yen
($70 billion) of debt each month in expanded easing measures
announced April 4.  Fed purchases have suppressed volatility. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price swings in Treasuries
fell to an all-time low of 48.87 basis points May 9. The measure
averaged 62.6 during the past 12 months.  The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped to 323,000 last week and the average during
the past month fell to the lowest level since before the last
recession, the Labor Department said May 9. On May 3, a report
showed stronger-than-forecast 165,000 increase in jobs in April
and unemployment at 7.5 percent, a four-year low.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment rose to 77.9 in May from 76.4 a month
earlier, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News
survey of 56 economists before the report May 17.  The U.S. sold $72 billion in notes and bonds this week,
including $32 billion in three year notes, $24 billion in 10-year securities and $16 billion in 30-year bonds.  The yield on the 10-year note is forecast to end the year
at 2.20 percent, according to the median estimates of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey May 3 to 8. The figure is down from a
forecast of 2.25 percent in a Bloomberg News survey conducted
April 5 to April 9. Thirty-year bonds may yield 3.25 percent at
the end of the year, compared with a forecast for 3.37 percent
in the previous survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
