U.K. 10-year gilts dropped for a
third week, the longest losing streak since June, as the  Bank of
England  refrained from boosting monetary stimulus and reports
added to signs Britain’s recovery is gaining momentum.  Two-year yields  rose the most in two months as industrial
production increased more than economists forecast in March and
an industry report estimated Britain’s growth accelerated in the
first quarter. Gilts also dropped as stock gains damped demand
for the relative safety of government debt. The pound weakened
the most in two months against the dollar.  “Industrial production surprised to the upside, adding to
evidence that the U.K. economy is finally exiting a recession,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd.
in Edinburgh. “We’ve seen a very sharp response in equity
markets and that’s undermined gilts. On top of that, there’s a
growing realization that the Bank of England is not in a rush to
increase quantitative easing.”  The U.K. 10-year yield climbed 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, this week to 1.89 percent, completing the
longest run of weekly gains since the period ended June 29. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 1.405, or 14.05
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,534) face amount, to 98.805.  The  two-year yield  climbed five basis points to 0.33
percent, the biggest increase since the week ended March 8  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
kept its target for asset purchases at 375 billion pounds on May
9, as forecast by all except one of 44 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The decision followed Governor  Mervyn King ’s
second-last meeting before he is replaced by Bank of Canada
chief  Mark Carney  on July 1.  Production Expands  Industrial production  rose 0.7 percent from February, when
it gained 0.9 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said
on May 9. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a gain of 0.2 percent. U.K.  gross domestic
product  expanded 0.8 percent in the quarter through April,
compared with growth of 0.3 percent in the three months ended
March 31, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
said in an estimate the same day.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 0.9 percent this month
through May 9, trimming gains this year to 0.8 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound declined 1.5 percent this week to $1.5339 at 5:07
p.m. in  London  yesterday, the biggest drop since the period
ended Feb. 22. The U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent to 84.53
pence per euro.  Sterling has depreciated 2.6 percent this year, the second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar rose 3.9 percent and the euro gained 1.9 percent.  The U.K. will sell 4.75 billion pounds of five-year gilts
on May 14 and 2.5 billion pounds of 30-year bonds on May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
