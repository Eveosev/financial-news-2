Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan were
named to the England cricket squad for the first Test against
New Zealand after both recovered from elbow surgery.  Off-spinner Swann and seam bowler Bresnan sat out England’s
series in New Zealand in March. Swann left the team before that
series to have surgery, while Bresnan was operated on after it
was decided he would be rested for those matches. Both have been
playing for their county teams this season.  “Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan have worked hard to regain
fitness following elbow surgery and have demonstrated through
their performances for their counties that they are ready for
the challenge of international cricket,” England National
Selector Geoff Miller said in a  statement  today.  The two-match series begins May 16 at Lord’s Cricket Ground
in  London . The teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in New
Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
