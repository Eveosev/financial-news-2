Major League Baseball suspended
umpire Fieldin Culbreth for two games for failing to follow the
rules involving replacing pitchers in a game between the Los
Angeles Angels and Houston Astros.  Culbreth and his crew -- Brian O’Nora, Bill Welke and
Adrian Johnson -- also were fined for the indiscretion in the
bottom of the seventh inning on May 9 at Minute Maid Park in
Houston.  The umpires allowed Houston manager Bo Porter to replace
reliever Wesley Wright with reliever Hector Ambriz before Wright
had pitched to a batter. Baseball’s rules required that Wright
pitch to at least one batter.  The game was played under protest when Angels manager Mike Scioscia lodged a complaint. The Angels rallied to win the game
6-5.  The previous night, umpire Angel Hernandez and his crew
didn’t reverse a call after a video replay showed Adam Rosales
of the Oakland Athletics should have been credited with a game-tying home run with two outs in the ninth inning against the
Cleveland Indians. The umpires upheld the original call of a
double, saying the ball didn’t clear the left-field wall and the
Athletics lost 4-3.  Oakland manager Bob Melvin was ejected when he complained
about the call, and MLB issued a statement saying the umpires
were wrong in not awarding the home run although the final score
wasn’t changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
