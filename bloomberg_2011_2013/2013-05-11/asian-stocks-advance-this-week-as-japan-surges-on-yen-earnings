Asian  stocks  advanced, with the
regional benchmark ending the week near its highest since June
2008, as the yen’s slide past 100 against the dollar buoyed
exporters in the busiest week of  Japan ’s earnings season.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  jumped 10 percent after forecasting its
highest profit in six years. Sharp Corp. surged 33 percent amid
reports the unprofitable electronics maker will cut jobs and
secure more investment from Samsung Electronics Co.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5)  rose 3.3 percent in Hong Kong after the lender
posted a bigger-than-estimated increase in first-quarter profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 1.3 percent to 141.86.
The gauge retreated the past two days from the highest since
June 2008. It’s risen 9.7 percent this year as the  Bank of Japan 
started unprecedented monetary easing and policy makers in the
U.S. showed willingness to add stimulus.  “The shift of money into equities is going to be an
ongoing theme for a very long time,” said Peter Esho, Sydney-based  investment adviser  at Wilson HTM Investment Group, which
manages $11.8 billion. “Central bank money-printing is not
changing any time soon. It makes equity markets look very
attractive.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index trades at 14.2 times  estimated
earnings , compared with multiples of 14.7 for the Standard and
Poor’s 500 Index and 13.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Regional Benchmarks  Japan’s Topix Index increased 5 percent this week, erasing
losses from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and ending the week at its highest level since September 2008.
The exporter-heavy Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 6.7 percent,
the biggest weekly gain since December 2009.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 1.5 percent after the
central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a record low.  South  Korea ’s Kospi Index dropped 1.1 percent even after
the  Bank of Korea  cut interest rates. Samsung and Hyundai Motor
Co. each fell at least 3.8 percent as the won climbed to its
highest level against the yen in more than four years.  The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 1.9 percent as
 China ’s exports unexpectedly accelerated.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index added 2.8 percent, gaining for a third week. Taiwan’s
Taiex Index climbed 1.8 percent.  HSBC advanced 3.3 percent to HK$88.05 this week in Hong
Kong, gaining for a third week. The London-based lender’s first-quarter pretax profit increased to $8.43 billion from $4.32
billion a year earlier, beating the $8 billion average estimate
of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank cited a
reduction in bad loan provisions for the results.  Toyota Forecast  Toyota, which gets about 75 percent of its revenue outside
Japan, advanced 10 percent to 6,050 yen in  Tokyo . The automaker
forecast a 42 percent gain in net income this fiscal year on
rising sales and a weaker yen.  Nikon Corp., which makes 85 percent of sales overseas,
soared 18 percent to 2,500 yen after the camera maker forecast
earnings that topped estimates.  The yen declined about 2 percent against the dollar this
week to its lowest level since April 2009, extending its slide
to about 5 percent since April 4 when BOJ Governor  Haruhiko
Kuroda  pledged to double the monetary base to achieve a 2
percent inflation target.  “The yen weakened beyond a psychological threshold and may
fall further,” said Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based strategist
at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
bank by market value. “Exporters are showing strong results,
supporting the market. Also, companies may raise profit
forecasts because many of them have conservative estimates.”  Of the 325 companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported quarterly  earnings  since the beginning of April and for
which Bloomberg has estimates, 51 percent beat projections,
Bloomberg data show.  News Corp. Profit  In Sydney,  News Corp . leapt 6.6 percent to A$33 after the
media company led by  Rupert Murdoch  tripled net income to $2.85
billion in its third quarter. Profit excluding some items was 36
cents a share, beating the 35 cent average of analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that fell, Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd.,
which supplies Nike Inc., tumbled 14 percent to HK$23.20, the
biggest weekly decline since November 2008. The shoemaker said
first-quarter results demonstrated a significant downturn, and
interim results may also be affected by rising costs and the
relocation of a factory.  To contact the reporters on this story:
