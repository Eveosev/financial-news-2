The seventh film in the Star Wars
series will be shot in Britain, producers of the science-fiction
franchise have confirmed,  London ’s Guardian newspaper says.  Shooting is scheduled to begin next year, with Star Trek
director J.J. Abrams taking the helm. Parts of earlier movies in
the series had been shot in the country, the paper says.  “We’ve devoted serious time and attention to revisiting
the origins of Star Wars as inspiration for our process on the
new movie,” Kathleen Kennedy, president of Star Wars producer
Lucasfilm, said. “It’s very exciting to be heading back.”  Burbank, California-based  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  bought Lucasfilm
Ltd. for $4.05 billion in cash and stock in October 2012. The
Star Wars films have generated $4.54 billion in worldwide ticket
sales, second to the Harry Potter series, Bloomberg News
reported in October.  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed
the news. “It is clear evidence that our incentives are
attracting the largest studios back to the U.K.,” he said in a
statement. “I am personally committed to seeing more great
films and television made in Britain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
