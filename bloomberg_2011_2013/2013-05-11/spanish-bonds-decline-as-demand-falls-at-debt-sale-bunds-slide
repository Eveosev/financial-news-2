Spain ’s 10-year government bonds
declined for the first time in six weeks as demand fell when the
nation sold a combined 4.57 billion euros ($5.9 billion) of
securities at an auction.  Spanish 10-year  yields  climbed to a two-week high as
investors submitted bids for 1.62 times the amount of 13-year
bonds sold on May 9, down from 2.85 times at the previous
auction in January. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio also
dropped for three- and five-year notes.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield
slid to the least since August 2010 after the nation sold 10-year securities for the first time since its bailout in 2011.
German 10-year bunds declined for a second week as  stocks  rose.  “The cover at the Spanish auction was a lot lower than
last time,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in  London . “People who have been chasing
Spanish yields externally probably feel like they have got
enough and aren’t going to chase it any further from here.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  climbed 16 basis points in the week,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 4.20 percent at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday, after rising to 4.26 percent, the highest level since
April 26. The rate increased for the first time since the period
ended March 29. The 5.4 percent bond due January 2023 dropped
1.385, or 13.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 109.375.  Spanish 10-year yields fell to a three-year low of 3.94
percent on May 3, one day after the  European Central Bank  cut
its main refinancing rate to boost growth.  Austerity Measures  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is seeking to end a six-year
slump after implementing the toughest austerity measures in the
nation’s democratic history. He won approval from the European
Commission to slow cuts in the European Union’s largest budget
deficit last month.  Spain is scheduled to sell bills maturing in six and 12
months on May 14. Italy plans to offer as much as 8 billion
euros of government debt on May 13 after borrowing costs at a
one-year bill auction fell to a record yesterday.  Portugal’s 10-year bonds advanced for a sixth week as the
nation’s first 10-year sale since 2011 attracted demand for more
than three times the amount the government was seeking.  “We are quite happy” with the sale, Portugal’s debt chief
Joao Moreira Rato said on May 7. “We have more than 360
investors and the book was three-times oversubscribed. It was a
big worry of ours to price well and to have the right size so I
hope it performs in the next few weeks.”  German Economy  The nation’s 10-year yield dropped five basis points this
week to 5.45 percent after falling to 5.41 percent on May 9, the
 least  since August 2010.  A report on May 15 will show  Germany’s (GDBR10)   economy  expanded 0.3
percent in the first quarter after contracting 0.6 percent in
the final three months of 2012, according to the median estimate
of 41 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed 14 basis points this
week to 1.38 percent after climbing to 1.39 percent yesterday,
the most since March 25.  Spanish bonds gained 8.3 percent this year through May 9,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds earned
0.7 percent, while Portuguese securities returned 6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
