France  reported its second confirmed
coronavirus-related infection today as an investigation to
identify other potential cases went on in the northern part of
the country.  The newly infected person shared the room with the first
patient infected by the new coronavirus from April 27 to April
29, the French Health Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  “This person, who had a prolonged and close contact with
the first patient, is currently being hospitalized and isolated
at the infectiology department of the regional university
hospital of Lille” in northern France, the ministry said. Tests
carried out on another suspected person were negative, it said.  France reported its first confirmed infection five days
ago. The patient had traveled to the  Middle East , where the
first cases of the virus were reported last year, according to
the  World Health Organization . Her roommate, a doctor and a
nurse have been hospitalized for tests in Valenciennes, in
northern France, radio station France Info reported.  Coronaviruses are a family of pathogens that cause
illnesses ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which sickened more than 8,000
people and killed 774 in 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO.
While the new virus is related to the one that causes SARS, it
appears far less transmissible, the WHO has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
