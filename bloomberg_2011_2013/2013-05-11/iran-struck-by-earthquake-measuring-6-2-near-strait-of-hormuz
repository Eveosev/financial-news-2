An earthquake hit the south of Iran
near the  Strait of Hormuz  this morning, 100 miles east-southeast
of  Bandar Abbas . Iranian seismologists confirmed the tremor,
according to the state-owned  Islamic Republic News Agency .  The quake struck at 6:38 a.m. local time and was measured
at 6.2 by the  U.S. Geological Survey . At least 11 people were
injured and five villages destroyed, Tehran-based  Press TV 
reported, citing Mahmoud Mozaffar, the head of the Rescue and
Relief Organization of Iranâ€™s Red Crescent Society.  Much of Iran lies close to geological fault-lines and is
prone to earthquakes. An earthquake in 2003 flattened the
southern city of Bam and killed about 40,000 people, while one
measured at 7.8 on the Richter scale struck last month. A
smaller one a week earlier shook the province of Bushehr,
raising concerns about the safety of a nuclear plant there.  About 10 aftershocks were detected, the strongest measuring
5.6 on the Richter scale. Rescue teams have been deployed, Press
TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
