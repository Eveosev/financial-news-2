Senate Democrats will try again next
week to advance the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the
Environmental Protection Agency, after Republicans boycotted a
committee vote on her this week.  California Senator  Barbara Boxer , the chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public Works committee, set a vote on the
nomination for May 16. The Democrat sent a letter to Louisiana
Senator  David Vitter , the top Republican on the panel, urging
him to attend the vote and to support McCarthy.  “As of the date of the upcoming business meeting, this
nomination will have been delayed at your request for four
weeks,” Boxer wrote in the letter, released late today. “It is
time to move forward with her nomination.”  Vitter has complained that the EPA hasn’t answered all of
his questions aimed at transparency at the agency. Committee
rules require at least two minority-party members to be present
or all majority-party members to vote in the affirmative.  McCarthy, if confirmed, would take over an agency that
Republicans have criticized for pollution limits that they say
will cost jobs and hurt the economy. McCarthy is the agency’s
assistant administrator for air pollution, and before joining
the Obama administration served Republican governors, including
 Mitt Romney  in  Massachusetts .  Vitter said he had asked five specific questions related to
transparency in EPA decision-making, and he said the agency had
only adequately answered one. Democrats circulated a series of
letters sent to Vitter with detailed responses to each query.  To contact the reporter on this story:
