Chris Rennard, former chairman of
the U.K.’s Liberal Democrat Party, will not be charged over
allegations of sexual touching, police said today.  The party, which is the junior partner in Prime Minister
David Cameron’s coalition government, said it will restart its
internal disciplinary inquiry into allegations that Rennard
sexually harassed women working for the party. Rennard denies
the allegations.  “The decision by the police not to prosecute Lord Rennard
with a criminal offense means that the party’s disciplinary
process, led by Alistair Webster QC, can now resume,” the
Liberal Democrats said in an e-mailed statement. “We consider
the allegations made against Lord Rennard, which he strenuously
denies, to be extremely serious and we can now continue with our
internal inquiry into these allegations.”  London ’s Metropolitan police said there wasn’t enough
evidence for it to press charges against Rennard, who sits as a
lawmaker in the upper House of Lords. Rennard voluntarily went
to a police station to be interviewed on June 16, police said.  “Various inquiries were conducted -- including meeting
with officials from the Liberal Democrat Party -- and a number
of individuals were spoken to as part of the investigation,”
the police said in a statement. “Those inquiries have now
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a
prosecution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
