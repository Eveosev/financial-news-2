  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the German
steelmaker forecasting a 2013 loss, plans to trim its executive
board to regain competitiveness after a slump in demand in
 Europe  drove prices for some of its products below cost.  Salzgitter will reduce the number of board members to three
from five when Wolfgang Eging and Heinz Groschke, responsible
for energy and trading, retire in January, it said today in a
statement. The company will reorganize into five divisions --
flat steel, heavy plate and section steel, energy, trading and
technology -- overseen by a new management committee, it said.  The steelmaker, 26.5 percent-owned by the state of  Lower
Saxony , announced plans in August to cut more than 1,500 jobs as
it seeks to save more than 200 million euros ($270 million) a
year. It lowered its profit forecast for the third time in nine
months on Aug. 5, citing impairments at the Peiner Traeger unit
and a “dramatic lack of orders” at its tubes division.  Today’s decision will deliver a “clear and lean management
structure,” Salzgitter said in the statement. Together with the
staff-reduction program, it will “secure the company’s
independence while safeguarding as many jobs as possible.”  Salzgitter has fallen 21 percent this year in Frankfurt
trading, while the MDAX Index for medium-sized companies has
climbed 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
