JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired Mark Alberici, who left Bank of America Corp. last month, as head of
equity derivatives structuring in New York.  Alberici, who works on structured notes that the bank
creates for sale to retail investors, started at JPMorgan this
month, said  Justin Perras , a company spokesman. He reports to
Jason Sippel, managing director of equity derivatives in New
York.  Alberici declined to comment when reached at his office.  He worked at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.
since July 2000, according to online records of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America  bought Merrill
Lynch in 2009.  The move was originally reported by
Structuredretailproducts.com, an industry newsletter.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets while earning fees and
raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such
as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
