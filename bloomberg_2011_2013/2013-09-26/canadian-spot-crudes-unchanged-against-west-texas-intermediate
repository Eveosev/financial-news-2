Canadian crudes were unchanged
against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate with little off-index trading in the spot market.  Western Canadian Select, a blend of heavy and bituminous
oils, was unchanged for November delivery at a $31.50 discount
to WTI, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. The
grade has dropped $7.50 against WTI this month.  Most trading on the Canadian spot crude market occurs
during index periods, when the average price of barrels to be
delivered the next month is set. Index trading for October
delivery ended Sept. 17. November index trading begins Oct. 1.  Canadian heavy crudes have weakened through the month on
expectations of rising production from  Alberta  and as fires and
equipment breakdowns this week cut demand for crude at
refineries in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast. WCS is at the
widest discount since Feb. 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Syncrude oil, a light grade produced in an upgrader from
heavy oil-sands bitumen, was unchanged at a discount of $3.50 to
WTI, according to Net Energy. Syncrude weakened from a $1
premium on Aug. 30 with upgraders that produce the oil coming
back online.  To contact the reporter on this story:
