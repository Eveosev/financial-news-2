Bjoern Borg AB (BORG) , a clothes retailer
named after the Swedish five-time Wimbledon tennis champion,
declined the most in three months after saying 2013 sales will
fall by as much as 4 percent because of a reconstruction of its
Dutch distributor’s operations.  The shares dropped as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since June 26. Bjoern Borg had fallen 3 percent
to 29.30 kronor as of 12:46 p.m. in  Stockholm . Trading volume
was more than twice the three-month daily average.  The distributor in the Netherlands applied for a
reconstruction of its retail operations, citing long-term
domestic market weakness, Stockholm-based Bjoern Borg said today
in a statement. The changes will mean a “substantial’ reduction
of the 24 stores operated by the distributor. Dutch wholesale
operations are in a separate company and not included in the
measures.  ‘‘We can see that this is a result of a tough macroeconomic
situation in the Netherlands,’’ Bjoern Borg Chief Executive
Officer Arthur Engel said in the statement. ‘‘This has strongly
affected local demand and hurt opportunities for our
distributor’s retail operations.’’  The company on Sept. 3 said it would discontinue its
business in  China  in 2013 because it hasn’t developed as
expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
