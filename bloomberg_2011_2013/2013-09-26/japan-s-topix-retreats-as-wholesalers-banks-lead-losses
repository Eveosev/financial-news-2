Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Topix index retreating for a third day, as wholesalers and banks
led losses among the gauge’s 33 industry groups.  The Topix slid 0.7 percent to 1,203.06 as of 9:02 a.m. in
Tokyo. Seven of the gauge’s groups advanced. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average lost 0.4 percent to 14,569.51.  The Topix climbed 9.5 percent in September after falling
for four months and was up 6.8 percent this quarter as of
yesterday. The measure surged 41 percent for the year through
yesterday, making Japanese equities the best performers among
developed markets.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold a press conference on
Oct. 1 to announce his decision on increasing the  sales tax ,
Jiji Press reported, citing a senior member of the ruling
 Liberal Democratic Party . The official said Abe is likely to
raise the levy as planned, according to the report.  Some 975 of the 1,745 companies in the Topix go  ex-dividend 
today, meaning investors buying the shares from here on won’t be
able to secure a dividend in the next round of payments.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The measure fell for a fifth day yesterday, the longest
losing streak this year, as concern grows that a looming
showdown over  government spending  poses a threat to growth.  The Topix traded at 1.27 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Japanese measure’s 30-day historic  volatility  was
at 19.04 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
