Asian  stocks  climbed, led by
Japanese shares, amid speculation the nation’s government will
study a corporate  tax cut  and advise public pension funds to
hold more risky assets.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  climbed 1.4 percent in  Tokyo , recovering
from an earlier decline, as the yen weakened against the dollar
for the first time in five days.  Finsoft Corp. (8018) , a trading-software maker, surged 538 percent on its trading debut in Hong
Kong. Advantest Corp., which makes semiconductor testing
devices, slid 3.2 percent after forecasting a loss.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent to 140.6 at
9:29 p.m. in Hong Kong after earlier declining as much as 0.7
percent. The equity benchmark has climbed 8 percent this month,
touching a four-month high on Sept. 23.  Japan ’s  Topix index 
reversed losses of as much as 1.6 percent after Kyodo News
reported the government plans to start a study on reducing the
 tax rate  paid by businesses. Some 975 of the 1,745 companies in
the gauge traded without the right to the latest dividend today.  “The market is getting a boost from the report on the
corporate tax rate cut and optimism the Government Pension
Investment Fund may boost shares in its portfolio,” said
Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive portfolio manager at
DIAM Co., which oversees more than $124 billion in assets
globally. “What’s kept a lid on the market, though, is the ex-dividend situation and poor U.S. market conditions.”  The Topix climbed 0.8 percent to a two-month high, while
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 1.2 percent. A group of
Japanese economists delivered its recommendations for the
world’s largest pension fund after markets closed in Tokyo. The
panel said the Government Pension Investment Fund should review
its holdings of domestic bonds.  Regional Indexes  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4 percent, Taiwan’s
Taiex Index lost 1.2 percent and  China ’s Shanghai Composite
declined 1.9 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index fell 0.4
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4 percent and
South Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.5 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index was little changed.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4
percent. The equity benchmark yesterday completed its longest
slump this year as Wal-Mart retreated and concern grew that a
political showdown over  government spending  poses a threat to
growth in the world’s largest economy.  Japan’s Topix has climbed 10 percent this month, extending
its surge this year to 42 percent, the biggest gain among 24
developed markets tracked by Bloomberg, amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  can lead the country
out of deflation through monetary easing.  Exporters Advance  Exporters climbed today in Japan as the yen fell 0.5
percent to 98.94 per dollar. Honda gained 1.4 percent to 3,870

Japan, climbed 1.4 percent to 3,175 yen.  Finsoft surged 538 percent to HK$5.23.  Nitto Denko Corp. (6988)  slumped 10 percent to 6,710 yen as BNP
Paribas SA advised selling shares of the materials manufacturer,
saying the surge since the announcement of its inclusion in the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average was overdone.  Advantest retreated 3.2 percent to 1,197 yen after
projecting a 2.5 billion-yen ($25 million) loss.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , which gets 12 percent of sales from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., declined 3.1 percent to HK$11.42. Wal-Mart is
