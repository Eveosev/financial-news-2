Wheat futures rose to a two-month
high after a government report showed improved U.S. sales to
 China  and  Brazil . Corn also advanced, while soybeans declined.  Exporters  sold  620,212 metric tons of wheat in the week
ended Sept. 19, up 44 percent from a year earlier, with China
and Brazil as the primary  destinations , the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . China, the world’s biggest
consumer of the grain, took 28 percent of new sales, the agency
said. Total sales since June 1 are up 39 percent from a year
earlier, government data show.  “China and Brazil were both buying U.S. wheat last week,
and that has given the market increased optimism about continued
new business,”  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for
Jefferies Bache LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“We are off to a very strong start, and sales will need to
continue to support a sustained rally.”  Wheat futures for delivery in December jumped 1.2 percent
to close at $6.7825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after touching $6.79, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 16.  Futures advanced for a fourth straight day, the longest
rally since July 31, on speculation that freezing weather during
the past week damaged the developing crop in  Argentina , the
Southern Hemisphere’s second-biggest exporter. Prices also
gained on speculation that a USDA report this month will show
Sept. 1 inventories fell 7.6 percent from a year earlier,
McCambridge said.  “We had very good demand during the first quarter” of the
marketing year that began June 1, McCambridge said. “The U.S.
is going to have a tight balance.”  Corn futures for delivery in December rose 0.4 percent to
$4.5675 a bushel in Chicago. Prices are down 11 percent since
the end of June, heading for a fourth straight quarterly
decline. U.S. farmers are expected to harvest 28 percent more
corn than in 2012.  Soybean futures for delivery in November slumped 0.4
percent to $13.1675 a bushel in Chicago. The price is up 5.2
percent since the end of June as dry weather in July and August
trimmed U.S. yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
