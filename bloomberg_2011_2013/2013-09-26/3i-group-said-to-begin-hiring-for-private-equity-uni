3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s oldest
private-equity firm, is looking to hire dealmakers after more
than a year of staff cuts, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  The London-based company plans to add associates to its
private-equity teams in the U.K. and  Germany , the two markets
where it sees the best potential for profitable buyouts, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private.  3i has also had informal talks with potential candidates
for a senior London-based role, two of the people said.  The return to hiring is a change in strategy by Chief
Executive Officer Simon Borrows. 3i has cut 160 employees,
equivalent to a third of its workforce, and closed six of the
firm’s 19 offices since June 2012 as Borrows sought to reduce
the company’s gross debt below 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion).  That target was achieved by June 30, according to 3i’s most
recent quarterly results. While the people said 3i still expects
to be a net seller of assets, the firm is beginning to make
investments to build investor confidence for a new capital pool.
Earlier this month, 3i announced it had invested 77 million
euros ($103 million) in GIF, a German automotive equipment
maker.  A spokeswoman for 3i based in  London  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
