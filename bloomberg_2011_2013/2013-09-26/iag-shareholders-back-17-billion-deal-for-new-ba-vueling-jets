IAG SA (IAG)  investors backed the
purchase of jets from  Boeing (BA)  Co. and  Airbus (EAD)  SAS worth $17
billion at list price to upgrade the fleets of its main British
Airways division and the Vueling low-cost unit.  Shareholders approved the addition of long-haul and narrow-body aircraft by “a sufficient majority” at an extraordinary
meeting in  Madrid  today, the London-based company said, with
more than 99 percent of votes cast backing each resolution.  British Airways, which this month began regular services
with Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Airbus A380 superjumbos, is
adding further planes to replace older models. Investors were
asked to back orders for 18 more Dreamliners and 18 Airbus
A350s, plus 62 A320s for Vueling, including 32 re-engined Neos.  IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is
known, plans to tap new long-haul destinations in  Asia  even as
it exits unviable short-haul routes and cuts more than 3,100
jobs at unprofitable Spanish arm Iberia in a bid to achieve 1.6
billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit in 2015. The
group bought full control of Vueling in April for 123.5 million
euros, extending its efforts to secure a Spanish turnaround.  The company will probably issue new earnings guidance soon,
Anand Date, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank with a “buy”
rating on the stock, said today in an investor note.  “We already expect a better result versus February
guidance,” he said, citing progress the company has made through
steps such as the Vueling purchase and restructuring measures.  IAG shares  fell 0.4 percent to 339.10 pence in London
before the results of the meeting were published, valuing
Europe’s third-largest airline by traffic at 6.8 billion pounds
($10.9 billion).  The top-up Dreamliner order includes at least 12 of the
largest 787-10s on offer from Boeing since June. The rest will
be 787-9s, the mid-sized variant that flew Sept. 17. Deliveries
will start in 2017, with the A350-1000s following a year later
and all 36 long-haul jets in the BA fleet by 2021.  Barcelona-based Vueling, in which IAG this year took
majority control, should see its fleet grow to 125 jets by then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
