BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest
mining company, priced $5 billion of notes in its biggest debt
raising in more than 18 months, as relative yields on mining
bonds in the U.S. were near the lowest level since June.  The four-part transaction follows a 750 million euro ($1
billion) note sale in April and a C$750 million ($727 million)
deal by the Melbourne-based company in May, Bloomberg-compiled
data show. BHP last sold into the U.S. market in February 2012,
when it priced $5.25 billion of debt in a five-part sale.  BHP, which has a $16 billion capital spending program for
fiscal 2014, follows  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  in selling new bonds since June as
producers seize on low yields and optimism for the long-term
outlook for commodities in  China  and other markets. The average
yield premium in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index of U.S.
mining and metals bonds touched 232 basis points this week, a
level unseen since June 5.  “High quality corporates are getting good-sized issuance
away at the moment,” said Ben Byrne, a credit sector specialist
at Citigroup Inc. in Sydney.  Glencore said this month it was selling 750 million euros
($1 billion) of seven-year notes in its first debt sale in the
currency since November, while  Rio Tinto  sold $3 billion of
dollar-debt in June.  Going Long  BHP issued $500 million of three-year, floating-rate notes
to yield 25 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and the same amount of 2.05 percent,
five-year debentures to yield 70 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company’s finance unit also sold $1.5 billion of 3.85
percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield of 125 basis points
and $2.5 billion of 5 percent, 30-year securities at a 130
basis-point spread.  The producer sought to tap demand for longer-dated paper,
with the 30-year component of yesterday’s BHP sale comprising
half the total bond transaction. Just 19 percent of the February
2012 multi-part deal was sold as 30-year debt.  BHP’s 2012 30-year U.S. dollar debt sale was priced to
yield 102 basis points more than Treasuries, 28 basis points
less than yesterday’s transaction. The yield premium over
sovereign securities on the February 2042 notes jumped 10 basis
points yesterday to 111, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “The 30-year tranche was interesting, they certainly hit
that one in size,” said  Michael Bush , head of credit research
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne . “When you look at
it on the curve, to me that 30-year pricing still looks pretty
attractive.”  BHP, which is rated A1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A+
by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, will use proceeds
from the bond sales “for general corporate purposes,”
according to a statement from the company.  Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. managed the offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
