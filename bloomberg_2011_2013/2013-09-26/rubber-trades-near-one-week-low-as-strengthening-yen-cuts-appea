Rubber traded near a one-week low
as the Japanese currency extended its advance against the
dollar, weakening the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  The contract for March delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange, which became the most-active today, dropped as low as
274.3 yen a kilogram ($2,788 a metric ton), approaching a one-week low for futures of 271.2 yen reached yesterday. Rubber
traded at 274.9 yen at 10:15 a.m. and headed for the first
quarterly advance since the three months through December.  The yen climbed to 98.27 per dollar, the highest level
since Sept. 19, amid concern that budget talks in  Washington 
risk a federal government shutdown, sparking demand for the
relative safety of Japan’s currency.  “Risk aversion by investors increased on a lack of
progress in the U.S. budget talks,” said Naohiro Niimura, a
partner at research company Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo.  Futures also came under pressure as oil in  New York 
extended losses for a sixth day, the longest losing streak in 16
months, raising speculation the price of competing synthetic
rubber may weaken, he said.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.6 percent to 20,455  yuan  ($3,342) a ton. Chinese
markets will be closed Oct. 1-7.  Thai rubber  free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 82.25 baht
($2.62) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
