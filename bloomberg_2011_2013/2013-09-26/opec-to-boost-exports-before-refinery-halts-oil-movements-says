The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase crude shipments by 1 percent
next month as they maximize flows before refineries are shut for
maintenance, according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will raise exports by 230,000 barrels a day to about 23.9
million a day in the four weeks to Oct. 12 compared with the
period to Sept. 14, the researcher said today in a report. The
figures exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and  Ecuador .  “It’s what you’d expect to happen at this time of year as
we start to get into refinery maintenance season,”  Roy Mason ,
the company’s founder, said by phone from Halifax,  England .
“It’s boring old seasonality and exports are likely to drift
downward until the end of October or start of November.”  Refiners typically trim imports at the end of the third
quarter while performing maintenance as summer demand in the
northern hemisphere for gasoline and diesel dwindles.  Brent
crude  was at $108.78 a barrel as of 3:17 p.m. today on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . It has risen 6.4 percent so
far this quarter.  Middle Eastern shipments will climb 2.4 percent to 17.72
million barrels a day to Oct. 12, compared with 17.31 million in
the month to Sept. 14, according to Oil Movements. Those figures
include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase 0.7 percent to 483.79
million barrels on Oct. 12, data from Oil Movements show. The
researcher calculates volumes by tallying tanker bookings, and
excludes crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
