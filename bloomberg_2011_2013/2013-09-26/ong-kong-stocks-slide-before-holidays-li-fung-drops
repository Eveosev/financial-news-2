Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index parings its biggest monthly advance in a year,
ahead of  China ’s seven-day holiday next week.  Li & Fung (494)  sank
after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it will cut orders.  New World Development Ltd., the homebuilder controlled by
the family of Hong Kong billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , slipped 1.2
percent after posting earnings that missed estimates.  Finsoft (8018) 
Corp., a maker of financial trading software, surged 538 percent
on its first trading day, the best Hong Kong debut since October
1996. Retail supplier Li & Fung dropped 3.1 percent.  The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.4 percent to 23,125.03 at the
close, with about three shares falling for every two that rose
on the gauge. Trading volume was 12 percent below the 30-day
average ahead of the National Day break starting Oct. 1. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share
index, declined 0.5 percent to 10,541.03.  “Investors are probably taking some money off the table
ahead of the holidays in China next week since we’ve had a good
run this month,” Jackson Wong, vice president of Hong Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities Co., said in a telephone
interview. “Investors aren’t making big bets until the debt-ceiling debate in the U.S. is resolved. If an agreement cannot
be reached, that could pose systemic risks.”  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent. The measure
yesterday completed its longest slump this year as Wal-Mart
retreated and concern grew that a political showdown over
 government spending  poses a threat to growth. Congress is yet to
pass a budget as lawmakers tussle over funding the 2010 health-care overhaul known as Obamacare. The lack of an agreement may
spur a government shutdown Oct. 1.  Li & Fung  Li & Fung sank 3.1 percent to HK$11.42 even after the
supplier of toys and clothes said Wal-Mart is continuing to
place orders for 2014 as usual. Wal-Mart said it was cutting
orders to suppliers this quarter and next to address rising
inventory. the company flagged in last month’s earnings report.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 6.4 percent this month, poised
for its biggest monthly advance since September 2012, after a

yesterday, compared with 15.4 for the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index. The  H-share index  entered a  bull market  this month after
rebounding 20 percent from a June low.  China’s real gross domestic product could grow as much as
7.5 percent this year and beyond, a level that will become the
“new normal,” Paul Gruenwald, Singapore-based Asia-Pacific
chief economist at Standard & Poor’s, wrote in a report
yesterday. The new leadership under Premier  Li Keqiang  and
President Xi Jinping appears to accept the reality that growth
is bound to slow, according to the report.  New World  New World slid 1.2 percent to HK$11.88. Underlying profit,
which excludes property revaluation gains and deferred taxes,

average estimate of 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, Finsoft jumped 538 percent to
HK$5.23 on its trading debut. The company offered 50 million
shares at 82 Hong Kong cents each in its initial public
offering.  The Fed said after its meeting last week that it wants to
