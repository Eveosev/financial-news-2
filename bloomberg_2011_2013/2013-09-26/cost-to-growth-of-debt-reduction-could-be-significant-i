Debt reduction by governments will
require a “sustained commitment” to fiscal consolidation that
could initially increase their debt ratios, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in a paper released today.  The cost to economic growth could be significant in the
short-term, which shows the importance of getting the pace of
fiscal consolidation right and acting to mitigate the negative
effect on growth, according to the paper.  “The good news is that high debt can be tamed even when
growth is low,” Helge Berger, an adviser in the IMF’s European
department, and Justin Tyson, a senior economist in the
department, said in a blog post based on today’s paper. “The
bad news is that, fiscal consolidation will likely come with an
initial price of lowering growth,” they said.  “This means that, where possible, consolidation should
happen gradually, supported by credible medium-term plans that
help to spread the effort over time,” Berger and Tyson said.
“Any measures to increase medium-term growth, such as
structural reforms, should also be enacted now.”  Advanced economies are under pressure to reduce debt levels
that are approaching all-time highs at a time of low economic
growth, making the task more difficult. According to the IMF’s
 World Economic Outlook , average output growth in advanced
economies between 2013 and 2018 could be almost 1.5 percentage
points below the rates experienced by those economies between
1980-2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
