Ethanol strengthened for a second
day, narrowing its discount to gasoline, as blenders expecting
lower prices later this year bought the biofuel to shore up
supplies for the short term.  Futures rose 5.7 percent after jumping 3.8 percent
yesterday. The spread tightened 7.69 cents to 69.8 cents a
gallon. October ethanol’s premium to November widened 6 cents to
27.9 cents, a phenomenon known as backwardation, when prompt
deliveries are more expensive than later ones. The December
contract was 8.5 cents below November.  “People aren’t wanting to buy much on a prompt basis, just
their immediate needs,” said Michael Slider, director of
business development at Fauser Energy Resources in  Oregon ,
 Illinois . “They’re just getting enough to get by.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 10.9 cents to
$2.007 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
settlement in three weeks. Futures have slumped 18 percent in
the third quarter and 8.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery added 3.21 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.705 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Slider said backwardation causes price squeezes when end
users of the biofuel get caught short product.  An Energy Information Administration report yesterday
showed  stockpiles  of the additive dropped 3.5 percent to 15.6
million barrels last week, the lowest level since June 28.  Production, Inputs  Ethanol  production  sank 0.7 percent to 832,000 barrels a
day, the lowest level since Aug. 30, data from the Energy
Department’s statistical arm showed.  Blender inputs , a measure
of demand, jumped 1.2 percent.  Corn for December delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$4.5675 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush spread of corn
to ethanol was minus 2 cents, little changed from yesterday. All
crush spreads through July 2016 were negative.  Ethanol is part of U.S. energy plans to reduce dependence
on fossil fuels. The government maintains compliance with
consumption targets with Renewable Identification Numbers, or
RINs, tracking certificates attached to each batch of biofuel
that can be traded among refiners and later submitted to the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Corn-based RINs rose 2 cents to 51 cents, compared to 7
cents in January, while  advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol jumped 0.5 cent to 58.5 cents,
from 37 cents in January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 17
cents to $2.495 a gallon; in  New York  the additive increased
12.5 cents to $2.40; on the West Coast prices gained 6 cents to
$2.32; and in Chicago the biofuel lost 6.5 cents to $2.405 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s premium to New York dwindled 19 cents to 0.5
cents, while the West Coast’s discount to the Gulf widened 11
cents to 17.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
