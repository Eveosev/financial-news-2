Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  headed for the
highest close in more than eight months after the Persian Gulf’s
second-biggest phone company agreed to sell its stake in PT Axis
Telekom Indonesia.  The Riyadh-based operator gained 2.4 percent to 43.3 riyals
at 12:51 p.m. in Riyadh, boosting its market capitalization to
86 billion riyals ($23 billion). That’s the highest level on a
closing basis since Jan. 20. More than four million shares were
traded, almost five times the three-month average. The stock was
the most-traded by value on the benchmark  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX) , which slipped 0.2 percent.  PT XL Axiata Tbk. (EXCL) , a unit of Malaysia’s largest mobile-phone operator, will acquire Axis from Saudi Telecom and settle
$865 million of the closely held carrier’s debts, according to a
stock exchange filing in  Kuala Lumpur  today. XL Axiata, a 66.5
percent-owned subsidiary of  Axiata Group Bhd. (AXIATA) , is paying $100
cash for the share capital of Axis.  The transaction requires regulatory approval from
Indonesia, in addition to approval from XL shareholders, Saudi
Telecom said in a statement to the nation’s stock exchange. Nine 
analysts  have a buy rating on the phone company, while seven
recommend investors hold the shares, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
