Carson Yeung, the owner of English
soccer team Birmingham City on trial for  money laundering , will
testify next month in a reversal of an earlier decision not to
take the stand.  District Court Judge Douglas Yau today allowed the  Hong
Kong  businessman’s application to reopen his defense after it
had earlier rested. The trial will resume Oct. 15.  Yeung, 53, pleaded not guilty to five charges of laundering
HK$721.3 million ($93 million) in deposits from parties
including a Macau casino operator and securities firms  over a
seven-year period to 2007. The son of a vegetable stand salesman
ran a successful hair salon and parlayed his earnings into savvy
investments in real estate and stocks, Yeung’s lawyers said.  Yeung was chairman of Grandtop International Holdings Ltd.,
which in 2007 bought a 29.9 percent stake in the West Midlands,
U.K.-based soccer club for 15 million pounds ($23 million).
Yeung bought the rest of the club in 2009, paying 81.5 million
pounds to David and Ralph Gold and  David Sullivan  and Grandtop
changed its name to  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309)   Police allege that the purchase was partly funded by money
connected to his money laundering charges. His defense says he
earned that money from trading stocks.  Yeung was arrested in June 2011 and shares of Birmingham
International have been suspended since. The soccer club had a
42 percent drop in sales for the six months ended Dec. 31, 2012,
after the team’s relegation from the top-flight Premier League
2011, according to its interim report.  Birmingham International issued a profit warning Sept. 9 it
attributed to the sales of players registrations. The company
said last month it was still in preliminary negotiations over
the sale of its stake in the  soccer club .  The case is Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Yeung Ka-sing Carson, DCCC860/2011 in the Hong Kong District
Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
