Cocoa swung between gains and
losses in  London  as investors weighed more selling by  Ivory
Coast , the world’s largest producer, and forecasts for shortages
in the season starting next month. Coffee and sugar slid.  Ivory Coast offered to sell beans for shipment in the
2014-15 season yesterday after futures traded on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London entered a  bull market  earlier this month.
Supplies will fall short of demand by 173,000 metric tons in
2013-14 as dry weather earlier this year reduced crop potential
in West Africa, says Macquarie Group Ltd. The crop in Ivory
Coast may get a boost from normal rainfall in the next 10 days,
weather forecaster World Weather Inc. said yesterday.  “It looks like they are taking advantage of the higher
prices,”  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group,
said by phone today, commenting on the Ivorian sales offers.
“Rains became a bit heavier in West Africa and we are getting
closer and closer to the start of the new harvest.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to 1,679
pounds ($2,695) a ton by 11:21 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Prices rose as much as 0.3 percent and fell as much as 0.8
percent earlier today. Cocoa for December delivery gained 0.3
percent to $2,582 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Futures
trading volumes on ICE were 28 percent higher than the average
for the past 100 days for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ivorian beans for shipment from October to December 2014
were offered at yesterday’s auction at a minimum price of 1,309
 CFA francs  ($2.68) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to data on
the website of industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao. That
would mean a premium of about 38 pounds ($61) a ton to the March
2015 futures, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Bull Market  Cocoa entered a bull market on Sept. 5 and rose to 1,700
pounds a ton on Sept. 16, the highest level in a year. In New
York, futures entered a bull market last month and are this
year’s best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
raw materials followed by cotton and crude.  “Prices need to stay high to accelerate selling and to
dampen short-term demand,” Haque said. The recent rains “may
help Ivory Coast to get a longer tail to the main crop.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 1.2 percent
lower at $1,688 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for December
delivery slid 0.5 percent to $1.1665 a pound on ICE.  White sugar for December delivery retreated 0.6 percent to
$488 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in March fell 0.5
percent to 18.10 cents a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
