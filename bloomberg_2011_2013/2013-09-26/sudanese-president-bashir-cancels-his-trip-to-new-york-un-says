Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir,
who’s wanted by the  International Criminal Court , has cancelled
his trip to New York to participate in the United Nations
General Assembly, according to the UN.  Ali Karti, the foreign minister of Sudan, will instead
address the world body on Sept. 27, UN spokesman Jerome Bernard
said in an e-mail. The International Criminal Court is seeking
Bashir’s arrest and trial on charges of  war crimes  in Darfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
