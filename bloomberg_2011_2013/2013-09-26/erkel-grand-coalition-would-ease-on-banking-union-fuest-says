German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may
agree to a centralized European bank resolution system if she
allies with the Social Democratic Party for her third-term
government, Clemens Fuest, head of the ZEW economic research
institute, said in an interview.  A so-called grand coalition of Merkel’s  Christian Democrats 
and the SPD, Germany’s two biggest factions, “is likely not to
stand in the way of a European resolution authority,” the head
of the Mannheim-based institute said by phone. At the same time,
Germany probably wouldn’t give up on its demand for disclosure
of banks’ legacy assets as a prerequisite, he said.  If the two parties govern jointly, they would probably also
ease the terms of aid loans made to  Greece (GKGNGDPY)  to stem the euro-area
debt crisis by extending maturities and lowering interest rates,
Fuest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
