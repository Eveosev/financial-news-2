Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, received a reloaded spot
cargo from Spain, shipping data show.  The Wilgas, with a capacity of about 127,000 cubic meters,
arrived Sept. 24 at Rio de Janeiro, according to transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. State-owned Petroleo
Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, has a floating regasification
terminal at Guanabara Bay.  The vessel sailed from SAGGAS Planta de Regasificacion de
Sagunto SA’s Sagunto terminal in eastern Spain, where it loaded
the supercooled natural gas from storage and departed on Aug.
16, the data show. Spain doesn’t produce LNG.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based
Petrobras will import as many as 15 cargoes a month in 2014, a
company official said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
