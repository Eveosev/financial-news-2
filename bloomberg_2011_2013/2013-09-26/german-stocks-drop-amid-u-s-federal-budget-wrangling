German stocks  were little changed,
following a two-day gain, as political wrangling delayed the
approval of a new U.S.  federal budget  before Monday’s deadline.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  lost 0.6 percent as a gauge of banks
posted the largest drop of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  advanced 2.2 percent as a
gauge of telecom companies rose the most on the Stoxx 600.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slipped less than 0.1 percent to 8,664.1 at
the close in  Frankfurt . The equity benchmark has still climbed
6.9 percent so far this month, extending its rally this quarter
to 8.9 percent, as the Federal Reserve unexpectedly refrained
from reducing its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases. The
broader HDAX Index increased less than 0.1 percent today.  “Investors are becoming again concerned regarding a
potential fiscal cliff in the U.S.,” Roger Peeters, chief
executive officer at Close Brothers Seydler Research in
Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail. “Government and opposition have
only a few days left to find a solution and the negotiations
seem to be hard from both sides.”  U.S. lawmakers have until Monday to agree on an emergency
budget to keep the federal government operating from Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year. Failure to pass a bill may
lead to a government shutdown.  New Budget  Republican Senator Ted Cruz gave a 21-hour speech yesterday
protesting against President  Barack Obama ’s reforms that
increase the number of people with access to health care.
Republicans, particularly in the House, have made undermining
Obamacare a condition for approving a new budget.  Democrats have said they will block major changes to the
Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers will probably also have to act to
increase the federal government’s debt ceiling as  total
borrowing  approaches the $16.7 trillion limit.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that jobless
 claims  decreased by 5,000 to 305,000 in the week ended Sept. 21.
The  median  forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
called for an increase to 325,000.  A Commerce Department release showed that the world’s
largest economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the
second quarter, slower than the 2.6 percent pace forecast by
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Gross domestic product
expanded 1.1 percent in the first quarter.  The National Association of Realtors’ index of  pending
house sales  fell 1.6 percent in August, more than the 1 percent
decline that economists had forecast in a Bloomberg  survey .
Sales retreated a revised 1.4 percent in July.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s biggest lender, slipped 0.6
percent to 34.36 euros.  Deutsche Telekom added 2.3 percent to 10.81 euros as
Europe’s second-biggest telephone company rose to the highest
price since July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
