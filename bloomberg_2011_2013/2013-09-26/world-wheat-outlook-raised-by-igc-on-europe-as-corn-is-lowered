World wheat production will be
higher than predicted a month ago on bigger-than-expected crops
in  Europe  and  Morocco , while the outlook for corn was cut on
China and Europe, the International Grains Council said.  The wheat harvest will climb to 692.6 million metric tons
in the 2013-14 season begun July 1, up 2 million tons from an
Aug. 30 forecast, the London-based council wrote in a report
today. That compares with 654.9 million tons a year earlier.  Wheat for delivery in December climbed 3.4 percent this
month in Chicago trading amid concern adverse weather might curb
production in Russia and  Argentina . Corn fell 6 percent on
expectations for a record global crop.  “A generally bearish supply outlook weighed on U.S. and
South American maize export prices,” the IGC wrote, using
another name for corn. “The prospect of adequate supplies has
weighed on sentiment.”  Global corn production is seen climbing to 943.2 million
tons in 2013-14, 2.2 million tons below the prior estimate,
according to the IGC. That will still be a record crop, it said.
Output was 862.9 million tons in the previous period. The U.S.
harvest will increase to 350 million tons, unchanged from the
prior estimate, from 273.8 million tons a year earlier.  China ’s corn-crop outlook was cut by 4 million tons to 210
million tons, while the wheat forecast was left at 118 million
tons. The council kept a forecast for Chinese corn imports of 7
million tons and wheat purchases of 7.2 million tons.  Ukraine, Morocco  Farmers in Ukraine are predicted to gather 28 million tons
of corn, 4 million tons more than forecast previously and up
from 20.9 million tons in 2012-13. The European Union corn-crop
outlook was cut by 1.5 million tons to 64.2 million tons.  The EU wheat harvest was forecast at 143.3 million tons,
1.3 million tons more than the previous outlook and rising from
last year’s 131.6 million tons. The estimate of Morocco’s
harvest was raised by 2 million tons to 7 million tons, compared
with 2012-13 production of 3.9 million tons.  Argentina’s wheat crop may climb to 11 million tons,
against an Aug. 30 outlook for 12 million tons, from 8.5 million
tons, the IGC said. That exceeds the 9.5 million-ton projection
from the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  The outlook for Russia’s wheat crop was trimmed to 51
million tons from 51.5 million tons, climbing from 37.7 million
tons in 2012. The IGC held its estimate for U.S. production at
57.5 million tons.  The council also kept global rice and soybean harvest
estimates unchanged from the previous outlook at 474 million
tons and 280 million tons, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
