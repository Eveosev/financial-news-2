Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) ’s
founders gained approval from 95.99 percent of shareholders for
their plan to acquire the ferrochrome producer and extended
their offer to Oct. 9 for the remaining investors.  Eurasian Resources Group BV, owner of 54 percent of ENRC,
gained acceptances from 16.1 percent of shareholders as of
yesterday, it said today in a statement. Total support for the
offer reached 95.99 percent after including the “irrevocable
undertaking” from  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , which owns a 26 percent stake.  Eurasian Resources, set up by  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov along with the Kazakh government,
offered $2.65 in cash and 0.23 of a Kazakhmys share for each
ENRC share in June. The bid, which they said was equal to 234.3
pence a share, compares with the 540-pence price of ENRC stock
in an initial public offering in London in 2007. They valued the
latest offer at 3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion).  ENRC traces its roots to the founders’ participation in the
1990s privatizations of Kazakh state assets, gradually combined
into a single group of companies and listed in London in 2007.
The company is under investigation by the U.K.’s Serious Fraud
Office over allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption at its
operations in Kazakhstan and  Africa .  Kazakhmys shareholders approved the deal on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
