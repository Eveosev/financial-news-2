Prior to that, he was an adviser to the senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, the firm said in a statement.  “Companies and industries are dealing with infrastructure protection and cybersecurity issues that cut across the globe and require compliance with a growing thicket of regulatory requirements,” Angela B.

Task Force Seeks New Laws to Fight 21st-Century Crimes  New York needs to update state laws dating from 1986 to better prosecute white-collar criminals, according to a special task force report released by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.  Current laws predate the Internet, social media and e-commerce and can’t keep pace with increasingly sophisticated frauds, Vance said Sept. 24 at New York University’s Center for the Administration of Criminal Law. Proposals include expanding the definition of larceny to cover the theft of software and personal identifying information, and eliminating a requirement that schemes to defraud target more than one victim.  “The Internet has become our 21st-century crime scene,” Vance said, noting that the most recent overhaul of New York’s penal code dates from the invention of Xerox Corp.’s first fax machine.  For example, old definitions of larceny don’t cover theft by duplication, a common means of stealing computer code, Vance said. The  task force  recommends expanding the definition of “computer material” to let prosecutors target hacking into another person’s private e-mail or webcam, and combat using computers to spy on unwitting victims.  Criminal law in New York state has been mostly unchanged since 1965, and the last notable alterations to white-collar crime enforcement were made in 1986, leaving fraud and corruption laws antiquated, Vance’s office has said.  The task force, convened almost a year ago, includes district attorneys, academics and defense lawyers. Their recommendations will be presented to the governor and the state legislature for consideration in the 2014 January session. Aside from cybercrime, the report targets four main areas: fraud, elder fraud, public corruption and procedural reforms.  For more, click here.
