Enforcement lawyers at the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission have dropped a policy of
acting without approval to extend investigations, according to
 Scott O’Malia , a Republican member who opposed the practice.  The agency’s enforcement division reconsidered its policy
of extending investigations absent commissioners’ objections and
will now seek their express approval with a vote, O’Malia said
in a statement today. The are four sitting members of the
commission which regulates derivatives.  “It is imperative for the commission to issue formal
orders of investigation that are consistent with congressional
intent and that reflect the commission’s collective opinion,
based upon each commissioner’s independent review of the merits
of each request,” O’Malia said.  The agency’s enforcement process was first highlighted by
O’Malia on July 23 at a congressional hearing during which he
said the policy was undermining commissioners’ oversight. He
said he had dissented from an enforcement matter because of the
procedural shift.  Steve Adamske , CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
