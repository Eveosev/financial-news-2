ABN Amro  Group NV hired Jan-Maarten Mulder as global head of commodities, a newly-created role.  Amsterdam-based Mulder reports to Maarten Terlouw, global
head of energy, commodities and transportation, ABN Amro said in
an e-mailed statement today. ABN Amro combined agriculture,
metals and energy commodities teams into a single business,
according to the statement. Mulder was global head of corporate
finance and treasury at Trafigura Beheer BV from 2006 to 2012.  “Commodities is a very important segment within ECT and we
believe this development will strengthen our ability to provide
a leading client service,” Terlouw said of the decision to
combine the teams, according to the statement.  Terlouw was recently promoted to global head of ECT from
global head of energy, replacing Harris Antoniou, who left last
month. Terlouw joined ABN Amro last year and previously was head
of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s global industrials team in
 London . Rui Florencio was promoted to global head of energy
commodities, reporting to Mulder, according to the statement.  Energy and transportation sector teams will continue to
operate separately within ECT division, the bank said.  ABN Amro, formed after the collapse of Fortis in 2008, will
be sold to the public for as much as 15 billion euros ($20
billion) in about a year, according to the Dutch government.  Mulder worked at Fortis commodities division before
Trafigura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
