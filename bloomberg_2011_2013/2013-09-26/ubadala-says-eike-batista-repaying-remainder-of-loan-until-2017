Mubadala Development Co., an Abu
Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, said the remainder of a $2 billion
loan made to  Eike Batista ’s EBX Group Co. will be repaid over
four years as he seeks to prevent his companies from collapse.  The unnamed “third party” will repay “progressively”
until June 30 2017, according to the wealth fund’s first half
report published today. A Mubadala official, who asked not to be
identified, confirmed that the information in the financial
statement related to Mubadala’s investment in EBX.  Mubadala said in July that it restructured a $2 billion
investment in the former billionaire’s holding company after a
stock-market selloff pushed down the value of his businesses.
Mubadala, which had said that EBX had redeemed a “significant
portion” of its original investment, was repaid with a
combination of cash and securities, according to today’s report.  The remaining loan is backed by “guarantees and pledges
over securities,” according to the wealth fund.  Commodities trader Trafigura and Mubadala said earlier this
month they plan to buy a controlling stake in Batista’s iron-ore
port for about $400 million as the Brazilian entrepreneur sells
off pieces of his commodities and logistics empire.  To contact the reporters on this story:
