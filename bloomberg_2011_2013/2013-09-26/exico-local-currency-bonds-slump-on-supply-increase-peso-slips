Mexican peso bonds maturing from
2017 to 2024 slumped a day after the government issued 20
billion pesos ($1.5 billion) of the securities in a swap to
extend debt maturities.  Yields on the bonds maturing in 2024 increased four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.02 percent at 12:19 p.m.
in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is
the highest on a closing basis since Sept. 17. The peso weakened
0.4 percent to 13.0557 per dollar.  The bonds extended declines as the U.S. budget impasse
damped demand for emerging-market assets, according to Siobhan Morden, the head of Latin American strategy at Jefferies Group
LLC in New York.  The “curve extension comes at an inopportune moment
against weaker sentiment,” Morden said in an e-mailed response
to questions.  The government bought back yesterday 21.3 billion pesos of
shorter-term securities maturing from 2014 to 2016 under the
debt exchange.  A statement today from the government disclosing plans to
increase bond offerings next quarter drove some investors to
sell, Alejandro Padilla, a strategist at Grupo Financiero
Banorte SAB, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
