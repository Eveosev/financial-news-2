LDK Solar Co.,  China ’s second-biggest maker of solar wafers, said it got a 30-day reprieve
from having to pay interest on debt payments that were due last
month.  The forbearance arrangement, covering payments that were
due Aug. 28 on the company’s 2014 securities, will expire on
Oct. 27, the company said today in a statement on its website.
LDK Solar said it is “the first step in achieving a consensual
solution to its obligations under the notes.”  Xinyu, China-based LDK said Sept. 4 it delayed $13 million
of interest payments that were due last month. It’s hired
Jefferies Group LLC to advise on its offshore debt obligations.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
