BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) , the smartphone
maker looking to go private in a $4.7 billion deal, is seeing
support from suppliers, bank customers and partners wobble amid
speculation the company may stop producing hardware.  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL) , an electronics supplier whose second-largest customer is BlackBerry, said yesterday it will probably
disengage from that relationship in the coming months. That’s a
sign the smartphone company’s device business is shrinking, said
 Peter Misek , an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC.  “BlackBerry’s ongoing handset business will be much
smaller and could even disappear,” said the New York-based
analyst, who has a hold rating on the shares.  The Jabil comments follow a move by  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) , the
fourth-largest U.S. carrier, to begin removing BlackBerry
inventory from its stores. While display models of the phones
will still be on view, customers will have to get inventory
shipped to them directly, T-Mobile said in a statement. Reuters
previously  reported  on the plan.  “T-Mobile continues to support the BlackBerry platform,”
the Bellevue, Washington-based carrier said. “The T-Mobile
retail channel is moving toward fulfillment via direct ship for
BlackBerry devices, rather than in-store inventory.”  Comeback Fizzles  The revamped BlackBerry 10 lineup, unveiled in January as
the linchpin of the company’s comeback plan, hasn’t sold as well
as analysts had projected. That’s contributed to plunging sales
and mounting losses. Longtime customers such as  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
are holding off on committing to new devices, people familiar
with the matter have said.  UBS AG (UBSN) , the world’s biggest wealth-management firm, also
has yet to make the upgrade and is running a BlackBerry 10 pilot
project to determine whether to move to the new platform, said
Samuel Brandner, a spokesman for the Zurich-based bank. UBS
employees can use older models of BlackBerry, or Apple Inc.’s
iPhones with added security software, to access work e-mail, he
said.  While UBS currently uses about 20,000 BlackBerrys globally,
the bank is evaluating other technical solutions and has
“strategic options ready in case of a permanent blackout of
BlackBerry,” Brandner said.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-biggest bank,
has decided against adopting BlackBerry 10 for now, the company
said in a statement. In addition to the lack of its
compatibility with BlackBerry’s earlier platforms, the
“dwindling albeit loyal population of BlackBerry users, and
concerns about long-term viability, are causing us to pause and
wait and see on any upgrades,” the Zurich-based bank said.  ‘Viable Alternatives’  “There are other very viable and attractive secure
enterprise mobile alternatives now that mean we do not need to
solely rely on BlackBerry as our mobile platform,” the bank
said.  Faced with these challenges, BlackBerry reached a tentative
agreement this week for a buyout by a group led by its biggest
shareholder,  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)  The consortium is
still seeking financing for the offer, which will be subject to
due diligence and further negotiation.  BlackBerry relies on Jabil and  Wistron Corp. (3231)  to supply it
with handsets, and the Jabil announcement suggests changes are
in the works, Misek said. After an inventory writedown of almost
$1 billion primarily for unsold BlackBerry Z10 models, the
question turns to what the company will do with its Q10, a
keyboard-equipped device that was released more recently.  BlackBerry “may just stop most of the production and use
its existing stockpile and channel inventory to fulfill demand
from any enterprise who are upgrading,” he said.  Stocks Drop  Shares of St. Petersburg, Florida-based Jabil tumbled 9.9
percent to $21.62 at the close in New York, the biggest drop in
more than two years. BlackBerry fell 0.7 percent to $7.95, its
third straight day of declines.  Concern over declining orders also took a toll on Taiwan-based Wistron. It accounts for 40 percent to 50 percent of
BlackBerry’s phone shipments, according to Ying-chang Kuo, an
analyst at President Capital Management in Taipei. The shares
fell the most since April in Taiwan trading today.  Celestica Inc. (CLS) , a Toronto-based electronics supplier, began
winding down its BlackBerry production last year. At the time,
the company got almost a fifth of its revenue from the
smartphone company.  After releasing preliminary quarterly results last week,
BlackBerry plans to issue more complete numbers tomorrow
morning. It won’t be holding its customary conference call with
analysts, citing the Fairfax buyout agreement.  James Moorman, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York,
said in a report that he was disappointed about the canceled
call, though he believes the company should focus on closing the
Fairfax deal.  “We think it will be its best option,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
