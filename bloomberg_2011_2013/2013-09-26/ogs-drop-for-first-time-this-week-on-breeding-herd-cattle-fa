Hog futures fell for the first time
this week on speculation that U.S. producers are starting to
retain more sows for breeding, signaling a rebound in the size
of the herd. Cattle also dropped.  The breeding herd on Sept. 1 probably rose to 5.866 million
hogs, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts. Cash-hog  prices  jumped as much
as 7.4 percent since Sept. 6 on concern that the supply of
animals available for slaughter was shrinking. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture will release its quarterly estimate of
hog inventories tomorrow at 3 p.m. in  Washington .  “Hog numbers are going to go up,” Mark Schultz, the chief
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis ,
 Minnesota , said in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for December settlement dropped 1 percent to
87.725 cents a pound at 10:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after rallying 2.9 percent in the previous three
sessions.  While the breeding herd will increase, the total number of
hogs will drop 1 percent from a year earlier to 67.463 million
animals, the Bloomberg survey showed.  The average  weight  of hog carcasses at slaughtering plants
rose yesterday to 205.22 pounds, up 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, USDA data show.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.31 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for November
settlement rose 0.3 percent to $1.645 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
