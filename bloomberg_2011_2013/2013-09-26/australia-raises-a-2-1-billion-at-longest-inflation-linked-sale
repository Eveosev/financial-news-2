Australia  extended its inflation-linked bond maturities to 22 years, selling A$2.1 billion ($2
billion) with the yield at the bottom of the target range.  The 2 percent security due Aug. 21, 2035, sold at a price
of A$96.943 per A$100 face amount, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Australian Office of Financial
Management. That equates to a spread of 25 basis points over
existing 2030 notes tied to consumer prices, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The government said yesterday it was targeting a
premium of 25 basis points to 29 basis points. The yield to
maturity was 2.2 percent.  This year has been the worst on record for investors in
Australian inflation-protected securities, which have lost 4
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data that go
back to 1997. Australian inflation has held within the central
bank’s target range of 2 percent to 3 percent this year.  “We didn’t think the issue would go this well,” said
Peter Jolly, head of market research for National Australia Bank
Ltd. in Sydney, the nation’s largest bank measured by assets.
“There was very strong demand. There’s not an inflation issue
in Australia now. But you’re not buying it for inflation
insurance today. You’re buying it for the next 22 years.”  The yield on Australia’s 2030 linker, previously the
longest-maturity federal bond, rose 86 basis points this year to
1.91 percent as of 4:54 p.m. in Sydney, Bloomberg-compiled data
show.  The AOFM said yesterday the offering would be at least
A$500 million. The sale was managed by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
