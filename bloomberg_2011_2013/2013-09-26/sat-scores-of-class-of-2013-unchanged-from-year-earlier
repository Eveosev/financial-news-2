The high school class of 2013
showed no improvement in SAT scores compared with the previous
class, prompting the college entrance exam’s administrator to
deem the results a “call to action.”  Fewer than half of the test takers, 43 percent, were
academically prepared for college-level work, the New York-based
 College Board , which owns the SAT, said today in a report. That
figure has changed little in five years, the group said. Average
scores were 514 for math, 496 for critical reading and 488 for
writing, matching last year’s results.  The SAT scores have declined or stagnated for years, from
2005 highs of 520 in math and 508 in reading. The average
writing score has decreased almost every year since that section
debuted in 2006 at 497. The exam, used by most U.S. colleges in
determining admission, is being revamped and a new version will
be announced in January, College Board President David Coleman
said on a conference call with reporters.  “We must dramatically increase the number of students in
K-12 who are prepared for college and careers,” Coleman said in
a statement. “Only by transforming the daily work that students
do can we achieve excellence and equity.”  About 30 percent of test takers were African American,
American Indian or Hispanic, up from 27 percent five years ago,
according to the nonprofit College Board, whose members include
universities. A total of 1.66 million students took the exam, a
drop of about 4,400 from a year earlier.  More students in the class of 2013 took the ACT, a rival
test owned by ACT Inc., based in Iowa City. ACT reported 1.8
million test takers, an 8 percent increase from the previous
year, according to an  August report .  Last year, the number of students taking the SAT was neck
in neck with those taking the ACT, according to the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
