Slovakia will collect more in taxes
than previously thought as economic  growth  exceeds expectations,
helping the eastern euro-area member bring its budget shortfall
below the European Union’s ceiling.  The government will probably  raise  132 million euros ($178
million) -- about 0.2 percent of gross domestic product -- more
in taxes this year than it projected three months ago, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement on its website today. Tax
receipts in 2014 and 2015 will exceed the June forecasts by 127
million euros and 134 million euros, respectively.  The rosier outlook is driven by the government’s revision
last week of its 2013 GDP-growth forecast to 0.8 percent, from
0.5 percent projected in June. Value-added tax has the largest
share on the total estimated improvement in collection, while
the ministry lowered its forecast for corporate income tax
receipts because of declining profitability, it said.  The export-driven Slovak economy is benefiting from a
revival of growth in the euro region, which it joined in 2009.
Better tax receipts will make it easier for Prime Minister
 Robert Fico ’s administration to meet its goal of reducing the
fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP as early as this year,
from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
