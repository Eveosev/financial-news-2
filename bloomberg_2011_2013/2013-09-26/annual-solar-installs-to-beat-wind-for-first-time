Solar power capacity installed
around the world this year will beat wind for the first time
driven by stronger policy support in key markets, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Photovoltaic plants will add about 36.7 gigawatts globally
in 2013 and wind farms 35.5 gigawatts, or almost 25 percent less
than last year, the research company said today in a statement.
Solar capacity will rise about 20 percent from 2012.  “The dramatic cost reductions in photovoltaics, combined
with new incentive regimes in Japan and  China , are making
possible further, strong growth in volumes,” said Jenny Chase,
BNEF’s head of solar analysis.  Lower panel costs and government support are accelerating
deployment of solar energy even as growth slows in the mature
European markets. Wind installations, more than double solar
before 2011, are also being slowed by Europe, as well as a lack
of clarity on policy in the U.S. and China.  Wind power installations will drop by almost a quarter this
year to their lowest level since 2008 because of the policies in
these two countries, according to Justin Wu, BNEF’s head of wind
analysis. China and the U.S. combined represented about 60
percent of the global wind market last year.  Until 2030, both maturing technologies will contribute
almost equally to the world’s new electricity capacity, the
company forecast. It sees wind accounting for 17 percent of
global power capacity in 2030 from 5 percent now and solar
expanding to 16 percent from 2 percent.  Cumulative wind capacity was almost three times solar at
the end of 2012, with 278,000 megawatts of turbines operating
compared with about 104,000 megawatts of panels, BNEF data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
