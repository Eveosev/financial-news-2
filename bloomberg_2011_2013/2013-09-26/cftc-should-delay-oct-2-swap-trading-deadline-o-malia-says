The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should delay an Oct. 2 registration deadline and give
swap-trading platforms more time to meet Dodd-Frank Act
regulations, Commissioner  Scott O’Malia  said.  Trading platforms, known as swap-execution facilities, are
rushing to meet the deadline and don’t have technology in place
to meet new data-reporting and other requirements, O’Malia said
in a speech prepared for the  Global Forum for Derivatives
Markets  in Geneva. The deadline may impact market liquidity
particularly on overseas-based platforms, he said.  “Market participants would benefit from getting a time-limited extension to allow for a smooth transition to these new
execution venues,” O’Malia said in the speech.  Dodd-Frank, the 2010 financial-regulatory overhaul, seeks
to increase competition and transparency in the $633 trillion
swap market after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the
2008 credit crisis. The agency has provisionally registered swap
execution facilities, known as Sefs, run by operators including
Tradeweb Markets LLC,  MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX) ,  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) 
and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
