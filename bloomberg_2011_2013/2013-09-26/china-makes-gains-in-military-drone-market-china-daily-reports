China  is gaining a bigger share of
the market for military drones, selling its Wing Loong unmanned
aerial vehicle to at least three nations, the state-run  China
Daily  newspaper reported today.  China has spent “considerable resources” on boosting
drone sales, and those efforts have proved effective, said Ma
Zhiping, general manager of China National Aero-Technology
Import and Export Corp., according to  the newspaper .  China is in negotiations with traditional clients as well
as new nations considering the Wing Loong, China Daily cited Ma
as saying. Ma said “more than two” clients use the Wing Loong,
and they’ve told China they are very satisfied, according to the
newspaper.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
