Scottish independence would reduce
the security of the country and the rest of Britain, according
to a panel of lawmakers looking at U.K. defense policy.  The removal of Trident nuclear missiles currently based in
 Scotland  would take several years in the event of a vote next
year in favor of independence, the House of Commons Defence
Committee in  London  said in a report published today.  First Minister  Alex Salmond ’s  Scottish National Party ,
which runs the semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh, last
year reversed its 30-year opposition to NATO membership on
condition that the weapons are removed. The U.K. deterrent is
based 30 miles from Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city.  A referendum on independence, the SNP’s flagship policy, is
being held on Sept. 18 next year.  Most Scottish-based defense contractors would be likely to
relocate their operations should voters opt for independence,
while Scotland would not be able to provide the country’s two
warship building yards with enough orders to keep them both
viable, the lawmakers said.  An independent Scotland would prioritize air and naval
defense with a focus on securing offshore oil and gas resources,
protecting fisheries and safeguarding coastal waters, Salmond
said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
