Zoltek Companies Inc. (ZOLT)  rose the most
in six months after the Nikkei newspaper reported the U.S.
producer of carbon fiber for windmill blades will be acquired by
Japanese competitor  Toray Industries Inc. (3402)   Zoltek, which is based in  St. Louis , gained 13 percent to
$18.51 at the close in New York.  Toray will pay an estimated 60 billion yen ($610 million)
to 70 billion yen for Zoltek, Nikkei said. Zoltek Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Zsolt Rumy and Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Whipple didn’t immediately respond to voicemail messages
today. No one answered calls made to Toray outside of normal
business hours.  Zoltek, founded in 1975 by Rumy, has faced pressure to make
changes since March when activist investor Quinpario Partners
LLC acquired a 10 percent stake and offered to buy the company
for a per-share price in the mid-teens. Zoltek rebuffed the bid
and in April hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. to explore “strategic
alternatives.”  Carbon fiber is a strong, lightweight material increasingly
used to build airplanes, autos, windmill blades and  golf clubs ,
among other uses. Zoltek had $43.5 million in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year on
revenue of $186.3 million, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
