Brazil ’s  unemployment  rate in
August unexpectedly fell, signaling continued recovery in the
world’s second-biggest emerging market. Swap rates rose.  The jobless rate dropped to 5.3 percent from 5.6 percent in
July, the national statistics agency said in Rio de Janeiro
today. That was the lowest since the 4.6 percent recorded in
December and equaled the record low for the month. It also was
less than  forecast  by all 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg,
whose median estimate was 5.6 percent.  Unemployment in Latin America’s largest economy has
remained near historic lows even as the economy slowed during
the first two years of President Dilma Rousseff’s
administration. The labor market has put pressure on inflation
that in April prompted the monetary authority to start raising
borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 9.31 percent at 9:17 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.2253 per  U.S. dollar .  Brazil’s inflation rate in the month through mid-September
slowed to 5.93 percent, falling below 6 percent for the first
time this year while remaining above the 4.5 percent midpoint of
the central bank’s target range. To tame inflation, the central
bank increased the benchmark  Selic (BZSTSETA)  rate by 175 basis points
since April in four monetary policy meetings.  The economy expanded 1.5 percent in the second quarter from
the prior period, marking the first time growth exceeded 1
percent since the end of 2010.  The  labor force  remained stable at 24.5 million people in
August as the number of unemployed fell to 1.3 million from 1.38
million, the statistics agency said.  Brazil’s economy  created  127,648 government-registered jobs
in August, the most since April and beating all but one estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
