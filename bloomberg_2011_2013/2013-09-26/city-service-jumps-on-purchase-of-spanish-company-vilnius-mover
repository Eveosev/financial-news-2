City Service AB, the biggest Baltic
building maintenance company, rose to a five-week high after
saying it bought a company in Spain and plans to expand further
beyond central and eastern  Europe .  The shares rose 3.8 percent in Vilnius to 1.93 euros, the
highest since Aug. 19, valuing the company at 61 million euros
($82 million). Volume of 76,703 shares was the most in five
months and almost nine times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  City Service paid 7.3 million euros for all the shares of
Madrid-based Aldesa Servicios y Mantenimiento SA and loans from
former shareholders, the company said in a regulatory  statement 
today. Based in Vilnius, the company already operates in
Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Russia and Ukraine.  “The first signs of recovery are evident in Spain and we
think it is a good time for acquisitions,”  General Director
Jonas Janukenas said in the statement. “We feel ready for
broader geographic expansion and we see perspective both in
 Spain  and other countries.”  Aldesa Servicios y Mantenimiento, operating under the
Concentra trademark, manages 4.8 million square meters of
commercial facilities throughout Spain with unaudited total
assets of 18.7 million euros at July 31 and forecasted 2013
revenue of 49 million euros, City Service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
