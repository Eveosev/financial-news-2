Italy  may designate
telecommunication networks as strategic assets after  Spain ’s
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  agreed to boost its stake in  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,
according to a draft of a decree that could be discussed at a
Cabinet meeting today.  Access networks such as Telecom Italia’s would be
considered “strategic,” giving the government a say in an
eventual change of ownership involving a foreign buyer. If
approved, the new rules would also apply to electricity and gas
grids, as well as railways, ports and airports.  Telefonica, already Telecom Italia’s biggest shareholder,
tightened its grip on the carrier this week by agreeing to a
$1.2 billion cash-and-stock transaction to gradually acquire
control of Telco SpA, the holding company that owns 22.4 percent
of the former phone monopoly.  The government could intervene in cases that represent a
“serious” threat for security, supply or continuity of
operations, according to the decree obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Maurizio Decina, a former member of Italy’s
telecommunications regulator AGCOM, said the government should
include not only access grids as strategic but also metropolitan
and long-distance networks.  Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi told Radio Anch’io in an
interview that “it’s important to make a distinction between
the network and the service management. The second one is
absolutely free on the market, while the first one must
obviously be under public control.”  The government is also studying changes to the country’s
takeover law that might lower the threshold for mandatory bids
from the current 30 percent, Finance Undersecretary Alberto Giorgetti told a Senate hearing this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
