Gold futures fell for the fourth
time in five sessions after a report showed U.S. jobless claims
dropped unexpectedly, boosting speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will scale back stimulus soon.  First-time claims declined to 305,000 in the week ended
Sept. 21, the Labor Department said. The median of 49 forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase to 325,000. The
 U.S. economy  expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter,
government data showed today. Earlier, gold rose as much as 0.3
percent as U.S. budget negotiations dragged on.  “The jobs data is decent, and worries about tapering are
back,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at TD
Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “The gold
market has become very sensitive to U.S. data.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,324.10 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price has dropped 21 percent this year.  Twenty-four of 41 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
last week said the Fed will scale back stimulus in December.
Gold surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to June
2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial
system by purchasing debt.  The precious metal has climbed 8.2 percent in the third
quarter, partly because of escalating tensions between the U.S.
and Syria and a jump in demand for jewelry and coins after the
price dropped to a 34-month low in late June.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$21.766 an ounce. The metal has dropped 28 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slipped 1.2 percent to $1,414.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$723.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
