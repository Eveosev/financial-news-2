U.K. stocks  were little changed,
with the FTSE 100 Index heading for its first weekly loss since
August, as investors awaited a report on U.S. jobless claims.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  climbed 2 percent after raising its full-year outlook for operating-profit growth.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
advanced 1.1 percent after saying it has discovered more oil in
northern  Kenya .  Centrica Plc (CNA)  slipped 1.6 percent after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. downgraded the biggest energy supplier to U.K.
homes.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  tumbled 8.2 percent after the gambling
company said that operating profit for its digital business in
2013 will fall short of the consensus analyst estimate.  The FTSE 100 Index retreated 3.6 points, or 0.1 percent, to
6,547.93 at 9:03 a.m. in London. The gauge has slipped 0.7
percent so far this week, paring its monthly gain to 2.1
percent, as euro-area manufacturing data missed economists’
estimates and as U.S. lawmakers neared a deadline to prevent a
shutdown of the federal government. The FTSE All-Share Index and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index both slipped 0.1 percent today.  The benchmark FTSE 100  has gained  5.3 percent in the
current quarter as Chinese economic reports exceeded predictions
and as the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from reducing
its monthly asset purchases at a September policy meeting. The
index has rallied 11 percent so far this year.  U.S. Economy  A Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today
will show 325,000 Americans filed for  unemployment benefits  last
week, compared with 309,000 a week earlier, according to the
 median estimate  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  At the same time, the third and final reading of a Commerce
Department report may show U.S. gross domestic product expanded
an annualized 2.6 percent in the second quarter, economists
predicted in a separate survey.  An index of  pending house sales  in the world’s biggest
economy fell 1 percent in August, according to the median
forecast in another poll. Sales dropped 1.3 percent in July. The
National Association of Realtors release the data at 10 a.m.  U.S. lawmakers have until Monday to agree to an emergency
budget to keep the federal government operating from Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year, through Dec. 15. Failure to
pass the bill may lead to a government shutdown.  In the U.K.,  gross domestic product  expanded at a 0.7
percent annual rate in the second quarter, economists predicted
before a release from the  Office for National Statistics  at 9:30
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
