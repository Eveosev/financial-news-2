Juan Cuesta, a senior partner at
Corpfin Capital, left the Spanish private-equity firm before a
planned new fund, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Cuesta, who spent 21 years with the Madrid-based firm after
joining from the forerunner of CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to help
start Corpfin, left last month to pursue new opportunities, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the departure
hasn’t been made public. Private-equity executives are typically
asked to invest their own money in the funds they manage.  The departure comes as the firm is raising its fourth pool
of capital, Corpfin Capital Fund IV FCR, with a 200 million-euro
($270 million) target. The company, which is using London-based
 Acanthus Advisers  to help raise the fund, is expected to reach
100 million euros by the end of the year, one person said.  The previous fund, which was started in 2007 and has stakes
in companies including Madrid-based pet retailer Kiwoko AS, has
already returned 70 percent of the 223 million euros raised and
is expected to generate a 30 percent cash return by the end of
its life, the people said.  In addition to his role as a dealmaker, Cuesta ran a unit
that provides startup funding to small Spanish businesses from
wealthy individuals. He sold his shares in Corpfin’s management
company to fellow partners, one person said.  Cuesta didn’t respond to e-mail requests seeking comment.
Corpfin and Acanthus officials declined to comment. News of the
fundraising was previously reported by Private Equity News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
