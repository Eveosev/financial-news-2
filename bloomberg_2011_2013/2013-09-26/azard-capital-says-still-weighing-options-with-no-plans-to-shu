Lazard Capital Markets LLC, the
closely held brokerage controlled by current and former  Lazard
Ltd. (LAZ)  employees, said it’s still exploring options such as a sale
and has no plans to close.  “It’s business as usual, serving clients,” Scott Sunshine, a spokesman for the New York-based broker-dealer, said
in a phone interview. “There is no deal announcement imminent,
and there are no plans to shut the firm down.”  Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino sent a message on
Twitter today saying the firm’s executives are looking for jobs
as “speculation swirls” that the company is close to reaching
a takeover deal or may shut down. Lazard Capital, spun out amid
Lazard Ltd.’s 2005  initial public offering , said in May it was
weighing options including selling itself or seeking a partner
to increase the value of the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
