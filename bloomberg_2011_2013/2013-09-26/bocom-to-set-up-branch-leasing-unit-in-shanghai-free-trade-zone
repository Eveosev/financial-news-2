Bank of Communications Co. , China’s
fifth-largest lender, plans to set up a branch and
transportation leasing unit in Shanghai’s free trade zone as
part of a proposal to provide financial services in the area.  The lender will upgrade existing outlets in the 29 square-kilometer (11 square-mile) zone to a high-level branch receiving
direct support from the bank, Vice President Qian Wenhui said at
a press briefing today.  The zone, set to open next week, may liberalize  interest
rates , allow freer  yuan  convertibility and relax foreign
investment restrictions as Premier  Li Keqiang  aims to shift the
economy toward services and consumption from exports. The
Shanghai-based bank, known as BoCom, is also studying plans to
offer investment products in the area, Qian said.  BoCom has submitted a 300-page plan on financial services
to regulators and expects lenders will be required to separate
existing customer accounts in the area from accounts created
after the zone is opened to prevent arbitrage and speculation,
Qian said.  The proposed leasing unit will specialize in aircraft and
ship leasing in the zone to take advantage of tax benefits and
looser regulation, he said. The bank is also considering trusts,
fund management and insurance units in the zone, according to
Qian.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
