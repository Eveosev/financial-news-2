Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , the U.K.’s
biggest construction group, won an 87 million-pound ($140
million) contract to develop commercial and retail space near
central London’s Regent Street.  The company will build two eight-story blocks with 260,000
square feet of space and a 10,000 square foot piazza between
Regent Street and Haymarket, the company said in a statement
today. Construction will begin this fall and is due for
completion in summer 2015.  “Working within the capital invariably presents its
challenges but the investment we have made in digital technology
and modular construction will come to the fore on this
project,” Balfour Beatty Chief Executive Andrew McNaughton said
in a statement.  Balfour Beatty is benefiting from a rise in orders from the
U.K. and U.S., its main markets, as a return to economic growth
fuels demand for construction. The new development is the
London-based company’s sixth commercial development under way in
the U.K. capital.  Shares in Balfour Beatty were unchanged at 284 pence at 9
a.m. in  London , giving the company a market value of 1.96
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
