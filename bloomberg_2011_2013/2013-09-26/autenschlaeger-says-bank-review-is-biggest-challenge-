Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger said assessing the quality of banks’ balance
sheets marks the biggest challenge facing European regulators in
the coming months.  The  European Central Bank  “needs a clear picture of the
actual risk faced by the banks it will be supervising,”
Lautenschlaeger said, according to the text of a speech prepared
for a conference in Frankfurt today.  The asset quality review and a stress test of lenders is
part of a plan that will see the ECB take over as the supervisor
for euro-area banks. The oversight role is the first step in
creating a regional banking union with centralized supervision
and procedures for dealing with failing banks.  There must be a “thorough and rigorous review of balance
sheets,” Lautenschlaeger said. ‘This will be the first test of
the SSM and of cooperation between the authorities involved.
Though we don’t have much time at all to accomplish this
extremely complex task, I am convinced that, if we act in
unison, we will succeed.’’  She also said she is “convinced” of the SSM’s advantages,
though she favored a different legal basis that would simplify
its “very complex governance structure.”  “It will be particularly important to strike the right
balance between ensuring fair competition by treating the same
risks equally and, at the same time, allowing for varying market
and banking structures as far as these cater for the
heterogeneous needs of the real economy,” Lautenschlaeger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
