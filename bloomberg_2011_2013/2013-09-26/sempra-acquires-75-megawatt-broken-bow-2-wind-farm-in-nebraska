Sempra Energy (SRE)  acquired a 75-megawatt wind farm in central Nebraska.  The company will buy 43 1.7-megawatt General Electric Co.
turbines for the Broken Bow 2 wind project in Custer County, the
San Diego-based company said in a statement today. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  Construction is expected to begin in December and will take
about a year. It will produce enough power for 30,000 homes.  Nebraska Public Power District agreed to purchase the
electricity under a 25-year contract.  When complete, Sempra’s U.S. Gas & Power unit will have
stakes in wind farms totaling more than 1,000 megawatts of
capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
