Canadian  stocks  rose for the third
time in four days as data showing growth in the  U.S. economy 
offset concern that a budget impasse in Washington could hurt
the recovery.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest diversified miner,
gained 2.5 percent as copper rose the most in a week.  Husky
Energy Inc. (HSE)  climbed 4.1 percent after reporting “significant
discoveries” in the Atlantic.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  added 0.7 percent after an analyst with
Guggenheim Securities LLC initiated coverage of the stock with a
buy rating. Alacer Gold Corp. dropped 6.1 percent as Credit
Suisse reduced its rating on the shares and gold prices sank.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 4.91 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,841.62 at 4 p.m. in Toronto,
trimming an earlier advance of as much as 0.5 percent. The
benchmark Canadian equity gauge has surged 5.9 percent this
quarter and is up 3.3 percent in 2013.  “The U.S. GDP and jobless claims data, those are the two
reasons” for the market’s gains, said  Ian Nakamoto , director of
research with MacDougall MacDougall and MacTier Inc. in Toronto.
The firm manages about $4 billion. “The guys in Washington will
find a compromise, the question is the impact on  consumer
confidence . My sense is the consumer will stay on.”  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized pace in
the second quarter, after expanding 1.1 percent in the first, a
sign the country was weathering federal budget cutbacks and
higher taxes. Fewer Americans applied for  unemployment  benefits
last week, with claims dropping by 5,000 to 305,000.  Budget Talks  Stocks pared an earlier rally as U.S. House Speaker  John
Boehner  said President  Barack Obama  can’t avoid negotiations on
raising the government’s debt limit, and he doesn’t expect his
chamber to pass the stopgap spending bill anticipated from the
Senate. The Senate likely will not vote on the bill until this
weekend, leaving the House one full workday to act before
spending authority for the federal government expires on Oct. 1.  Energy shares  rose 0.4 percent as a group, as six out of 10
industries in the S&P/TSX advanced. Trading volume was 18
percent lower than the 30-day average.  Husky Energy climbed 4.1 percent to C$30.26 after the
Calgary-based company said it discovered oil in the Flemish Pass
Basin off the Atlantic coast of  Canada .  Legacy Oil & Gas Inc. rose 1.8 percent to C$6.71 and
Imperial Oil Ltd. gained 1.5 percent to C$45.54 as crude prices
advanced for the first time in six days.  Teck Resources rose 2.5 percent to C$29.29 as copper jumped
1.1 percent, the most in a week.  Valeant Gains  Valeant, the biggest drugmaker in Canada, increased 0.7
percent to C$106.41. Louise Chen, analyst with Guggenheim,
initiated  coverage  of Valeant with a buy rating.  Raw-materials companies had the biggest decline among the
10 main industries in the S&P TSX, dropping 1 percent as gold
for December delivery sank 0.9 percent. Of 24 companies in the
S&P/TSX Gold Index, 23 fell.  Semafo Inc. tumbled 6.9 percent to C$2.42.  Alacer Gold (ASR)  sank
6.1 percent to C$3.21 after Credit Suisse cut the stock’s rating
to underperform from outperform.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  lost 0.6 percent to C$8.22, the lowest
close since November, for a third day of declines since agreeing
to sell itself on Sept. 23 to a group led by Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. in a tentative deal worth $9 a share or $4.7
billion. The agreement is subject to securing financing and due
diligence.  The smartphone maker has slumped 24 percent in the past
five days and is scheduled to officially report second-quarter
 earnings  tomorrow. The company on Sept. 20 disclosed worse-than-estimated earnings and smartphone sales and plans to fire 4,500
workers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
