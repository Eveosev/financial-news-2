The market for short-term IOUs by
nonfinancial companies climbed to the highest mark in 12 years.  The seasonally adjusted amount of commercial paper issued
by the  firms  climbed $13 billion to $242.5 billion outstanding
in the week ended yesterday, the highest level since June 2001,
the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.  The central bank’s unprecedented economic stimulus measures
pushed borrowing costs to record lows for debt issuers in May,
spurring record offerings of dollar-denominated company bonds
that have reached an all-time monthly high in September.  “Short-term debt markets are functioning as normally as
can be expected given the ongoing distortions of monetary
policy,”  Howard Simons , strategist at Bianco Research LLC in
Chicago, wrote in an e-mail.  Nonfinancial commercial paper climbed to $223.8 billion in
January 2009, a more than seven-year high, before plunging to
$101.2 billion that December, according to Fed data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Total  U.S. commercial paper  climbed $17.2 billion to $1.064
trillion outstanding in the period ended yesterday, the third
straight increase, according to the Fed. That’s the highest
level since the market touched $1.085 trillion for the period
ended Feb. 13.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
