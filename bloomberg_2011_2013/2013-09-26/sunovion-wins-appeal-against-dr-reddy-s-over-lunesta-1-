(Corrects spelling of Sunovion in headline.)  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co.’s
Sunovion won an appeals court ruling today that Dr. Reddy’s
Laboratories Ltd.’s generic version of Lunesta would infringe a
patent that expires next year.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in
 Washington  said the trial judge erred in ruling the Dr. Reddy’s
version didn’t infringe the patent. The  opinion  was posted on
the court’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
