Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, delayed the opening of an iron-producing facility under construction in Louisiana until the end
of the year after a storage dome collapsed.  The plant, which will be the worldâ€™s largest producer of
direct-reduced iron, was scheduled to begin production within a
few weeks, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company said in a
statement today. There were no injuries and no environmental
impacts, the company said. The dome was one of three on the
site.  Direct-reduced iron uses natural gas to process iron ore so
that it can be used in electric furnaces such as those Nucor
uses to produce the metal. The $750 million plant in St. James
Parish,  Louisiana , is expected to produce 2.5 million tons of
DRI a year, Nucor said.  Katherine Miller, a spokeswoman for Nucor, declined to
comment on the cause of the collapse.  Nucor slipped 41 cents to $49.08 at 11:33 a.m. in New York.
The shares have risen 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
