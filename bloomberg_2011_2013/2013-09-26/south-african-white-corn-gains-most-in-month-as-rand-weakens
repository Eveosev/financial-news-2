South African white-corn futures
rose the most in a month before a government report that may
show no change in production estimates and as the rand weakened
against the dollar, making imports more expensive.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 1.4 percent, the most since Aug. 26, to 2,344
rand ($234) a metric ton, by the midday close in Johannesburg.
The yellow variety for delivery in the same month, increased 0.8
percent to 2,156 rand a ton.  The nation will probably reap the same amount of the grain
this season as the 11.5 million tons predicted in the previous
month, a median estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey
shows.  “We are expecting the final crop estimate today, some
parts of the country look OK, while other parts, like the North
West province, don’t, so we will see,” Jacques Pretorius, a
trader at Suidwes Landbou (Pty) Ltd. in North West said by
phone. “The weaker rand also contributed” to the rise.  The rand retreated 0.3 percent to 10.0155 rand a dollar by
12:14 p.m. in Johannesburg. A weaker rand makes it more
expensive to import the grain into the country.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest corn producer. A
meal made from the white variety is one of the nation’s staple
foods and yellow corn is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.9 percent to 3,397,
the most since Sept. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
