The  New York Rangers  re-signed
free-agent forward Derek Stepan, their leading scorer last
season.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed in a statement from the
National Hockey League team. The package is worth $6.15 million
over two years, ESPN reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Stepan, a 23-year-old center, had 18 goals and 26 assists
for 44 points, along with 12 penalty minutes, in 48 games last
season. He also led the team and tied for second in the NHL with
six game-winning goals.  Rick Nash led the Rangers in goals scored with 21.  The Rangers begin the season on Oct. 3 in Phoenix, the
opener of a nine-game road trip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
