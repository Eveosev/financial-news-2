Palm oil declined to the lowest
level in more than six weeks as a fall in crude prices reduced
the appeal of vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock and the pace
of exports slowed from  Malaysia , the second-biggest producer.  The contract for December delivery lost 1.1 percent to
2,269 ringgit ($706) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest close for futures since Aug. 12. Prices
fell 5.6 percent this month after advancing the most in almost
three years in August. Palm for physical delivery in October was
at 2,310 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Texas Intermediate for November delivery traded near
the lowest level in 12 weeks after data showed an unexpected
increase in U.S. reserves. Palm oil is the biggest feedstock for
biodiesel after soybean oil and 6.34 million tons will probably
be processed into fuel this year, 11 percent more than in 2012,
according to Oil World, a research company based in Hamburg.  “Crude oil prices have been declining and taking away the
incentive for using palm oil in production of biodiesel,” said
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based broker
Sunvin Group. “Another reason for the weakness in palm oil is
that the export numbers have come down.”  Shipments from Malaysia rose 6.5 percent to 1.24 million
tons in the first 25 days of September from the same period a
month earlier, surveyor Intertek said yesterday. That’s slower
than the 13 percent growth in the first 20 days of the month.  Soybeans for delivery in November slid 0.6 percent to
$13.1325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
December delivery declined 0.4 percent to 41.92 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery rose 0.1 percent to
close at 5,404  yuan  ($883) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil decreased 0.3 percent to end at 7,042 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
