The Ibovespa fell for a third
session as  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  sank after Valor
Economico reported that it missed a local bond payment.  OGX, the  oil company  controlled by former billionaire  Eike
Batista , contributed the most to the index’s decline. The drop
in the  stock index  was limited as retailers including  Cia.
Hering (HGTX3)  rose after a report showed Brazil’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped in August.  The Ibovespa slid 0.2 percent to 54,176.42  at 11:03 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. Fifty stocks advanced on the gauge while 20 fell.
The real climbed 0.3 percent to 2.2241 per dollar.  “OGX has been facing a lot of problems, and every time a
new one comes up in the news, shares fall,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, the head strategist at Futura Corretora brokerage, said
in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  OGX, the fourth-heaviest-weighted stock on  Brazil ’s
benchmark stock measure, fell 8.1 percent to 34 centavos. The
company missed a payment on a local bond yesterday and may miss
payment on a dollar bond next week, Valor Economico reported,
without saying where it got the information. An OGX press
official declined to comment.  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in August,
matching the lowest level for the month, the national statistics
agency reported today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
projected it to hold at 5.6 percent.  Hering added 2.2 percent to 34.89 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
