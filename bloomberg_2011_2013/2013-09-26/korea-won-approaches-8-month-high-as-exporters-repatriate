South  Korea ’s won strengthened to
near an eight-month high on speculation exporters are
repatriating dollars to meet month-end cash needs.  Government
bonds  declined.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. got a 572.8
billion won ($534 million) order to build a large jack-up rig
for Denmark’s Maersk Drilling, the company said in a regulatory
filing yesterday. The won appreciated 6.2 percent this quarter,
Asia’s best performance, as global funds added almost $9.4
billion to their holdings of equities in the period, exchange
data show.  “There are dollar supplies from shipbuilders and other
exporters as the end of month draws near,” said Park Jung Hyun,
a Seoul-based currency dealer at Hana Bank. “The won’s rising
trend remains in place, though the government may smooth out any
sharp gains.”  The won advanced 0.2 percent to 1,075.19 per dollar in
 Seoul , after yesterday’s 0.5 percent drop, which was the biggest
decline in a month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,072.31 on Sept. 24, the strongest level since Jan. 25.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.20 percent.  Credit Suisse Group AG raised its three-month forecast for
the won to 1,060 from 1,075, citing South Korea’s current-account surplus and capital inflows. “The  Bank of Korea  is
likely to continue intervening to manage the pace of won
appreciation, but we expect it to be overwhelmed by the
magnitude of inflows,” strategists including Singapore-based
Ray Farris wrote in a report yesterday.  ‘Proactive’ Steps  Policy makers must take “proactive” steps to deal with
financial instability, while continuing to push through
structural reforms, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said
at a conference in Seoul today. Asian emerging-market economies
face risks, including volatile capital flows and slowing growth,
and the  Federal Reserve ’s decision to delay its stimulus may
provide short-term “relief,” Kim said.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent note due September
2018 rose five basis points to 3.09 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The yield on the 2.75 percent bond due June 2016
rose two basis points to 2.85 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
