India plans to build a 4-gigawatt
solar farm, more than doubling its total capacity to date.  State-run companies including  Bharat Heavy Electricals
Ltd. (BHEL) ,  Power Grid Corp. (PWGR)  of India Ltd.,  SJVN Ltd. (SJVN)  and the Solar
Energy Corp. of India will form a joint venture to complete the
first gigawatt by the end of 2016, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Department of Heavy Industry.  The farm will be built near Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan state
to supply power to government distribution companies through the
national grid, the department said.  India had 1.8 gigawatts of solar capacity as of July 31,
according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The
biggest photovoltaic project is a 150-megawatt plant in
Maharashtra state, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
