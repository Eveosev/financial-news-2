Swiss stocks declined, dragging the
benchmark Swiss Market Index lower for the third time in four
days, as investors awaited reports on U.S. jobless-benefit 
claims and home sales.  The  SMI (SMI)  fell 0.4 percent to 8,022.03 at 9:25 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark has still climbed 3.6 percent this
month, extending its gain this quarter to 4.4 percent, as the
 Federal Reserve  refrained from reducing its monthly bond
purchases. The gauge has rallied 18 percent so far in 2013, the
third-best performance by a European developed market. The Swiss
Performance Index also slipped 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
today was 18 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A U.S. Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington 
will show initial claims for  unemployment benefits  rose to
325,000 last week from 309,000 the previous period, according to
the median estimate of 49 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Separate data from the National Association of Realtors may
show its index of pending home sales in the worldâ€™s largest
economy fell 1 percent last month from July, when it slid 1.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
