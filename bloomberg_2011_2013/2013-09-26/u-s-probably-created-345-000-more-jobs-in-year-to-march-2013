The Labor Department’s preliminary
estimate of employment in the year ended March 2013 was revised
up by 345,000 workers, reflecting the addition of employees who
weren’t previously counted in the monthly payrolls report.  Current estimates show 2.03 million jobs were added in the
12-month period. A reclassification of workers into another
category of establishments inflated the estimate by 469,000, the
Labor Department’s preliminary projections showed today on its
website.  The department’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
program reviewed businesses that provide non-medical, home-based
services for the elderly, an industry that wasn’t reflected in
Labor’s monthly payrolls calculations. It reclassified those
workers into a category that provide services for older
Americans, which the Labor Department includes in its payrolls
measure.  The result moved almost half a million workers into the
education and health-care services industry. Without this
adjustment, the number of employees added to payrolls would have
declined by 124,000.  The downward revision is probably the more accurate figure
because the level of payrolls in March 2012 has not yet been
calculated to incorporate the change, Kirk Mueller, national
benchmark branch chief for the Labor Department, said in an
interview.  The final annual benchmark revisions to payrolls will be
issued with the January employment data to be released in
February 2014. The Labor Department uses records from state
jobless benefit tax records to benchmark its employment data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
