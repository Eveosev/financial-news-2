The  New York Yankees  were
eliminated last night from postseason contention, marking the
second time manager  Joe Girardi ’s club missed the playoffs in
his five years in charge.  The Yankees, who have a record 27  World Series 
championships, lost 8-3 to the Tampa Bay Rays. They already had
been eliminated earlier in the evening when the Cleveland
Indians won 7-2 against the  Chicago White Sox .  With four games remaining in the regular season, New York
(82-76) cannot catch the Rays (89-69) or the Indians (88-70) for
the two American League wild-card spots. The Yankees made the
playoffs for 14 straight years before 2008, when the team failed
in Girardi’s first season in charge.  Evan Longoria hit two home runs and drove in four runs for
the Rays.  David Price  (9-8) allowed two runs in seven innings
for the win, while  Phil Hughes  (4-14) lasted two innings for the
Yankees.  Tampa Bay holds the first of the wild-card spots that are
given to the two teams in each league with the best non-division-winning records. Cleveland now holds the second spot,
with the Texas Rangers (87-71) a game back after a 7-3 win at
home against the Houston Astros.  The Rays and Indians both are on six-game winning streaks,
best in the major leagues. The Astros have lost 12 straight and
are an MLB-worst 51-108 this season.  Max Scherzer improved to 21-3 by allowing two hits and
striking out 10 in seven scoreless innings as the  Detroit Tigers 
clinched their third straight AL Central division title with a
1-0 win at the Minnesota Twins.  National League  In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals completed a
three-game series sweep of the Washington Nationals with a 4-1
victory yesterday and moved to the brink of capturing the
Central division title when the Pittsburgh Pirates and
Cincinnati Reds lost.  The Pirates lost 4-2 at the Chicago Cubs and the Reds lost
1-0 at home to the New York Mets, who got 7 2/3 scoreless
innings from starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka.  St. Louis (94-65) needs one more win or one more loss by
the Pirates (91-68) to clinch the division title. The Reds (90-69), who no longer can win the division crown, will get one of
the NL’s two wild cards, with St. Louis or Pittsburgh taking the
other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
