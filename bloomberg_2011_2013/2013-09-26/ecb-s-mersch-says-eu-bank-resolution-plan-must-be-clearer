European Central Bank Executive
Board member Yves Mersch said a European Union plan for a single
resolution fund under the region’s planned bank union is unclear
and needs a credible backstop.  The European Commission’s proposal for the single
resolution mechanism “foresees such a fund, financed by levies
on private banks,” Mersch said today in  Frankfurt . “I welcome
this proposal in principle. But I think that, during the build-up phase, clarification is needed on what will happen if there
are exceptional circumstances which lead to the fund’s resources
being exhausted.”  The ECB is preparing to take over supervision of euro-area
lenders next year and plans to begin with a risk review by the
beginning of 2014 before analyzing balance sheets and conducting
a  stress test . Mersch said last month that the ECB won’t start
reviewing banks unless a credible plan on how to handle failing
lenders is in place.  The EU proposal on the single resolution fund “is unclear
here,” Mersch said today. “In my view a credible backstop is
essential to ensure that resolution costs can be separated from
national budgets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
