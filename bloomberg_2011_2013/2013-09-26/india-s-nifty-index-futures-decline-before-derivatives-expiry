Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped
before the expiry of derivatives contracts today.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery fell 0.4
percent to 5,913 at 10:04 a.m. in Singapore. The September
contract dropped 0.3 percent. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index
lost 0.3 percent to 5,873.85 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex
decreased 0.3 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares also declined 0.3 percent.  The Sensex’s  30-day volatility , a measure of price swings,
held at the highest level since August 2009 yesterday. The index
has veered between a one-year low and a 34-month high in the
past four weeks. The gauge tumbled as the rupee weakened to a
record low last month and rallied after central bank Governor
Raghuram Rajan outlined plans to bolster the financial industry
and stabilize the currency, and the  Federal Reserve  refrained
from cutting stimulus.  “Markets are expected to remain cautious ahead of the
derivatives expiry,” Amar Ambani, head of research at India
Infoline Ltd., wrote in an e-mail yesterday. “The indexes may
move in a tight range with no major cues to look forward to.”  Overseas funds  bought a net $5 million of domestic shares
on Sept. 24, data from the regulator showed yesterday.
International investors have bought a net $1.97 billion of the
nation’s stocks this month, poised for the first monthly net
inflow since May. They pulled out $3.7 billion in the three
months to Aug. 31 as capital fled  emerging markets  amid concerns
the U.S. Federal Reserve would curtail record stimulus.  Shares of  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest software
services company, may be active after the stock was raised to
outperform from neutral at Robert Baird, with a 12-month price
target of $58 for the company’s American Depositary Receipts.
The shares gained 0.5 percent to $48.87 yesterday.  The Sensex has risen 2.2 percent this year in rupee terms
and is  valued  at 13.7 times projected 12-month earnings,
compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It has lost 10 percent this year in dollar
terms. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is trading at 10.6 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
