Eni SpA (ENI)  sold Russian Urals blend at
the lowest price in five months in northwest Europe after
loading programs showed October exports from two  Baltic Sea 
ports will jump to a one-year high.  No bids or offers were made for  North Sea  Forties crude. A
third cargo of the grade has been booked to  South Korea  after a
four-month lull, as prices dropped.  North Sea  Brent for November settlement traded at $109.02 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.57 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $108.07, a discount of 95 cents to November.  South Korean refiners Hyundai Oilbank Co., GS Caltex Corp.
and SK Innovation Co. each bought a supertanker of Forties crude
for October and November loading, according to nine people who
participate in the market, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. The cargoes will be the first
U.K. exports to the Asian nation since the Maersk Sandra set
sail on June 7.  SK Energy, the refining branch of SK Innovation, issued a
rare tender to swap a supertanker of Iraqi Basrah Light blend
for the same amount of Forties loading in end-October, which was
won by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, according to six people who
participate in the market. A Shell official in  London  declined
to comment on the matter, as did Jung Min Yoo, a Seoul-based
spokesman for SK Innovation.  Statoil ASA will delay the startups of Njord and Hyme
fields until the second quarter of 2014 because of “additional
time to plan and undertake remedial works,” Faroe Petroleum
Plc, which holds stakes in the two projects, said in a statement
today.  Urals/Mediterranean  Eni sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Oct. 6 to Oct. 10
loading to Vitol Group at $2 a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. This
is the lowest since April 9, and compares with a discount of
$1.40 for the last trade on Sept. 24.  Vitol sold another cargo for the same period in northwest
 Europe  to Total SA at a discount of $1.90 a barrel to Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  Combined Urals exports from Primorsk and Ust-Luga in
October will total 7.591 million tons, or 1.79 million barrels a
day, the most since October 2012, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Loadings from Ust-Luga will be a record 2.5 million tons,
compared with a revised 2.197 million tons for September. Two
crude slots of 100,000 tons each are not yet allocated. The
September exports were revised down from 2.297 million tons
after one cargo was added and two free positions weren’t filled.  Urals shipments from Primorsk will be 51 cargoes totaling
5.091 million tons, according to the schedule. This is the most
since April, and compares with 4.49 million tons this month.  Exports of Urals from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be
2.91 million tons, down from 2.945 million tons for September,
according to the plan. This includes 11 consignments of 135,000
to 145,000 tons each and 17 lots of 80,000 to 85,000 tons each,
the plan showed. Two shipments of 80,000 tons of Siberian Light
will also be exported from this port next month.  The final loading program for October is unchanged from the
preliminary plan released earlier today.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold via a tender two Urals cargoes of
100,000 tons each for loading from the Baltic Sea, according to
four people who participate in the market. One lot for loading
Oct. 7 to Oct. 8 from Ust-Luga was sold to Talmay Trading and
the other for Oct. 8 to Oct. 9 from Primorsk was bought by Royal
Dutch Shell Plc.  West Africa  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will export
53 crude cargoes in November, one less than in October,
according to a final loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Shipments will total 50.88 million barrels, or 1.7 million
barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with a revised
51.76 million, or 1.67 million barrels a day, next month. Most
consignments are of 950,000 to 1 million barrels.  The number of shipments in the final program is three less
than the 56 cargoes, or 1.74 million barrels a day, listed in
the preliminary schedule released on Sept. 17. Export plans for
Cabinda, Gimboa, Hungo, Mondo, Nemba and Saturno were revised.  To contact the reporters on this story:
