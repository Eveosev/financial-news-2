Sierra Leone Brewery Ltd. opened a
2.4 billion leones ($561,000) water treatment plant in Freetown,
the capital of the West African country.  The facility processes about 50 cubic meters of water per
hour, Allieu Kafoe, technical project manager for the brewer
said by phone today.  Heineken NV (HEIA)  has a majority stake in the
brewer, according to its website.  About 40 percent of people in rural Sierra Leone and 84
percent of those in urban areas have access to piped water,
public taps or other forms of improved water sources, according
to World Bank data for 2011.  The African Development Bank is providing loans and grants
to  fund  a $61 million water supply project in the country, where
a cholera outbreak last year killed more than 250 people and
sickened more than 18,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
