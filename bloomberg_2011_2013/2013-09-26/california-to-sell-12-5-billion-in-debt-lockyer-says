California  plans to sell $12.5
billion in debt in the next 18 months after the most-populous
state’s economic recovery helped reduce its relative borrowing
costs to the  lowest  level in five years, Treasurer Bill Lockyer
said.  The sales will include $5 billion to $6 billion in general-obligation bonds through early next year, another $5 billion of
such debt after July 1, and $2 billion in lease-revenue
securities, Lockyer said yesterday at a Bond Buyer conference in
 Los Angeles .  “Whenever we go to market, the demand exceeds the
supply,” Lockyer said in an interview. Individual investors
continue to be substantial buyers, he said.  Lockyer said he has sold about $50 billion in debt since
taking office in 2007 and the planned borrowing is in keeping
with the average pace.  Fitch Ratings  and  Standard & Poor’s  raised California’s
credit rating in the past year, citing an economic recovery that
has lifted the state’s housing industry. Both companies grade
the state A, their sixth-highest level.  California sold $7.6 billion of long-term general-obligation bonds in the fiscal year that ended June 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The state has borrowed
$764 million with such securities in fiscal 2014, which began
July 1.  The state has bond sales scheduled for October and
November, though Lockyer hasn’t said how much he would offer.  Buoyed by voter approval last year for increases in sales
taxes and higher levies on incomes of $250,000 or more,
Democratic Governor  Jerry Brown , 75, forecast an $817 million
surplus this year. It would be the first time revenue exceeded
expenditures in almost a decade, after the world’s ninth-biggest
economy ran up more than $100 billion of deficits since 2007.  As of Sept. 1, California had $79.4 billion in long-term
bonds, out of $147.8 billion authorized by voters, according to
 Lockyer’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
