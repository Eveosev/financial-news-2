India ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
a third day after the central bank said it will take steps as
required to ensure adequate cash supply in the financial system.  The  Reserve Bank  of India is injecting about 1.5 trillion
rupees ($24 billion) into markets every day via money-market
operations and export-credit refinance, it said in a statement
yesterday. The RBI’s pledge to support funding availability
follows Governor  Raghuram Rajan ’s unexpected decision on Sept.
20 to raise the benchmark  repurchase rate , which caused 10-year
yields to surge 66 basis points in two days.  “This should be a near-term respite for Indian  government
bonds , while monetary policy bias and forex volatility continue
to be sources of concern,” Barclays Plc analysts including
Mumbai-based Siddhartha Sanyal wrote in a report dated
yesterday. “After the surprise repo rate hike last week, the
likelihood of RBI support to liquidity is meaningful.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent sovereign notes due May 2023
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.72
percent as of 10:26 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the
central bank’s trading system. The rate climbed to 8.85 percent
on Sept. 23, the highest since Aug. 28.  Rajan raised the repo rate to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent
in the first increase since 2011. “We want to fight against
inflation and we’ll bring inflation down,” he said Sept. 20 in
his first policy review since taking over as the RBI’s governor
on Sept. 4. India’s  wholesale prices  rose 6.1 percent in August
from a year earlier, the most in six months.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , a derivative contract used to
guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell six basis
points to 8.76 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
