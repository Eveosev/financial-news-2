Japan ’s market for solar panels
used in industrial-sized projects is expected to contract
quickly after fiscal 2014 due to a lack of space and fewer
incentives, Yano Research Institute said.  By fiscal 2020, demand for utility-scale and commercial
solar systems will contract to 200.7 billion yen ($2.03 billion)
after reaching 2.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2014, the Tokyo-based
researcher forecast in a Sept. 24  statement . Japan’s fiscal year
starts on April 1.  Lower incentives for solar power producers and a lack of
land may lead to the rapid drop in the non-residential market,
the researcher wrote.  Japan introduced an incentive program for clean energy in
July 2012 to diversify its energy mix, leading to a surge in
solar installations across the country.  “Many Japanese solar panel makers see the expansion of the
market for solar power generation systems after fiscal 2012 as
temporary after the introduction” of the incentive program,
according to the statement from Yano.  Given the outlook, Japanese manufacturers are reluctant to
expand production capacity and are instead turning to foreign
makers for panels that can be sold under their own brands,
according to Yano.  Residential accounted for about 80 percent of Japan’s solar
market until fiscal 2011, according to the researcher. Non-residential solar increased to nearly half of the market in
fiscal 2012, it said.  New homes will be an area of growth, according to Yano.  To contact the reporter on this story:
