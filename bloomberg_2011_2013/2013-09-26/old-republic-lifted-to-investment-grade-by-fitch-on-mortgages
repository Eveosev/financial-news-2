Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) ,
the seller of business insurance and mortgage guarantees, was
lifted to investment grade by Fitch Ratings on reduced risk tied
to home loans.  The insurer was upgraded to BBB- from BB+ as the wind-down
of the mortgage insurance unit “reduces the likelihood that its
financial difficulties would trigger debt covenants that
result in debt acceleration,” the ratings firm said today in a
statement on Chicago-based Old Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
