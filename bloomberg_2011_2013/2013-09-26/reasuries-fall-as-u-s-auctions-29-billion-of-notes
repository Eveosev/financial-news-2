Treasuries declined for the first
time in five days as the U.S. sold $29 billion in seven-year
debt to weaker-than-average demand even as the deadlock in
 Washington  over the  federal budget  risked a government shutdown.  The auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount offered, was 2.46, versus
an average of 2.63 for the past 10 sales of the notes. The yield
on the 10-year benchmark note climbed from almost a six-week low
after a report showed U.S. jobless-benefit claims unexpectedly
fell. Yields had fallen since the  Federal Reserve  decided last
week not to slow its bond-buying program.  “It was a lackluster auction,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We’ve seen gains for the last four consecutive
sessions. The combination of the claims data and the supply
proved to be a small negative for the Treasury market. Thursday
is a bit of a give-back on the recent gains.”  The  yield  on the current seven-year note increased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.03 percent at 5
p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
price of the 2.125 percent security due in August 2020 declined
1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 5/8.  Ten-year note  yields advanced two basis points to 2.65
percent after falling yesterday to 2.61 percent, the lowest
level since Aug. 12. They reached a two-year high of 3.01
percent on Sept. 6.  The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond  Index (BUSY)  has risen 0.9
percent this month. It is little changed this quarter and down
2.4 percent for 2013. The Bloomberg  Global Developed Sovereign
Bond Index (BGSV)  has gained 1.6 percent this month and has dropped 3.6
percent in 2013.  Volatility Rises  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index rose 3 percent to 77.6, above the 2013
average of 71.89. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest
level in two months.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 2 percent to $328
billion, from $321.7 billion yesterday. The average this year is
$316 billion  A slide below zero in rates on some Treasury bills that
mature beyond October showed little investor angst that U.S.
lawmakers may fail to agree on a federal-debt limit.  Congress hasn’t passed a budget for the 2014 fiscal year,
which starts Oct. 1. The House and Senate are at odds over using
the measure to stop funding the nation’s three-year-old health-care law, President  Barack Obama ’s signature legislative
achievement, and the lack of an agreement could lead to a
government shutdown.  Debt Ceiling  Separately, Congress must vote to raise the nation’s
borrowing limit. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew told
lawmakers yesterday in a letter that measures to avoid breaching
the debt ceiling will be exhausted on Oct. 17.  Rates on  three-month  Treasury bills fell below zero today
for the first time since December, reaching negative 0.0051
percent before ending the day at zero. They closed yesterday at
0.0152 percent.  Treasury bills that mature Oct. 24 were at a rate of 0.030
percent, up from 0.018 percent yesterday. Two years ago, one-month bills jumped to 0.18 percent on July 29, 2011, the highest
since February 2009, as Congress pushed to the Aug. 2, 2011,
deadline set by Treasury to avoid a default.  “People are selling one-month bills to buy three-month
bills to get out of the window of likely delayed payments due to
a mishap on the debt ceiling,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in  New York  at primary dealer Credit Suisse
Group AG.  Note Auction  The seven-year notes auctioned today  yielded  2.058 percent,
compared with a forecast of 2.059 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. Last month’s
offering of the securities drew a yield of 2.221 percent, the
highest level since July 2011.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the notes today, compared
with an average of 40.2 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 17.8 percent,
versus an average of 19.5 percent at the past 10 sales.  Seven-year notes have lost 3.2 percent this year, compared
with a return of 3.9 percent in 2012, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Investors bid $2.87 for each dollar of the $1.618 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Third Sale  Today’s offering was the last of three note auctions this
week totaling $97 billion. The government sold $33 billion in
two-year debt on Sept. 24 and $35 billion in five-year
securities yesterday.  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities auction, will raise
$47.7 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $62.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  Treasuries fell earlier as a Labor Department report showed
initial claims for  jobless  benefits in the U.S. unexpectedly
decreased by 5,000 to 305,000 in the week ended Sept. 21. An
official at the agency said there were no special factors and
 California  has caught up with a recent backlog of new
applications stemming from a computer system changeover.  The median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an increase to 325,000.  Any Tools  Minneapolis Fed President  Narayana Kocherlakota , a voter on
policy next year, said the central bank must do “whatever it
takes” to strengthen a job market that is healing too slowly.  The Fed should be “willing to use any of its
congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher
employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be,”
Kocherlakota said today in a speech in Houghton,  Michigan .  The central bank refrained from tapering its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases after a Sept. 17-18 policy meeting,
saying it needs more evidence of lasting improvement in the
economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
