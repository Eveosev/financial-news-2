Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) 
and  Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd. (6501)  are among companies charged
by the U.S. with conspiring to rig bids for car parts.  The companies were named in documents filed today in
federal court in  Detroit . Theyâ€™re charged with conspiracy to
restrain trade for fixing prices of automotive parts sold to
carmakers including  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  General Motors Co. (GM) , Chrysler
Group LLC,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co.  The U.S. Justice Department, which has been investigating
price-fixing, bid-rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in
the auto parts industry, said on Sept. 24 that more than
$874 million in criminal fines had been imposed and that 11
companies and 19 executives had been charged in the probe.  Competition authorities around the world have been
investigating suppliers, and more than 100 products and more
than 70 companies are involved in the probe, EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a speech yesterday in
 Washington .  Other companies charged today include  Mitsuba Corp. (7280)  and
Valeo  Japan . The Justice Department said earlier that it will
hold a news conference today in Washington related to an
antitrust enforcement action  To contact the reporters on this story:
