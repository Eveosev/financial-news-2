Russia plans to increase its Urals
crude shipments from Ust-Luga to a record in October, raising
total exports from two Baltic Sea ports to a one-year high, a
final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Combined exports from Primorsk and Ust-Luga will total
7.591 million metric tons, or 1.79 million barrels a day, the
most since October 2012, according to the plan.  Loadings from Ust-Luga will be 2.5 million tons, compared
with a revised 2.197 million tons for September. Two crude slots
of 100,000 tons each are not allocated.  Ust-Luga exports for September were revised down from 2.297
million tons after one cargo was added and two free positions
werenâ€™t filled.  Urals shipments from Primorsk will be 51 cargoes totaling
5.091 million tons, according to the schedule. This is the most
since April, and compares with 4.49 million tons this month.  Exports of Urals from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will be
2.91 million tons, down from 2.945 million tons for September,
according to the plan. This includes 11 consignments of 135,000
to 145,000 tons each and 17 lots of 80,000 to 85,000 tons each,
the plan showed. Two shipments of 80,000 tons of Siberian Light
will also be exported from this port next month.  The final loading program for October is unchanged from the
preliminary plan released earlier today.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
