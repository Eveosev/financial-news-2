German President Joachim Gauck
praised the late Berthold Beitz as a “man of the century” at a
commemoration in Essen today.  Beitz, a banker and industrialist who rescued Jews from the
Nazis during World War II, “has made our country better,”
Gauck said in a speech attended by Bundestag President Norbert
Lammert and Deputy Chancellor Philipp Roesler.  The 99-year-old, who would have celebrated his 100th
birthday today, died on July 30. In 1942 he hid Jews in his home
in  Poland  and saved hundreds of men and women from a train
destined for the Belzec death camp by claiming them as workers.  Beitz later helped rebuild Fried Krupp GmbH, a predecessor
to  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s biggest steelmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
