Treasury 10-year note yields
increased from almost a six-week low as reports showed claims
for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly declined last
week, showing progress in the labor market.  Treasuries fell for the first time in five days as
investors prepared to bid for $29 billion of seven-year notes
today.  Ten-year yields  have dropped since the  Federal Reserve 
last week maintained its policy of buying $85 billion of debt a
month to put pressure on borrowing costs. President  Barack Obama 
and congressional Republicans were deadlocked over the budget in
a confrontation that risks a government shutdown.  “The claims number looks good,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief
U.S. economist in New York at Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC Capital
Markets , one of the 21 primary dealers that trade directly with
the central bank. “It’s hard to apply any negative spin to this
number.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.64 percent at 11:35 a.m. New York
time, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. The yield, which
reached a two-year high of 3.01 percent on Sept. 6, touched 2.61
percent yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 12, amid bets
U.S. budget talks won’t avert a government shutdown. The price
of the 2.5 percent security due in August 2023 fell 3/32, or 94
cents per $1,000 face amount, to 98 25/32.  The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond  Index (BUSY)  has risen 0.9
percent this month. It is little changed this quarter and down
2.4 percent for 2013.  Higher Volatility  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index rose yesterday for the first time in 11
days, increasing 0.6 percent to 75.3, above the 2013 average of
71.86. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.19, a two-month high.  “We ran a long way from where we were before the non-tapering Fed,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New
York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “We’re stuck in the
 Washington  watch, and it’s going to be with us for a couple of
weeks. The market probably stretched a little too far with
supply still on us.”  Jobless (INJCJC)  claims decreased by 5,000 to 305,000 in the week
ended Sept. 21, a Labor Department report showed today in
Washington. An official at the agency said there were no special
factors and  California  has caught up with a recent backlog of
new applications stemming from a computer system changeover. The
median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for an increase to 325,000.  Congress hasn’t passed a budget for the 2014 fiscal year,
which starts Oct. 1. The House and Senate are at odds over using
the measure to stop funding the health-care law, and the lack of
an agreement could lead to a government shutdown on Oct. 1.  Bill Rates  Rates on Treasury bills maturing close to the deadline for
raising the borrowing ceiling increased. Rates on bills due Oct.
24 rose to 0.04 percent, the most on a closing basis since Aug.
19. The rate on bills due Oct. 31 has held within four basis
points of zero during the period.  That’s different than two years ago, when one-month bills
jumped to 0.18 percent on July 29, 2011, the highest since
February 2009, as Congress pushed to the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline
set by Treasury to avoid a default.  The rate on three-month Treasury bills dropped today to as
low as negative 0.005 percent, the first time below zero since
December 2012, before trading at zero.  “People are selling one-month bills to buy three-month
bills to get out of the window of likely delayed payments due to
a mishap on the debt ceiling,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate
strategist in  New York  at primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG.  Note Auction  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 2.045 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.221 percent at the
previous auction on Aug. 29, the highest level since July 2011.
Investors bid for 2.43 times the amount offered last month,
versus 2.54 at the July auction.  A five-year note sale yesterday drew 2.67 times the total
available, the highest bid-to-cover ratio since May. The U.S.
sold $33 billion of two-year debt at a yield of 0.348 percent,
below a forecast of 0.354 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities auction, will raise
$47.7 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $62.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.589 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  ‘Policy Mistakes’  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker , who voted
repeatedly last year against expanding stimulus, said today the
Fed’s $3.72 trillion-dollar balance sheet and interest-rate
guidance increases the risks and the costs of policy errors.
Stein gave a speech in  Frankfurt ,  Germany .  “My concern is that the combination of  forward guidance 
and a very large balance sheet has raised the likelihood of
policy mistakes going forward, and also has raised the cost of
such mistakes, should they occur,” Lacker said in a speech at
the Swedbank Economic Outlook Seminar in  Stockholm .  The central bank refrained from tapering its bond buying
after a Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, saying it needs more
evidence of lasting improvement in the economy. The Fed
purchased $1.57 billion today of Treasuries due from February
2036 to August 2043 as part of the program.  A Commerce Department report today showed gross domestic
product rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, unrevised from
the previous estimate, after expanding 1.1 percent in the first
quarter. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was a 2.6 percent pace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
