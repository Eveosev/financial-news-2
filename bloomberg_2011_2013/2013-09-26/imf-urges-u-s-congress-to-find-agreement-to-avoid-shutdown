The  International Monetary Fund 
urged U.S. lawmakers to quickly find a fiscal agreement to avoid
a federal government shutdown and raise its $16.7 trillion
borrowing limit.  “This is important for the continuation of the recovery in
the U.S. and beyond that in the global economy,” IMF spokesman
Gerry Rice said in a press briefing in Washington today.  President  Barack Obama  and congressional Republicans are
deadlocked over the  federal budget  in a confrontation that could
prompt a government shutdown within days. That showdown could
influence the next set of negotiations over raising the
borrowing limit, which the Treasury Department has said will be
reached by Oct. 17.  Rice today also said that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde yesterday met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on
the sidelines of the United Nations’ General Assembly. They
discussed the government’s economic priorities and how the
relationship with the IMF could be deepened, Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
