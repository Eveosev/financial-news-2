Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , one of the two
European phone companies part-owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB, rose to the highest in a year on speculation that a
takeover by the Mexican billionaire may become more likely.  The  shares  rose as much as 5.9 percent in Vienna, the
biggest increase since America Movil said Aug. 9 it intends to
make a 7.2 billion-euro ($9.7 billion) offer for the shares it
doesn’t already own in  Royal KPN NV. (KPN)  They traded at 5.972 euros,
the highest since Sept. 2012, at 2:51 p.m. local time. About 1.5
million shares changed hands, more than three times the three-month average.  “There’s a lot of M&A going on in the sector,” Usman Ghazi, a London-based analyst for Berenberg Bank, said in a
telephone interview. “Obviously  Telekom Austria  is on the radar
and that’s why the share price is so strong. Any story, however
ridiculous or misleading, is going to get the shares up.”  Speculation is fueled because yesterday a one-year period
ended during which Slim would have been forced to pay a 60
percent premium to Telekom Austria’s current share price if he
made a buyout offer to minority shareholders. An interview with
Austrian economy minister Reinhold Mitterlehner about his views
on privatizations also rekindled attention for Telekom Austria,
Ghazi said.  The stock has  gained  more than 25 percent over the last
three months. While two analysts advise investors to buy the
stock, 15 say they should hold it and five say they should sell
it,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
