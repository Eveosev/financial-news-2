Kawa Capital Management Inc. will
buy more units of  Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar company that filed
for protection from creditors in July, as the U.S. private-equity firm expands into funds investing in the industry.  Kawa will buy German sales and services units Conergy
Deutschland and Conergy Services and units in the U.S., Canada,
Singapore and Thailand, the Hamburg-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement. Kawa won’t take Spanish, French, Greek,
Czech or Indian units, Conergy said, without disclosing terms.  The deal gives Kawa “the necessary know-how for the global
planning, construction and operation of solar power plants,”
Andrew de Pass, a partner at the firm, said in the statement.
“We are stepping on new paths and will expand our business
activities to funds that invest in solar plants.”  Conergy is also talking to seven potential investors from
 Europe  and  Asia  about the sale of its German module factory in
 Frankfurt  an der Oder, the company said in a separate statement.
The company’s administrator is “confident” about reaching an
agreement with one of the investors by the end of next month.  Subsidies for renewable energy are falling as German and
Chinese competition shrinks panel prices and margins. German
producers that have filed for protection from creditors since
late 2011 include  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells SE, once the
world’s biggest maker of solar cells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
