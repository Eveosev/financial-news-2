Crude options volatility declined
as the underlying futures gained for the first time in six days.  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 20.34
percent at 3:45 p.m., down from 21.08 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose 37
cents to settle at $103.03 on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Oil advanced as U.S. jobless claims fell last week and the
economy expanded at a faster clip last quarter.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 51 percent of
electronic trading volume today.  November $95 puts were the most active options, dropping 7
cents to 20 cents a barrel on volume of 2,701 contracts at 3:57
p.m. The next most-active option, November $100 puts, slid 18
cents to 94 cents on volume of 2,287 contracts.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 61
percent of the 78,685 lots traded.  November $95 puts were the most active options yesterday
with 6,163 contracts changing hands as they fell 1 cent to 27
cents a barrel. November $90 puts, the next most-active,
declined 1 cent to 6 cents on volume of 5,078 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
41,867 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,808 lots
and December $100 calls with 32,748.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
