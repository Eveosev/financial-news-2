Bulgaria plans to cut natural gas
imports from  Russia  to 50 percent of its annual consumption
within five years to ensure energy bottlenecks don’t hold back
economic growth, according to President Rosen Plevneliev.  The European Union’s poorest member, which gets 87 percent
of its gas from Russia, is seeking to link with the planned
Trans-Adriatic Pipeline that will ship 10 billion cubic meters
of gas a year to  Italy  from  Turkey , Plevneliev said today in an
interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. A 2009 dispute
between Ukraine and Russia that cut flows to Bulgaria for two
weeks highlighted the need for greater independence, he said.  “In five years’ time, we’d like to see at least 50 percent
of the gas consumption in  Bulgaria  coming from different and
diversified sources,” Plevneliev said.  While gross domestic product will expand 1 percent this
year, the country has the potential to grow as much as 4 percent
to 6 percent annually, according to the president. Protests this
year over austerity measures and corruption show the nation is
continuing its transition to democracy as citizens demand more
transparency from politicians, Plevneliev said.  Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski took the post in May after
street protests prompted the previous government to resign.
Political leaders are struggling to maintain public confidence
as voters grow increasingly upset with what they see as a
corrupt political system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
