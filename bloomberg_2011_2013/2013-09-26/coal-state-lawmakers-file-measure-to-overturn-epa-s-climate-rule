A group of coal-state lawmakers
introduced a  measure  to overturn the Environmental Protection
Agency’s proposed limits on carbon-dioxide emissions from power
plants.  The joint resolution faces an unlikely road to becoming law
because it would also need to be passed by the Democratically-controlled Senate and signed by President  Barack Obama . The
measure would use the Congressional Review Act to invalidate the
proposed rule, which was issued this month. The lead sponsor of
the resolution is Representative David McKinley, a West Virginia
Republican.  Obama in June directed the EPA to issue a cap on carbon
pollution from power plants, which account for 40 percent of
U.S. emissions. The EPA proposal, which applies to only new
plants, would essentially mandate that new coal plants use
expensive carbon capture technology. With that requirement no
new coal plants would be built, according to industry
representatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
