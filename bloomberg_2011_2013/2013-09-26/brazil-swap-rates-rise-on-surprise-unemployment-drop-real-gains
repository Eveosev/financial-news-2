Brazil’s swap rates climbed to a
one-week high as an unexpected drop in the August unemployment
rate added to speculation that the central bank will sustain the
pace of increases in borrowing costs to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point to 10.13 percent at 10:09
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level since Sept. 19. The real
gained 0.6 percent to 2.2186 after falling 1.4 percent
yesterday, the biggest decline in a month.  “The labor market is overheated,”  Newton Rosa , the chief
economist at Sul America Investimentos, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “Inflation will continue to be pressured, which should
prompt the central bank to raise rates two more times.”  Economists lifted their forecast for annual inflation at
the end of 2014 to 5.96 percent from 5.90 percent, according to
the median forecast of a weekly central bank survey published
Sept. 23. Labor market gains helped inflation accelerate earlier
this year beyond the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for the first time since 2011.  The unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in August,
matching the lowest level for the month, the national statistics
agency reported today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
projected it to hold at 5.6 percent.  Brazil ’s policy makers have raised the  target lending rate 
by 1.75 percentage points from a record low 7.25 percent in
April, the fastest pace of monetary tightening among 49 major
economies tracked by Bloomberg. At 9 percent, the central bank
has the highest target lending rate in Latin America.  To contact the reporters on this story:
