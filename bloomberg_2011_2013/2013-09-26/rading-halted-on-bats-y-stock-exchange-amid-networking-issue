Bats Global Markets Inc.’s BYX
Exchange reopened using a  Chicago  backup site after a computer
malfunction forced the equity market to shut for three hours.  Bats, the Lenexa, Kansas-based company that’s planning to
merge with Direct Edge Holdings LLC to become the second-largest
U.S. stock exchange operator, said a programming bug in a
vendor’s network software caused the disruption that closed BYX
at 9:44 a.m.  New York  time. That exchange accounted for 2
percent of daily U.S. volume in September, according to data
compiled by Bats.  While the switch to Chicago took effect at 12:40 p.m. New
York time, volume on BYX didn’t accelerate until about an hour
later,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. This was the first time
Bats turned to the backup site in Chicago, spokesman  Randy Williams  said. Three previous uses of a facility in Nutley,  New
Jersey , were scheduled in advance, he said.  Today’s pause followed a series of breakdowns at bourse
operators around the world, including a three-hour trading halt
on Aug. 22 for thousands of U.S. stocks listed by Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White told the industry during a Sept. 12 meeting to collaborate
on making markets more reliable.  Bats shut the BZX Exchange, its largest U.S. stock
exchange, for 50 minutes on Aug. 6 because of a network
malfunction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
