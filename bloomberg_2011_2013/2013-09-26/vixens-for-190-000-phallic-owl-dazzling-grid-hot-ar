Warm up for Halloween with the
zombie-like vixens in Ashley Bickerton’s new show
“Mitochondrial Eve/Viral Mother” at Lehmann Maupin Gallery’s
Lower East Side outpost. They sport bulging eyes and cigarette
necklaces.  The faces appear on perforated wooden or resin surfaces,
festooned with thick blobs of paint, flowers, beads, seashells,
rotting pieces of food, butterflies and insects.  Bickerton, who’s been living in Bali since 1993, started
this group by making clay models that also became the basis for
his first sculptures, which are getting their  New York  debut.
Cast in metal and fiberglass, the large silvery busts are mostly
monochromatic except for crazy makeup and an occasional feather.  Prices are $60,000 to $190,000. Through Oct. 26 at  Lehmann

Brazilian artist Caetano de Almeida, who weaves threads of color
to create dazzling grids.  The repetitive patterns are opened up by white circular
cutouts that push the colorful strings apart, creating new,
unexpected rhythm in the composition.  In the largest painting a maze of thin lines makes the New
York subway system look like a kindergarten project. Some of the
lines penetrate the white circles, turning them into
crosshatched suns floating amid euphoric chaos.  Prices are $30,000 to $60,000. Through Oct. 13 at 195

D’Alvia’s show at  Mulherin & Pollard  gallery. They combine the
classical, the cartoonish and the erotic.  D’Alvia turns hard materials into meticulously carved
objects that appear shaggy, leafy or slurpy.  A bronze titled “Happyday” depicts a monkey blowing its
brains out. In “Lump,” ceramic spaghetti has been tamed into a
cube shape. In “Swannabee (Space Bird),” a phallic shape
protrudes from a smooth, curved marble mass.  Prices are $1,500 to $16,000. Through Sept. 29 at 187

second-floor space around the corner from the New Museum.  It’s featuring a solo exhibition of photo collages by John
Houck called “A History of Graph Paper.”  Each work has an intriguing sense of space, at once shallow
and deep. Within a single image, the same objects -- stamps,
cardboard boxes, pencils, sheets of paper -- appear flattened
out and in relief.  Prices are $4,000 to $6,000. Through Oct. 27 at 1 Rivington

fleeting and unusual art projects in the city. Artists Danielle
Durchslag and Ryan Frank invited eight friends to create an
emerging-art sukkah.  “Assembly Required: A Sukkah Salon” is a temporary,
kosher structure, built with 10 artworks on Durchslag’s balcony.
Compact and open to the elements (and with an unobstructed view
of the Empire State Building), its canopy of branches and leaves
was crafted by Ian Trask. The walls are made with 8-foot-tall
panels, each an artwork.  Frank’s cut-up plastic curtain, originally imprinted with
an image of a green country road, turned into an abstraction
after the weekend’s downpour. The setting sunlight transformed
Durchslag’s family sukkah decoration into a glowing, mandala-like installation.  The show is open by appointment through Sept. 30. To
schedule a visit, e-mail  sukkahsalon@gmail.com .  Muse highlights include  Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich
Jaroslovsky  on technology,  Lance Esplund  on art.  To contact the reporters of this story:
