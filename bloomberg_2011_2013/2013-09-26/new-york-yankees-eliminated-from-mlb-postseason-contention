The  New York Yankees  were
eliminated from postseason contention tonight, marking only the
second time in 19 seasons they will miss the playoffs.  The Yankees, who have a record 27 World Series
championships, were eliminated when the Cleveland Indians won
7-2 against the Chicago White Sox.  New York, which is losing 7-3 against the Tampa Bay Rays in
the ninth inning tonight, cannot catch the Rays or the Indians
for the two American League wild-card spots.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
