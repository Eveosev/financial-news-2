Canada’s election watchdog said it
has charged Conservative lawmaker Dean Del Mastro for violating
the country’s election law.  The four charges include spending more than the amount
allowed under the law and failing to report an election
contribution, the Commissioner of Canada Elections said today in
a statement.  Del Mastro, commenting in a separate statement, said he
“entirely rejects” the allegations and plans to defend himself
in court. The lawmaker said he will leave the Conservative Party
caucus until the matter is resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
