Clydesdale Bank Plc must pay about
42 million pounds ($67 million) in fines and compensation to
customers for miscalculating mortgage repayments.  Clydesdale, a Glasgow, Scotland-based lender owned by
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , made a calculation error that left
a 21.2 million-pound shortfall across 22,000 customer mortgage
accounts, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said in a
statement today. The error, which began in 2005 and was
corrected in 2010, led to unexpected increases for customers in
their monthly repayments.  “For most people, mortgage payments are their biggest
monthly outgoing and we all budget on the assumption that the
information our mortgage lender gives us about what we need to
pay is correct,” said Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s head of
enforcement. “Here Clydesdale failed in that basic duty and,
when it discovered the problem sought to pass all of the
consequences on to its customers.”  Clydesdale was fined 8.9 million pounds by the regulator
after receiving its standard 30 percent discount for
cooperating. The total cost for the bank, including the penalty,
will be about 42 million pounds, Clydesdale said in an e-mailed
statement. Most of that had been provided for by the end of
June, it said.  David Thorburn, Clydesdale’s chief executive officer,
apologized for the errors.  “We should have made it clear at the time that this was
entirely our fault and that some customers may be entitled to
compensation,” Thorburn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
