Investor expectations for U.S.
inflation have declined to the lowest in more than three years
even as data point to economic recovery, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
said, citing surveys.  While policy makers in major economies are providing
unprecedented stimulus, investors see little price pressure in
the U.S., the euro region or the U.K. over the next five years,
according to the bankâ€™s quarterly overview published yesterday.  Investors expect  U.S. inflation  to average 1.68 percent in
the next 12 months, compared with 1.85 percent in the previous
survey in March. Over the next two-to-five years, the rate is
seen at 2.4 percent, the lowest since the July 2010 survey,
JPMorgan said. The report was based on responses from 320
investors including asset-management companies, pension funds,
banks and  hedge funds .  Medium-term inflation expectations for the euro region
dropped to the least since the surveys began in March 2010, with
investors predicting consumer prices will increase at a 1.3
percent rate in the next 12 months and 2 percent in the two-to-five-year horizon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
