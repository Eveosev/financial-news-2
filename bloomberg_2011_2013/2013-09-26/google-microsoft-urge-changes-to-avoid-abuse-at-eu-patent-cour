Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Microsoft Corp (MSFT)  and at
least 12 other companies urged the European Union to change
draft rules that will guide the way the bloc’s first patent
court operates.  “We appreciate that Europe has long worked towards a
unified patent system, and we hope the proposed new system will
be a significant step forward,” the companies, including  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  said in a  letter  that was sent to EU institutions today.
“We are concerned” that aspects of the draft rules “may
undermine these benefits by creating significant opportunities
for abuse.”  EU ministers in February approved plans to set up the first
patent court, paving the way for a  common patent system  after a
decades-long deadlock on the plans. Costs for getting patent
protection in  Europe  could be cut by more than 30,000 euros
($40,443) under a new common patent system, the European
Commission, the EU’s executive agency has said.  One of the companies’ concerns is that the rules aren’t
clear enough on when or how it will be decided whether a
particular patent is valid and that this “could undermine,
rather than promote, innovation in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
