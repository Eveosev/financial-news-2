Mars Blend’s discount to West Texas
Intermediate narrowed after the U.S. benchmark lost ground to
Brent.  WTI’s discount to its European counterpart widened by 59
cents to $6.25 a barrel at 3:25 p.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. When WTI weakens versus Brent, which
is used to price foreign crudes, it can raise the value of
domestic oils competing for space in Gulf Coast refineries.  Mars strengthened by 75 cents to a discount of $2.05 a
barrel against WTI at 2:02 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 40 cents to
a premium of $2.40. Heavy Louisiana Sweet fell 10 cents a barrel
to a premium of $2.90.  Thunder Horse  advanced to a premium, gaining 75 cents to 25
cents a barrel above WTI, and Poseidon rose 40 cents to a
discount of $2.90 a barrel to the domestic benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
