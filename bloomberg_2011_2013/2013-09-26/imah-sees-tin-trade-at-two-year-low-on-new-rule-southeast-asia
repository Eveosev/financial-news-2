Tin exports  from  Indonesia , the
largest shipper, are slumping to a two-year low after the
government limited cargoes to metal traded on local bourses.
Futures climbed for a third day in London.  Shipments of the commodity used in smartphones and
computers will drop to as low as 3,000 metric tons this month,
according to  PT Timah (TINS) , the country’s largest producer. That’s
less than half the amount in August and the least since November
2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices may rise as much
as 20 percent to $28,000 a ton by the end of the year, Timah
President Director Sukrisno said in an interview.  Indonesia, which accounts for about 40 percent of global
exports, is seeking to boost the value of commodity sales,
including metals. The rule change prompted producers such as
state-backed Timah to curb exports as many buyers have yet to
become members of an exchange in Jakarta. The impasse is
depleting  stockpiles  tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange, while
boosting prices to the highest level in six months.  “We expect exports will drop further in September after
they declined to about 6,000 tons last month,” said Sukrisno,
who uses a single name. “That’s not a problem because we’re
committed to seek prices, not volume,” he said in Pangkalpinang,
Bangka Belitung, where the company is based. Timah’s stock
advanced for a third day in Jakarta to the highest in a week.  Tin for delivery in three months outperformed the five
other main base metals including copper and lead on the LME in
the past year as the Indonesian curbs worsened a global deficit.
The metal -- which rose to $23,450 yesterday, the highest price
since March 19 -- climbed 0.2 percent to $22,263 at 2:41 p.m. in
Jakarta. It was last above $28,000 in August 2011.  Benchmark Price  The new policy is designed to establish a domestically
determined benchmark price, Trade Minister  Gita Wirjawan  said in
an interview on Sept. 23. It will be implemented over the long
term and shipments are expected to decline, said Wirjawan. While
the rule applies to refined ingots at present, it will be
extended to cover other products such as solder from 2015.  The change, which took effect Aug. 30, is part of wider
government efforts to increase the value of commodity shipments
from  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy. Indonesia has ordered
mining companies to build smelters as it plans to ban raw
mineral-ore shipments from January 2014. The country imposed a
tax on cocoa-bean shipments in 2010 to encourage investment in
processing plants. Tin-purity rules were also raised this year.  Timah, which declared force majeure after the policy change,
wants to sell to overseas buyers through the Indonesia Commodity
and Derivatives Exchange in Jakarta. The company will no longer
use term contracts, which specify a fixed quantity for delivery
over a set period, Sukrisno said this month.  Limit Shipments  The ICDX -- which has 18 tin-trading members, with eight
sellers and 10 buyers -- traded 675 tons of ingots from Aug. 30
to yesterday, bourse data show. The exchange expects the
government to stick with the new policy, which aims to limit
shipments and increase prices, Christilia Angelica, head of
business development, said on Sept. 18.  The forecast for 3,000 tons of exports this month may
comprise about 400 tons of ingots that have been traded through
the ICDX and about 2,600 tons of other tin products such as
solder, Timah Corporate Secretary Agung Nugroho said.  Stockpiles in LME-registered warehouses are heading for the
biggest monthly decline since January 2012 as holdings are
withdrawn from sheds in Singapore and  Malaysia , where most of
the metal is stored. The LME-tracked reserves stood at 13,625
tons on Sept. 26, 12 percent lower than at the end of August.  ‘Stopped Operations’  “Most of the smelters have stopped operations” as they
can’t export, said Tjahyono Mukmin, president director of
Serumpun Tin, a group of producers that wants to trade ingots
through the Jakarta Futures Exchange, or JFX. “We’re still
waiting for a permit for the JFX.”  Indonesia shipped 98,817 tons last year, including 9,874
tons in September, according to trade ministry data. About 0.7
gram of tin is found in a mobile phone and as much as 3 grams in
a tablet computer, according to data from  St. Albans , England-based ITRI Ltd. and Henkel AG, a Dusseldorf-based solder maker.  The new rules are causing confusion, which is supporting
prices,  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. said Sept. 11. The global
deficit is forecast to more than double from 6,000 tons this
year to 13,000 tons in 2015 as demand beats supplies, Standard
Bank said in a report. Citigroup Inc. raised its 2014 forecast
9.1 percent to $22,375 a ton, according to a report this week.  “In August, tin surged to $22,000 to 23,000, which
exceeded my expectations,” said Timah’s Sukrisno. “If the
current trend continues, prices will most likely rise to $25,000
a ton in October. I’m even optimistic it will reach $28,000 a
ton by the year-end.”  Shares in Timah rose as much as 4 percent to 1,570 rupiah,
the highest since Sept. 20, and traded at 1,550 rupiah. The
stock is 0.7 percent higher this year, lagging behind the
Jakarta Composite Index’s 2.3 percent gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
