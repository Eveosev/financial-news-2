Gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur
diesel gained on speculation that seasonal maintenance at U.S.
refineries will reduce fuel supplies.  Futures rose as the Energy Information Administration
reported yesterday that refinery utilization fell 2.2 percentage
points to 90.3 percent last week. Gasoline  production  dropped
2.8 percent to the lowest level since May and  output  of
distillates shrank to a three-month low.  “There’s an expectation that maintenance and turnarounds
are going to start to lower what are high-capacity utilization
numbers,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for October delivery rose 1.55 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.6884 a gallon at 9:49 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 41 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day. Prices are down 4.4 percent
this year and 2.3 percent in the third quarter.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 16 cents to $9.09 a barrel, down from
$13.73 on Aug. 30. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 16 cents
to $3.43.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 1.3 cents to $3.434
a gallon, 37.1 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based
AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery rose 1.61
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.9892 a gallon on trading volume
that was 1.8 percent below the 100-day average. Futures have
dropped 1.8 percent this year and are up 3.8 percent in the
third quarter.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 27 cents to $22.41 a
barrel. The  premium  over Brent increased 27 cents to $16.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
