Peter Mandelson, who was business
secretary for the U.K. Labour Party until it lost power in 2010,
warned leader Ed Miliband over his plan to freeze energy bills.  Miliband said this week he wanted to take on “predator”
utility companies, which he accused of exploiting consumers. He
pledged that energy suppliers will be prevented by law from
increasing prices until 2017 if Labour wins the May 2015 general
election.  “Perceptions of Labour policy are in danger of being taken
backwards,” Mandelson told the Guardian newspaper. “I tried to
move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy
between state control and laissez-faire.”  Energy companies hit back against the proposed price cap,
saying that a significant portion of rising bills is the result
of requirements imposed by government that they buy power from
green sources.  Centrica Plc (CNA) , the largest supplier of energy to homes, has
lost more than 7 percent of its value since Miliband made his
announcement on Sept. 24. That’s the third-biggest decline among
companies in the FTSE 350 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
