Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen
said policy makers will remain committed to flexible inflation
targeting as they expand their role to respond to financial
imbalances when setting interest rates.  Policy should take into account inflation and “provide a
reasonable balance between the path for inflation and the path
for overall capacity utilization,” he said in the text of
speech in Oslo today. “Notwithstanding new macro-prudential
tools, we see a need to add a third criterion: The interest rate
should be set so that monetary policy leans against a build-up
of financial imbalances.”  The bank this month left its benchmark rate at 1.5 percent
and signaled faster increases in the future after its efforts to
fight back the krone’s appreciation paid off. The bank signaled
it will move toward higher rates as house prices and consumer
debt hover at record levels.  Norges Bank is trying to balance policy to avoid fueling
krone gains without overheating an economy buoyed by a booming
petroleum industry and record house prices. Private debt has
surged to about 200 percent of disposable income, according to
the central bank.  “We remain firmly committed to our flexible inflation
targeting framework,” Olsen said. “But the global financial
crisis has taught us to be both modest and inquisitive.
Experience with new macro-prudential policy tools is limited,
and institutional frameworks are still in the making. Leaning
against financial winds remains subject to debate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
