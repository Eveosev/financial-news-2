Cristiano Ronaldo continued his
scoring run with both goals as Real  Madrid  beat Elche 2-1 to
move within two points of Spanish soccer leaders Barcelona and
Atletico Madrid.  Also last night,  Monaco  beat Bastia 3-0 to maintain its
two-point lead atop France’s Ligue 1, while Roma went top of
 Italy ’s Serie A as it won 2-0 at Sampdoria and Napoli drew 1-1
at home with Sassuolo.  Ronaldo converted a stoppage-time penalty kick to lift Real
to 16 points through six games. The Portuguese forward opened
the scoring with a free kick early in the second half before
Richmond Boyake’s header tied the game in the first minute of
stoppage time. Ronaldo then scored from the spot in the sixth
added minute after Pepe was fouled by Carlos Sanchez.  It was Ronaldo’s seventh goal in eight days, lifting his
tally to 210 in 206 matches for Real, according to Infostrada
Sports. He’s scored 11 times in his past five matches for Real
and Portugal.  Radamel Falcao scored twice after  Emmanuel Riviere ’s opener
to keep Monaco ahead of defending champion Paris Saint-Germain,
which won 1-0 at Valenciennes on a goal from Edinson Cavani.
Monaco has 17 points after seven matches, with PSG on 15.  In Italy, goals by Mehdi Benatia and Gervinho extended
Roma’s perfect start to the season as the capital club moved to
15 points from five games. Defending champion Juventus came from
behind to win 2-1 at Chievo and join second-place Napoli on 13
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
