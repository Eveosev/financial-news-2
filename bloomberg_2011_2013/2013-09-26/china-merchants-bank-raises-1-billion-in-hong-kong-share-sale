China Merchants Bank Co. (3968) , the
nation’s sixth-largest lender, raised HK$7.95 billion ($1
billion) in a Hong Kong rights offer following a share sale in
Shanghai.  Shenzhen-based Merchants Bank made the announcement in a
Hong Kong exchange filing yesterday. The lender said on Sept. 4
it sold 27.5 billion yuan of shares in the Shanghai offer as
96.4 percent of local investors participated.  The funding enables Merchants Bank to plug a capital
shortfall and accelerate growth as competition with smaller
rivals such as  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988)  and  Industrial Bank
Co. (601166)  intensifies. Chinese lenders have announced plans this year
to raise as much as 327 billion yuan from bond and equity sales
amid tighter capital rules and a government crackdown on short-term financing.  Ping An Bank Co., the least capitalized among  China ’s 17
publicly traded lenders, said earlier this month it plans to
sell 14.8 billion  yuan  of stock to its controlling shareholder
to bolster its financial strength.  Merchants Bank’s capital adequacy ratio fell to 10.72
percent as of June 30 from 11.41 percent at the beginning of the
year, and its core Tier 1 ratio dropped to 8 percent from 8.34
percent, according to its first-half earnings report. While both
measurements are higher than the minimum regulatory requirement,
they are the second lowest among Hong Kong-listed mainland
lenders.  The bank aims to improve its capital ratio to 11.5 percent
by the end of 2015, while lifting the Tier 1 ratio to 9.5
percent, President Tian Huiyu said last month.  Shares of Merchants Bank lost 0.7 percent to close at
HK$14.66 in Hong Kong yesterday, bringing their decline for the
year to 12 percent. The bank fell 0.7 percent to 10.76 yuan in
 Shanghai .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
