Copper dropped, paring the first
quarterly gain in a year, on slowing demand in  China  before next
week’s holidays and on concern that U.S. budget negotiations are
stalling.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.4 percent to $7,169.50 a metric ton
and traded at $7,183.50 by 11:00 a.m. in  Tokyo . Copper increased
1.2 percent this month and added 6.4 percent this quarter.  Markets in China are closed from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7 for
National Day holidays. Congress is yet to pass a U.S. budget as
lawmakers tussle over whether to use it to stop funding the 2010
health-care overhaul known as Obamacare. The lack of an
agreement may spur a government shutdown.  “The market remained subdued before next week’s Chinese
holidays amid concern on the U.S. budget talks,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research at Nihon Unicom Inc.
in Tokyo. Copper will trade in a narrow range over the next
week, he said.  Futures for delivery in December dropped 0.1 percent to
$3.268 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Metal for delivery in
December on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.2 percent to
51,850  yuan  ($8,470) a ton.  On the LME, tin and lead also slid, while aluminum, nickel
and zinc were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
