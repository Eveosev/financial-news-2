The U.S. Senate is poised tomorrow
to begin consideration of an amendment to restore funding for
the President  Barack Obama â€™s signature health-care law as part
of legislation to fund the government past Sept. 30.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid proposed an amendment to
restore the health-care funding and to pay for government
operations through Nov. 15, a month shorter than the funding
expiration date in the measure the House passed Sept. 20.  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, also moved to limit debate on the
measure, setting up a Sept. 27 vote on that motion. The move
came after Republicans -- notably Senator Ted Cruz of  Texas  --
yielded back time for debate on taking up the bill, and it sets
up a final vote for Sept. 28 at the latest.  Cruz spoke for more than 21 hours yesterday and today in
opposition to the 2010 health-care law, vowing to do what he can
to block the Senate from funding its implementation. A House-Senate agreement is necessary before Oct. 1 to avoid a
government shutdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
