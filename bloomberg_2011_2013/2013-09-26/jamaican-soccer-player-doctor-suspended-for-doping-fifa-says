Jamaican soccer player Jermaine Hue
and team doctor Carlton Fraser were suspended by the sport’s
international governing body after the midfielder failed a
doping test.  Hue tested positive for dexamethasone following a World Cup
qualifying match in  Honduras  in June, and will be suspended for
nine months, FIFA said today in an e-mailed statement. Fraser
will be ineligible for four years for administering the
substance to the player, the governing body said.  “The suspension covers all types of match, including
domestic, international, friendly and official fixtures,” FIFA
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
