Ford Motor Co. (F) , seeking to devise
systems that better link car passengers’ mobile phones to their
vehicles, acquired software company Livio for less than $10
million.  The automaker plans to retain all 11 full-time employees at
Ferndale, Michigan-based Livio, Paul Mascarenas, Ford’s chief
technical officer, told reporters today on a conference call.
Livio will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford, he said.  “Livio has solutions which are largely software-based that
allow our customers to bring their content into the vehicle
through their mobile device,” Mascarenas said. Ford and Livio
will “work towards developing an industry standard for
smartphone-to-vehicle communications.”  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  has made in-car
technology a pillar of the second-largest U.S. carmaker’s
vehicles with features including Sync voice commands and MyFord
Touch controls. Systems that integrate cars with mobile phones
will be used in 21 million vehicles by 2018, from just 1.9
million last year, according to researchers  GSMA  and  SBD .  Livio hasn’t disclosed its financial performance, said Jake Sigal, the company’s founder and CEO. He declined to say whether
Livio is profitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
