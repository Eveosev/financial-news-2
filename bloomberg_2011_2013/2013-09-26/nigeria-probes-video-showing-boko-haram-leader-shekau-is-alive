Nigeria ’s army said it is
investigating the authenticity of a video in which Abubakar Shekau, leader of the Boko Haram Islamists, is shown dismissing
military claims he may have died.  “It’s going to be subject to analysis,” Ibrahim Attahiru,
the Nigerian army spokesman in Abuja, the capital, said by phone
today. “I won’t tell you further what we’re going to do about
it until we authenticate and confirm” if the video is genuine.  The military  task force  fighting the militants in the
country’s northeast said on Aug. 19 that Shekau may have died
from injuries sustained in a June 30 clash, without providing
proof.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language, has carried out gun and bomb attacks
across Nigeria’s mainly Muslim north and the capital, Abuja,
killing thousands of people since 2009. Nigeria’s more than 160
million people are almost evenly split between Christians,
predominant in the south, and Muslims.  “It was said that I was killed, but here I am,” Shekau
said in the video sent to reporters in the northeastern city of
Maiduguri yesterday. “I am talking and laughing at the Nigerian
authorities who misled the world that I am dead.”  In the video, an armed Shekau in military fatigues is
sitting on the floor surrounded by masked gunmen. He claimed
responsibility for attacks last week, including one in the
northeastern town of Benisheik, which the authorities said left
at least 142 people dead.  To contact the reporters on this story:
