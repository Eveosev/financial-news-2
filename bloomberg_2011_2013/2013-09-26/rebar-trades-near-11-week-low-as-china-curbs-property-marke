Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the lowest level in 11 weeks after  China  reaffirmed
the need to reduce overheating in the property market.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to 3,615 yuan ($590) a metric ton at
11:12 a.m. local time. The most-active contract declined to
3,612 yuan on Sept. 23, the lowest since July 10. Futures have
lost 3.6 percent this month.  China must prevent rising land prices, which in some
instances have been stoked by local governments selling plots in
prime locations because they are under pressure to pay debts,
the China Securities Journal reported today, citing Hu
Cunzhi，vice minister of land and resources.  “Steel demand will be restrained unless the government
eases policies curbing the property market,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 0.8
percent to $133.8 yesterday, according to a price index compiled
by The Steel Index Ltd. The average spot price of rebar fell 0.2
percent to 3,504  yuan  yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
