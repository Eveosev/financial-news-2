European stocks were unchanged as
data showing the number of Americans filing jobless claims
unexpectedly fell last week offset investor concern that budget
wrangling in Washington will lead to a government shutdown.  Ladbrokes (LAD)  Plc plunged to its lowest price in almost a year
after issuing a profit warning for its digital division.  Thomas

close of trading. The gauge has dropped 0.4 percent so far this
week amid concern that U.S. politicians will fail to approve a
 federal budget  for the new financial year. It has still climbed
5.3 percent in September as the  Federal Reserve  refrained from
reducing its monthly asset purchases, and has surged 9.8 percent
since the end of June, heading for the biggest quarterly gain in
four years.  “Markets clearly hate uncertainty and the U.S. debt
ceiling coupled with when the Fed is going to taper are clearly
two areas of concern,” Stephane Ekolo, chief European
strategist at Market Securities in London, wrote in a message.
“Given the good run the markets have experienced, it is normal
to pause a little.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 24 percent greater than the average of the
past 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Data  In the U.S., jobless  claims  decreased by 5,000 to 305,000

budget to keep the federal government operating from Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year, through Dec. 15. Failure to

western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent,
Germany’s DAX fell less than 0.1 percent and France’s CAC 40
Index dropped 0.2 percent.  Italian Decline  Italy’s FTSE MIB slid 1.2 percent amid concern the

the shares to neutral from overweight, citing proposals from
Britain’s Labour Party to freeze energy bills and break up the
country’s six biggest power suppliers.  Royal DSM NV (DSM)  slid 5.4 percent to 55.13 euros. The company
that spent $3.2 billion on nutrition-ingredient acquisitions
said profit this year may fall short of an initial target
because of stagnant markets in Europe and lower chemical prices.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  dropped 2.1 percent to 380.3 pence, taking its
