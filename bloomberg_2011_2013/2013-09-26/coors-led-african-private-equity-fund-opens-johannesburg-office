One Thousand & One Voices, a
private-equity fund started by the great grandson of the founder
of Coors Brewing Co., said it’s opening a Johannesburg office
after hiring three former  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. employees.  Navaid Burney, who was chief operating officer at Pangea
Exploration (Pty) Ltd. and previously head of Africa private
equity for Standard Bank, will lead the Johannesburg team,
Denver-based One Thousand & One Voices said in a statement
today. Merafe Moloto, managing director at Motseng Investment
Holdings, and Michael Adiukwu of Standard Bank’s leveraged and
acquisition finance unit, will be directors of the fund.  One Thousand & One Voices has raised more than $100 million
of the $300 million targeted for the fund, which will invest in
the fastest-growing nations on the continent, including Kenya,
Ghana, Tanzania and Nigeria. While Standard Bank closed its
private equity operations in 2011,  Africa  is attracting firms,
including  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and Actis LLP, with faster economic
growth rates than developed nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
