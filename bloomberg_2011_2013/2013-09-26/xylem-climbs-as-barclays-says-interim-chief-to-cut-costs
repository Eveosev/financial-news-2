Xylem Inc. (XYL) , which replaced its
chief executive officer earlier this month, rose the most since
July after Barclays Plc upgraded the stock, saying successor
Steve Loranger will be more aggressive in slashing costs.  The water company, based in  White Plains ,  New York , spun
off in 2011 while Loranger was chairman of ITT Corp., gained 2.5
percent to $28.23 at the close in New York the most since July
1. Xylem also said today it won an ozone-treatment system
contract in  China  valued at $1.9 million to improve municipal
water supplies in the Jinshan district of Shanghai.  “Steve Loranger has shown a willingness in the past to be
creative in shareholder value creation through the prior breakup
of ITT,” Scott Davis, a Barclays analyst in New York, said in a
note to clients today. “We would assume that he would be
willing to entertain further consolidation within the industry
and at the very least be more aggressive on cost targets and the
balance sheet.”  Loranger took over as interim chief on Sept. 9 after
Gretchen McClain stepped down. Davis raised his rating on Xylem,
whose pumps helped clear New York tunnels of  Hurricane Sandy 
floodwaters, to overweight or the equivalent of buy from
equalweight. Of 15 analysts covering Xylem, four advise buying
the stock, eight recommend holding and three say sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
