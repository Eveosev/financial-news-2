Middle distillate  inventories in
Singapore fell from the highest level in more than seven months,
according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore stockpiles of middle distillates, a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, fell 8.3 percent to 10.01 million
barrels in the week ended yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies last
week were at the highest level since Jan. 30.  Residual fuel  inventories, including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 3.4 percent to
21.79 million barrels, the lowest in five weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline rose 1.2 percent to 11.23 million
barrels, the data showed.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
