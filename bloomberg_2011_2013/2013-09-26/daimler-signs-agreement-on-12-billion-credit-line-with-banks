Daimler AG (DAI)  reached an agreement
with a consortium of banks for a 9 billion-euro ($12 billion)
credit line for the next five years to provide the world’s
third-largest maker of luxury cars with financial flexibility.  The facility will replace an existing line worth 7 billion
euros that would have expired in 2015, the Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer said in a statement today. Daimler has
options to extend the length of the new credit to 2020.  Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche has vowed to regain
the top spot in luxury-car sales by the end of the decade after
dropping to third in 2011. The effort to overtake Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi will be
based on investment in new models such as the GLA compact sport-utility vehicle. Daimler said it doesn’t plan to utilize the new
facility, which was “substantially oversubscribed.”  “We are delighted with the great interest in this credit
line,” Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said in the
statement. “We decided to renew the existing credit line at
this early stage primarily due to the favorable market
conditions, and have thus gained a sound liquidity cushion for
the longer term.”  More than 40 European, American and Asian banks are a part
of the consortium, Daimler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
