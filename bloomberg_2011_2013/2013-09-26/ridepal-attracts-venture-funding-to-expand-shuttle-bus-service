Corporate shuttles equipped with
Wi-Fi and other amenities are a hallmark of Silicon Valley
startups. Now a shuttle service called RidePal is attracting
venture funding in a bid to succeed as a startup itself.  RidePal, which provides rides to employees of more than 30
companies, announced $3.2 million in funding today from a group
led by Claremont Creek Ventures and Volvo Group Venture Capital.
Corporate customers of the two-year-old San Francisco-based
company include  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  and  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)   The company aims to capitalize on the proliferation of
corporate shuttle buses in Silicon Valley, which can ferry
workers from San Francisco and Oakland to the southern reaches
of San Jose. In getting employees out of their cars, RidePal is
joining companies like Uber and Lyft in trying to disrupt the
auto industry’s traditional model of vehicle ownership.  “Every workday millions of people unnecessarily suffer
through a long, frustrating twice-daily commute,” Nat Goldhaber, managing director at Claremont Creek Ventures, said
in the statement. “A commuter strategy is necessary for
companies to attract top talent and keep employees committed.
RidePal solves these challenges.”  RidePal provides daily service between 11 cities in the San
Francisco Bay area, relying on buses from companies such as
Black Tie Transportation and Bauer Transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
