Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  won a 400-megawatt deal to supply turbines to two  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  wind
farms in  Texas , the biggest order it received in three years.  Delivery of 200 V110 2-megawatt turbines will begin in the
first half as the Los Vientos III and Los Vientos IV wind farms
are scheduled to start up in 2015 and 2016, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas said today in a statement. The accord with Duke’s
renewables unit includes three-year service agreements.  The deal suggests Vestas is regaining ground in the U.S.,
its biggest market for shipments in 2012, after announcing no
new orders in the first eight months of this year. Flip-flopping
U.S. tax credit policies led to a feast then a famine for wind
developers. Including today’s deal, the Danish manufacturer has
this month announced three U.S. orders totaling 540 megawatts.  Vestas rose as much as 6 percent, the biggest intraday jump
since Aug. 21, and was up 4.6 percent at 129.10 kroner by 10:57
a.m. in Copenhagen. The stock more than quadrupled this year.  “This order also will keep our U.S. factories busy and
create jobs for Vestas service technicians who ensure the
turbines are producing the maximum amount of power,”  Chris Brown , U.S. sales unit president,  said  in a statement.  The company’s previous single-sale order that was larger
was a 420-megawatt Australian transaction in August 2010.  Tower Factory  Vestas last month canceled plans to sell a tower factory in
Pueblo,  Colorado , as it expects the plant to operate at full
capacity next year. Chief Marketing Officer Morten Albaek also
said he expected the U.S. market to recover in the second half.
In August, the company said it would supply 400 megawatts to EDP
Renovaveis SA’s U.S. sites. It didn’t count that in its 2013
orders as it was part of an already-agreed 1,500-megawatt deal.  Vestas last year shipped 1,313 megawatts of turbines in the
U.S., more than double its next biggest market in  Germany . An
expiring U.S. tax credit encouraged developers to rush to build
projects in 2012, leaving a dearth of new work for this year
even after the tax credit was unexpectedly renewed on Jan. 1.  The Danish turbine producer has now announced 3,356
megawatts of new orders in 2013, leaving it fewer than 400
megawatts short of its 2012 total of 3,738 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
