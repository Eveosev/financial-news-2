Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
cocoa producer, offered to sell beans for shipment in the
2014-15 season after futures traded on the NYSE Liffe exchange
in London entered a  bull market  earlier this month.  Beans for shipment from October to December 2014 were
offered at yesterday’s auction at a minimum price of 1,309  CFA
francs  ($2.69) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to data on the
website of industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao. That
would mean a premium of about 38 pounds ($61) a metric ton to
the March 2015 futures, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Cocoa entered a bull market on Sept. 5 and rose to 1,700
pounds a ton on Sept. 16, the highest level in almost a year. In
New York, futures entered a bull market last month and are this
year’s best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
raw materials followed by cotton and crude.  “It looks like they are taking advantage of the higher
prices,”  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at  Macquarie Group
Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s biggest investment bank, said by phone today,
commenting on the sales offers. “Prices need to stay high to
accelerate selling and to dampen short-term demand.”  Global cocoa supplies will fall short of demand by 195,000
tons in the 2013-14 season starting next month, Damien
Thouvenel, a trader at Paris-based Sucres et Denrees SA, said in
a Sept. 12 interview. That follows a shortage of 155,000 tons
this season. Processing will gain 3 percent to 5 percent in
2013-14, Peter B. Johnson, chief executive officer at grinder
Euromar Commodities GmbH, said in an interview the same day.  Chocolate sales will rise 6.2 percent to a record $117
billion next year, estimates Euromonitor International Ltd., a
consumer research company in London. Demand for chocolate in
China will expand 11 percent annually in the five years to 2018,
13 percent in Brazil, 22 percent in India and 8 percent in
Eastern Europe, according to the  Hershey Co. (HSY) , maker of Hershey
Kisses and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to 1,673
pounds a ton by 11:08 a.m. in London. Prices fell as much as 1.8
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
