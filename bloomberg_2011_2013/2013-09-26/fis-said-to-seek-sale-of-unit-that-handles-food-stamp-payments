Fidelity National Information
Services Inc. (FIS)  is selling its electronic benefits-transfer
business, which helps the government make food-stamp payments,
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The card payment processor is working with  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  to sell the business, which may fetch more than $200
million, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the matter is private. First-round bids are due next
week, the people said.  Fidelity National, which does business as FIS, is selling
units to focus on financial institutions. Last year, the
Jacksonville, Florida-based company sold its health-care benefit
business to Lightyear Capital LLC for $335 million.  Brad Fennessy, a spokesman for FIS, declined to comment, as
did John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Bank of America.  The food-stamp unit serves clients in 25 states according
to a  press release  last year. It generates about $25 million in
annual earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and
depreciation, said the people.  Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF)  spun off Fidelity National
Information Services in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
