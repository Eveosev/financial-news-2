The  Asian Development Bank  has
agreed to loan the growing Indian city of Kolkata $400 million
to expand and modernize its water and sanitation systems.  India ’s seventh-largest city “is struggling to provide
decent basic services to all its residents,” said Fei Yue,
director of the ADB’s South Asia Urban Development and Water
Division. The disparities will worsen “if we don’t improve the
systems now,” the executive said today in a statement.  The Manila-based lender said about 300 million liters (79
million gallons) of water are lost every day along city
suppliers’ 5,700 kilometer (3,540-mile) network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
