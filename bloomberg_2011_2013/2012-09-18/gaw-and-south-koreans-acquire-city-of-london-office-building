Downtown Properties Inc., an
affiliate of Hong Kong-based  fund manager  Gaw Capital Partners,
bought a building in the City of London financial district
leased in part to  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)   Downtown, based in Los Angeles, bought the Vintners Place
building at 68 Upper Thames Street with a South Korean group
including the Korea Federation of Community Credit Co-Operatives
and the Korean Teachers’ Credit Union, according to a statement
from the fund manager. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.  The 26,000-square-meter (277,000-square-foot) building is
located on the bank of the River Thames, close to Blackfriars
rail station. The property is about half of the size of the
Leadenhall Building, the  office tower  nicknamed the Cheesegrater
that is being developed by British Land Co. Plc and Oxford
Properties Group Inc. in the City.  The purchase is the third real estate deal completed by the
group, which bought First National Plaza in Chicago last year
and 333 Market Street in  San Francisco  in 2010, according to the
statement.  “We have always viewed London, New York and Hong Kong as
the three global gateway cities where international capital
flows,” Goodwin Gaw, managing principal at Gaw and Downtown,
said in the statement. “Assets trade at a liquidity premium.”  The building had been owned by Vintners Propco Sarl, a
Luxembourg-based company, from September 2007, according to
documents filed with the  Land Registry . It was bought that year
using a mortgage from Deutsche Genossenschafts-Hypothekenbank
AG, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
