Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube and Google
Play video services will get more than 600 programs from News
Corp.’s Twentieth Century Fox studio, adding TV shows and movies
such as “Family Guy,” “Glee” and “X-Men.”  The titles will be available for purchase or rent in the
U.S., Jonathan Zepp, Google’s manager of TV and film content
partnerships, said on the  Mountain View , California-based
 company’s blog . The content will come to other countries later.  The Fox studio is seeking ways to generate more online
revenue from its films and TV shows, which often are pirated and
viewed for free. Google, meanwhile, wants to expand YouTube
beyond its amateur-video roots to become a bigger source of
Hollywood entertainment. The company also is trying to bolster
Google Play, a service that lets users get movies, shows and
books on their Android smartphones and tablets.  Google’s announcement coincided with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
introduction today of Digital HD, a service that lets viewers
buy and watch high-definition movies on Amazon.com Inc.’s
website, Apple Inc.’s iTunes and other platforms, as well as
YouTube and Google Play.  Fox, which announced plans to introduce the service on
Sept. 7, is offering the sci-fi movie “Prometheus” for less
than $15, three weeks before it will be available on DVD.  Google shares  climbed 0.7 percent to $714.90 at 11:46 a.m.
in  New York . News Corp., based in New York, fell 0.5 percent to
$24.49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
