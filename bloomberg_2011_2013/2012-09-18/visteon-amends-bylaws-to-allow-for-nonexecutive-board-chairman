Visteon Corp. (VC) , which ousted its
chief executive officer last month, amended its bylaws to give
the board the ability to appoint a nonexecutive board chairman.  Visteon is leaning toward naming Tim Leuliette, the interim
CEO and chairman, to the permanent CEO position, three people
familiar with the plan said last week. Visteon disclosed the
bylaw change in a  regulatory filing  after regular trading in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
