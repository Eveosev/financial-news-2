The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development’s shareholders approved
investments in Jordan,  Tunisia  and  Morocco  for trade finance and
lending to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Jordan’s InvestBank will receive $30 million for
international trade-finance projects and the Maghreb Private
Equity Fund III run by AfricInvest-TunInvest, a private equity
firm in Morocco and Tunisia, will be given 20 million euros ($26
million) for lending to SMEs. Morocco’s Societe Generale
Marocaine de Banques will receive a 20 million-euro loan in two
equal tranches for lending to micro-enterprises and SMEs as well
as a 5 million-euro trade-finance facility, the EBRD said.  “Investments in  Egypt  are expected to be submitted
shortly,” the EBRD said in an e-mailed statement today.  The London-based bank, which said it has opened offices in
the four countries, plans to invest as much as 200 million euros
in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region by the end of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
