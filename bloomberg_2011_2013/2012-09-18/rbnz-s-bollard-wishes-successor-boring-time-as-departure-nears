New Zealand  has inflation under
control and a stable financial system that shouldn’t provide any
immediate challenges for the central bank, according to
departing Governor Alan Bollard.  “We’re handing over at a time inflation is very much under
control, where interest rates are expected by the market to stay
where they are for a year or so and we’ve got pretty assured
financial stability,” Bollard said in an interview with TV3,
posted on the broadcaster’s  website . He ends a 10-year term on
Sept. 25.  The central bank last week forecast annual inflation will
average less than 2 percent over the next two years, and has
kept the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent since
last year. Bollard will be replaced by former World Bank
managing director Graeme Wheeler.  “I hope he has a boring time,” Bollard said. “I don’t
think he will but that’s what we’re really all about here,
stability -- economic stability, financial stability.”  Bollard said New Zealand retains a “potent” monetary
policy where the central bank could lower  interest rates  if it
needed to, or it could respond to pressures in the housing
market by raising borrowing costs.  Economic growth is likely to be subdued, he said. “We’re
growing reasonably, but not really vigorously and I can’t really
see that in the very near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
