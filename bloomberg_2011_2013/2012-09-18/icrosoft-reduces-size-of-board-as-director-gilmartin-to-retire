Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  director Raymond Gilmartin, former chief executive officer of Merck & Co., will
leave the software maker’s board, reducing the size to ten
directors. The company also raised its dividend by 15 percent.  Gilmartin is retiring after 11 years of  service  and won’t
seek re-election to the board at the company’s 2012 annual
meeting, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in a
statement.  Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 23
cents, payable to shareholders of record on Nov. 15. The world’s
largest software maker has increased the payout in each of the
previous two years, including a 25 percent boost in 2011.
Microsoft’s cash and short-term investments as of June 30 surged
to more than $63 billion, from $52.8 billion a year earlier,
just before the last dividend increase.  The shares have advanced 20 percent this year. Microsoft
was little changed at $31.18 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
