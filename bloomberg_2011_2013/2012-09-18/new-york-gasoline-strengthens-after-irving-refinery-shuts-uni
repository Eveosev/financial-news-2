New York  gasoline strengthened
after a report that Irving Oil Corp. shut a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Saint John refinery in  New Brunswick .  The Canadian refinery shut the 70,000-barrel-a-day unit
yesterday, Hillary Stevenson, manager of data integrity at
Genscape, an energy-information provider, said in an e-mail.
Excess emissions also occurred at the sulfur plant, she said.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline to be
blended with ethanol, or CBOB, rose 0.75 cent in New York Harbor
to 15.5 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:01 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 1.33 cents to $3.0775 a gallon.  Lesley Dickson, an Irving spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The 298,800-barrel-a-day
refinery exports more than half of its production to the U.S.
Northeast, according to Irving’s  website .  Gulf Coast gasoline weakened 1 cent to 6.75 cents a gallon
over futures after Phillips 66 restarted several units at its
Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse,  Louisiana , yesterday.  Phillips 66 expects all units at the 247,000-barrel-a-day
plant to be started by the end of the week, the company said in
a statement on its website. Power was lost to the refinery on
Sept. 5, the second time in about a week after the plant was
shut in preparation for Hurricane Isaac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
