Two female police officers died
during an operation in Manchester today that led to the arrest
of Dale Cregan on suspicion of their murder, said Greater
Manchester Police.  Both officers, who were unarmed, suffered serious injuries
in a “routine operation” in Hattersley, Tameside, and one of
the officers died at the scene, the police force said in an e-
mailed statement. The second officer died later from her
injuries.  “A long and dark shadow has been cast across Greater
Manchester and my thoughts are with the officers’ family,
friends and colleagues,” said Assistant Chief Constable Garry
Shewan, according to the statement.  Cregan, 29, was arrested in relation to the officers’
deaths and two previous counts of murder.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
