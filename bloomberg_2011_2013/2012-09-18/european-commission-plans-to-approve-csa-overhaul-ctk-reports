The European Commission plans to
approve an overhaul of unprofitable Czech state airline Ceske
Aerolinie AS, including a 2.5 billion-koruna loan ($131 million)
from state company Osinek,  CTK  reported, citing unnamed people
familiar with the matter.  The government merged the carrier with Letiste Praha AS,
Pragueâ€™s international airport, in a bid to overhaul the airline
after an attempt to sell it failed in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
