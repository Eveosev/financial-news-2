Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields near a record low, on speculation slowing growth will
damp inflation.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 6.55 percent, according to the central bank. It fell
to 6.5 percent on Sept. 13, the lowest closing level since the
securities were first issued in 2009.  Colombia will report this week that economic expansion
slowed to 4.2 percent in the second quarter from 4.7 percent in
the first three months of 2012, according to the median estimate
of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Should growth come in slower than expected, we’ll see
less inflation,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst at Alianza
Valores SA brokerage in Bogota.  Annual inflation was 3.11 percent last month, within the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  Colombia’s peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,796.25 per  U.S.
dollar  after erasing an earlier drop of as much as 0.4 percent.
The currency has jumped 7.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
