Siemens AG (SIE)  will eliminate 615 jobs
at U.S. factories producing windmills in response to declining
orders, dealing a blow to Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher ’s push into environmentally friendly energy sources.  “The industry is facing a significant drop in new orders,
and this has an unfortunate consequence on employment in this
segment of the power industry,” Munich-based Siemens said today
in a message to employees that was obtained by Bloomberg.  The cuts account for more than a third of the workforce
that Siemens has built up in its U.S. wind-energy business, an
operation that helped the company to national prominence after
President  Barack Obama  visited a facility in  Iowa  in 2010.
Siemens said that it has invested $100 million to establish its
U.S. wind-power subsidiary over the past 5 years.  The reductions are a setback for Loescher’s attempt at
bolstering the company’s portfolio of so-called green products
that are environmentally friendly. Siemens is in the process of
realigning its business after having to curtail its earnings
forecast twice this year, and the company will present the
results of its revamp to management next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
