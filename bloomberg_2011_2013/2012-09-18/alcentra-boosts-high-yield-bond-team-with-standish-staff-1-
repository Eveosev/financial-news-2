Alcentra Group, a credit asset
manager owned by  Bank of New York Mellon  Corp., is boosting its
high-yield bond business by adding an eight-person team from
Standish Mellon Asset Management Co. LLC from January 2013.  The combination will increase the assets Alcentra manages
to $23 billion from $15.2 billion, split between the U.S. and
 Europe , the firm said today in an e-mailed statement.  Paul Hatfield, Alcentra’s chief investment officer, will
relocate to  New York  from London to be president and head of the
group’s U.S. business, according to the statement.  “We have seen an increasing number of requests from
sophisticated investors for mixed mandates with the flexibility
to invest in both loans and bonds in one fund, depending on the
cycle and their views on duration and inflation, so this
transaction also serves to meet that need,” Alcentra Chairman
David Forbes-Nixon said in the statement.  Alcentra, formed in 2002, became part of Bank of New York
in 2006. It invests in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds,
distressed debt, mezzanine financing, and structured credit,
according to its  website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
