Vitol Group sold ultra-low-sulfur
diesel in  Europe . Gasoil barge discounts shrank.  BP Plc plans to shut a gasoline-making unit at its
Rotterdam oil refinery, Europe’s second-largest, for planned
maintenance next month, according to a person with knowledge of
the matter.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $1,105 to $1,110 a metric ton, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin
board. That’s down from $1,127 yesterday.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the biggest buyer of the Eurobob
grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Barges
are usually of 1,000 or 2,000 tons. Gunvor Group Ltd. was the
main seller.  Gasoline’s crack, or  premium to   Brent crude , advanced 15
cents to $12.12 a barrel at 5:17 p.m. local time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker
in  London .  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent shrank to $6.81 a barrel from
$7.06 yesterday, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  AIC Ltd. and Vitol sold  barges  of diesel to Morgan Stanley,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window. The shipments changed hands at $30.50 and
$31 a ton more than October gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, little changed from yesterday.  Heating oil  barges traded at discounts of $3 a ton,
compared with $4 in the previous session, the survey of Platts
showed. Gunvor sold to Cargill Inc.  Gasoil for October delivery fell for the second day, losing
$24.25 to trade at $986.25 a ton as of 5:19 p.m. local time on
the ICE exchange.  October’s premium to the next month, or backwardation, grew
to $4 a ton, the biggest spread since July 11, excluding expiry-
day anomalies. The market structure reflects rising near-term
demand or falling supply.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, fell
to $18.97 a barrel at 4:30 p.m., little changed from yesterday.
Brent declined 1 percent to $112.69 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  changed hands at $643 to $645 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. That compares with $660 to
$661 a ton in the previous session. The low-sulfur grade traded
at $699.75 to $702 a ton, down from $719 to $721 yesterday.  Refineries  BP’s fluid catalytic cracking unit at its Rotterdam
refinery will be idled for about four weeks, according to the
person, who declined to be identified as they’re not authorized
to speak publicly about the matter. Carlo Eijkels, a BP
spokesman in Rotterdam, declined to comment when contacted by
phone today.  The unit, known as an FCC, has the capacity to process
62,000 barrels daily, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Rotterdam refinery can handle about 377,000 barrels of crude
a day, the data show.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) ,  Portugal ’s biggest oil company, said
it is supplying refined products normally as workers take part
in a three-day strike that’s scheduled to end tomorrow.  Galp yesterday said some units at its refineries had been
halted while others were operating at lower levels due to the
strike. The company’s Oporto plant in northern Portugal can
process about 90,000 barrels of oil a day, while its site in
Sines, on the coast south of Lisbon, has a capacity of 220,000
barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
