The Philippine central bank will
report the nation’s  balance of payments  position for August. The
external payments posted a surplus of $3.18 billion in July.  The Southeast Asian nation has secured central bank
approval to sell peso-denominated debt to global investors and
dollar bonds in the local market, issues that may help reduce
the government’s borrowing costs. The government has the go-
ahead to sell as much as $1 billion worth of the peso notes and
up to $500 million of dollar securities, according to three
officials who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  EVENTS:
