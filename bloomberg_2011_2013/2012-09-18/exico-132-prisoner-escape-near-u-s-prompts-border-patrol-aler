At least 129 Mexican inmates
escaped through a tunnel at a prison across from Eagle Pass,
 Texas , prompting local officials to alert the U.S. border patrol
and warn that the Zetas cartel organized the breakout.  The prison’s director and security chief were detained,
Coahuila’s state government said in a statement last night.
Alleged members of the Zetas gang tried to block authorities
from reaching the jail after the escape, triggering a firefight
that left four criminals dead, the state’s police chief, Jorge
Luis Moran, said in a radio interview today with Radio Formula.
Police lowered the number of fugitives to 129 from 132 out of a
population of about 730 inmates.  “The state’s combined police forces are carrying out
continued operations,” state prosecutor Hector Ramos said in an
interview on  Milenio TV  last night. “We’ve alerted U.S.
authorities, who deployed border patrol speed boats.”  The jail break took place in the city of Piedras Negras,
just across the Rio Grande River from Texas.  “We are aware of the prison break in  Mexico  and state law
enforcement remains in close contact with federal authorities
along the border to monitor the situation,” said Josh Havens,
deputy press secretary for Texas Governor  Rick Perry , in a
telephone interview from Austin.  It is the largest breakout since more than 140 inmates
escaped a jail in the northern border city of  Nuevo Laredo  in
2010, Milenio reported, prompting President Felipe Calderon to
criticize state-run penitentiaries today on his Twitter account.  ‘Deplorable,’ Mexico’s Challenge  “In the past six years, more than 1,000 prisoners have
escaped state jails. None have done so from federal prisons,”
Calderon wrote. “State justice institutions’ vulnerability must
be corrected,” he wrote in a separate tweet, calling
yesterday’s jail break “deplorable.”  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and Mexican Foreign
Minister Patricia Espinosa were set to meet today in  Washington 
at a security conference to discuss strategies for combating
organized crime, strengthening the rule of law and securing the
border.  The U.S. has provided Mexico with development aid and
crime-fighting assistance through a $1.6 billion program known
as the Merida Initiative.  “It’s emblematic of a challenge that Mexico needs to
overcome,”  Stephen Johnson , the director of the Americas
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, said in an interview. “At some point Mexico needs
to join the big leagues and be able to contain its prisoners,
process people through the penal system and make it work.”  Drug War  The country will open its first privately built prisons
this year as the war against drug gangs fills cells past
capacity. Federal facilities currently hold 22 percent more
inmates than the 180,000 they were designed to accommodate,
according to a May 2011 government report.  The state is offering 200,000 pesos ($15,627) for
information allowing the recapture of each prisoner. The
prisoners may have escaped through a tunnel dug in the carpentry
workshop, the state government said in its statement.  The 22.9-foot long (7 meter) and 3.9-foot-wide tunnel
allowed the “prisoners to break out one by one into an empty
lot,” the government said in yesterday’s statement. Some or all
of the prison authorities are suspected of involvement in the
escape, Moran, the police chief, said.  More than 47,000 people have been killed since President
 Felipe Calderon  deployed troops to fight drug cartels in
December 2006. In February, 37 inmates escaped a penitentiary in
Nuevo Leon state with the aid of prison guards and by sparking a
riot that left 44 prisoners dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
