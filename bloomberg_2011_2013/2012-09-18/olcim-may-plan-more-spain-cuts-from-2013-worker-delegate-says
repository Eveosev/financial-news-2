Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  may plan a deeper
restructuring of its business in  Spain  next year, according to a
representative for the cement maker’s workers in the country.  “I think that we´ll begin a new restructuring because we
keep losing money,” Daniel Garrido, a factory trade union
delegate, said in e-mailed responses to questions. The Swiss
firm’s plants are running at 50 percent capacity in Spain,
depending on the price of electricity, he said.  Holcim is in the midst of executing a plan to cut its
Spanish staff from 1,200 at the beginning of 2012 to 710 by the
end of the year, company spokesman  Peter Gysel  said. Holcim said
May 21 that it would halt production at two of five cement
plants, streamline its corporate structure and center
administration in  Madrid , in response to a 63 percent decline in
cement sales between 2007 and 2011.  Holcim has “no plans for further re-structuring for the
time being, and if the current macro-economic situation remains
stable,” Gysel said in an e-mailed response to questions. Gysel
declined to comment on Holcim’s Spanish capacity utilization.  Garrido, one of three worker representatives in Spain, sees
reduced hourly salaries and further plant capacity cuts as
measures Holcim could introduce from 2013.  Peter Fontana, Holcim’s chief executive officer, has taken
out a layer of top management in  Europe  to mirror cuts on the
factory floor, installing a new head of Europe on Sept. 1.
Previously, the region was split between three executive
committee members.  In recent years the Jona, Switzerland-based company has 
slashed staff numbers in Spain, where it has been present since
1980. The company employed 1,566 employees there in 2009, 1,333
in 2010 and 1,257 employees as of year-end 2011, according to
Holcim annual reports. The company produced 5.2 million metric
tons of cement capacity in the country as of the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
