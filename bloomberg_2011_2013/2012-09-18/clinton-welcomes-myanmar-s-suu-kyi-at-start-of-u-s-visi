Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
welcomed Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to the State
Department at the start of a U.S. visit.  In a brief appearance before reporters, the two women
talked about refugee resettlement. Suu Kyi, who last visited the
U.S. in the late 1980s, said she learned about developments in
America by “listening to the news in  Burma ,” the country’s
original name that is still used by opposition members and the
U.S. administration.  “It’s a place that is eagerly awaiting your welcome
because there’s so much excitement and enthusiasm about the fact
that you could actually come,” Clinton said. The two first met
when Clinton traveled to Myanmar in late November.  Suu Kyi, a former dissident and political prisoner, is in
 Washington  to receive a congressional medal of honor, and meet
with officials and activists. Lawmakers awarded her the medal,
Congress’ highest civilian honor, in absentia in 2008 while she
was under house arrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
