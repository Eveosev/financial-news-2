Nigeria ’s naira strengthened after
the central bank kept its benchmark  interest rates  at a record
high to support the currency and control inflation.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer gained as
much as 0.4 percent, before trading 0.1 percent stronger at
157.7 a dollar as of 4:46 p.m. on the  interbank market  in Lagos.
The naira has appreciated 2.9 percent this year, the third-best
performer in Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy makers, led by Central Bank of Nigeria Governor
Lamido Sanusi, held rates at 12 percent in a unanimous decision,
to curb price pressures and support the naira. All 11  economists
surveyed  by Bloomberg predicted the rate.  Measures taken at the last meeting to stabilize foreign
exchange and build reserves “were effective,” Sanusi told
reporters today in Abuja, the capital. “The moderation in
headline inflation has not been accompanied by a decline in  core
inflation ,” he said.  The central bank has kept its policy rate unchanged at 12
percent this year after raising it by 5.75 percentage points in
2011 to curb price pressures. Inflation slowed to 11.7 percent
in August from 12.8 percent in the previous month, the
statistics agency said on its website yesterday. The core
inflation rate, which excludes food prices, fell to 14.7 percent
in August from 15 percent in July, according to the statistics
office.  “The statement seems to express continued caution,”  Leon Myburgh , an Africa strategist at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg,
said in e-mailed comments today. “Capital inflows have
increased and are likely to stay in-country according to the
governor. This has added significantly to stabilizing the naira
and building CBN foreign exchange reserves.”  Reserves Rise  The West African nation’s  foreign-exchange reserves  rose to
a more than two-year high of $40.56 billion on Sept. 14,
according to data compiled by the central bank. Nigerian
benchmark  Bonny Light crude  has advanced 26 percent to $114.33
per barrel since a year low in June.  The yield on Nigeria’s 16 percent domestic bonds due June
2019 rose 25 basis points to 12.04 percent, according to today’s
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 were little changed at 4.75 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi fell for a third day, retreating 0.4 percent
to 1.9025 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
