The Reverend  Jesse Jackson  said he
had secured the release of two American citizens held in Gambia
after meeting with President Yahya Jammeh.  “They will be leaving with us thanks to the mercy of the
president, he has allowed them to go,” Jackson told reporters
yesterday in the capital of Banjul. Jackson said he appealed to
Jammeh, who has been in power since a 1994 coup, to extend his
moratorium on executions that was announced this month.  The two Americans being released into Jackson’s custody are
Tamsir Jassey, who is serving a 20-year sentence in connection
with an aborted coup against Jammeh in 2006, and Amadou Scattred
Janneh, a former Gambian information minister who was charged
with treason in 2011.  Gambia, a former British colony, is the smallest country in
mainland  Africa  with a population of about 1.8 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
