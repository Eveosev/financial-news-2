The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.2 percent to 677.21 at 4:57 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
declined 0.5 percent to 1,637.646.  CRUDE OIL  Oil extended its decline after the biggest drop in two
months on speculation that a slowing U.S. economy may curb fuel
demand.  Oil for October delivery fell as much as 64 cents to $95.98
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $96.05 at 3:30 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract slid $2.38 yesterday to $96.62, the lowest close since
Sept. 10. Prices are 2.8 percent lower this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
 Asia , rose $2.31, or 12 percent, to $21.63 a barrel at 10:01
a.m., according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
The spread is at the highest since April 15, 2011. Gasoil swaps
for October were unchanged at $132.80 a barrel, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 11
cents to $3.34 a barrel, PVM data showed. This shows reduced
losses from processing crude into the residue product. Fuel-oil
swaps for October fell $14, or 2 percent to $684.75 a metric
ton, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  Copper declined for a second day on concern that  China  may
not ease monetary policy as expected and that  Spain  may be
forced to ask for aid, risking slower global economic growth.  The metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.8
percent to $8,238 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange, and
traded at $8,258.50 by 2:33 p.m. Shanghai time. The January-
delivery contract fell 0.4 percent to 59,570  yuan  ($9,424) a ton
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Copper for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $3.7725
per pound on the Comex in  New York , extending yesterday’s 1.1
percent decline. On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel, and
tin declined.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was set to decline for a second day in London as a
rally to a six-month high spurred some investors to sell the
metal.  Gold reached $1,778 an ounce on Sept. 14, the highest since
Feb. 29, after the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of
quantitative easing to boost growth. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  this month gave details of a plan to buy
debts of  member states  and China approved infrastructure
spending plans.  Immediate-delivery bullion fell 0.3 percent to $1,756.80 an
ounce by 9:17 a.m. in London. December-delivery futures were
down 0.7 percent at $1,758.90 on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans declined to the lowest price in a month on signs
that a rally to a record may be slowing shipments from the U.S.
as the harvest progresses.  November-delivery soybeans fell as much as 1.1 percent to
$16.51 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the lowest level
for the most-active contract since Aug. 20, and traded at
$16.5175 at 3:10 p.m. in  Singapore . Futures peaked at $17.89 on
Sept. 4 as the worst U.S. drought in half a century cut yields.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.6 percent to $7.5275 a
bushel in Chicago, after slumping to the lowest intra-day price
since July 24. Wheat for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent
to $8.86 a bushel after tumbling 5 percent yesterday, the most
since January.  Rubber climbed to the highest level in almost 11 weeks on
speculation that Japan’s central bank will expand monetary
stimulus to rein in the Japanese currency’s strength, boosting
the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  February-delivery rubber gained as much as 1.9 percent to
259.5 yen a kilogram ($3,303 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest price since July 4. The most-
active contract traded at 258 yen at 1:22 p.m. Futures advanced
12 percent last week, the best gain since the period ended Jan.
20. The market was closed yesterday for a holiday.  Palm oil  dropped on speculation that rains in  South America 
will aid early soybean planting, easing concern that edible-oil
supplies are dwindling and driving down soybean prices in
Chicago by the most allowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
