Kazi Abdul Muktadir, Deputy
Governor of the  State Bank of Pakistan , comments on the
country’s interest rate outlook and growth.  Pakistan  cut  interest rates  to 10.5 percent from 12 percent
in August, seeking to bolster faltering growth with the first
reduction since 2011. Muktadir spoke to reporters on the
sidelines of a conference in Kuala Lumpur today.  On whether there’s room to further cut rates:  “We have to see when the time comes. We’ve had some
opportunities to cut rates in the past but we want to see how
those initiatives have functioned.”  On whether inflation or growth is a bigger concern:  “You have to find a balance between the two. You’ve got to
pick up a middle path. We’ll have to wait until the next
monetary policy (meeting) and we’ll sit down and decide on
that.”  On whether Pakistan needs to tap the  International Monetary Fund 
for further financial help:  “At the moment our remittances this year have been pretty
heavy. We’ve had record remittances and looking at our receipts
et cetera, there’s not been too much pressure on our balance of
payments. But going forward we’ve got to see how it is and
that’s when the government will be taking a decision on those
areas.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
