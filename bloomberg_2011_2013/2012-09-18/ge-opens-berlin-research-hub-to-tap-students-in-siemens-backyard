General Electric Co. (GE)  said it will
open a research center in Berlin to access university graduates
and be closer to political decision makers in the backyard of
competitor  Siemens AG. (SI)   GE expects sales in  Germany  to grow by a “double-digit”
percentage this year, according to Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco,
chief executive officer for GE’s European operation. While GE
was unable to close acquisitions in the country as planned, it
is still on the lookout for targets, he said at a press
conference in Garching near Munich today.  GE last year said it will pump 80 million euros ($104
million) into expanding its presence in Europe’s largest
economy, including the Garching research center. It’s launched
an advertising campaign with the slogan “We are the GE in
Germany.” Siemens, which competes against GE in energy, health
care, and industrial businesses, is headquartered in Munich and
Berlin, with Berlin featuring the company’s single largest
manufacturing site.  GE took market share in medical equipment from rivals
including Siemens, Royal Philips Electronics NV, and  Toshiba
Corp. (6502) , the company’s healthcare head Volker Wetekam said today.
GE has about 1,800 employees in its German health care business,
he said.  GE has hired 500 employees in Germany since last year, the
company today said. GE has about 7,000 employees in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
