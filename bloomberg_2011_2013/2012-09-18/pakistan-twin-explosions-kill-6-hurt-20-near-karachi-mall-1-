Six people were killed and 20 were
injured in twin explosions near a shopping mall in  Pakistan ’s
commercial capital of Karachi, according to the local
government.  “We heard two loud explosions at 7:30 p.m. and even on the
second floor the whole shopping center seemed to shake like an
earthquake,” said Shakir Shah, a store assistant at the Dolmen
Shopping Mall. “There was panic and everyone is rushing to
close their stores.”  Today’s bombing in Karachi comes at a time when the city,
home to the stock exchange and central bank, has seen three
straight days of violence by protesters demonstrating against an
anti-Islam film. Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s biggest
religious party, has called for traders to keep shops closed
tomorrow in protest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
