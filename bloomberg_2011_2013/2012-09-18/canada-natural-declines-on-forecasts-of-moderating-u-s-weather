Canadian natural gas advanced after
the U.S. Energy Department reported a smaller-than-normal gain
in inventories of the fuel.  October gas in Alberta  climbed 0.6 percent. The
department’s weekly stockpile report showed supplies expanded by
67 billion cubic feet during the week ended Sept. 14 to 3.496

 surplus  to the average declined to 8.6 percent from 9 percent a
week earlier.  “Injections have fallen short of the five-year average
build in 23 of the past 24 weeks,” Mike Tran, an analyst at
CIBC World Markets Corp. in  New York , said in a note to clients
today. “Although today’s injection was much more in line with
the magnitude of the builds that we’ve seen historically for
this time of year, it was still slightly lower than the seasonal
average build.”  Alberta  gas for October delivery rose 1.25 cents to
