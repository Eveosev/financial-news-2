Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the Indian wind
turbine maker that’s posted losses for three years, said it
asked bondholders for a four-month extension on redemptions of
$220.8 million of notes due next month.  The manufacturer said it proposed an Oct. 10 meeting with
holders of $200 million of zero-coupon  convertible bonds  and
$20.8 million of 7.5-percent convertible notes. It’s seeking to
delay payment of the bonds, due from Oct. 11 to Feb. 11,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  The postponement would be the second in less than six
months for the Pune-based company, which is suffering from
stiffer competition from overseas turbine makers as it struggles
to cope with debt built up from acquisitions.  Suzlon deferred $360 million of bond payments by 45 days to
July 27 and today said it’s exploring options including selling
“non-critical assets,” and issuing new shares or  debt .  “With these measures we remain fully confident of meeting
our obligations and preserving value for all our stakeholders,”
the company said in the statement.  “The request for an additional extension does not really
come as a surprise,” said Antoine Bourgault, a London-based
analyst with ISM Capital LLP. “Suzlon’s business model is
structurally challenged. Despite a growing order book the group
has yet to demonstrate any ability to generate free cashflow. We
recommend investors continue to avoid the bonds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
