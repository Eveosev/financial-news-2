Kemira Oyj (KRA1V)  Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Buechele said he’s working on a growth strategy for the
Finnish maker of water chemicals that will encompass
acquisitions as well as expansion in regional markets such as
 South America  and Asia.  Managers will pull together a plan by November and seek
approval from the board in March, Buechele told investors and
analysts gathered in London today. The strategy will then be
unveiled to the market in April.  Buechele is looking beyond a restructuring program he
announced in July that includes 600 jobcuts and a possible 14
site closures to save 60 million euros ($78 million) in costs.
The former  BASF SE (BAS)  executive is installing a new management
structure at Kemira, effective October, with four regional chief
executives empowered to run their respective areas.  “This is a sharpened strategy, not a completely new one,”
Buechele said. Bolt-on purchases will be pursued to gain a
presence in markets, though largers acquisitions are off the
agenda until the growth strategy is approved by the board, he
said.  Kemira’s targets include an earnings before interest and
taxes margin of 10 percent by 2014.  “There’s room for consolidation,” Buechele said. “We’re
intensively reviewing 14 sites. We’re taking that very
seriously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
