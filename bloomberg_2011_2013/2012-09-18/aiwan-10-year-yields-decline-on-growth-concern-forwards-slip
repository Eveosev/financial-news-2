Taiwan dollar forwards retreated
for a second day as declines in global equities deterred
investors from holding riskier assets. Bonds were little changed.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  index of shares snapped a seven-day rally
following a decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday.
Taiwan will report on Sept. 20 export orders fell 2 percent in
August from a year earlier, following a 4.4 percent slump in
July, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Risk-taking sentiment is weaker as everyone’s calmed down
after the QE3 announcement,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co., referring to the
third round of quantitative easing measures unveiled by the
 Federal Reserve  last week. “We’re back on looking at
fundamentals.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
NT$29.35 against the greenback, a second day of depreciation,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts are at a
0.4 percent premium to the NT$29.46 spot rate.  Government bonds  were little changed before the Ministry of
Finance sells NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 10-year securities
tomorrow. The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due
September 2022 was at 1.201 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The central bank, which has kept its  benchmark rate  at
1.875 percent since June 2011, will meet to review borrowing
costs on Sept. 20.  The currency has rallied 0.8 percent since Sept. 13, when
the Fed said it will start open-ended purchases of $40 billion
of mortgage debt per month, and hold  interest rates  near zero at
least through mid-2015.  The  overnight money-market rate  held at 0.388 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  -- Editors: Amit Prakash, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
