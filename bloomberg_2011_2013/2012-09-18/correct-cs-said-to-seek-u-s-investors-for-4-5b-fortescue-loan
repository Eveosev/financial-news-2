Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is targeting
U.S. institutional investors as it seeks to sell part of its
share of a $4.5 billion loan to  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
said a person familiar with the matter.  The lender plans to focus on marketing the five-year
secured debt to asset managers rather than other banks,
according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
the details are private. Fortescue’s loan package is
underwritten by Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase & Co., and will
refinance the miner’s existing bank facilities, the company said
in a statement today.  Fortescue is considering bringing in more banks to help
sub-underwrite the loan to spread the credit risk, according to
the person familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
