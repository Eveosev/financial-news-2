The Australian dollar declined
versus its U.S. peer after the central bank said the strength of
the currency and slowing Chinese growth are risks to the
economy, minutes from a Sept. 4 meeting showed.  The Aussie slid against the majority of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as the  Reserve Bank  of Australia minutes spurred
speculation the central bank may cut  interest rates  if
necessary. The New Zealand dollar gained versus most of its
peers after a Nikkei report speculated the  Bank of Japan (8301)  could
take steps to weaken the yen as soon as tomorrow.  “Australia’s dollar is lower after the RBA minutes show
the central bank’s proclivity for easing, which is nothing new,
but it has served as a reminder and resulted in other risk
currencies outperforming it, especially New Zealand’s dollar,”
 John Curran , a senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an
online foreign-exchange dealer, wrote to clients yesterday.  Australia’s dollar lost 0.2 percent to $1.0457 yesterday in
New York after earlier falling 0.6 percent. The Aussie rose to
$1.0625 on Sept. 14, the highest since March 20. It fell 0.1
percent to 82.42 yen after declining as much as 0.8 percent to
81.79.  The  New Zealand dollar  increased 0.1 percent to 82.72 U.S.
cents. The so-called kiwi gained 0.3 percent to 65.20 yen after
earlier falling as much as 0.5 percent.  The BOJ increased the size of a fund to buy assets such as
government debt by 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) to 45 trillion
yen in July, and has kept its target for overnight lending
between zero and 0.1 percent since October 2010.  The kiwi has strengthened 3.9 percent this year, the
biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation currencies on the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie has fallen
0.5 percent and the greenback is down 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
