Twitter Inc., the microblogging
service whose members can send 140-character messages to
followers, unveiled a new design for profile pages.  Users will now be able to upload a so-called header photo
that will appear above messages, known as tweets, that are
viewed on the companyâ€™s website or via apps for mobile devices,
San Francisco-based Twitter said on its design blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
