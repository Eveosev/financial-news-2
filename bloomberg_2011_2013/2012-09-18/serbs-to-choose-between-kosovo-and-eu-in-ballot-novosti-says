Serbia  may hold a referendum on
whether its former province of  Kosovo  should be recognized as
part of efforts to join the EU,  Vecernje Novosti  reported.  The referendum will be held if the EU makes the recognition
of Kosovo’s independence a specific condition for Serbia’s EU
membership, the newspaper said, citing people in the Serbian
government and President’s office it did not name.  Serbia last held a  referendum  in April 1998, when the
nation voted against any mediation of the international
community in resolving issues in Kosovo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
