Canada ’s dollar broke a two-day
slide against its U.S. peer after trading near a 13-month high
as a technical measure showed the currency dropped from levels
that suggested the rally was too high.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Canadian dollar
versus the  U.S. dollar  was 62 today after reaching 72.4 on Sept.
13. A reading above 70 indicates an asset may have rallied too
far, too quickly and may be due for a retracement. The Canadian
currency gained even as crude oil tumbled for a second day after
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia warned of slowing growth in  China ,
falling commodity prices and a global economy still “subject to
significant downside risks.”  The loonie faced “damaged risk sentiment” in the past 24
hours,  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed income
and currency strategy in Toronto at Royal  Bank of Canada , wrote
in a note to clients. “Yesterday’s late-day plunge in  oil
prices  was a starting point, followed by dovish RBA minutes.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, advanced 0.1 percentage point to
97.42 cents per U.S. dollar. It touched 96.33 on Sept. 14, the
strongest level since August 2011. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0265.  Crude-oil futures dipped 1.4 percent to $95.29 a barrel in
New York after tumbling 2.4 percent yesterday, including a $4
fall in three minutes before the expiry of October options
contracts. Oil is Canada’s largest export.  U.S. stocks declined for the second day, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  falling 0.1 percent.  Technical Analysis  Canada’s dollar may weaken to support levels at 98.01,
98.42 and C$1.0002, which will attract renewed buying, RBC’s
Davis wrote. That could push the loonie to re-test resistance at
96.34, with a close below that opening up 94.93 and 94.08. The
last time it approached those levels was July 2011. Resistance
and support refer to areas on a graph where orders may be
clustered.  “We are retaining our bearish view” on the U.S. dollar,
Davis said. “Not only are valuations at overbought levels, but
a bearish divergence is beginning to form.”  Canadian companies are likely to take advantage of a risk
appetite renewal among investors worldwide, pushing corporate
debt issuance toward a record high this year.  Royal Bank of Canada and  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , the first and
fourth largest underwriters of corporate debt this year,
estimate that Canadian companies and banks will raise C$20
billion ($20.5 billion) of bonds in the final four months of
2012.  Bonds Gain  Canadian  government bonds  advanced for a second day, with
the yield on the 10-year benchmark falling three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.92 percent. The 2.75 percent
security maturing in June 2022 rose 28 cents to C$107.38.  The Bank of Canada is auctioning C$1.4 billion of 30-year
bonds tomorrow at noon. Two previous sales of the same amount of
the securities this year yielded 2.41 percent in May and 2.79
percent in March. The yield on current 30-year bonds fell two
basis points to 2.49 percent.  The Canadian dollar fell earlier as the RBA issued minutes
of its Sept. 4 meeting that indicated growth slowing in China
and signaled that policy makers were monitoring weaker commodity
prices. RBA policy makers said that recent data on China’s
growth were “a touch weaker, and this had been accompanied by a
sharp decline in spot prices for  iron ore  and coking coal.”  China is the largest importer of oil and metals in the
world and one of Canada’s biggest trading partners.  “Market participants are concerned that there hasn’t been
a policy response from China,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency
strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in Toronto, said in a phone
interview. “With no policy response from China, does that mean
the commitment to engineer a soft landing from China is
waning?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
