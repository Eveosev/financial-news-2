Atlanta Falcons  running back
 Michael Turner  was arrested on charges of drunken driving early
today, hours after the National Football League team’s victory
over the Denver Broncos, police said.  Turner, 30, was stopped by Gwinnett County, Georgia, police
after being clocked in a black Audi R8 traveling 97 miles an
hour in a 65-mph zone, according to a police statement. After an
officer smelled alcohol coming from the driver, Turner was
arrested for DUI and speeding, according to police.  The driver identified himself to the officer as the
Falcons’ player, according to the police statement.  The Falcons said in a statement that the team was “aware
of the situation” and is “in the process of gathering
information,” declining to give further comment.  James “Bus” Cook, Turner’s agent, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the arrest.  Turner scored his 51st career touchdown in Atlanta’s 27-21
win over the  Denver Broncos  last night in the Georgia Dome.
Turner, who joined the Falcons in 2008 after four seasons with
the  San Diego Chargers , rushed for 1,340 yards and 11 touchdowns
last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
