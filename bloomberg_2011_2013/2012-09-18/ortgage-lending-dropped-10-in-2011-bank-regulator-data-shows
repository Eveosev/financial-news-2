Lending for mortgages dropped in
2011 as refinancings declined and many borrowers relied on loans
backed by the  Federal Housing Administration , according to bank
regulators’ 2011 data on housing loans.  “The total number of originated loans of all types and
purposes reported fell by about 780,000, or 10 percent, from
2010, in part because of a 13 percent decline in refinancings,”
the bank regulators said today in a release in Washington of
mortgage lending transactions in 2011 at 7,632 U.S. financial
institutions covered by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.  “Home purchase lending also fell, but by a more modest 5
percent,” last year, the regulators said.  The banking regulators’ data for 2011 cover a period in
which housing was deeply depressed and had not shown the
improvement in prices and sales that have occurred in 2012. The
group of banking regulators includes the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the  Federal Reserve , the  National Credit Union
Administration , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.  The 2011 data “reflect a continued heavy reliance on loans
backed by the Federal Housing Administration insurance that
began several years ago with the onset of problems in the
mortgage market,” the regulators said. The share of home
purchase mortgages by the FHA was 31 percent in 2011, up from 7
percent in 2007 although down for 36 percent in 2010.  Home purchase mortgages backed by the Veterans
Administration have risen to 8 percent in 2011 from 7 percent in
2010 and 3 percent in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
