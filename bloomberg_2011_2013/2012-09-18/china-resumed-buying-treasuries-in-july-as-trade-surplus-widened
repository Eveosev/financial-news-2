China , the biggest foreign owner of
 U.S. government debt , bought  Treasury securities  in July for the
first time in three months as the nation’s  trade surplus  with
the U.S. widened by the most on record.  The Asian country’s  holdings  increased by $2.6 billion, or
0.2 percent, to $1.15 trillion, U.S. Treasury Department data
released yesterday show. The total amount held is down 0.2
percent from 2011, when China reduced its ownership on an annual
basis for the first time since the data was made available in
2001.  China recorded a $29.4 billion trade surplus with the U.S.
in July, pushing the year-to-date amount to $174.4 billion,
Commerce Department data show. The trade deficit was a record
$295.4 billion last year. China increased its holdings of
Treasuries even as yields fell to record lows in July.  “The biggest misconception in the marketplace is that
Chinese buying of Treasuries has something to do with
Treasuries,” said Krishna Memani, director of fixed income at
OppenheimerFunds Inc. in  New York , who manages $70 billion.
“China buying Treasuries has everything to do with China’s
trade position relative to the U.S. It’s entirely trade
driven.”  The Obama administration said that China’s policies keep
its currency undervalued and produce an unfair advantage in
global trade. In its semi-annual report to Congress on exchange-
rate policies in May, the Treasury Department said that it will
continue to push for changes that yield greater exchange-rate
flexibility.  Currency Reserves  Treasuries fell for the first time in three days, with the
yield on the benchmark 10-year note rising two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, 1.83 percent as of 6:13 a.m. in  London .
The  yuan  rose 0.1 percent to close at 6.3120 per dollar.  The monthly changes in Chinese holdings of Treasuries
mirror a slowdown in the pace of growth in currency reserves,
which increased 1.9 percent to $3.24 trillion through the first
six months of 2012, compared with full-year gains of at least 12
percent in each year since 2001, according to People’s Bank of
China data.  “Part of the reason that China has been buying Treasuries
over the past several years is because they’ve been active in
their  currency markets  and need to put those dollars to work,”
said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research in
New York at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the  Federal Reserve . “They haven’t necessarily been
accumulating dollars to put to work.”  Japanese Holdings  The world’s most populous nation’s holdings of short-term
Treasury bills slipped 48 percent to $4.3 billion, the fewest
since April. At the same time its position in longer-term notes
and bonds rose 0.6 percent to $1.1453 trillion, the most since
April.  Japan , the second largest foreign lender to the U.S.,
increased its  holdings  $7 billion or 0.6 percent to $1.1171
trillion. China now holds $32.5 billion more in U.S. government
securities than Japan, the smallest gap since September 2008
when China overtook Japan as the U.S.’s largest creditor.  The Fed is the  largest holder  of U.S. government securities
with $1.65 trillion.  Foreign investors held $5.35 trillion of Treasuries in
July, an increase of 0.7 percent for the month and 6.9 percent
for the year, U.S. government data show.  Foreign investors held 50.4 percent of the $10.6 trillion
of outstanding marketable  U.S. debt  as of July, little changed
from the month before and from December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
