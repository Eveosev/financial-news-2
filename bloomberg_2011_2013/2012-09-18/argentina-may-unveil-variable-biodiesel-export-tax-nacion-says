The Argentine government may
announce tomorrow a variable tax rate linked to prices for
soybean biodiesel exports,  La Nacion  reported, citing non-
identified businessmen briefed on the matter by Trade Secretary
Guillermo Moreno.  Soybean biodiesel export taxes, currently 24 percent, will
range between 17 percent and 24 percent and be linked to soybean
prices, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. Argentine
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  may announce the new
rates tomorrow, La Nacion said.  Argentina is the world’s third-largest exporter of
soybeans. The U.S. and Brazil are the world’s first- and second-
largest soybean exporter, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
