Hungary’s forint weakened for a
second day as concern European leaders will struggle to contain
the debt crisis drove investors from riskier assets.  The currency of the European Union’s most indebted eastern
member depreciated 0.2 percent to 283.72 per euro by 5:01 p.m.
in Budapest, adding to a 0.7 percent retreat yesterday.  Rising yields may force  Spain  to seek assistance, European
Central Bank Governing Council member Luc Coene said yesterday.
Hungary will write to the  International Monetary Fund  by
tomorrow to present on what basis the cabinet is willing to
negotiate a bailout for the country,  Mihaly Varga , the
government’s chief negotiator, told reporters yesterday.  “The forint has weakened because of the worsening
international sentiment,” Zoltan Arokszallasi, a Budapest-based
economist at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today. “Pending any substantial developments on the IMF, the
currency may continue tracking global trends today.”  Hungary raised 55 billion forint ($253 million) selling
three-month Treasury bills at an auction today, 10 billion
forint more than planned, as financing costs declined. The
average accepted yield was 6.69 percent, down from 6.71 percent
at the last sale of that maturity on Sept. 11, according to
results from the Debt Management Agency on Bloomberg. Investors
bid for 103 billion forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
