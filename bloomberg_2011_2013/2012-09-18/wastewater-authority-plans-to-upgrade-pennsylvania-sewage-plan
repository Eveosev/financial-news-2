An eastern Pennsylvania wastewater
authority plans to spend half of an estimated $34 million in
project funds to reduce phosphate and nitrogen discharges of
treated sewage that makes its way to the Chesapeake Bay.  The Abington regional wastewater authority plans to upgrade
and expand the sewage treatment plant that serves the Clarks
Summit area to comply with the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s
mandate to help curb discharges in the Chesapeake Bay watershed
that can harm plants and wildlife.  Bids to build the project in phases may come as early as
Nov. 1 for construction that under EPA requirements must be
finished by October 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
