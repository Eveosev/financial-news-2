Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Harley-Davidson
Inc. (HOG)  led borrowers raising at least $16 billion in the busiest
day in more than a week for company bond sales in the U.S.  Novartis,  Europe ’s largest drugmaker by revenue, issued $2
billion in its first sale in more than two years and Milwaukee-
based Harley-Davidson offered $600 million of three-year notes
for the first time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales are the most since $20.6 billion on Sept. 10 and compare
with a daily average this year of $5.9 billion.  Borrowers are raising debt after central banks in the U.S.
and Europe took actions to stabilize the economy and curb bond
yields. Sales are now at the fastest pace on record for the
month, with issuance already exceeding September 2011 levels.  “We all expected September to be a very big month and this
is a follow-up to what we’ve seen over the past two weeks,”
Vincent Murray, head of the U.S. fixed-income syndicate at
Mizuho Securities USA in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “There’s opportunistic issuance going on.”  Yields on bonds from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers reached 3.772 percent yesterday, a record low,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master  index . The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures reached 241
basis points, or 2.41 percent, the lowest since June 2011.  Novartis Offering  Novartis sold $1.5 billion of 2.4 percent, 10-year
debentures to yield 68 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of 3.7 percent, 30-year bonds at a
relative yield of 80 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  The sale is the Basel, Switzerland-based company’s first
since March 2010, when it issued $5 billion in three parts,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley
managed today’s sale.  Harley-Davidson, the biggest U.S. motorcycle maker, sold
1.15 percent debentures at a spread of 85 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The company last issued debt in January,
selling $400 million of 2.7 percent, five-year notes, and has
not previously sold three-year debt, the data show.  Issuance this month totals at least $105 billion, more than
the $74.4 billion sold in all of September 2011, Bloomberg data
show.  ING Bank NV issued three-year fixed- and floating-rate
notes totaling $2 billion,  Duke Energy (DUK)  Corp. sold $650 million
of 4 percent, 30-year debt and  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  offered $350 million
of 3.25 percent bonds maturing in February 2023, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
