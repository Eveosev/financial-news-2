OAO Rosneft plans to boost refining
5.9 percent next year to 54 million metric tons of crude, the
press service for  Russia â€™s largest oil company said today.  The increase from an expected 51 million tons this year
will come as it modernizes plants, Rosneft said by e-mail.  The press service denied an earlier Interfax report about a
possible decline in processing next year that cited Konstantin
Rudyak, a refining development executive for the Moscow-based
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
