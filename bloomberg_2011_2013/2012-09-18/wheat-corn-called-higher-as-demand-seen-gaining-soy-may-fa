What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago, Dennis DeLaughter, a market analyst at VantageRM in
Houston, said by telephone today. The price fell 6.6 percent in
the previous two sessions, which may spur demand by users of the
grain, he said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
higher in Chicago, DeLaughter said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower,
DeLaughter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
