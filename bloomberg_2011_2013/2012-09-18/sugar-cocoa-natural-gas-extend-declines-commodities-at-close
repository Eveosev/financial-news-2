The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  slipped 1.3 percent to 670.13 in New
York, the lowest level since Sept. 5. Cocoa, sugar and natural
gas were among the largest decliners.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  fell 0.8 percent
to 1,633.343, the second straight drop.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures fell to a three-week low as projected
rainfall in  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the world’s biggest growers,
helped ease crop concerns.  Both countries will have an increase in precipitation
starting tomorrow and through the end of the week,  Drew Lerner ,
an agriculture meteorologist and president of World Weather
Inc., said in a telephone interview today. The nations accounted
for 69 percent of the world’s supplies last season, according to
the International Cocoa Organization in  London .  Cocoa for December delivery dropped 2 percent to close at
$2,532 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
touching $2,519, the lowest since Aug. 29. Prices touched a 10
month high of $2,707 on Sept. 6, partly on concern that dry
weather would erode crop prospects.  Sugar fell the most in four weeks on signs that farmers are
speeding up the cane harvest in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer. Coffee and cotton rose, while orange juice dropped.  ICE raw sugar for March delivery declined 3 percent to
close at 20.15 cents a pound, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Aug. 21.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery climbed 1.1
percent to $1.775 a pound in  New York .  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to
76.02 cents a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery slid 2 percent
to $1.265 a pound.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures declined for a fourth day in New York
as forecasts for moderating weather signaled reduced fuel
demand.  Gas for October delivery fell 9.2 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$2.773 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since Sept. 7. Prices
have declined 7.2 percent this year.  CRUDE OIL  Oil declined to a two-week low as  Saudi Arabia  was said to
be taking action to lower prices and after  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  reduced
its profit outlook, increasing concern that an economic slowdown
will curb demand.  Oil for October delivery slid $1.33, or 1.4 percent, to
$95.29 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since Aug.
30. The two-day decline was 3.7 percent. Prices are down 3.6
percent this year.  Brent crude  for November settlement fell $1.76, or 1.5
percent, to $112.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. It dropped 2.5 percent yesterday.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid to a six-week low on speculation that
stockpiles rose and amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
slow the global economy and fuel demand.  October-delivery gasoline fell 4.43 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to settle at $2.899 a gallon on the Nymex.  Heating oil for October delivery fell 3.63 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.1271 a gallon on the exchange, the lowest
settlement since Sept. 5.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat fell in its worst two-day loss in eight weeks as
precipitation in the southern U.S. Great Plains boosts prospects
for winter planting. Soybeans fell to a four-week low on rain in
the U.S. and  South America  while corn fell to the cheapest in
two months as the U.S. harvest accelerated.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for December delivery
dropped 1.7 percent to settle at $8.635 a bushel. The price has
plunged 6.6 percent in the past two days, the worst two-session
loss since July 24.  CBOT soybean futures for November delivery fell 1.7 percent
to close at $16.40 a bushel after falling to $16.305, the lowest
level for a most-active contract since Aug. 17. The oilseed has
gained 36 percent this year after a drought hurt U.S. crops.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 1.1 percent to
$7.40 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, prices fell to $7.39, the
lowest level since July 13.  BASE METALS  Copper rose in London as a report showing U.S. homebuilder
confidence at the highest level in more than six years signaled
stronger demand for the metal.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.2 percent to settle at $8,319 a metric ton
($3.77 a pound).  Copper futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
settle at $3.787 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Nickel and aluminum declined in London, while lead and zinc
rose. Tin was unchanged.  PRECIOUS METALS  Platinum futures fell for the second straight day as a six-
week labor dispute at a  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  mine may end, easing supply
concerns in  South Africa , the world’s top producer. Gold gained.  Nymex platinum futures for October delivery declined 2.2
percent to settle at $1,636.30. Yesterday, the price dropped 2.4
percent. Since the start of the strike on Aug. 10, the commodity

active contract since Aug. 30.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 60 cents to
$1,771.20 an ounce on the Comex.  Comex silver futures for December delivery rose 1 percent
to $34.718 an ounce.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures jumped to the highest price in almost two weeks
on signs that U.S. pork processors are stepping up animal
purchases. Cattle also gained.  On the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, December hog futures
advanced 1.2 percent to settle at 74.2 cents a pound, after
touching 74.475 cents, the highest level since Sept. 5 for the
most-active contract.  Cattle futures for delivery in December climbed 0.4 percent
to settle at $1.28875 a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 6.1
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.3
