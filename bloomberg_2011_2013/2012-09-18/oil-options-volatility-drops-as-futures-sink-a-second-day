Crude oil options volatility fell
as underlying futures tumbled a second straight day.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 32.15 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , down
from 32.2 percent yesterday. The eight most-active options in
electronic trading were calls.  Crude oil for November delivery fell $1.33, or 1.4 percent,
to settle at $95.62 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $130 calls, which fell 2 cents to 30 cents a barrel at
4:07 p.m. with 3,608 lots trading. November $135 calls were the
second-most active, with 2,764 lots changing hands as they
declined 1 cent to 7 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 61 percent of the 55,638 contracts in
electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude
oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would rise
accounted for 50.4 percent of the 117,275 contracts traded.  December $130 calls were the most actively traded options
with 5,945 lots changing hands. They fell 5 cents to 32 cents a
barrel. December $75 puts advanced 8 cents to 32 cents on volume
of 4,476.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
45,507 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 44,525 lots
and December $100 calls with 42,357.  To contact the reporter on this story:
