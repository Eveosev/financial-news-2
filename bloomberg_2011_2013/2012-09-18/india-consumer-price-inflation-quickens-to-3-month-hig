Indian consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in three months in August as costs of vegetables
and sugar increased.  The  consumer-price index  climbed 10.03 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 9.86 percent advance reported earlier
for July, the Statistics Office said in New Delhi today.  The  Reserve Bank of India  kept  interest rates  unchanged
yesterday to damp inflation risks from a drop in the rupee and a
below-average monsoon that threatens to crimp farm output. At
the same time, it cut the amount of deposits banks must set
aside as reserves to support lending following the government’s
biggest push to revive growth since 2009.  “Inflation remains an overriding concern despite the
government’s policy initiatives,” Sujan Hajra, a Mumbai-based
economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd., said before
the release. “The  Reserve Bank  will ease liquidity through
buying bonds and cutting the  cash reserve ratio  rather than
cutting policy rates.”  The rupee, which has tumbled about 12 percent against the
dollar in the past 12 months, fell 0.5 percent to 54.305 per
dollar at 11:19 a.m. in Mumbai. The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
eased 0.1 percent, while the yield on the 8.15 percent
government bond due June 2022 rose one basis point to 8.17
percent from 8.16 percent before the data release.  Vegetable prices climbed 20.79 percent last month from a
year earlier, today’s statement showed. Sugar rose 17.51 percent,
while pulses gained 16.04 percent.  India boosted diesel tariffs last week to pare its fiscal
deficit and allowed more foreign investment in the economy, the
most extensive policy overhaul of Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s previously gridlocked second term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
