Los Angeles  should raise the
 retirement age  for new city employees to 65 from 55 to help save
as much as $4.3 billion over 30 years, the city administrator
said.  Miguel Santana , the chief administrative officer who raised
the specter of bankruptcy in April, said the changes, including
a limit on pension income to 75 percent of wages, would help
“ensure fiscal stability” in the second most-populous U.S.
city.  Los Angeles has been spending more than it takes in for 10
consecutive years and almost ran out of cash in 2010 when its
municipal utility withheld money. Many of the recommendations
mirror state changes signed into law last week by California
Governor  Jerry Brown . Those revisions didn’t affect the city of
3.8 million, which has a greater degree of local control under
its city charter.  “The city is not alone in considering a new retirement
tier for new hires,” Santana, 43, said today in a report to
Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa  and the City Council. “Several major
public sector entities in California and across the nation have
either implemented or are in the process of implementing
significant pension reforms for new hires.”  While Los Angeles has reduced its workforce and increased
employee health-care contributions, the city remains in a
“dire” fiscal situation, Santana said.  Employee retirement costs are projected to increase $154
million, or 45 percent, by June 2017, he said. That sum is
enough to hire 770 police officers or firefighters, buy 11
helicopters or fill 7.3 million potholes, Santana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
