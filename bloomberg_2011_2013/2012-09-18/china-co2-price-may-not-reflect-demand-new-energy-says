The first carbon-dioxide price
reported in  China ’s Guangdong province at 60  yuan  ($9.50) a
metric ton is probably coordinated by government and may not
reflect demand and supply, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Four Chinese cement makers bought 1.3 million tons of
emission permits for the new carbon market at the price, the
21st Century Business Herald reported today. European Union
carbon was today at 7.51 euros ($9.81) a ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London as of 3:04 p.m.  “The price of 60 yuan a ton is negotiated between local
government and the buyers, and does not reflect any supply and
demand fundamentals,” Charlie Cao, an analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in Beijing, said today.  “The emitters with potential capacity expansion plans need
to purchase carbon credits to obtain project approval,” he said
in an e-mailed note.  The cement companies plan to add about 25 million tons of
annual production capacity, which will emit 13 million tons of
carbon, the newspaper said in a report on its website. About 90
percent of the carbon-dioxide emissions will be covered by free
quotas handed out by the government, with the companies needing
to pay for the remaining 10 percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
