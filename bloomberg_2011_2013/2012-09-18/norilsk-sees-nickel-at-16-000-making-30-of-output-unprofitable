Nickel prices at about $16,000 a
metric ton would make 30 percent of global output of the metal
unprofitable, according to Moscow-based OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel ,
the biggest producer.  At $15,000 a ton, 45 percent of output would be
unprofitable, the company’s press service said today by e-mail,
citing Yuri Sobolev, sales director.  Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange, a global benchmark, averaged about $15,763 a ton last
month. The metal, down 4.7 percent this year, fell 2.2 percent
to $17,815 by 4:47 p.m. local time, after rallying to $18,236
yesterday, the highest price in more than four months.  Global demand for nickel and copper increased 3 to 4
percent in the first eight months of the year, according to
Sobolev. The company’s earlier forecast for the whole year was
for a 1 to 2 percent increase.  Palladium demand rose 5 percent in January through August,
in line with Norilsk’s expectations, according to Sobolev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
