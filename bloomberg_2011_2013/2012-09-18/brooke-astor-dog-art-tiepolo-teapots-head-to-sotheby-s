Philanthropist Brooke Astor’s
lacquered Japanese cabinets, Louis XV clocks and porcelain tea
sets are heading to the auction block at Sotheby’s on Sept. 24
and 25.  The sale “Property From the Estate of Brooke Astor”
includes more than 900 lots from her Park Avenue duplex and her
Westchester mansion, Holly Hill.  Expected to tally as much as $9.7 million, the proceeds
will benefit Astor’s favorite charities, including the
 Metropolitan Museum  of Art, the  New York Public Library , the
 Animal Medical Center  and  New York  schools. Astor died in 2007
at the age of 105.  Estimates range from a small leather jewelry case, valued
between $80 and $120, to a Tiepolo drawing for $300,000 to
$400,000.  “There are so many small objects that are hopefully
affordable for people,” said Philip Marshall, Astor’s grandson,
in a telephone interview. “They were just as important to her
as her expensive paintings.”  Among the highlights are animal figurines and dog
paintings, many of which hung salon-style along the spiral
stairwell in Holly Hill.  “There were dog statues and paintings all over the
place,” said Marshall. A 19th-century painting of a King
Charles spaniel, holding a red slipper in its teeth, is valued
between $2,000 and $4,000.  Many Teapots  The sale also includes lots of teapots. A group of four
18th-century Chinese pots is expected to bring $2,000 to $3,000.
A mahogany tea table in the style of George III is valued
between $300 and $400.  “She just loved having tea with people in the afternoon,”
Marshall said.  In 1953, she married Vincent Astor, the oldest son of
millionaire John Jacob Astor IV, who died on the Titanic in
1912. An expressionistic portrait of Vincent Astor as a young
lieutenant has an estimate of $600 to $800.  As a child, Astor lived with her parents in  China , and
Asian art remained a passion throughout her life. She financed
the replication of a Ming dynasty garden court at the
 Metropolitan Museum of Art . The Sotheby’s sale includes a
Qianlong-period gilt bronze lion clock stand, estimated at
$180,000 to $220,000 and a pair of 18th-century famille-rose
porcelain vases, valued at $80,000 to $120,000.  Diamond Necklace  A fixture in New York society, Astor was known for her
jewels. A Bulgari diamond necklace featuring 13 emerald drops is
estimated between $250,000 and $350,000; the auction catalog has
a photograph of Astor wearing the necklace while standing next
to President  Lyndon B. Johnson  at a Plaza Hotel dinner dance.  A pair of 18-karat gold, platinum and diamond double-heart
ear clips by  Van Cleef & Arpels (CFR)  is valued at $4,000 to $6,000.
Her French gold and ruby bracelet is $5,000 to $7,000.  All those things were “part of her lifestyle,” Marshall
said. “They bring back so many memories.”  Muse highlights include  Martin Gayford  on art,  James S.
Russell  on architecture.  To contact the reporters of this story:
