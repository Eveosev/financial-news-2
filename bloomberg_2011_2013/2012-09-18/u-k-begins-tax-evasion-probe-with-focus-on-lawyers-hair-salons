U.K. began a crackdown on  tax
evasion , including among London lawyers, which it expects to
bring in 19.5 million pounds ($32 million).  HM Revenue & Customs  task forces starting today will focus
on five “high risk” business areas in an effort to flush out
tax evaders, the authority said in a press release. The Scottish
motor trade and retail businesses in four U.K. regions are being
targeted in the latest project, the agency said.  “This is not an empty threat -- HMRC can and will track
you down if you choose to break the rules,” said  Mike Eland ,
the agency’s enforcement and compliance chief.  The task forces were introduced following a 917 million-
pound government investment that began in 2011 to take on tax
evasion, avoidance and fraud. The authority said it intends to
raise 7 billion pounds each year by 2015 from the project.  Restaurants in southeast  England  and hair and beauty salons
in the northeast of the country are also under scrutiny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
