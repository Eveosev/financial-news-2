Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (LPX) , the
largest U.S. producer of a lumber look-alike used in houses and
furniture, fell the most in seven weeks after a competitor
announced it would open a new plant.  Louisiana-Pacific, based in Nashville,  Tennessee , dropped
6.1 percent to $13.49 in New York, the biggest decline since
July 31.  Closely held Georgia-Pacific LLC will ramp up production at
its oriented-strand board facility in Clarendon County, South
Carolina, in the first quarter of 2013, the Atlanta-based
company said in a statement today.  Georgia-Pacific is owned by Koch Industries Inc. It will
spend $30 million to complete the Clarendon County factory,
which it acquired in 2010 for $400 million in a deal that
included a similar plant in Allendale,  South Carolina , and other
facilities, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
