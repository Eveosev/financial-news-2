     Sept. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Dana Gas PJSC, the fuel producer
with $1 billion in Islamic bonds maturing in October, may reach
a “reasonable resolution with investors” on the sukuk, the
president of the company’s biggest shareholder said.  “I am very optimistic about the professionalism of Dana
Gas management to reach a reasonable resolution with
investors,” Crescent Petroleum Co.’s President Badr Jafar told
reporters in Dubai today. “Discussions are ongoing with  Egypt 
regarding scheduling payments.”  Dana Gas has appointed Deutsche Bank AG, Blackstone Group
LP and Latham & Watkins LLP to advise on the sukuk. Bondholders
of the Islamic debt hired London-based  law firm  Linklaters LLP
to negotiate a restructuring, three people familiar with the
matter said in May. The sukuk is secured against the company’s
Egyptian assets as well as Sajaa Gas Private Ltd. and United Gas
Transmissions Co., part of a venture to supply Iranian gas to
the  United Arab Emirates  that is yet to start.  Crescent Petroleum holds a 20.1 percent stake in Dana Gas,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
