Egypt  created a union to represent
the country’s housemaids, the first legal body to regulate
female domestic workers, in a bid to bring informal workers into
the regulated economy.  The union was registered at the labor ministry earlier this
month with an initial 300 members after a request from the
Egyptian Association for Community Participation Enhancement,
according to Abdel Moneim Mansour, the group’s director.  The union will set rules to regulate the working
relationship between maids and their employers, Mansour said by
phone today. Egypt’s Labor Code leaves domestic service workers
outside the scope of any legal protection, leaving them
vulnerable to abuse, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
