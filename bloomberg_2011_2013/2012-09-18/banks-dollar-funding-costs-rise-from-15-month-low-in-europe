The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose from the lowest level in more than 15
months, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 22 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:14 a.m. in
 London  from minus 19 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The swap has risen from minus 17 on Sept. 14, the
cheapest since June 14, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 27 basis points, or 0.255
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 25 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose from the lowest since June 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, the
Euribor-OIS spread, was 16.7 basis points from 16 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.089
percent yesterday from 0.095 percent on Sept. 14. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 8.1 basis points compared with 8.6
yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 306 billion euros ($401 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 335 billion euros on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
