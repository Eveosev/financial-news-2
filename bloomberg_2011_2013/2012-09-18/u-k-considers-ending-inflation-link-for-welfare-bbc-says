The U.K. government is considering
ending the automatic increase in welfare payments in line with
inflation,  the BBC said , citing unnamed people close to the
negotiations.  With wages rising more slowly than inflation as the economy
struggles to emerge from its double-dip recession, linking
welfare payments to average pay rises would have saved 14
billion pounds ($23 billion) since 2008, the  BBC  said, citing
internal government estimates.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has told Work
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to find an extra 10
billion pounds of savings from his budget if other departments
are to avoid cuts, the BBC said.  Another option would be to freeze almost all welfare
payments for 12 months, saving 7 billion pounds in a single
year, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
