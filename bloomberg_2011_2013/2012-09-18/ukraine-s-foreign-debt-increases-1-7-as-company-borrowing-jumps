Ukraine’s foreign debt advanced in
the second quarter as corporate borrowing increased, the central
bank said.  Gross foreign debt rose 1.65 percent to $129 billion on
July 1 from $126.9 billion on April 1, the  Natsionalnyi Bank
Ukrainy , based in the capital, Kiev, said today on its website.
That’s equal to 74 percent of gross domestic product, it said.  State foreign debt declined 7.4 percent to $23.9 billion,
while corporate debt rose 6.7 percent, according to the data.
More than 72 percent of the total was denominated in dollars,
with $56.8 billion due for repayment in the next year, according
to the statement.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Alan Crosby  To contact the reporter on this story:
