OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, approved an additional dividend of 4.08 rubles a
share, boosting the payout to 25 percent of last year’s profit
on the orders of President  Vladimir Putin .  State-run Rosneft will more than double the total dividend
for 2011 to 7.53 rubles a share, or 79.8 billion rubles ($2.6
billion) in total, the Moscow-based company said today in a
regulatory filing after a board meeting yesterday. The company
in April approved a 3.45-ruble payout.  Russia’s government signed a directive this month allowing
Rosneft to raise dividends to 25 percent of net income from 11.5
percent. It’s seeking to bolster funds at the company’s majority
shareholder Rosneftegaz, which may bid for energy assets as the
state sells off businesses, according to Putin.  The president called on Rosneft Chief Executive Officer
 Igor Sechin  to increase the dividend on June 15. Sechin is also
board chairman at Rosneftegaz.  Rosneft shareholders will meet Nov. 30 in Khabarovsk,
eastern Russia, to approve the additional dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
