Energoprojekt Holding AD (ENHL) , a Serbian
construction and energy group, forecasts 359 million euros ($469
million) worth of new contracts this year, which may help it
exceed its full year sales target.  The Belgrade-based company will have new contracts worth
279 million euros in the second half, including 170 million
euros in Africa,  Middle East , Asia and other foreign markets,
after securing deals totalling 80 million euros in the first six
months, Chief Financial Officer Dimitraki Zipovski said at a
presentation in Belgrade today.  “We hoped for 350 million euros in new contracts, so it’ll
be slightly above the target, despite the intensifying
competition on the emerging markets” Zipovski said. “The
crisis in Europe has made many of our competitors turn more to
 Asia  and Africa, it’s become quite crowded there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
