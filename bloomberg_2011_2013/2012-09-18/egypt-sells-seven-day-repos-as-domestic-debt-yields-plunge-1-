Egypt sold 10 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  as plunging yields
on  government securities  signal pressure on central bank funding
is easing.  The regulator received 11.4 billion pounds in bids for the
one-week repos. The repo contracts allow government-security
holders access to funds at an annual rate of 9.75 percent,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg.  The average yield on  nine-month treasury bills  tumbled 140
basis points, or 1.4 percentage point, to 14.47 percent at an
auction this week.  Repo offerings climbed as high as 38 billion pounds in June
as banks wary of political unrest leading up to that month’s
presidential election grew more conservative, pushing the
government’s borrowing costs to near-record levels. The
offerings fell to as low as 6 billion pounds as political
stability returned with the swearing in of President Mohamed
Mursi and the signing of foreign aid agreements. The government
aims to raise a record 175 billion pounds by auctioning debt
this quarter.  The yield on the nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds
maturing in 2020 advanced a fourth day, climbing 13 basis basis
points to 5.47 percent at 5:44 p.m. in Cairo, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest level on a
closing basis in almost two weeks.  The pound, subject to a managed float, was little changed
at 6.0873 a dollar.  Egypt  started the funding facility in March 2011 to address
banks’ concerns about liquidity as foreign investors pulled out
of local debt following the nation’s popular uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
