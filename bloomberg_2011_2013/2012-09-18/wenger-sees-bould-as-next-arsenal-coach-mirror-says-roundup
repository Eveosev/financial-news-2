The following is a roundup of
soccer stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the
Web.  Bould Remark  Arsenal coach  Arsene Wenger  said his assistant Steve Bould
could replace him when the Frenchman eventually leaves,  the
Daily Mirror  reported.  “But of course, one day, why not? I think he has the
qualities,” Wenger was quoted as saying.  Bould is in charge for Arsenal’s Champions League game at
Montpellier today because Wenger is suspended, the Mirror said.  Walcott Contract  Wenger said he’s still hopeful that Theo Walcott will sign
a new contract,  the Daily Mirror  reported.  Walcott has not started the last three games and got a
mixed reception from fans when he entered as a substitute
against Southampton on Sept. 15, the Mirror said.  City’s Ferrari  Manchester City coach  Roberto Mancini  said the team is a
contender to win the Champions League,  the Sun  reported.  “We used to drive a Fiat Cinquecento and it is not so easy
but now we drive a Ferrari,” Mancini was quoted as saying.
City’s starts the competition at Real Madrid today.  Torres Return  Former Liverpool director  Damien Comolli  considered signing
 Fernando Torres  from Chelsea a year after the striker left
Anfield,  the Daily Mail  reported.  In February, as Torres was racking up a 25-hour stint on
the field without scoring, Comolli discussed the idea with a
“prominent” Liverpool team member, the Mail said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
