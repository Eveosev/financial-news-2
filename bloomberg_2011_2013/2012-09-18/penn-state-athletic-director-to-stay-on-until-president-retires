Acting Athletic Director Dave Joyner will have a job at least
until President  Rodney Erickson  retires in June of 2013 or 2014,
Erickson said.  “I think Dave is doing an excellent job for us, and my
intent would be to keep Dave on as long as I serve,” Erickson
said yesterday in an interview in  New York .  Erickson said he expects the school’s next president to
conduct a national search for an athletic director, which was
suggested in a report by former  Federal Bureau  of Investigation
Director  Louis Freeh  in the aftermath of a child sex scandal
that led to the ouster of former university president  Graham
Spanier  and legendary football coach  Joe Paterno .  “I think it’s appropriate for the next president to make
that choice,” Erickson, 65, said.  Joyner  replaced Tim Curley in November 2011 after the
former athletic director was charged with perjury for lying
about his knowledge of child molestation involving former
football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Curley has denied the
charge.  The school was fined $60 million by the  National Collegiate
Athletic Association  after the scandal. The football program was
banned from bowl appearances for four years and lost 20
scholarships a year for four years.  Former Player  Joyner, 62, who has said he is interested in keeping the
job full time, played offensive tackle for Penn State from 1969-
1971, earning first-team All-American honors his senior season.
He also wrestled from 1970-72, again earning All-American honors
and finishing as the NCAA runner-up in the heavyweight division
in 1971.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in science in 1972 and his
M.D. from  Penn State ’s College of Medicine in 1976. He founded
Joyner SportsMedicine Institute in 1992, eventually developing
19 physical therapy centers in eight states. He was the U.S.
Olympic Committee’s head physician at the 1992 Olympic Winter
games, the 1991 World University Games and the 1989 United
States Olympic Festival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
