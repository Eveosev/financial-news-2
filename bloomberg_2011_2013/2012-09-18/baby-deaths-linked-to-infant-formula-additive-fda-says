Seven babies died after being fed
an additive used to help thicken infant formula or breast milk,
U.S. regulators said.  The deaths were among 21 premature infants and one born
full-term that developed inflamed intestines after they were
given SimplyThick, the  Food and Drug Administration  said in a
 consumer update  today. The product is a thickening gel designed
to help premature babies swallow food and keep it down, said
Benson Silverman, director of FDA’s Infant Formula and Medical
Foods Staff.  The agency first warned in May 2011 against feeding
SimplyThick to premature babies because it may cause a tissue
inflammation known as necrotizing enterocolitis. The FDA is
expanding the warning today to infants of all ages. Further
study is needed to determine if a link between SimplyThick and
the condition exists, FDA said.  The product, made by the company SimplyThick LLC of  St.
Louis , is available to consumers and at medical centers,
according to the FDA. It is sold in individual serving packets
and in 64-ounce dispenser bottles, which can be purchased from
distributors and pharmacies. A phone message left at SimplyThick
wasn’t returned.  Older children and adults use the product to help with
swallowing problems caused by trauma to the throat, Silverman
said in the update.  To contact the reporter on this story:
