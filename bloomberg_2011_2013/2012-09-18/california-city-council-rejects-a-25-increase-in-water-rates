A city council in northern
 California  unanimously rejected a 25 percent increase in water
rates over the next five years, saying Sonoma hadn’t considered
options including consolidating services with water agencies to
cut costs, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported.  Public Works director Milenka Bates told the council last
night that without the rate increases, Sonoma would have to
defer projects and “fix things as they break,” the newspaper
said.  The city’s public works department had sought at least a 5
percent annual rate increase for five years to help offset a
projected water budget deficit and pay for infrastructure
improvements such as replacing aging wells. The city buys 95
percent of its water from the Sonoma County Water Agency, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
