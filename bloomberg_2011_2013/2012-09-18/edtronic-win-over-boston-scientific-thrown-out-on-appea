Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  must try again to
prove that it didn’t infringe two patents controlled by Boston
Scientific Corp. over implantable defibrillators, a U.S. appeals
court said today.  U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
erred in her analysis of the patents owned by Mirowski Family
Ventures and licensed to Boston Scientific, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an  opinion  posted on its
website. The judge also improperly placed the burden on Mirowski
to prove infringement when it was Medtronic that filed the suit,
the appeals court said.  Medtronic has a license to the two patents, and sued in
2007 seeking a ruling that would clear it of having to pay
royalties on them, said Christopher Garland, a spokesman for
Minneapolis-based Medtronic. The patents have since expired, he
said.  Robinson had upheld the validity of the patents and said
there was no infringement. The Federal Circuit vacated both of
those findings and remanded the case for further procedures.  “We are reviewing the decision and considering possible
further appellate review before returning to the trial court for
a new trial,” Garland said.  The case is Medtronic Inc. v.  Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) ,
11-1313, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
( Washington ). The lower court case is Medtronic Inc. v. Boston
Scientific Corp., 07cv823, U.S. District Court for the District
of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
