Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose for a second straight day as European sovereign-
debt concern curbed demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The  extra yield  investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries increased four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 117 basis points at 2:52 p.m. in Lima,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  European Central Bank Governing Council member Luc Coene
said yesterday that rising bond yields may force Spain to seek
assistance and submit to ECB conditions for aid.  Coene’s comments “brought people’s attention back to
Europe” and may have spurred “short-term profit-taking after
QE,” said Kenneth Lam, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  New
York , referring to the  Federal Reserve ’s third round of asset
purchases known as quantitative easing announced Sept. 13.  The sol was little changed at 2.6020 per dollar, according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Peru’s central bank said on
its website that it bought $40 million in the spot currency
market today and paid an average 2.6026 soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
