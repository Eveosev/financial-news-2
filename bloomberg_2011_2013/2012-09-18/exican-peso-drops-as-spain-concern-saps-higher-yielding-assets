Mexico’s peso declined for a second
day as concern  Spain  will need outside financial aid damped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 12.7962 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. The currency pared its rally this year
to 8.9 percent, still the biggest among the greenback’s 16 most-
traded counterparts.  The currency is falling on a “bit more risk aversion due
to Spain,” Roberto Galvan, a currency trader at Intercam Casa
de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico City. The prospect of
Spain requiring assistance “generates some pressures.”  Rising bond yields may force Spain to submit to European
Central Bank conditions for aid, ECB Governing Council member
Luc Coene said yesterday in  London . The country will consider a
rescue to reduce borrowing costs if conditions are acceptable,
Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said
today in an interview with Telecinco.  Concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis may slow the global
economic recovery helped make the peso Latin America’s worst-
performing major currency last year.  Yields on Mexico’s local currency bonds due in 2024 dropped
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.66 percent
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
increased 0.43 centavo to 138.29 centavos per peso.  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos of 28-day Cetes and 8
billion pesos of the 91-day securities offered today, the
central bank said on its website. The government also sold all 9
billion pesos in 182-day bills and 9.5 billion pesos of the 364-
day notes it auctioned, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
