Billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s
voting share in  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  increased to 60.6 percent
from 50.4 percent after one of the company’s founders converted
his stock to ordinary shares, Interfax said.  Mail.ru co-founder Gregory Finger converted his 12 million
shares of so-called A-grade stock to ordinary shares, resulting

Mail.ru.  New Media and Technology Investment and Ardoe Finance Ltd.
now have 32.66 percent and 27.96 percent of Mail.ru voting
