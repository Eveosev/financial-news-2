Promotora y Operadora de
Infraestructura SAB , Mexico’s fourth-largest infrastructure
company by sales, will carry out plans to raise about 5 billion
pesos ($391 million) through a share sale in early October,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Pinfra said in a prospectus filed in May that it will offer
as much as 61.2 million shares to the public before the
overallotment option for underwriters to buy shares. The so-
called greenshoe would push the sale to as many as 70.4 million
shares, valued at about 5 billion pesos based on current prices
of existing shares.  The deal is part of a wave of potential share sales poised
to follow  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s more than $4 billion offering of
stock in its Mexican unit, set to price on Sept. 25.  Mexichem
SAB’s (MEXCHEM*)  shareholders at a meeting today approved a plan to sell
about $1 billion of new stock in the chemical company controlled
by billionaire Antonio del Valle, Enrique Ortega, director of
strategic planning and investor relations, said by phone.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB are managing the sale, according to the
prospectus. Pinfra will use the money to finance projects, pay
debt and possibly make acquisitions, according to the filing.  Pinfra’s stock has gained 26 percent this year in Mexico
City trading. The shares slipped 1.6 percent today to 70.87
pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
