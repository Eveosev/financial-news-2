Australia  fly-half Quade Cooper
will miss the last two rounds of the inaugural Rugby
Championship because of a knee injury.  Scans on Cooper’s right knee today showed a small chip of
articular cartilage which will require clean-up surgery, the
Wallabies said in an e-mailed statement.   Although it’s the same knee that was operated on following
last year’s Rugby World Cup, the injury isn’t long-term and
Cooper is expected to be available for Australia’s tour of
Europe in November, the team added. A decision on his
availability for that trip will be made once his rehabilitation
is underway, the Wallabies said.  Australia, which is second in the southern hemisphere
championship standings after rallying for wins the previous two
weekends, will name its squad for its final two matches in  South
Africa  and Argentina tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
