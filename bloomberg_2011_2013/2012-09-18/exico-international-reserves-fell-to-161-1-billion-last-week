Mexico ’s  international reserves 
fell to $161.1 billion in the week ended Sept. 14, the central
bank reported today on its website.  Reserves registered a net decrease of $201 million, the
bank said, after dropping $17 million the previous week.  Mexico’s reserves have climbed 13 percent this year, giving
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens greater leeway to
intervene in the foreign exchange market to buoy the peso if
needed. The currency on June 1 touched its weakest against the
dollar since March 2009 on concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis would damp global economic growth.  Mexico uses dollar auctions to limit daily declines in the
peso after it tumbled 11 percent against the dollar in 2011, the
most among major Latin American currencies. Since November, the
central bank has been offering $400 million daily at an  exchange
rate  that’s at least 2 percent weaker than the previous day.  This year, the peso has strengthened 8.9 percent against
the dollar, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
