South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, may raise its forecast for the crop
to 11.39 million metric tons when the Crop Estimates Committee
announces its projection on Sept. 26.  Estimates from five traders surveyed by Bloomberg ranged
from 10.92 million to 11.4 million, with the median seeing
output increase from the committee’s previous forecast of 11.2
million tons. Wheat production may be unchanged from the
committee’s last projection for 1.76 million tons, according to
the survey.  “Deliveries that have been coming in are looking good,
that’s what gives me hope of a good summer crop,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp-based grain trader Senwes
Ltd., said by phone today.  South African corn prices fell today as rains in the key
growing province of Mpumalanga and forecasts for rain in Brazil
and  Argentina  boosted prospects for supply of the grain.  Yellow corn for December delivery, the most active
contract, declined 80 rand, or 3.2 percent, to 2,402 rand a ton
by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. That was the biggest drop since March 22. White
corn for the same month fell by the same amount to 2,406 rand a
ton, the biggest decline for a most active contract since April
16.  Wheat for December delivery declined 1.5 percent to 3,485
rand a ton.  Meal made from white corn is South Africa’s staple food and
yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
