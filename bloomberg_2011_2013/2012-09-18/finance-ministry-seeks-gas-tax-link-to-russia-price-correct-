(Corrects to remove Interfax  tax-rate  calculations in last
two paragraphs after news service changes estimates.)  Russia ’s  Finance Ministry  proposed
linking the natural-gas extraction tax to increases in the
regulated domestic price for the fuel, according to a copy of
draft amendments on its website.  Producers other than OAO Gazprom, which owns the country’s
pipelines, would get a discounted rate, according to the
document. The government has planned to raise average regulated
gas prices for industrial consumers by 15 percent a year.  The tax rate for so-called independent producers would
gradually near Gazprom’s, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
