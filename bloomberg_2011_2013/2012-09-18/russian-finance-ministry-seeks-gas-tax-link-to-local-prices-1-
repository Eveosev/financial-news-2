Russia ’s  Finance Ministry  proposed
linking natural-gas extraction taxes to the domestic price for
the fuel, while sticking with rates near those it sought in May.  So-called independent gas producers, which include  oil
companies  and OAO Novatek, would pay tax at a different rate to
state-run OAO Gazprom, which owns the country’s pipelines,
according to draft amendments published on the ministry’s
website. Under the May proposals, the gap between the smaller
competitors’ lower rate would almost close by mid-2015.  The ministry revisited its plans, which would have doubled
Gazprom’s rate and raised that for independents fourfold, after
producers’ opposition. It aims to cut a deficit to 0.1 percent
of gross domestic product by 2015 from as much as 1.5 percent
next year. Oil and gas contribute half of revenue. Novatek Chief
Executive Officer Leonid Mikhelson said the May proposals were
“shocking” and Gazprom lobbied for a local price link.  The rates for Gazprom and independents will be similar to
those outlined in May, a ministry official who declined to be
identified in line with the authority’s policy, said by phone
today. The main change was the introduction of a formula linked
to the government’s indexation of the gas price, the official
said. The proposal covers the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
