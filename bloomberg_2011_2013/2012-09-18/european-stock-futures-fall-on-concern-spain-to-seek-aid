European stocks  declined the most
in two weeks as investors bet that the rally in the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP)  to a 15-month high overshot the economic outlook and
prospects for corporate earnings.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world’s largest paintmaker, tumbled the
most in one year after saying Chief Executive Officer Ton
Beuchner will go on sick leave.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  slid 4 percent after
analysts downgraded the stock. PSA Peugeot Citroen and Fiat SpA
led a gauge of European automakers lower after a report showed
 car sales  slumped in August. Diageo Plc gained 2.1 percent after
Morgan Stanley recommended the shares.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.4 percent to 273.8 at the
close of trading, the sharpest decrease since Sept. 4. The
equity benchmark has still  climbed 17 percent  from this year’s
low on on June 4 as European Central Bank policy makers approved
an unlimited bond-buying program and the  Federal Reserve 
unveiled a third round of asset purchases.  “While central banks solved the liquidity problem, the
fundamental issues haven’t been solved as Southern Europe
remains uncompetitive.”said Jeppe Christiansen, the chief
executive officer of Copenhagen-based Maj Invest A/S, which
manages $7.4 billion.  The Stoxx 600 rallied during 13 of the 15 weeks through
Sept. 14, reaching the highest close since June 1 last year.
This sent the measure’s  price multiple  to 12.3 times the
estimated earnings of its member companies, the highest since
December 2010.  Spanish Auction  Spain sold 4.6 billion euros ($6 billion) of bills today,
just above the maximum target. The country’s borrowing costs
fell at the first auction since the ECB proposed buying the debt
of cash-strapped nations.  Spanish 10-year bonds  rose for the first time in four days
after the debt sale, signaling that the indebted nation can
continue to borrow from the market even as it contemplates
whether to seek an international bailout.  ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said investors may
begin to ask for higher yields if  Spain  delays a request for
external aid.  If “markets see that Spain will not” ask for assistance,
“then it will not last long before spreads will rise again, and
then Spain will be somewhat forced to come back on its decision
and submit to the conditionality program,” Coene said at a
panel discussion in  London  yesterday.  The volume of shares changing hands on Stoxx 600 companies
was 22 percent more than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German Economy  German  investor confidence  rose for the first time in five
months in September, a report showed today.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed
to minus 18.2 from minus 25.5 in August. Economists forecast a
gain to minus 20, according to the median of 41 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Investors are now taking a breather to see what the next
driver will be,” said Henrik Henriksen, the chief strategist at
PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, where he helps oversee $55
billion. “If investors keep buying more risky assets, stock
markets will be able to rise on their own. They will otherwise
be helped by Spain asking for a bailout.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 15 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX slid 0.8 percent, while the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.4 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 1.2
percent.  Akzo, Aviva  Akzo Nobel dropped 5.5 percent to 46.16 euros, the biggest
decline since September 2011. Buechner will take leave for one
month to recuperate from fatigue on the advice of his doctor,
Amsterdam-based Akzo said. He plans to return in the first half
of October and Chief Financial Officer Keith Nichols will be the
point-person in the interim period.  Aviva lost 4 percent to 344.9 pence. Deutsche Bank AG
downgraded the stock to hold from buy and Bank of America Corp.
cut its rating to underperform, the equivalent of sell, from
neutral.  Peugeot retreated 4.3 percent to 6.78 euros, as a gauge of
European carmakers was the worst-performing  industry group  on
the Stoxx 600. Car registrations in the region fell 8.5 percent
to 722,483 vehicles in August from 789,458 a year earlier, the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association,
or ACEA, said. Sales this year through August decreased 6.6
percent to 8.59 million cars.  Renault SA (RNO)  slid 4 percent to 39.07 euros, Fiat declined 4.3
percent to 4.53 euros and preferred shares of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
slipped 2.3 percent to 148.10 euros.  Arkema, Volex  Arkema SA (AKE)  dropped 4.4 percent to 71.69 euros even as the
French maker of industrial chemicals said it will increase its
dividend payout and raised its profitability target for 2016 as
it pursues acquisitions and develops new products.  Arkema’s dividend  “will already show a significant step-up
in 2012,” and it “targets beyond a 30 percent payout ratio on
adjusted net income,” the company said.  Volex Plc (VLX)  plunged 27 percent to 187.5 pence, the biggest
decrease since January 2008. The company said operating profit
for the year ending March 31 will be broadly in line with the
last financial year due to a recent unexpected drop in demand
from its largest customer in the consumer sector.  A gauge of commodity stocks fell for a second day as copper
led metals lower in London.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining group, lost 1.4 percent to 1,996.5 pence, while

largest food company, gained 0.8 percent to 59 Swiss francs,
while  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  advanced 1.2 percent to 65.83
euros.  The ASE Index climbed 2.9 percent after Greek Finance
Minister Yannis Stournaras said his country’s budget deficit
will be in line this year with the 14.8 billion-euro target
promised to international lenders. National Bank of Greece SA
jumped 7.3 percent to 2.05 euros, while Alpha Bank AE rallied
7.7 percent to 1.68 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
