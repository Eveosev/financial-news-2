Lithuanian  inflation  under European
Union methodology will probably slow to 3 percent from a year
earlier in September, the statistics office said.  Consumer prices may rise 0.4 percent from the previous
month, the fastest pace since May, as growth in clothing and
fuel costs accelerates, the office, based in the capital,
Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Inflation was 3.4 percent in August, it said, increasing a
3.3 percent estimate released Sept. 10.  Lithuania needs to slow inflation to qualify for planned
euro adoption in 2014. Countries seeking to make the currency
change must keep inflation at less than 1.5 percentage points
above the average of the three lowest levels in the EU. That
target was 3 percent in August, while  Lithuania â€™s 12-month
average was 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
