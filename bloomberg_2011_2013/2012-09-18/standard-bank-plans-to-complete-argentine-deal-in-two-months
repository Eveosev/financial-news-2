Standard Bank  Group Ltd., which
expected to close the sale of a stake in its Argentine unit to
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  by June, said the
deal will close within the next two months.  “The deal should be concluded within the next two
months,” Erik Larsen, a spokesman for the bank, said in e-
mailed comments today. David Munro, chief executive officer for
corporate and investment banking at Johannesburg-based Standard,
had said in an interview the deal may not close by year’s end.  Standard agreed in 2011 to sell 80 percent of its stake in
the Argentine unit to ICBC for about $400 million. Regulatory
hurdles have slowed the transaction, according to Munro.  “To maximize value and to behave in an ethical and
responsible way, the bank needs to take time to make sure the
deals are done properly,” said Neville Chester, a  fund manager 
at Cape Town-based  Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML)   Standard gained 0.5 percent to 104.49 rand as of 10:15
a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
