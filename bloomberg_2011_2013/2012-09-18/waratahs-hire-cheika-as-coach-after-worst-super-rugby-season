The New South Wales Waratahs hired
Michael Cheika as head coach on a three-year contract following
the team’s worst Super Rugby season.  Cheika replaces Michael Foley, who quit in July to join the
Western Force, and will take over on Oct. 1, the Waratahs said
today. Cheika, 45, guided Irish province Leinster to  Europe ’s
Heineken Cup title in 2009 and spent the past two seasons as
director of rugby with French Top 14 team Stade Francais.  “In addition to a wealth of domestic and international
coaching experience, Michael has a proven track record as an
inspirational leader and an agent of change,” Waratahs Chairman
Roger Davis said in an e-mailed statement.  The Sydney-based Waratahs ended the 2012 season with a
franchise-record eight straight losses to finish 11th in the
standings and third in the five-team  Australian Conference .
They’d reached the playoffs the previous two years.  Cheika said his first priority will be establishing a clear
identity and playing style for the Waratahs, who finished as
runners-up in southern hemisphere rugby’s top provincial
competition in 2005 and 2008.  “By achieving this we will earn the right to think about
getting some good results,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
