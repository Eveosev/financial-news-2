Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  showed “complete ignorance of facts and realities”
in his comments on the Mideast peace process, said Ambassador
Maen Rashid Areikat, chief representative of the PLO delegation
to the United States.  “Nobody needs peace more than the Palestinians who have
endured exile and Israeli military occupation for more than six
decades,” he said in an e-mailed comment today. “Romney’s
allegations that Palestinians are committed to the destruction
of  Israel  are baseless given the fact that Palestinians have
expressed support for the two-state solution, and repeatedly
recognized Israel’s right to exist.”  “The best way the Republican nominee can help in resolving
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is by adhering to long standing
U.S. policy regarding an acceptable solution that will lead to
the end of military occupation of  Palestine , peace, and
security,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
