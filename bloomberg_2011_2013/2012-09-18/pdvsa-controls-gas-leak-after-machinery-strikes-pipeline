Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the
state oil company, controlled a gas leak after  “heavy
machinery” struck a pipeline in Guarico state this morning, the
company said.  The accident took place while the company performed
maintenance work, PDVSA said in a statement sent by e-mail. Two
workers suffered “light” injuries, the company said.  PDVSA workers and security officials controlled the leak by
closing two nearby wells, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
