Bank of India  plans to offer loans
to homes and businesses for solar-power systems as the country
seeks to avoid a repeat of the July blackout that affected half
the nation’s 1.2 billion people.  The state-owned bank signed a memorandum of understanding
with  Gautam Polymers ’ Solid Solar unit to finance lanterns and
rooftop panels for residential and commercial consumers, the
companies said in a joint e-mailed statement.  Bank of India (BOI) , based in Mumbai, will offer the funding
through its 4,157 branches. Access to loans will make it easier
for consumers to buy solar products that have high upfront
costs, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
