Greek and international groups that
submitted offers to buy a 50.4 percent stake in tobacco company
Sekap SA will be announced on Sept. 20,  Kathimerini  said.  Fewer than eight groups that had expressed interest in the
stake in May submitted offers, the Athens-based newspaper
reported, without citing anyone. The due diligence will be
completed by the end of October, Kathimerini said.  Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA owned the stake in Sekap
before  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  bought the lender for 95 million euros
($124 million) on July 27 as part of a restructuring of  Greece â€™s
banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
