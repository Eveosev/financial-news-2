Serbia’s government must trim the
deficit to 3.5 percent of economic output next year to avoid a
debt crisis and balance the budget by 2016, Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  said.  Serbia is trying to stave off bankruptcy amid a contracting
economy and rising unemployment. The government of Prime
Minister  Ivica Dacic , which took office in July, wants to narrow
the deficit to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 and
to 1 percent in 2015.  “It’s vital we do this,” Dinkic said in Belgrade today.
“We plan to balance the budget in 2016,” he told lawmakers,
presenting the draft 2012 supplementary budget to parliament’s
Finance Committee.  The 2013 budget gap will be 0.5 percentage point lower than
initially planned as the government took into account advice
from the  Fiscal Council  and the  International Monetary Fund  to
ensure public debt does not explode, Dinkic said.  The government needs to narrow the shortfall to convince
the IMF it’s committed to medium-term fiscal consolidation, the
key to start talks with the Washington-based lender on a new
loan program.  IMF Watching  The IMF, which suspended a $1.3 billion precautionary loan
in February on evidence Serbia was slipping on agreed deficit
and debt targets, said on Sept. 14 it would be watching how the
country manages its finances and central-bank autonomy before
agreeing to a new loan. Serbia wants a new deal before adopting
the 2013 budget, to encourage investors to offer cheaper funds
to the indebted state.  Dinkic said one of his main concerns is a rapid increase in
debt-servicing costs, which will rise to 93 billion dinars
($1.06 billion) in 2013 from 66 billion dinars this year.  Public debt rose to 49.6 percent of GDP at the end of 2011,
with output measured at 31.14 billion euros ($40.7 billion),
Dinkic said, citing a report from state auditors. Public debt
was 45.1 percent of GDP at the end of last year, according to
the government of former Premier Mirko Cvetkovic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
