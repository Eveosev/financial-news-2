Colombia  may decide by October or
early November whether to grant an environmental license to
 Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which operates the nation’s
largest oil field.  The decision on exploration and production at the CPE-6
block in eastern Colombia is pending additional information,
which the company expects to submit next week, said Luz Helena
Sarmiento, director of the National Environmental Licensing
Authority, in an interview today in Bogota.  Pacific Rubiales expected an environmental license for the
block as soon as August, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin
said Aug. 10.  Shares (PREC)  of Pacific Rubiales slid 6.1 percent to 44,780 pesos
at the close in Bogota. Shares of  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , which
also owns part of the CPE-6 block, slid 1.5 percent to C$14.35
in Toronto.  The regulator is also awaiting additional information for a
water permit for Rubiales, Colombia’s top oil field, Sarmiento
said. Pacific Rubiales operates the Rubiales field, in which
state-run  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  also holds a stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
