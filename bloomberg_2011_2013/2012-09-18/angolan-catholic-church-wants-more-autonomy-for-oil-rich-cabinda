Angola ’s Catholic Church said it
wants increased autonomy for the province of Cabinda to counter
growing calls for independence in the area that accounts for
more than a quarter of oil output in Africa’s second-largest
producer.  The church wants the province to be able to manage more of
the money that it generates, spokesman Manuel Imbamba said in
remarks from the Vatican that were broadcast today on Radio
Ecclesia, a Catholic radio station based in Luanda, the Angolan
capital.  “Dissatisfaction is growing in a form that no political
party or politician should ignore,” he said.  Cabinda is separated from the rest of the country by the
Congo River and a strip of land that belongs to the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  pumps about 500,000 barrels a day from wells
off the coast of Cabinda. ExxonMobil Corp.,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Total SA (FP) 
account for most of the rest of the southwest African country’s
production of 1.8 million barrels a day.  The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda has
carried out a low-intensity guerrilla war against the government
for the past several decades, a conflict that’s separate from
the 27-year Angolan civil war that ended in 2002. About 38
percent of Angola’s population of 18 million are Catholic,
according to estimates by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s
World Factbook. The percentage is higher in Cabinda, according
to Federal Research Division of the U.S. Library of Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
