Russia , the third biggest wheat
exporter last season, had 34.6 million metric tons of grain
stockpiles as of Sept. 1, down 21 percent from 43.9 million tons
a year earlier, said the Federal State Statistical Service.  Big agricultural producers had 21.1 million tons, down from
27.2 million tons a year earlier, while holdings in procurement
and milling companies fell to 13.5 million tons from 16.7
million tons, the service known as Rosstat said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Procurement firms and millers had about 10.2 million tons
of wheat stocks, of which 8.2 million tons is of milling
quality, Rosstat said. That’s down from about 13 million tons of
the grain, including 10 million tons of milling wheat, a year
earlier.  Most of the stocks, or about 9.9 million tons, are held in
the Central federal district, which is 5.9 percent less than a
year earlier, according to the statistics service. About 8.7
million tons are in Volga, or 23 percent less than a year
earlier. Inventories in the Southern area, which is the closest
to Russia’s main exporting routes, fell 40 percent to 6.7
million tons.  Rosstat’s figures don’t include small, private farm or
household reserves.  Wheat for December delivery rose 1 percent to $8.865 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 4:37 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 36 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
