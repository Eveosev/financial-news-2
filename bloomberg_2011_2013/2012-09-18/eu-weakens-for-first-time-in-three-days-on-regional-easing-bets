The Romanian leu weakened the first
time in three days, depreciating along with the zloty and koruna
on speculation east European central bankers will ease monetary
policy to aid weakening economies.  The leu slumped 0.3 percent to 4.5051 per euro at 2:58 p.m.
in Bucharest. Poland’s zloty slid 0.3 percent and the Czech
currency fell as much as 1.1 percent. Yields on  Romania ’s
country’s 2018 euro-denominated bond rose a second day,
advancing three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.767
percent.  The Czech central bank may use the  exchange rate  as a tool
to ease monetary conditions, Governor Miroslav Singer said in an
interview for Mlada Fronta Dnes published today. The Czech and
Polish economies shrank in the second quarter, while  Hungary 
slid into recession. Romania’s economic growth will slow to 0.9
percent this year from 2.5 percent in 2011, according to
International Monetary Fund forecasts.  “Emerging  Europe ’s currencies remained on the downward
trend versus the euro pushed by worries that central banks in
the region will relax monetary policy in order to prompt
economic growth,” Piraeus Bank Romania SA economists, including
Camil Apostol wrote in a note to clients today. “We see the leu
closing the day on a downward trend in line with its peers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
