European Union lawmakers voted for
new rules that would require companies to report payments to
government officials over energy, mining and forestry projects,
a member of the European Parliament said.  Arlene McCarthy , a U.K. Socialist parliamentarian, said
lawmakers would demand that EU governments and regulators agree
that listed European and large private companies should report
all payments of more than 80,000 euros ($104,480) for individual
projects, according to a  statement  on her website.  The European Parliament must now negotiate with EU
governments and the European Commission on a final version of
the rules before they can become final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
