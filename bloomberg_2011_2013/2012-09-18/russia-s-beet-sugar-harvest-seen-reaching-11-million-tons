Russia harvested 11 million metric
tons of beet-sugar from 27 percent of the sown area as of
Sept. 17, according to the country’s  Sugar Producers’ Union .  The harvested area was 310,100 hectares (766,270 acres),
the union said today on its website. Yields were 35.5 tons a
hectare, the union said, without providing a year-earlier
comparison.  Russia had an all-time high beet-sugar crop of 46.2 million
tons last year, when the country produced a record 5.1 million
tons of sugar and exported more than 300,000 tons of the
sweetener, according to Agriculture Ministry data.  Refineries processed 7.2 million tons of the roots by
Sept. 17, up from 6.7 million tons a year earlier, the union
said in another statement. Output of the sweetener reached
800,000 tons, up from 778,000 tons a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
