England left  Kevin Pietersen  out of
the cricket squad going to India for a four-Test series after
the batsman’s disagreements with management.  Batsmen Nick Compton and Joe Root join the 16-man squad led
by Alastair Cook, the England and Wales Cricket Board said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Pietersen was left off the team after criticism of then-
captain  Andrew Strauss  during the last Test series against South
Africa. The ECB and England team management have met with
Pietersen to discuss his place in the squad.  “These discussions remain private and confidential and as
there are issues still to be resolved, Kevin has not been
considered for selection for the India tour,” the ECB said in
the statement.  Three spin bowlers will also travel to  India ; Samit Patel,
Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
