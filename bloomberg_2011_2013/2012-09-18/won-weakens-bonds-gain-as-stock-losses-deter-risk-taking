South Korea ’s won retreated from a
six-month high and government bonds advanced as global stock
declines deterred investors from taking riskier bets.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid yesterday from the
highest level since 2007 amid concern rising bond yields will
prompt Spain to seek financial aid. Policy makers must control
volatile capital flows as quantitative easing measures taken in
the U.S. and Europe have a negative spillover in  developing
countries , Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said Sept. 14.
The  Korea Development Institute  cut its 2012 economic growth
forecast to 2.5 percent yesterday, from a May projection of 3.6
percent.  “We will be seeing some correction in the  currency market 
as investors take caution against government intervention and
risk-taking recedes as stocks fall,” said Han Sung Min, a
Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank. “Still, losses will
be limited as dealers are waiting to sell the dollar once the
won weakens to near the 1,120 level.”  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,118.40 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, after reaching the strongest level since March
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 6.22 percent. The  Kospi index  gained 0.1 percent.  European Union finance ministers failed to agree on a
timetable for a more unified banking sector and clashed over
terms of bailout requests and the role of the  European Central
Bank  at a meeting Sept. 14 in Cyprus.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 slid three basis points to 2.87 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. The rate touched 2.9 percent yesterday, the
highest in almost a month. Three-year debt futures rose 0.13 to
106.00 and the one-year interest-rate swap fell three basis
points to 2.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
