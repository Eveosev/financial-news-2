Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA, and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led a second day
of declines for the country’s equity index on concern Europe’s
leaders will struggle to resolve the debt crisis.  Komercni shares dropped 1 percent to 3,865 koruna by the
end of trading in Prague. Austria’s Erste slid 0.8 percent. The
 PX (PX)  index, in which the two companies have a combined 41 percent
weighting, dropped 0.3 percent.  Lenders are among the biggest stock decliners in Europe
today after Luc Coene, a member of the European Central Bank’s
Governing Council, said yesterday that rising yields may force
Spain to seek assistance and submit to ECB conditions for aid.
Stocks rallied on Sept. 14, with  Komercni Banka  rising to its
highest in 14 months, after the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to
extend stimulus measures for the world’s largest economy.  “The positive sentiment seems to have evaporated” as
“the markets’ focus is shifting back to Europe after the Fed
meeting,” Tomas Mencik, a stock analyst at Cyrrus AS brokerage
in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report to clients today.
“The markets are again concerned about Spain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
