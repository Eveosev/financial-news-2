U.K. government bonds rose for a
second day amid speculation Spain will delay asking for the
financial assistance it needs to fix its financial turmoil.  Ten-year gilt yields  dropped from the highest since May
after a U.K. report showed inflation slowed in August, enhancing
the attraction of fixed-income securities. The pound
strengthened versus the euro as a gauge of German investor
sentiment stayed negative, spurring demand for Britain’s
currency as a haven from the  European debt crisis .  “In  Europe  and the U.K., the economies are still facing a
lot of headwinds and maybe with yields around the 2 percent
level for both gilts and bunds, investors would consider it not
a bad investment,” said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income
strategist at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in  London . Assistance “programs
are in place but they’re only going to open when Spain asks.
This sort of impasse has got to solve itself,” he said.  The  10-year gilt yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
rising to 1.99 percent yesterday, the highest level since May
10. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.43, or
4.30 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,625) face amount, to 98.845.  Spain  will consider seeking a bailout only if the
conditions imposed are acceptable, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said in an interview with Telecinco. In
October, the government faces 29 billion euros ($37.89 billion)
of debt redemptions as well as two regional elections that may
shape the government’s thinking on a bailout request.  German Sentiment  Germany ’s ZEW Center for European Economic Research said
its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed to
minus 18.2 from minus 25.5 in August. The gauge of the current
situation fell to 12.6, the lowest since June 2010.  U.K. consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in August from a year
earlier, down from an annual gain of 2.6 percent in July, the
 Office for National Statistics  said in London.  The U.K.  30-year break-even rate , a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between regular
and index-linked bonds, fell seven basis points to 2.94 percent.  The Statistics Authority said it will hold a consultation
starting next month on possible changes to the calculation of
inflation measures. The Consumer Prices Advisory Committee said
there is “sufficient evidence to consider change” to inflation
calculations. The National Statistician will publish a
consultation document on Oct. 8.  Gilts have returned 1.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 1.3 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to 80.33 pence per euro
after depreciating to 81.15 pence on Sept. 14, the weakest level
since June 115. Sterling was little changed at $1.6248.  The U.K. currency has appreciated 0.9 percent in the past
month, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro rose 3.4
percent and the dollar fell 2.9 percent.  The  Bank of England  will tomorrow release minutes of its
Sept. 5-6 meeting, when policy makers left the benchmark
 interest rate  on hold at 0.5 percent and keep the asset-purchase
target at 375 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
