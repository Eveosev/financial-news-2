The U.S. government won a temporary
delay of a lower court ruling striking down a military detention
law as unconstitutional.  U.S. Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier in  New York  today granted
a Justice Department request for an interim stay of the Sept. 12
ruling. The government argued that the decision, which imposed a
permanent injunction barring enforcement of the law, poses a
threat to national security.  In a one-page order today, Lohier delayed the ruling until
Sept. 28, when a three-judge panel of the appeals court will
consider whether to extend the stay.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest invalidated
provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2012
that provide for detention by the U.S. military of people who
provide support to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The government
appealed.  A group including former New York Times reporter
Christopher Hedges in January sued President  Barack Obama  and
 Leon Panetta , the secretary of defense, challenging the law. The
plaintiffs claim it could subject them to detention for acts
including writing and advocacy that are protected by the First
Amendment.  The case is Hedges v. Obama, 1:12-cv-00331, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
