     Sept. 18 (Bloomberg)  --  Aerodrom Nikola Tesla AD (AERO) , Serbia’s
main airport, will serve 3.5 million passengers this year, the
most since the 1990s, when  Yugoslavia ’s bloody breakup and
sanctions closed it to international traffic.  The expected 12 percent increase in passenger numbers and a
2.4 increase in flights to 46,000, will make the state-owned
airport “by far the fastest-growing” in the Balkans, even as
it struggles to get paid by its biggest customer, JAT Airways,
Chief Executive Officer Velimir Radosavljevic said at a
presentation in Belgrade today. JAT’s bills overdue more than 60
days led to a 521.6 million-dinar ($5.9 million) writedown in
the airport’s first-half results.  “It’s up to the government to resolve that” as it also
controls the carrier, Radosavljevic said. A “transfer of
property” from the airline to the airport is among options to
settle the debt, he said without elaborating.  If it collects what JAT owes, the  Nikola Tesla airport  may
have the best year in more than a decade, as its first-half
pretax profit was 1.2 billion dinars without the writedown, 27
percent more than a year ago, he said. The number of passengers
in the first eight months rose 7.5 percent to 2.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
