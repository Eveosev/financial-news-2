Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s David A. Viniar, the longest-serving chief financial officer of a major
Wall Street firm, will retire at the end of January and be
replaced by Harvey M. Schwartzfrom the sales and trading unit.  Viniar, 57, will join the New York-based bank’s board of
 directors  when he retires, the company said in a statement
today. Schwartz, 48, will assume oversight of operations,
technology and finance as well as co-head of the firm-wide risk
committee, the company said. Schwartz has worked at Goldman
Sachs since 1997.  “I have sought Harvey’s advice on risk judgments and
market knowledge for a long time and I know he will be an
outstanding chief financial officer,” Viniar said in the
statement. “I look forward to continuing to contribute to
Goldman Sachs as a member of our board of directors.”  Goldman Sachs was the most profitable securities firm in
Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008. Viniar
helped steer the firm through the financial crisis and guided
the company through its initial public offering in 1999.  The firm plans to appoint more independent directors to the
board in the near future, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
