Prime Minister  David Cameron  is
continuing work on plans to overhaul Britain’s state pension,
his spokesman said after a newspaper reported the premier is
worried existing proposals will cost too many votes.  The Financial Times said today Cameron has ordered that
plans for a flat-rate pension of 140 pounds ($227) a week be re-
examined after ministers misjudged how much it would alienate
voters. The government is drawing up legislative proposals that
will be introduced in Parliament this year.  “It is true that we have not yet published the white paper
and that work is continuing on the issue,” Cameron’s spokesman,
Steve Field, told reporters in  London  today when asked if the
Financial Times report was correct. “We will introduce a
single-tier pension system and that remains the policy.”  The Pensions Bill will introduce a single-tier pension to
complement the basic, means-tested pension and increase the
 retirement age  to 67 from 65 by 2028. Unions last week
threatened to strike over plans in a separate bill to make
public-sector workers save more for retirement and align their
pension age with the private sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
