India 's UPA coalition government, widely accused of policy paralysis after having seen annual economic growth dip under its watch to 5.5 percent from more than 8 percent,  initiated a slew of reform measures last weekend  designed to attract foreign capital and restore investor confidence. The most significant of these reforms was the opening up of the retail sector to foreign investment, a decision first  made by the government last November  but subsequently  rescinded  after vociferous resistance both from the opposition and some of the coalition's own partners. The  reform package , which also included a liberalization of investment opportunities in  aviation  and power, the sale of equity in public-sector companies to raise capital and a steep increase in the price of  diesel fuel , was the most far-reaching since  the liberalization of India's socialist economy in 1991 , when the country faced a balance-of-payments crisis. The timing of the measures was seen by some as politically motivated, as Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 's government had been in the dock for  the entire monsoon session  of Parliament for its role in a scam involving the allocation of coal blocks. To others, the proposals were  a belated but welcome recognition  by the government that it had, since coming to power for a second term in 2009, spent too profligately on subsidies and welfare programs and neglected crucial issues of wealth creation and economic liberalization. Some commentators  read the moves  as confirmation that reforms in India can only be delivered as shock therapy by an economic crisis, and not carried out in incremental steps after reasoned debate in Parliament, there being just too many forces invested in the status quo. Even if we take all this to be true, Singh's coalition government still deserves to be complimented for taking hard decisions in the face of considerable opposition. The opening up to foreign direct investment in retail isn't favored by a large number of Indian people, such as the country's millions of small shopkeepers, as well as sections of the middle-class, the intelligentsia and political parties both to the left of the government (which see the move as opening the door to the economic exploitation of India by multinationals with deep pockets, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.) and to the right. There is merit in some of the objections to the new reforms, but it should be granted finally that the task of a government is to lead, not to chase an impossible consensus; that the present government has after years of dithering done so; and that in doing so, it has gambled that in the two years before the next general elections it can persuade the Indian electorate that these steps were necessary for the country's long-term economic health. In any case, the central government has left it open to India's state governments to veto the move on FDI in retail within their own jurisdictions should they want to. The government of one of the biggest states,  Uttar Pradesh  (which has a population of more than 200 million, or almost a sixth of India's people) as well as the states governed by the main opposition party, the BJP, have already said  they are opposed  to opening their doors to foreign investment in the retail sector. Almost a dozen other states have said they welcome the move. Over time these  two pools of states  might form something like a control group and an experimental group on FDI in retail, allowing Indians to make up their minds on the basis of hard facts. For now, no one side is clearly in the right; there's only the sense of a whole new world ahead. As a team of reporters wrote  in the weekly magazine Outlook  last year, when the government  made its first attempt  to persuade the Indian people that FDI in retail  would benefit both producer and consumer : And in a front-page story  in the Telegraph , Jayanta Roy Chowdhury and Sanjay K. Jha wrote: In the wake of the government's announcements, a number of opposition parties, including the nationalist BJP and the  Communist Party of India  (Marxist), and major Indian trade confederations announced that  they would hold a trade bandh , or strike, on Sept. 20, to protest the decision. The owners of millions of kirana stores, or small grocery shops, are against the entry of multinational companies into the retail market, even if they have successfully held their own over the last decade against large Indian supermarket chains. Some of the shop owners' concerns, as well as those of critics on the left, were voiced  by an editorial in the Hindu , the most left-wing of India's major English newspapers: The leader of the opposition in Parliament,  Arun Jaitley  of the BJP, took a different line in articulating his party's view of the new measures,  saying : But cheap Chinese goods are already plentifully available in India, sourced by the very class of small traders and businessmen whose concerns the BJP claims to represent. A more balanced overview of the situation was provided by a sage editorial in the Business Standard that  argued : Meanwhile, stock markets reacted positively to the announcements, and the  BSE India Sensex  Index  rose to a 14-month high . Singh's government now has two years before the next general elections in which to act upon the challenges it has set itself with its new policy framework, and to prove its genuine commitment to these ideas by trying to prove their intellectual coherence. The Indian voter -- whether farmer, trader, worker, consumer or investor -- has the same amount of time to consider his or her response at the ballot box in 2014.
