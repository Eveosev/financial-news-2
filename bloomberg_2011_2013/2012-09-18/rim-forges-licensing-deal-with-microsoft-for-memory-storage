Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  reached a licensing deal to give the struggling
BlackBerry maker the rights to use Microsoft file-memory
technology in its smartphones.  The technology standard, known as exFAT, will help users
transfer large multimedia files between their smartphones and
desktop computers, the companies said today in a joint
statement. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
Microsoft has similar agreements with electronics makers
 Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Canon Inc. (7751)   RIM is adding features to its BlackBerry phones in a bid to
stop customers from fleeing to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices
built on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software. Early next year the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company plans to release the first
BlackBerry 10 phones, which have a faster Web browser and the
ability to run multiple applications at once.  RIM rose 2.3 percent to $7.42 at the close in  New York . The
stock has lost 69 percent of its value in the past year. Shares
of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft were little changed
today, at $31.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
