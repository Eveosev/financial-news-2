Hungary’s National Armenian Council
will file a claim in court against the government’s decision to
allow the transfer a convicted Azeri murderer of an Armenian
soldier to Baku, where he was immediately pardoned,  Blikk  said.  The charges include bribery and abuse of power, the
Budapest-based newspaper said, citing Szevan Sarkisian, chairman
of the council.  Ramil Safarov, an army officer sentenced to  life
imprisonment  by a Hungarian court for the 2004 murder with an ax
of an Armenian serviceman in Budapest, was pardoned Aug. 31 by
Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  after being transferred to his home
country to serve out his sentence there, Blikk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
