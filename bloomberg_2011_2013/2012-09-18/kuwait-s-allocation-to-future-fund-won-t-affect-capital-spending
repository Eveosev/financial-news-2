Kuwait’s decision to raise revenue
allocations to its Future Generations Fund this year won’t be at
the expense of  capital spending , the state-run news agency  KUNA 
reported, citing Finance Minister Nayef Al-Hajraf.  The decision to transfer 25 percent of revenue to the fund,
up from an annual 10 percent, in the fiscal year that began
April 1 is to “encourage saving,” the minister said, according
to KUNA. The government aims to continue allocating 25 percent
of revenue to the fund in future fiscal years, Al-Hajraf said.  The fund, created in 1976, is managed by the  Kuwait
Investment Authority , the country’s sovereign-wealth fund that
also manages Kuwait’s General Reserve Fund. The KIA invests in
local, Arab and international markets.  Kuwait, the third-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is estimated to own about $300
billion of assets abroad through its sovereign-wealth fund,
which holds stakes in Daimler AG and  BP Plc. (BP/)   To contact the reporter on this story:
