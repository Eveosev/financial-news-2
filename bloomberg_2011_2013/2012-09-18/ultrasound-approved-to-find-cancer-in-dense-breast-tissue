The first ultrasound device
designed to help detect cancer in women with dense breasts, who
often aren’t diagnosed until they are experiencing more advanced
stages of the disease, was approved by U.S. regulators.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared Sunnyvale,
California-based U-Systems Inc.’s somo-v ABUS in combination
with standard mammography in women who have a negative mammogram
and no symptoms of  breast cancer , the agency said today in a
 statement . The device from the closely held company can scan the
entire breast in about one minute.  The  National Cancer Institute  estimates 40 percent of women
who undergo mammography, a low-dose X-ray, have dense breasts.
Dense breasts have larger amounts of connective and glandular
tissue, making it more difficult to interpret whether cancer is
present using a mammogram, the FDA said. The U-Systems’ device
would be used as an additional test after a mammogram, the
agency said.  Breast cancer  is the second-leading cause of cancer-related
death among women. An estimated 227,000 women will be diagnosed
with the disease in 2012 and almost 40,000 will die, the FDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
