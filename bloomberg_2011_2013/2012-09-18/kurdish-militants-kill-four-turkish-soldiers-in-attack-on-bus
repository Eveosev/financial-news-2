Kurdish militants killed at least
four Turkish soldiers and wounded 48 others in a rocket attack
today on a bus in the country’s southeast, the Anatolia news
agency said.  The bus caught fire after the militants fired a rocket-
propelled grenade at it on a highway between Bingol and Mus
province, the state-run agency said, citing Governor Mustafa
Hakan Guvencer of Bingol.  The militants have stepped up attacks in recent months in a
war for autonomy in  Turkey ’s southeast that has lasted for
almost three decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
