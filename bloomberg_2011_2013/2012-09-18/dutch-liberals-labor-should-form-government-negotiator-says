The Dutch Liberal and  Labor Party ,
the two strongest groups in Parliament after last week’s
elections, should form a Cabinet without including a third
party, according to a formal recommendation from the chief
negotiator, Henk Kamp.  Kamp, a Liberal, and former Finance Minister Wouter Bos
from Labor should now explore the setting-up of such a coalition
“as soon as possible” in their role as “informateurs,” Kamp,
the caretaker social affairs minister, said in an e-mailed
statement today as he made his recommendation to Parliament in
 The Hague .  Coalition negotiations in the Netherlands started Sept. 14,
with Kamp receiving party leaders. The Liberals, led by
caretaker Prime Minister  Mark Rutte , took 41 out of the 150
seats in Parliament in the Sept. 12 vote, with Labor, led by
Diederik Samsom, winning 38.  Talks between the Liberals and Labor still may prove to be
difficult due to policy differences. Rutte rules out providing
more money for  Greece , while Labor’s Samsom has said he wants to
give the country more time to meet its targets for getting its
finances into shape. Rutte is in favor of continuing austerity
to meet deficit rules, while Samsom says the timescale for
budget goals can be eased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
