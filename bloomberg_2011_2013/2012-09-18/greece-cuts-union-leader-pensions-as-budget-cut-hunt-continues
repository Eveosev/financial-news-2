Greece ’s Labor Ministry will
abolish a special pension that’s been paid to trade union
leaders since 1937 as the government continues its hunt for 11.5
billion euros ($15 billion) of spending cuts needed to qualify
for aid to keep the country in the euro.  The pension, introduced by dictator Ioannis Metaxas, has
been paid to presidents and secretaries of trade unions as well
as to board members of the General Confederation of Greek Labor
with 12 years of  service , according to an e-mailed statement
from the Athens-based ministry today.  “This decision, demanded by the need to rationalize the
social security system, will not only save funds but is also a
just and equal decision,” the ministry said.  The pension is funded by a percentage of contributions paid
by all workers to the country’s biggest pension fund, IKA. The
ministry’s law will abolish it from Nov. 1. No estimate of the
savings was given. The pension is paid to a few hundred people
and ranges from 200 euros to 600 euros a month, the state-run
Athens News Agency reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras and representatives of
Greece’s lenders from the euro area and  International Monetary
Fund  have been locked in talks for weeks in an attempt to agree
on the two years of savings. Approval of the cuts will allow the
release of a 31 billion-euro payment, part of the country’s
second rescue agreement, which has been blocked since June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
