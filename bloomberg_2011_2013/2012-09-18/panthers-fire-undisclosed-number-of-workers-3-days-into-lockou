The  Florida Panthers  fired an
undisclosed number of employees, three days into the  National
Hockey League ’s lockout.  Michael Yormark, president of Sunrise Sports &
Entertainment -- the company that operates the Panthers -- said
that the reductions were “due primarily to the NHL work
stoppage.” He didn’t say how many staff members were let go.  The Panthers’ firings come one day after Ottawa Senators
President Cyril Leeder said the team has made temporary staff
cuts and had full-time employees go to a shortened work week.
The NHL locked out its players on Sept. 16 after failing to
agree on a new labor contract, the league’s third work stoppage
in 18 years.  “We thank all of those former staff members for their
efforts, while SSE’s human resources department has volunteered
to work with these former staff members to assist them in
finding new employment,” the Panthers’ Yormark said in a
statement.  The 2012-13 season was scheduled to begin Oct. 11.  With the lockout, 2011-12 NHL Most Valuable Player Evgeni
Malkin of the  Pittsburgh Penguins  is among those players who are
making plans to play outside the U.S. Malkin signed with
Russia’s Metallurg Magnitogorsk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
