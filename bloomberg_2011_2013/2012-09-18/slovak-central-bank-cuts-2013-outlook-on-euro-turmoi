The Slovak central bank lowered its
forecast for the nation’s economic  growth  next year to 2 percent
from a previously projected 3.1 percent, citing the euro
region’s debt crisis and austerity measures.  The estimate for 2012 gross-domestic-product growth was
raised to 2.7 percent from the 2.5 percent predicted three
months ago as the expansion in the first half was faster than
expected amid a surge in car-making, according to a quarterly
forecast released by Governor Jozef Makuch at a press conference
today in the capital, Bratislava. The bank reduced its GDP
growth outlook for 2014 to 3.5 percent from 4.3 percent.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, faces falling
demand for its exports in western  Europe  as the sovereign-debt
crisis damps consumption. While a surge in production by the
local unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  has so far helped the eastern
European nation weather the crisis better than many peers, risks
to its outlook remain, the central bank said.  “The pace of growth will continue slowing in 2013 after
the effect of the supply shock on the export side wanes,” said
Makuch, who’s also a member of the European Central Bank’s
Governing Council. “At the same time, growth will be affected
by austerity measures.”  The economy advanced 0.7 percent in the second quarter,
among the fastest in the European Union, compared with a 0.2
percent contraction in the bloc of 17 nations sharing the euro.
It grew 3.3 percent in 2011.  The Finance Ministry yesterday kept its forecast for 2012
GDP growth at 2.5 percent, while cutting the projection for 2013
and 2014 to 2.1 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.  The central bank also raised its projection for average
 inflation  in 2012 to 3.7 percent from 3.5 percent, driven by
commodity prices. Price growth is set to slow to 2.4 percent in
2013 and to 1.9 percent in 2014, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
