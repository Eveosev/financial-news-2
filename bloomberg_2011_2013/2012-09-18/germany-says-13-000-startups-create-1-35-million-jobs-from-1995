Germany â€™s Economy Ministry said
about 13,000 startup companies with workforces that grew at
least an annual 20 percent over three years were set up in the
country from 1995 through 2010, creating 1.35 million jobs.  The startups were most successful when they focused on
innovation and international markets early on, the ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement, citing a study it commissioned.
The main hurdles were a lack of financing and skilled workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
