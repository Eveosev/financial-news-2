Karolinska Development AB (KDEV) , a
Swedish biotech company, rose the most in three months in
Stockholm trading after an early-stage study of a cancer
treatment showed the medicine may be effective.  The shares rose as much as 8.6 percent, the biggest gain
since May 31. Karolinska Development traded 4 percent higher at
15.80 kronor as of 1:45 p.m. local time. The shares were the top
gainers in the OMX Stockholm All-Share Index, which was down 0.8
percent.  Data from a first- and second-phase clinical study of
APR-246 showed that the drug was well tolerated and that it had
an effect against tumors, Karolinska Development said today in a
statement. The drug candidate is being developed by Aprea AB
which now plans to advance APR-246 into a mid-stage study in
ovarian cancer. Stockholm-based Karolinska Development holds a
68.5 percent stake in Aprea, according to Aprea’s website.  “Although it was primarily a safety trial, the data
indicates that APR-246 has an anti-tumor effect,” Chief
Executive Officer Torbjoern Bjerke said in the statement. “With
these new results we can see a clear path forward for APR-246.”  Aprea develops cancer treatments targeting a protein called
p53 that suppresses tumor growth. Changes in the protein are
common in various cancer forms and may increase resistance to
standard chemotherapy, Karolinska Development said. Results from
the study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
