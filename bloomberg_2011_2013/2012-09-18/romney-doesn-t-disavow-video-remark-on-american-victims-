Mitt Romney  said his comment in a video released earlier today calling many Americans “victims” dependent on the government wasn’t “elegantly stated,” while stopping short of disavowing the remark.  The Republican presidential candidate said tonight that his comments, secretly recorded at a campaign event earlier this year, were made while “speaking off the cuff in response to a question.”  Barro: Today, Mitt Romney Lost the Election “It’s not elegantly stated,” Romney said outside a campaign fundraiser in  Costa Mesa , California. “Of course I want to help all Americans. All Americans have a bright and prosperous future.”  The tape’s release threatened to distract from Romney’s message against President  Barack Obama  over the handling of the  U.S. economy . It also emerged as the former Massachusetts governor seeks to reset his campaign after losing ground to Obama in polls after the political conventions.  In the video, Romney says “there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,” according to the recording that was obtained by  Mother Jones  magazine from an unidentified person. It also was posted online by the  Huffington Post .  “All right -- there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them,” Romney says on the video, adding that they “believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.”  Obama Criticism  The remarks drew criticism from Obama’s re-election campaign. “It’s shocking that a candidate for president of the  United States  would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the American people view themselves as ‘victims,’ entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take ‘personal responsibility’ for their lives,” Obama campaign manager  Jim Messina  said in a statement.  Romney Government-Dependent ‘Victims’ Remark Roils Message Romney said tonight that Obama’s “approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes because frankly my discussion about lowering taxes isn’t as attractive to them, and therefore I’m not likely to draw them into my campaign, as effectively as who are in the middle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  John McCormick  in Costa Mesa, California at   jmccormick16@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeanne Cummings at   jcummings21@bloomberg.net
