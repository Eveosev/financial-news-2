Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , which
operates banks in 32 African countries, rose the most in almost
two weeks on speculation profit will increase in the nine months
through September after falling in the first half.  The stock gained 9.1 percent to 12 pesewas by the close in
Accra, the capital, the biggest increase since Sept. 6.  “Ecobank Transnational is expected to break even in its
nine-month performance, after earnings declined in the first
half of the year,” David Tetteh, chief executive officer of  CAL
Bank Ltd. (CAL) ’s brokerage unit, said by phone today. A $250 million
investment from South Africa’s Public Investment Corp. in April,
which gave it a 20 percent stake in Ecobank, was probably “used
to address major efficiency issues bordering on the bank’s
growth,” he said.  The bank’s net income declined 7.4 percent to $83.9 million
in the first six months of the year, it said on July 27. Net
interest income, the money banks make from loans increased to
$442 million from $256 million a year before, it said.  Ecobank trades on three regional  stock exchanges . In
Nigeria shares fell 1.2 percent to 11.21 naira and was down 2.7
percent to 36  CFA francs  in Abidjan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
