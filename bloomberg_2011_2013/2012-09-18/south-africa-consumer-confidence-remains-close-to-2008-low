South African  consumer confidence 
remained near a four-year low in the third quarter as a high
jobless rate and concerns about fuel and food price increases
erode sentiment.  The FNB/BER  consumer confidence  index gained 2 points to
minus 1 in the third quarter, Johannesburg-based  First National
Bank (FSR)  and the  Bureau for Economic Research  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The index peaked at 13 in the third quarter of
2010.  “ Consumer confidence  remains weak and not supportive of
robust growth in consumer spending,” according to the
statement. “Moderating wage inflation, lackluster job creation
and rising household tax burdens will continue to erode
household income growth.”  Consumer spending slowed in the second quarter on concerns
about a worsening economy and rising food and fuel prices,
central bank data show. Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  cut
the  benchmark interest rate  on July 19 as the economic outlook
in South Africa deteriorated and factory output, which accounts
for 15 percent of the economy, contracted in the second quarter.  Corn reached a record last month on the Chicago Board of
Trade and white corn, a staple in South Africa, has risen 18
percent since June 1 on the South African Futures Exchange. The
government increased the price of gasoline 8.4 percent this
month.  Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of spending
in the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
