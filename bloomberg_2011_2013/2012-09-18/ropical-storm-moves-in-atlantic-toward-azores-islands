Tropical Storm Nadine is moving
northeast in the Atlantic on a path that may threaten the Azores
Islands with damaging wind and rain, the National Hurricane
Center.  The 14th named storm of the Atlantic season that runs
through November was 450 miles (720 kilometers) west-southwest
of the Azores, moving at 8 miles per hour with winds of 60 mph,
the NHC said in a 5 a.m. Atlantic time advisory.  “A tropical storm watch may be required for a portion of
the Azores later today,” the Miami-based center said.  In the Pacific, Hurricane Lane is forecast to become a
remnant low within two days, the NHC also said. The system was
about 1,180 miles west of the tip of  Baja California  with 75 mph
winds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
