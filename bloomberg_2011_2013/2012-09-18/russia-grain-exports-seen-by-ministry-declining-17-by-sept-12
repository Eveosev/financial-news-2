Russia, the world’s third biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, shipped 6.1 million metric tons of
grain from July 1 through Sept. 12, down 17 percent from 7.38
million tons a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Exports were 1.27 million tons in the first 12 days of this
month, the ministry said in a statement on its website today,
citing the Federal Customs Service data. The shipments included
1.05 million tons of wheat, 180,000 tons of barley and 13,000
tons of corn.  Grain prices continued to rise in Asian areas of the
country, where the new crop supply was insufficient, the
ministry said. Prices advanced in the European part as well
because of demand from exporters and domestic consumers.  In the European part of the country, the average price for
the third-grade milling wheat increased 2.5 percent to 8,279
rubles ($267) a ton yesterday, the ministry said. Fourth-grade
milling wheat rose 3.3 percent to 8,066 rubles a ton and feed
wheat rose 3.6 percent to 7,715 rubles a ton.  Prices are expected to rise further in the weeks ahead
because of the “increasing competition between exporters and
domestic consumers” for grain, the ministry said.  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $8.7675 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 3:03 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 34 percent this year.  Russia ’s exports of wheat, which has suffered from drought,
are expected to fall to 8 million tons this season from 21.6
million tons a year earlier, making the country the fifth-
largest shipper, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Estimates. The U.S.,  Australia ,  Canada  and the European Union
are expected to be 2012-13’s top four exporters, USDA data
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
