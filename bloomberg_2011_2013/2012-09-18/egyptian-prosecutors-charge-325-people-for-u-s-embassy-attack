Egyptian prosecutors have charged
325 people of rioting during protests last week to denounce the
U.S. over an anti-Islamic film.  The protestors were charged with resisting authorities and
attacking the security personnel during an attack on the U.S.
embassy in Cairo, according to a statement faxed by Cairo’s Qasr
al-Nile prosecution office, citing Judge Mohamed Abdel-Shafi.  The film, which the U.S. has described as “very
offensive,” has triggered a series of violent demonstrations
and attacks on U.S. and European-linked targets across the
Muslim world. U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three
colleagues were killed in an attack in Benghazi last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
