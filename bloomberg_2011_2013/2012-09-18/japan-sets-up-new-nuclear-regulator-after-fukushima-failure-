Japan ’s new nuclear regulator
starts operation tomorrow as part of measures the government
introduced after the Fukushima disaster to try and establish an
independent supervisor of the industry.  The government will inaugurate the Nuclear Regulation
Authority and its secretariat tomorrow to separate promotion of
nuclear power from regulation of the same industry,  Yukio Edano ,
the trade and industry minister, said today in Tokyo.  Previously, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry was
responsible for both expanding nuclear power and supervising it,
including the existing regulator Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency, known as NISA.  “Unfortunately, the ministry failed to avoid the disaster
and meet public expectations,” Edano told officials at the
ministry today. “Everyone in the ministry has to acknowledge
that the abolishment of NISA is based on the lessons and
reflections from the failure.”  NISA will be integrated into the new authority, or NRA, as
an an affiliate of the Ministry of Environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
