The euro stayed lower versus the
dollar and the yen after German investor confidence increased
for the first time in five months in September.  The shared currency was 0.3 percent weaker at $1.3075 at
10:09 a.m. London time. It was 0.4 percent lower at 102.82 yen.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed
to minus 18.2 from minus 25.5 in August. Economists forecast a
gain to minus 20, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
