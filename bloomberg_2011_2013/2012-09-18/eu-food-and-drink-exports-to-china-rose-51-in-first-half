European Union exports of food and
beverage products to  China  climbed 51 percent in the first half
of this year, compared with a year earlier, the bloc said.  EU food and drink shipments to China were worth 1.963
billion euros ($2.563 billion) in the first six months of this
year, compared with 1.298 billion euros in the first half of
2011, according to a  statement  today on the blocâ€™s website.  Food and drink imports from China totaled 2.115 billion
euros, down 4.9 percent from last year, leaving a trade deficit
of 152 million euros. That compares with a deficit of 926
million euros in the first half of 2011, the EU said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
