A Bugatti Veyron will be among lots
at a collectible car auction that also includes a 1955 Mercedes-
Benz Gullwing estimated at as much as $5.2 million.  The Mercedes, one of just 29 alloy-bodied 300SL models, is
formally valued at 3.2 million pounds in a sale of 90 cars and
motorcycles by  RM Auctions  in Battersea,  London , on Oct. 31.  Prices  of the rarest 1950s and 1960s cars by marques such
as Mercedes and Ferrari are on the rise, dealers said. Some of
the most recent luxury models are struggling to appreciate.  “The Veyron is completely crazy,” said Adrian Hamilton,
chairman of the Hampshire-based dealer  Duncan Hamilton & Co. ,
which has bought and sold several examples. “If you drive flat
out, it runs out of petrol in 16 minutes. It costs a fortune to
maintain. Yet a car like that may never be created again. It
could potentially be a reasonable investment, depending how many
miles are on the clock.”  The 2008 Veyron EB 16.4, with a top speed of more than 250
miles per hour, is being sold without reserve and has less than
700 kilometers (435 miles) on its odometer. The Veyron had an
original price of $1.5 million to $2 million, dealers said, and
this one is estimated to fetch between 440,000 pounds ($715,000)
and 560,000 pounds. It is one of 22 European- and U.S.-made cars
entered by the Dutch collector Wim Zegwaard.  Wine Auction  A case of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti La Tache 2005 fetched
a top price of $45,938 at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  wine auction in  New York 
that registered the company’s highest-ever levels of buying from
Latin American clients.  The case of La Tache, estimated at $30,000 to $40,000 at
the Sept. 15 event, was bought by a U.S.-based collector, the
New York-based company said.  The sale raised $3 million with fees -- matching the high
estimate, based on hammer prices -- with 92 percent of 1,147
lots successful. Burgundies from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
generated four of the 10 top prices.  Two cases of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982 sold between
the high and low estimates, for $39,813 each, both to the U.S.
trade, underlining the decline in value of  Asia ’s favorite
trophy Bordeaux. A 12-bottle lot of this same Lafite vintage
sold for $133,584 at Sotheby’s,  Hong Kong , in October 2010.  Cork Street  Cork Street’s status as one of London’s destination gallery
districts is being threatened by two proposed real-estate
developments, dealers said.  Plans are being drawn up by the Pollen Estate and Native
Land to redevelop parts of the Mayfair street, which houses 20
galleries specializing in modern and contemporary art. About
half the dealerships would be affected.  The Pollen Estate’s proposals for numbers 5 to 9 will
provide new office, retail and art gallery spaces behind
existing facades.  Native Land  plans to demolish the block containing numbers
22 to 27 -- including the street’s oldest dealership, the Mayor
Gallery, founded in 1925 -- to build a residential development
designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, the architects of
the Candy brothers’  One Hyde Park .  Fred Mayor staged Joan Miro’s first solo exhibition in the
U.K. in 1933. Peggy Guggenheim opened her first commercial
gallery, at 30 Cork Street in 1938.  “We’re fully aware of the reputation the area has for
galleries,” Dan Clarke, development manager for the Native Land
project, said in an interview. “Our plans will add about 30 to
40 percent more gallery space than there is at the moment.”  Formal Applications  Neither developer has yet made a formal planning
application to Westminster Council. The redevelopment of 5-9
Cork Street is scheduled for completion in late 2016 or in 2017,
the  Pollen Estate (GPOR)  said in an e-mail yesterday.  “The Estate is keen to preserve and build on Cork Street’s
reputation as a gallery location by providing higher quality
space with an improved frontage,” the Pollen Estate said in an
e-mail. “Gallery owners affected by the proposals are being
consulted to give them a first-hand opportunity to comment.”  “If we leave the street, we won’t be able to afford to come
back,” Simon Tarrant, sales manager of  Alpha Gallery , said in an
interview. “Rents may be four or five times higher. We’re small
independent galleries and can’t compete with major retailers.”  A  petition  opposing the redevelopment of Cork Street has
attracted more than 6,000 signatures. The campaign is seeking
10,000 by Sept. 30, allowing it to make a formal objection to
the U.K. Parliament.  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on music,  Ryan Sutton  on
food,  Rich Jaroslovsky  on tech and  Jeremy Gerard  on theater.  To contact the writer on the story:
