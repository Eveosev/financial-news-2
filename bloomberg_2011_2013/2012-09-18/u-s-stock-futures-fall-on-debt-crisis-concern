Most U.S.  stocks  fell, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed to the highest level since 2007, as  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  slumped and concern grew that European leaders will struggle to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  FedEx dropped 3.1 percent as it reduced its profit outlook after quarterly earnings fell. United Continental Holdings Inc. fell 2.3 percent amid a U.S. investigation of tarmac delays.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

About five stocks fell for every four advancing on U.S. exchanges today, as 6 billion shares traded hands, in line with the three-month average.  “We’re looking for the market to flatten out and hold where it is until the U.S. election,”  Thomas Nyheim , a Wilmington, Delaware-based fund manager for Christiana Trust, which oversees about $13 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Europe is an overhang that’s still there on the U.S. market. Their debt crisis is not being handled, it’s Band-Aids here and there. It’s slowing us down.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  is trading at 14.1 times the estimated earnings of its constituent members, close to its highest price multiple since the end of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The equity benchmark rose to its highest level since December 2007 on Sept. 14 after the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy mortgage securities to support economic growth. Bearish options contracts on the  S&P 500  have dropped to the cheapest level in more than three years.  Spanish Bonds  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent yesterday after a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Cyprus on Sept. 14 and 15 failed to agree on a timetable for a more unified banking industry, the terms of bailout requests and the role played by the  European Central Bank .  ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said Spain may have to ask the European Commission for aid and submit to conditions imposed by its creditors if bond yields continue to increase. Coene spoke at a panel discussion in London yesterday.  The Spanish government sold 4.6 billion euros of bills at an auction today, more than its maximum target.  Spain’s bond yields  climbed to more than 6 percent yesterday for the first time since Sept. 7, the day after policy makers approved ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s plan to buy government debt to ensure the transmission of  interest rates .  Business Slowdown  “We don’t think Europe is going to have a giant, broad-based, perfect solution, but we’ve come a long way over the last 12 months,” Kate Moore, the New York-based senior global equity strategist at  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , said on Bloomberg Television’s “In The Loop with  Betty Liu ” today. “We are very much worried about a slowdown in business spending and this uncertainty shock that could hit the economy over the next few quarters.”  Energy, financial stocks and companies that rely on consumer discretionary spending  fell  the most in the S&P 500, retreating at least 0.4 percent. Consumer staples, phone companies and health-care stocks rose the most.  FedEx slumped 3.1 percent to $86.55. The operator of the world’s largest cargo airline cut its annual profit outlook as a weakening economy spurs shippers in the U.S. and overseas to switch to cheaper delivery options.  Bellwether Stock  The company, an economic bellwether because it ships goods from financial documents to electronics, pared its forecast for U.S. expansion next year to 1.9 percent from a June prediction of 2.4 percent. FedEx trimmed its forecast for global growth this year and next to 2.3 percent and 2.7 percent, down from 2.4 percent and 3 percent, respectively.  “Fundamentally what’s happening is that exports around the world have contracted and the policy choices in Europe, the U.S. and China are having an effect on global trade,” Chief Executive Officer  Fred Smith  said on a conference call. “Over the last few months, exports and trade have gone down at a faster rate than GDP has.”  The Dow Jones Transportation Average declined for the second day, losing 1.1 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index slumped 2.1 percent. United Continental fell 2.3 percent to $19.27. The world’s largest airline is under U.S. investigation for stranding 16 flights on tarmacs for more than three hours during thunderstorms.  AMD Slides  AMD declined 9.7 percent to $3.62, the most in the S&P 500, after the second-biggest maker of processors said CFO Thomas Seifert will leave to seek other opportunities. The resignation is the latest disruption at the semiconductor maker, which is struggling to prevent larger rival Intel Corp. from taking market share and is facing slowing demand in the PC market.  OCZ Technology Group Inc. (OCZ)  dropped 7.4 percent to $4.13. Chief Executive Officer Ryan Petersen resigned from the maker of solid-state disk drives. He will be replaced on an interim basis by Chief Marketing Officer Alex Mei, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement yesterday.  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  declined 10 percent to $1.38 after Time Warner Cable Inc. said it plans to sell its 46.4 million shares in the money-losing venture to build a high-speed wireless Internet network across the U.S. Time Warner Cable has alerted other Clearwire investors, including  Sprint Nextel Corp.
