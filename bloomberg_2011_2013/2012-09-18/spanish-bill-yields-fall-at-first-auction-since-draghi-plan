Spain  sold 4.6 billion euros ($6
billion) of bills, just above the maximum target, and its
borrowing costs fell at the first auction since the  European
Central Bank  proposed buying the debt of cash-strapped nations.  Spain sold 12-month bills at 2.835 percent, compared with
3.07 percent when they were last auctioned on Aug. 21, and 18-
month bills at 3.072 percent, compared with 3.335 percent.  The Madrid-based Treasury, which plans to sell another 4.5
billion euros of bonds on Sept. 20, said demand for the 12-month
bills was 2.03 times the amount sold, compared with 1.91 last
month, and 3.56 for the longer-dated bills, compared with 3.98.  Borrowing costs fell from the previous auction even as the
impact of ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s proposal to buy bonds of
countries that submit to rescue programs started to fade.
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has delayed making a
decision on whether to trigger the mechanism that Draghi
announced two weeks ago, prompting an increase in 10-year yields
yesterday to more than 6 percent.  The extra yield on Spanish benchmark  10-year bonds  compared
with German equivalents narrowed to 426 basis points at 10:45
a.m. in  Madrid , compared with 440 basis points before the
auction and 430 basis points yesterday.  On Sept. 20, Spain will sell its benchmark 10-year bond,
maturing in January 2022 and securities due in October 2015. The
Treasury said Sept. 6 it had sold 76.8 percent of the medium-and
long-term debt it plans to sell this year. It hasn’t given data
on the progress of bill sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
