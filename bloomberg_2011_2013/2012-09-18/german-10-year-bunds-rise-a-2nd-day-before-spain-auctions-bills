Spanish 10-year bonds advanced,
snapping a three-day decline, as the country sold 4.6 billion
euros ($6 billion) of bills at its first auction since the
 European Central Bank  proposed buying sovereign debt.  Spain’s 10-year  yield , which earlier climbed above 6
percent for a second day, declined as Deputy Prime Minister
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the country will consider
seeking a bailout if the conditions imposed are acceptable.
Italian bonds rose for the first time in three days. German 10-
year bunds gained as investor confidence stayed negative in
September. The European Financial Stability Facility sold 182-
day bills at a negative yield.  “The auction was reasonable and gives some confidence
Spain can keep going for a while longer,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“It shows the ECB have bought them some time and that’s what’s
taken a little bit of the pressure off them today. However, they
will probably still need a bailout at some stage.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 5.90 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
climbing to 6.06 percent, the highest since Sept. 7. The 5.85
percent security due in January 2022 gained 0.545, or 5.45 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.635. The yield on Italian 10-
year bonds fell five basis points to 5.05 percent.  Draghi Plan  Spain sold 12-month bills at 2.835 percent, compared with
3.07 percent when they were last auctioned on Aug. 21, and 18-
month bills at 3.072 percent, versus 3.335 percent. The Madrid-
based Treasury plans to sell another 4.5 billion euros of bonds
on Sept. 20.  Europe ’s temporary bailout fund, also known as the
EFSF, sold 1.94 billion euros of six-month bills at an average
yield of minus 0.0181 percent.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds reached a euro-era
record 7.75 percent on July 25, before ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged a day later to do “whatever it takes” to
safeguard the monetary union. Draghi gave details of the central
bank’s asset-purchase plan on Sept. 6, helping to push the yield
to a five-month low of 5.55 percent four days later. Activation
of the program is dependent on countries asking for help and
submitting themselves to conditions set by the ECB.  ‘New Sacrifices’  “If we get our borrowing costs to fall, so we pay less,
and if we manage to do that by doing reforms and without new
sacrifices” a financial rescue may be an option, Saenz said in
an interview with Telecinco.  ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said rising
borrowing costs may force  Spain  into asking for help.  If markets see that Spain won’t ask for assistance, “then
it will not be long before spreads rise again, and then Spain
will be somewhat forced to come back on its decision and submit
to the conditionality program,” Coene said at a panel
discussion in London yesterday.  The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold
Spanish 10-year bonds instead of German bunds slipped four basis
points to 426 basis points, down from a euro-era record 650
basis points in July. It narrowed 21 basis points since Sept. 6.  “It would appear that the drop in yields has encouraged
Spanish politicians to try and tough it out, but the numbers
aren’t good,”  Michael Hewson , a market analyst at CMC Markets
U.K. Plc in London, wrote in a client note. “The concern
remains that continued prevarication will send bond yields
higher again, with attention now turning to” Spain’s 10-year
bond auction in two days’ time.  Bond Volatility  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Spain and  Austria , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two-year and 10-year securities and credit-default
swaps. The yield on  Portugal ’s bond due in October 2023 climbed
22 basis points to 8.65 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell three basis points to 1.64
percent, after being as high as 1.734 percent yesterday, the
most since April 26.  The nation plans to sell 5 billion euros of two-year notes
tomorrow. It last sold the securities on Aug. 22 at an average
yield of zero, compared with a  record-low  auction yield of minus
0.06 percent in July.  Germany’s ZEW Center for European Economic Research said
its  index  of investor and analyst expectations, which aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed to
minus 18.2 from minus 25.5 in August. The gauge of the current
situation fell to 12.6, the lowest since June 2010.  German bonds returned 2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities were little changed, while Italy’s debt earned 15
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
