The Philippine peso retreated from
a four-year high after reports heightened concern the region’s
economies are slowing, tempering inflows into stocks.  The currency has weakened 0.8 percent in two days, headed
for its worst back-to-back loss in a month, after official data
yesterday showed  Singapore ’s exports and  South Korea ’s
department-store sales fell in August. The  Philippines ’
unemployment rate rose to 7 percent in July from 6.9 percent in
April, the statistics office said in  Manila  today. Foreign funds
have bought $2.2 billion more local shares than they sold this
year, exchange data show.  “The peso reflects the economic concerns in the region,”
said Emilio Neri, an economist at  Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) 
in Manila. “Investors are turning cautious following hefty
stock gains this year.”  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 41.743 per dollar as of 4
p.m. local time, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency touched 41.358 yesterday, the strongest level since
April 1, 2008. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
5.25 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Philippine Composite Index snapped a four-day rally
today. The gauge has advanced more than 22 percent this year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its overnight rate at a
record-low 3.75 percent on Sept. 13. The central bank raised its
average inflation forecast to 3.4 percent for this year and 4.1
percent for 2013, compared with earlier projections of 3.1
percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due March 2032 was
steady at 5.73 percent, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The treasury will auction 9 billion pesos of 20-year
notes on Sept. 25, according to its sale calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
