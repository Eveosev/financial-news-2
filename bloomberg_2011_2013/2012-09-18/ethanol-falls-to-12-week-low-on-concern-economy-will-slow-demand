Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell to
the lowest price in 12 weeks on concern the economy is slowing
and will crimp demand for the biofuel.  Prices moved lower with other commodities, including corn,
crude oil and gasoline, on speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis
and a sluggish global economy will curtail fuel consumption. The
additive is mixed with gasoline to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  “Everything’s down,” said Jeff DeReamer, an ethanol
broker at ICAP Energy in Lexington,  Kentucky . “It’s the entire
macro global economy.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery dropped 3.8 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.28 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since June 29. Futures have gained 3.5 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast tumbled
11 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $2.405 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive slid 5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.295, data compiled
by Bloomberg showed.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased 4.5 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.36 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel lost 4
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.375.  Corn for December delivery slumped 8 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $7.40 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.33, or 1.4 percent,
to $95.29 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
fallen 3.6 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery declined 4.43 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.899 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Gasoline narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to 61.9 cents from
62.53 cents yesterday, making the biofuel less attractive to
blend for refiners, who stand to pocket the difference between
the two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
