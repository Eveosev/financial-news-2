DoubleLine Capital LP’s  Jeffrey Gundlach  will manage a strategy available to European investors
that mimics his flagship  Total Return Bond Fund. (DBLTX)   DoubleLine, the  money manager  with more than $40 billion in
assets, is partnering with Nordea Bank AG, which will distribute
the product to investors in Europe, according to a  statement 
today by the Stockholm-based financial services group. The U.S.
Total Return Bond strategy will invest in the same types of
securities as DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, including
agency mortgage-backed securities and non-agency mortgage
securities, which don’t have an explicit or implicit guarantee
from the U.S. government.  The new strategy marks Los Angeles-based DoubleLine’s first
venture into the European market. DoubleLine, which was founded
by Gundlach and President Philip Barach in December 2009, has
attracted $22 billion in net deposits in the past 12 months, the
third-highest amount after Vanguard Group Inc. and Pacific
Investment Management Co., according to data compiled by
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Gundlach, 52, said last week he may add stock
funds to DoubleLine’s lineup of bond offerings.  The $32 billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund returned
7.9 percent this year through Sept. 17, beating 96 percent of
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It  returned  8.6
percent over the past 12 months, ahead of 97 percent of rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
