Jordan’s energy and mineral
resources ministry signed a memorandum of understanding with
Global Oil Shale Holdings of  Canada  to evaluate the kingdom’s
shale-oil reserves, the official Petra news agency reported.  The accord calls for a feasibility study about producing
50,000 barrels a day of oil from shale over 220 square
kilometers (85 square miles) in the Attarat Um Ghudran and
Isphere Al Mahatta areas of central and southern Jordan,
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Alaa Batayneh said,
according to Petra.  The company will start talks after two years on signing an
agreement with the government on producing shale oil, Batayneh
said. Global Oil Shale Holdings will start drilling wells within
three months and conduct environmental studies for as long as
two years, said David Argyle, the company’s General Manager,
according to the report.  Jordan says it holds the world’s fourth-largest reserves of
shale oil, a sedimentary rock containing solid bituminous
materials that are released as petroleum-like liquids when the
rock is heated. The government is turning to shale oil along
with nuclear, solar and wind power to help meet rising demand
for electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
