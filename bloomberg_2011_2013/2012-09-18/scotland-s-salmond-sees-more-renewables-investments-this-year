Scotland’s First Minister  Alex
Salmond  said he expects to make “significant” announcements
this year of renewable energy investments in Scotland where the
question of U.K. independence is not hampering investment.  “The massive investment we’re seeing in the Scottish
renewable energy industry indicates that far from being put off,
investors see in Scotland a government which is deeply committed
to renewable energy and indeed other parts of the energy
sectors,” Salmond said today in an interview in London.  The leader of the ruling  Scottish National Party  said he
expects to be able to announce investments from companies
“following on an international sense” after companies
including Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd,  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)  and  Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM)  detailed
plans to locate offshore wind plants in Scotland.  Scotland is seeking to get all of its electricity from
renewables by the end of the decade. Salmond is pursuing a
policy of breaking away from the U.K., planning a referendumon
the subject in 2014. Developers of energy projects including SSE
Plc have said the plans make it harder to invest in Scotland
until the outcome is clear.  “Investors are speaking very clearly and they see enormous
potential in the Scottish  energy industry , that’s why we’re
getting so many investments in the present moment,” Salmond
said, noting that Scotland, has about quarter of the wind and
tidal resource in Europe and will be able to export power and
meet demand for at home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
