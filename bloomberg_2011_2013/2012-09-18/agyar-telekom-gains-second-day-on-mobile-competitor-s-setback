Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose for a second day after a
Hungarian court annulled the results of a tender awarding mobile
frequency to a potential competitor.  The shares rose as much as 0.9 percent and traded 0.2
percent higher at 430 forint by 10:08 a.m. in Budapest, after a
2.4 percent jump yesterday. The benchmark BUX index of shares
slid 1 percent.  The court yesterday found “serious procedural law
infringements” in the tender for the country’s fourth mobile
frequency, which was won by a consortium of state-owned
companies. The three existing mobile service providers, Magyar
Telekom and the local units of Vodafone Plc and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , had
appealed the tender results.  “The stock may carry on yesterday’s momentum for the rest
of the week,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at the
broker unit of KBC Groep NV, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
