Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
biggest private-equity firm, agreed to buy Vivint Inc. for about
$2 billion to gain home-security, energy-management and solar-
power customers in more than 670,000 homes in  North America .  Blackstone is buying a majority stake in the Provo, Utah-
based home-security and solar-leasing company from initial
investors  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Jupiter Partners LLC and
Peterson Partners LP in a deal that should be completed by year-
end, founder and Chief Executive Officer Todd Pedersen said in
an interview today. He plans to keep his minority equity stake.  “We were a small company when they first invested in us in
2006,” Pedersen said. “They’ve done very well since then and
with Blackstone we’ll have the strong backing in the  capital
markets  that will help us scale up.”  Vivint started as a home-security and management business
in 1999 and last year expanded into offering solar-power leases.
These home-management services, excluding solar, reached more
than $30 million in recurring monthly revenue this year and
should climb to almost $35 million in the next three months,
Pedersen said.  Blackstone this year began seeking new revenue in
residential real estate, buying foreclosed single-family homes
in bulk and converting them to rental units. The New York-based
firm is the largest U.S. owner of hotel properties,  “With Blackstone there are some good synergies but that’s
more of an ancillary benefit,” Pedersen said.  Blackstone rose 1.9 percent to $15.23 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
