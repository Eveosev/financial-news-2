Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Wyeth unit must face
a class action by investors claiming the drugmaker hid negative
data on Pristiq, an anti-depressant marketed as the first non-
hormone menopause treatment.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan today granted a
request by two pension funds to sue on behalf of all investors
who bought Wyeth common stock from June 26, 2006, through July
24, 2007. The plaintiffs claim Wyeth misled them by failing to
disclose information about Pristiq’s effects on the heart and
liver, which delayed the drug’s approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.  The suit was filed in 2007 by the City of Livonia
Employees’ Retirement System. The plaintiffs, led by the
Pipefitters Union Local 537 Pension Fund, say Wyeth stock
dropped $5.70 after the company disclosed the negative effects
publicly. The investors are seeking unspecified damages.  Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug company, acquired Wyeth in
2009.  “The court’s decision is limited to preliminary procedural
issues,” Chris Loder, a spokesman for the New York-based
company, said in an e-mailed statement. “The opinion does not
address the merits of the case.” He said the company will fight
the lawsuit.  The case is City of Livonia Employees Retirement System v.
Wyeth, 07-cv-10329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
