A military court in Lebanon filed
charges including terrorism against members of the Meqdad clan,
which has kidnapped Syrian and Turkish nationals.  Members of the clan were among six people charged with
offenses including establishing an armed group to kidnap people,
the official National News Agency said. Some of them were
Syrian, the agency said.  Lebanese security forces arrested Maher Meqdad, a spokesman
for the Shiite Muslim clan, last week. He announced last month
that members of the clan had kidnapped Syrians and a Turkish
citizen, in retaliation for the seizure of a family member by
Syrian rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.  The Lebanese army freed the Syrian captives in a raid in
 Beirut  last week, while the Meqdad family handed the Turkish
hostage over to police. The kidnappings had led some Gulf states
to warn their citizens not to travel to  Syria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
