Tom Mundy, chief strategist of
Otkritie Financial Corp., the Russian brokerage taking over
Nomos Bank, quit less than two years after joining from
 Renaissance Capital .  Mundy, who was among at least a dozen people Otkritie hired
from Moscow-based RenCap, said by phone today that he resigned
for personal reasons. Alexey Karakhan, a spokesman for Otkritie,
confirmed Mundy’s departure and said the company is looking for
a replacement.  Mundy joined Otkritie in October 2010 along with Alexander Burgansky, a RenCap oil analyst, and senior bankers Igor Vayn
and Ruslan Babaev. Otkritie, partly owned by state-run lender
VTB Group, said last week it hired Ruben Aganbegyan from the
Micex-RTS stock exchange as chief executive officer.  Yoni Gluhovsky, a director of derivative sales in  London ,
left last month, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be named because the departure hasn’t
been announced. Marco Casas, a vice president of equity sales at
Otkritie in  New York , said he left the bank in July to take a
similar role at Macquarie Bank Ltd. Gluhovsky didn’t answer
calls to his mobile phone, and Karakhan couldn’t immediately
comment on the additional departures.  Otkritie plans to increase its stake in London-traded Nomos
to 100 percent within two years from about 20 percent now, the
Moscow-based lenders said last month. The combined company would
be  Russia ’s largest non-state bank after  Alfa Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
