A Metropolitan Museum of Art guard
accidentally shot himself in the leg this afternoon while
cleaning his gun in an employee locker room, a spokesman for the
Manhattan museum said.  “The public was never in any danger,” spokesman Harold Holzer said in a telephone interview. “We don’t have further
details, whether it was flesh or bone.”  The name of the guard, who’s been on staff for 24 years,
was not released. Holzer said a minority of the security staff
carry weapons. He declined to say where they’re assigned.  “The Met has always had a small force of armed guards,”
Holzer said, adding that it was the first time a gun was
discharged in the 20 years he’s worked at the museum.  The man is in stable condition at  New York-
Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center , said Brian Sessa, a
detective with the  New York City Police Department .  To contact the reporter of this story:
