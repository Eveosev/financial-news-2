The Serbian central bank sold euros
to support the dinar after it weakened 0.4 percent against
 Europe ’s common currency.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it sold 10
million euros ($13.2 million), acting for the first time since
April 6, to “enable the smooth functioning” of the market. The
bank started selling after the dinar dropped to 112 to the euro
in interbank deals, three traders with knowledge of the action
said, asking for anonymity in line with bank policies.  The National Bank of Serbia has sold 568.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar. It left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 9.5 percent on April 12 and
amended reserve-requirement rules, releasing foreign-currency
liquidity and draining dinars to stabilize the Serbian currency
and avoid pressures on inflation.  The central bank’s outstanding repo stock fell by 11
billion dinars this week to 78.9 billion dinars, the lowest
since August 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
