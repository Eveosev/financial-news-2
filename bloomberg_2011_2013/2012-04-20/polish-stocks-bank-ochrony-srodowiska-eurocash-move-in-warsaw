Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  slipped 0.2
percent to 2,227.46 at 12:58 p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA (BOS)  , the Polish state-owned
bank that finances environment protection projects, declined 2
percent to 47.89 zloty, the most since April 10, after saying it
set a share sale price below its maximum level.  Eurocash SA (EUR)  , Poland’s largest distributor of non-
durable consumer goods, lost 1.8 percent to 39.99 zloty, falling
for the first time in five days as a technical indicator
