Indian stocks dropped, ending a
four-day rally, on concern an interest-rate cut this week by the
 Reserve Bank of India  may be insufficient to spur growth.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  slid to a one-week low before its
earnings. Fourth-quarter profit may drop by the most in three
years, according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  declined to a three-week low. The RBI
cut its  repurchase rate  for the first time in three years on
April 17 to revive growth, and said inflation risks may limit
the room for further reductions.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.7 percent
to 17,373.84 at close. The loss pared the weekly rally to 1.6
percent. The S&P CNX Nifty Index lost 0.8 percent to 5,290.85.
April-delivery futures sank 6.7 percent to 5,000 intraday. The
slump was probably due to a trading error, said Sunil Pachisia,
vice president at Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd. The NSE was looking
into the matter, spokeswoman Divya Malik Lahiri said by phone.  “With the RBI not really holding out the promise of this
being the start of a full-blown rate-reduction cycle, it leaves
the market still unsure,” Vetri Subramaniam, head of equities
at Religare Asset Management Co., which has about $2 billion in
assets, said yesterday in a Bloomberg UTV interview in Mumbai.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  last month projected
record borrowing needs of 5.69 trillion rupees ($110 billion) to
plug a fiscal shortfall estimated at 5.1 percent of GDP in the
year that started April 1. The gap for the year will be 5.9
percent of GDP, wider than the 4.6 percent target set in 2011.  “The RBI was right in saying that the fiscal deficit is
tying its hands,” Pankaj Vaish, head of markets for  South Asia 
at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , said in an interview to Bloomberg UTV today.
“The RBI delivered a good rate cut and now we need to see the
promises on the fiscal front come through.”  UBS Downgrade  Any slippage in the deficit will have “implications” for
consumer prices, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said April 17.
Government data showed  inflation  slowed less than estimated in
March to 6.89 percent, a pace that is still the fastest among
the BRIC economies.  “We no longer see potential for big downside inflation
surprises or aggressive policy easing” in India, said Niall MacLeod, Asia equity strategist at  UBS AG (UBSN) , in a report dated
today. “Our preference is now  China , rather than India.” UBS
cut Indian equities to neutral from overweight.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
declines in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, climbed for the first time
this week today, gaining 3.8 percent to 20.09.  A total 791.33 million shares changed hands on the BSE and
NSE yesterday, lower than the daily average of 908.2 million in
the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings  Reliance Industries declined 1.5 percent to 730.9 rupees.
