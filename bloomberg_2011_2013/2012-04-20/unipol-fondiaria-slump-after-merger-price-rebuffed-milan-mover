Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  and
 Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA)  fell after the latter’s board rejected the
swap ratio proposed in a four-way merger involving the two
insurers.  Fondiaria,  Italy ’s No. 2 insurer, said it backed the merger
plan and will continue to pursue a transaction, though it wants
the terms reviewed, according to a statement from the company
late yesterday.  Separately, a 20 percent stake in  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) ,
which is also involved in the combination along with  Milano
Assicurazioni SpA (MI) , was seized by prosecutors amid a probe into
market manipulation, according to a person familiar with the
investigation. A spokeswoman for Premafin declined to comment.  Italy’s financial police said late yesterday it was seizing
a 20 percent stake in a large publicly traded company without
identifying it.  Unipol, based in Bologna, dropped 8.7 percent to 21.65
euros as of 9:32 a.m. in Milan today, while Fondiaria declined
8.5 percent to 96.3 euro cents before being suspended. Premafin
fell as much as 11 percent and Milano Assicurazioni dropped as
much as 4.8 percent.  Milano Assicurazioni is due to hold a board meeting today
to review the merger proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
