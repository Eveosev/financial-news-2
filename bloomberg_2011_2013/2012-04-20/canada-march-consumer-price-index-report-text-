The following is the text of
Canada’s consumer  price index  report for March released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 1.9% between March 2011 and March 2012,
following a 2.6% increase in February. This 0.7 percentage point
difference was largely the result of slower year-over-year
increases in prices for food and energy.  Food prices rose 2.2% in the 12 months to March, following
a 4.1% increase in February. This slower increase was the result
of a month-over-month decline in food prices in March 2012,
while a year earlier food prices had been on the rise.  The cost of energy advanced 5.1% in the 12 months to March,
after rising 7.2% in February. The year-over-year increase in
gasoline prices eased to 6.6% in March, following an 8.9% rise
in February. Electricity costs increased 5.3%, after rising 8.7%
the previous month.  The  Consumer Price Index  (CPI), excluding food and energy,
increased 1.5% in the 12 months to March. This increase followed
a 1.7% gain in February.  12-month change  Of the eight major components, six posted slower year-over-
year increases in March compared with February. The two
exceptions were recreation, education and reading; and alcoholic
beverages and tobacco products.  The main factors in the 1.9% increase in the All-items CPI
in March were higher prices in transportation and shelter.  The cost of transportation increased 3.8% in the 12 months
to March. In addition to gasoline, prices rose for passenger
vehicle insurance premiums and for the purchase of passenger
vehicles.  Shelter costs rose 1.6% compared with March 2011. Alongside
higher electricity prices, consumers paid 2.4% more in
homeowners’ replacement costs. Prices for natural gas continued
to decline.  Food prices increased 2.2% in the 12 months to March, led
by gains in food purchased from stores. Prices rose 5.8% for
meat and 6.1% for bread. In contrast, prices for fresh
vegetables declined 15.8%, the largest year-over-year decrease
since April 2008.  Prices for clothing and footwear increased 0.4% in the 12
months to March, following a 2.8% rise in February. This 2.4
percentage point difference was mostly attributable to year-
over-year declines in prices for women’s clothing.  The provinces  Year over year, consumer prices increased at a slower pace
in March than in February in every province.  In  Quebec , consumer prices rose 2.1% in the 12 months to
March, after rising 3.2% in February. The 1.1 percentage point
difference was largely the result of slower price increases in
food purchased from stores and gasoline.  Prices in Ontario went up 2.2% year over year in March,
following a 2.9% increase in February. This slower rate of
increase was largely attributable to smaller price gains in food
purchased from stores, clothing and footwear, and gasoline.  In British Columbia, prices rose 1.6% on a year-over-year
basis in March after increasing 1.7% the previous month. Prices
for gasoline increased 6.0%, after rising 4.2% in February.
British Columbia and Manitoba were the only two provinces in
which gasoline prices rose at a faster rate in the 12 months to
March than in the 12 months to February.  Seasonally adjusted monthly Consumer Price Index increases  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, consumer prices
increased 0.2% from February to March after increasing 0.1% from
January to February.  The index for recreation, education and reading rose 0.4%
in March and the transportation index increased 0.2%. Conversely,
the shelter index fell 0.2% and the index for food fell 0.3%.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of  Canada ’s core index
