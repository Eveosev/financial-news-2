Companies listed on the ChiNext
Board of the Shenzhen stock exchange will be delisted if they
are censured by the exchange three times over a three-year
period, the exchange said today in a statement.  The companies will also be removed from the board if their
share prices close below par values for 20 consecutive days or
net asset values are negative for the latest year, according to
the statement.  The exchange said it won’t support ChiNext companies to
regain a listing status by means of reverse takeovers. The
rules, which amend a plan announced in February, will come into
effect on May 1, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
