Recent rains have been
“beneficial” for farmers in  England  and  Wales , while more
precipitation is needed to end drought in parts of the country,
the U.K. Environment Agency said.  East Anglia, southeast England, and South and East
Yorkshire remain in drought, the London-based agency said in a
 statement  on its website today. Areas in the southwest and Wales
had 22 millimeters (0.87 inch) to 28 millimeters of rain this
week.  “While we’ve had some welcome rain this week, the
environmental drought affecting large parts of England could
last until Christmas,” Polly Chancellor, national drought co-
ordinator, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
