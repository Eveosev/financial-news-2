The U.S. auto-safety regulator said
it will hold a forum on  lithium-ion batteries  in electric cars
next month, almost a year after a  General Motors Co. (GM)  Chevrolet
Volt caught fire following crash-testing.  The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
announced today a meeting May 18 in  Washington  to convene
government officials and auto and battery-industry
representatives to talk about “safety considerations” for cars
powered by lithium-ion batteries. The meeting was  announced  in a
posting on the Federal Register’s website.  A Volt caught fire in June, three weeks after a crash test
at a NHTSA facility in  Wisconsin . Disclosure of the fire, which
NHTSA and GM initially didn’t make public, prompted the Detroit-
based automaker to offer to take back Volts leased by customers
and to Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson testifying before a
U.S. House committee in January.  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)  said last month it was recalling electric
batteries it made for Fisker Automotive Inc. and other
automakers after a $107,000 Fisker Karma shut down because of a
battery defect during testing by Consumer Reports magazine.  President  Barack Obama  has made development of electric
vehicles a priority, funding a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of
plug-in cars and providing billions of dollars in grants and
loans to companies for vehicle and battery development through
the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
