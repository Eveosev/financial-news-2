Following is the text of
 Canada ’s leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 0.4% in March, following a
0.7% rise in February. This was the index’s ninth consecutive
monthly increase. Of the 10 components, 8 advanced.  The financial components remained positive in March, with
both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the  money supply  increasing.
The average workweek increased for the sixth straight month,
while services employment resumed a year-long upward trend after
stalling in February. The housing index recovered, as both
existing home sales and starts rose. The United States leading
indicator increased for the second month in a row, supported by
its employment and financial components.  Manufacturing was mixed, with a gain in the ratio of
shipments to inventories offset by a decline in new orders.
Furniture and appliance sales posted a seventh consecutive
