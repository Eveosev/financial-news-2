The new Serbian government that
emerges from the May 6 election should swiftly revise the 2012
budget to cut the deficit and limit state borrowing,  Biznis 
reported, citing an International Monetary Fund official.  Keeping the budget under control will preserve investor
confidence, the monthly magazine cited IMF resident
representative Bogdan Lissovolik as saying. The measures adopted
by the outgoing government of Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic to
save 15.7 billion dinars ($187 million) and bring the budget gap
back toward its target for 2012 amid an economic slowdown are a
step in right direction, though they arenâ€™t sufficient, he said,
according to Biznis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
