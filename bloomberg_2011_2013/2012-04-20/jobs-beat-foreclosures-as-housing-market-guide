Employment levels may affect local
U.S. housing markets more than the number of foreclosed homes,
according to Shawn Snyder, a Citigroup Inc. economist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the performance of the National
Association of Home Builders/First American Improving Markets
Index, which Snyder cited in a report two days ago to support
his conclusion.  Housing is gaining ground in 101 metropolitan areas across
the country, according to this month’s index.  Florida  has nine,
more than any other state except  Texas , even though data from
the  Mortgage Bankers Association  show a bigger inventory of
foreclosures there than anywhere else.  Selling these homes “may not even be a prerequisite for
local recovery,” let alone a nationwide rebound, Snyder wrote.
The New York-based economist said that Florida’s improving
markets include Orlando and Tampa, which have two of the
country’s largest foreclosure stockpiles.  Joblessness in the state fell 1.7 percentage points for the
14 months ended in February, according to data compiled by the
Labor Department. Only three other states, Michigan, Missouri
and Utah, had bigger declines.  The NAHB/First American index, introduced last September,
tracks the number of metropolitan areas where employment,  house
prices  and permits to build single-family homes have risen from
lows for at least six months. About 360 locations are tracked.
Texas had 12 areas that showed improvement this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
