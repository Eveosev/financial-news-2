Gulf Coast  gasoline gained after an
upset in a catalytic hydrodesulfurization unit at Exxon Mobil
Corp.’s Beaumont refinery in Texas.  An instrument panel malfunction at the plant caused the
incident, Exxon said in a filing yesterday with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. “The refinery anticipates
no impact on production,” the company said in the filing.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.75 cent to 15.5 cents versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:09 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
0.96 cent to $3.0012 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor weakened 0.25 cent to a
discount of 6.38 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
