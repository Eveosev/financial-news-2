Kingboard Laminates Holdings Ltd. (1888) 
is targeting to complete a loan of at least HK$2.5 billion ($322
million) as early as today as it awaits a response from one more
potential lender, two people familiar with the matter said.  Kingboard hired Citigroup Inc.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and
Standard Chartered Plc to help arrange and underwrite the loan
last month, another person familiar with the matter said on
March 8. The loan was marketed in general syndication to other
lenders after those banks were hired, the people said.  Anna Cheung, an investor relations manager at the Hong
Kong-listed maker of laminate products, wasn’t immediately
available when called five times today at the company’s investor
relations department seeking comment on loan plans.  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., Tai Fung Bank Ltd., Taishin
Financial Holding Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Nanyang
Commercial Bank Ltd. joined at a mandated lead arranger level
with commitments of at least HK$150 million, a person familiar
with the matter said on April 17.  At least HK$2 billion in commitments has been received from
banks in syndication and the borrower is expected to decide this
week on the final size of the loan, that person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
