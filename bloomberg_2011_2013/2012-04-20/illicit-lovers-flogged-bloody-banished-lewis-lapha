After Susan Perry and Robert Watson
were found guilty by a jury, they were immediately transported
to prison, stripped to the waist, tied to a cart and flogged
through the streets until the blood ran freely down their backs.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Their crime? The two unmarried people had produced a baby.
It was 1612, in Westminster,  England , a time when all sex
outside marriage was strictly prohibited.  The Christian church, the state, local governments and
ordinary citizens had a stake in repressing every erotic
transgression with harsh penalties ranging from whipping to
death.  Two among many thousands punished, Perry and Watson were
also exiled from their community, never to see family and
friends again. They also lost their homes and livelihood.  It was not until the following century that most private
sexual encounters passed beyond the reach of  English law .  I spoke with Faramerz Dabhoiwala, author of “The Origins
of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution,” on the
following topics:  1. Sexual Repression  2. Prisons for Immorality  3. Enlightenment Attitudes  4. Celebrity Courtesans  5. Double Standard  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
