Investcorp Bank BSC (INVCORP) , a buyout firm
based in  Bahrain , may sell French industrial equipment supplier
the IPH Group, three people with knowledge of the plans said.  Rothschild is helping the private equity firm, based in
Manama, to evaluate options for the company, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private.
Investcorp has yet to make a decision on whether to go ahead
with a sale, which would fetch about 500 million euros ($660
million), they said.  Investcorp, which manages about $12 billion of assets,
bought Orefi Participation, a French industrial parts and
equipment manufacturer, in 2006 and combined it with
Autodistribution SA, a business it purchased the same year. The
Lyon-based company, which operates under the Orexad brand in
 France , has since expanded through acquisitions in Romania and
 Belgium . It  purchased  two German suppliers of mechanical power
transmission components, Zitec Industrietechnik GmbH and Wilhem
Jung GmbH, this year.  A spokesman for Investcorp declined to comment.  The IPH Group has sales of 760 million euros and employs
2,960 people, according to the companyâ€™s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
