PostNL NV (PNL) , the biggest Dutch postal
operator, fell the most in more than four months in Amsterdam
after Chief Executive Officer Harry Koorstra resigned in a
dispute with the company’s supervisory board.  PostNL fell 6.3 percent to 3.93 euros, the biggest drop
since Dec. 14, valuing the company at 1.54 billion euros ($2
billion). The shares have gained 60 percent this year.  Koorstra stepped down with immediate effect and the
supervisory board plans to appoint Herna Verhagen, the
management board member responsible for the parcels and
international business, as his successor, PostNL said after the
stock market closed yesterday. Koorstra had a “very
cumbersome” relationship lately with the supervisory board and
is leaving without any compensation as he considers principles
to be of “paramount importance,” he said in the statement.  “It’s sad to see Mr. Post leaving, having been in charge
for more than twenty years,” Andre Mulder, an Amsterdam-based
analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.
“Leaving without accepting any exit payment is an example of
outspoken Koorstra,” said Mulder, who has a buy recommendation
on PostNL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
