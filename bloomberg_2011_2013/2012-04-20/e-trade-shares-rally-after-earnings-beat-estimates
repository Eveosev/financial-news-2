E*Trade Financial Corp., (ETFC)  the online
brokerage that returned to profitability last year, gained the
most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after first-quarter
earnings exceeded the average analyst projection.  E*Trade rose 6.1 percent to $10.48 today, the most since
Jan. 3. The  shares  have gained 32 percent in 2012, about three
times the S&P 500’s advance of 9.6 percent.  Profit excluding some items in the quarter was 13 cents a
share, compared with a 9-cent analyst forecast, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Revenue was $489.4 million, compared with the
average analyst estimate of $472.5 million. The company said
loan-loss provisions fell 41 percent to $72 million from the
fourth quarter. The retail broker posted  four years  of losses
through 2010, partly because of the subprime mortgage market
collapse in 2007.  “E*Trade advanced its thesis of credit continuing to
improve and brokerage performing in-line with peers, though soft
trading activity keeps our 2012 earnings estimates flat,”
 Richard Repetto , an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in
 New York , wrote in a note.  Daily average revenue-generating trades fell 11 percent
from a year earlier to 157,000, according to the company’s
release yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
