Economic growth in Russia and
 Poland  will slow in the coming quarters as euro-area banks cut
lending to meet stricter capital requirements, Bank of America
Corp. said.  Russia’s expansion probably decelerated to 4.6 percent in
the first quarter from 4.8 percent in the previous three months,
while Poland’s slowed to 3.6 percent from 4.3 percent,  David Hauner , Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s London-based head of
economics for emerging Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, wrote
today in an e-mailed note.  “With stalling activity in the quarters ahead, emerging
Europe, the Middle East and Africa is likely to underperform the
global cycle,” Hauner wrote. The reason is “the region’s
exposure to euro-zone deleveraging. We remain negative on
foreign-exchange and local debt markets in the months ahead.”  The  International Monetary Fund  this week raised its 2012
global growth forecast to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent in
January. Still, recent manufacturing surveys suggest slower
growth in Russia and Poland, according to Hauner.  Poland’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by HSBC
Holding Plc and Markit Economics, fell to 50.1 points in March
from 52.2 in January. Russia’s index was unchanged from January
at 50.8, with HSBC calling manufacturing expansion “sub-par.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
