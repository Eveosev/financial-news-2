Serbiaâ€™s current-account deficit
widened 47.1 percent in the first two months of 2012 from the
same period last year to 667.9 million euros ($882.02 million)
because of a growing trade deficit and capital outflows.  Foreign direct investment fell 399.9 million euros, while
portfolio investors pulled 68.4 million euros out of the Balkan
nation, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
