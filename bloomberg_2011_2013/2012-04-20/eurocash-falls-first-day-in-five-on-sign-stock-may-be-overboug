Eurocash SA (EUR) , Poland’s largest
distributor of non-durable consumer goods, dropped for the first
time in five days as a technical indicator suggested the stock’s
rally was overdone.  The shares tumbled as much as 3.1 percent to 39.46 zloty,
and traded 1.8 percent lower at 12:34 p.m. in Warsaw.  Eurocash’s 14-day  relative strength index  stood at 76 at
the close yesterday. A reading above 70 indicates to some
technical analysts a security may decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
