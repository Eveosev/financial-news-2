Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , operator of the
nation’s biggest onshore oil field, posted an 11 percent decline
in profit that missed analyst estimates.  Net income  fell to 21.9 billion rupees ($421 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 24.6 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, said in a
statement today. The median  estimate  of 32 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was a profit of 23.7 billion rupees.  The company lost 2.2 billion rupees after currency
fluctuations, compared with 380.1 million rupees a year earlier,
Cairn India said. The levy on crude oil sales increased to 4
billion rupees from 2.7 billion.  Cairn India  shares  have climbed 11 percent this year,
trailing the 12 percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive
Index. (SENSEX)  The stock fell 0.9 percent to 347.55 rupees at the close
in Mumbai, before the earnings were announced.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , a metals and mining company based in
London with no experience in oil and gas production, and unit
 Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  completed the acquisition of a 59 percent stake in
Cairn India from shareholders, including  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , for
$8.67 billion in December, 16 months after announcing the deal
in August 2010.  Approval for the takeover from India’s cabinet on June 30
was on condition royalty will be included in the cost of field
development, which can be recovered from sales. State-run Oil &
Natural Gas Corp., Cairn’s partner with a 30 percent stake in
the Rajasthan block, paid the entire royalty since production
started in August 2009.  Cairn India sells oil at rates linked to Brent crude oil
prices, unlike ONGC, which is required to bear part of the
country’s fuel subsidy. Brent crude in  London  averaged 12
percent higher at $118.45 a barrel in the quarter ended March 31
compared with a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
