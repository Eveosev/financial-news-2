Eric Chavez  hit two of the Yankees’
five solo home runs as New York won 6-2 against the Red Sox in a
game marking the 100th birthday of Boston’s Fenway Park.  Today’s contest at the oldest stadium in Major League
Baseball came on the centennial of the first official game at
the park. That game 100 years ago was between the Red Sox and
the New York Highlanders, since renamed the Yankees.  Alex Rodriguez, Nick Swisher and Russell Martin also hit
home runs for the Yankees (8-6). David Ortiz homered for Boston
(4-9).  Ivan Nova (3-0) got the win, allowing two runs on seven
hits in six innings. Red Sox starter  Clay Buchholz  (1-1), who
allowed all five homers, took the loss.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
