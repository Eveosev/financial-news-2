E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a
Hungarian renewable-energy and heating company, fell for a third
day after saying yesterday it was starting a “restructuring
plan” to address accounting errors.  The shares retreated as much as 8.4 percent, the most this
month, to 2,130 forint and traded at 2,188 forint at 10:03 a.m.
in Budapest, the biggest decliner today in the 11-member
benchmark BUX  gauge . E-Star dropped 4.2 percent yesterday.  “After the hammering yesterday, we only expect a
substantial rebound in the shares once the accounting problems
of the past year or more are really settled,”  Akos Kuti , a
Budapest-based analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote
in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
