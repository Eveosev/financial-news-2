Germany’s eastern states want to
block cuts to solar subsidies implemented by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government this month, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing Saxony-Anhalt’s Prime Minister Reiner
Haselhoff.  The states represented in parliament’s upper chamber or
Bundesrat have the power to slow down implementation of the
cuts, but may not be able to get a majority to stop them, the
newspaper said. The states want to hold talks with Merkel at the
end of May, it said.  Solar companies with plants in the eastern states including
insolvent  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  have reduced jobs
since subsidies were reduced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
