Tanker-construction slippage, a
measure of the rate at which new vessels join the fleet compared
with estimates, was 30 percent in the first quarter, McQuilling
Services LLC, a New York-based shipping consultant estimated.  There were 57 vessels that should have joined the fleet
during the period and 40 did, it said in a report sent by e-mail
yesterday. Normal slippage is about 5 percent, it said.  Owners are canceling and delaying orders, not taking up
options to have tankers built and having different vessels
constructed instead, McQuilling said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
