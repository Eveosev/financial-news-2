Hong Kong  Chief Executive-elect
Leung Chun-ying appointed the former commissioner of the city’s
anti-corruption body to head his office.  Fanny Law, who was also previously the city’s secretary for
education and manpower, will be “responsible for the overall
supervision of the office and liaison with political groups and
different sectors of the community,” the government said in a
statement. She will head the office until June 30, it said.  Leung, a former property surveyor who will begin his five-
year term on July 1, has pledged to narrow the city’s income gap
and preserve the city’s freedom. He also needs to polish the
government’s tarnished image as the anti-corruption bureau
conducts investigations into Rafael Hui Si-yan, a former No. 2
official, and  Donald Tsang , the current chief executive.  Law entered government employment in 1975 and was permanent
secretary for education and manpower from 2002 to 2006. She was
appointed the commissioner of the  Independent Commission Against
Corruption  in October, 2006, and resigned in June, 2007, after
an inquiry found she interfered with academic freedom in her
previous position.  The commission of inquiry was set up to investigate the
allegation that from 2002 to 2005, Law requested  Paul Morris ,
resident of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, to fire four
academics after they published stories in local media
criticizing Hong Kong’s education policy. Law denied the
allegation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
