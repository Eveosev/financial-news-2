Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
biggest lender by market value, headed for its highest in almost
10 months as first-quarter earnings jumped.  The stock rose 2.27 percent to 15.76 naira as of 2:11 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, on course for its strongest
level on a closing basis since June 23. The shares have climbed
11 percent this year compared with the 4.5 percent advance in
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange   All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   Guaranty’s net income grew to 19.3 billion naira ($123.4
million) in the first quarter through March from 14.3 billion
naira a year ago, the Lagos-based bank said in statement
published on the Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website yesterday.  “We see the shares adding further gains over the coming
days,” due to the “better-than-expected results, driven by a
combination of strong funding income which beat our forecast by
9 percent,” Olubunmi Asaolu, an equity analyst at FBN Capital
Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today.  Guaranty’s net income in 2011 surged to 52.65 billion naira
from 38.35 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based bank
said March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
