Cameroon,  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer, revised export figures for the beans in
February, changing the data to show an increase of 0.4 percent
from a year earlier.  Shipments in the month were unchanged at 9,702 metric tons.
For the same period of the previous year, exports were 9,662
tons, according to the Cocoa and Coffee Board. Earlier, the
Douala-based board said the data showed the February figure more
than tripled from a year earlier. No reason was given for the
change in today’s e-mailed report.  A total of 159,494 tons has been exported since the start
of the season, compared with 183,665 tons shipped in the
previous year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
