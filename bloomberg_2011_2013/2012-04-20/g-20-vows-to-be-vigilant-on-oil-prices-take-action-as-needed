The Group of 20 richest nations,
which includes four of the world’s five biggest oil producers,
vowed to remain “vigilant” about high crude prices and take
action if needed to ease price pressures.  “Vigilant of high  oil prices , G-20 members stand ready to
carry out additional actions as needed and welcome the
commitments by producing countries to ensure adequate supply,”
G-20 finance ministers and central bankers said in a draft
statement to be released after talks in Washington. The
statement was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Oil rose as high as $110.55 on March 1, an increase of 47
percent from October’s low of $74.95, as  Iran  threatened to
close the  Strait of Hormuz  at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the
transit point for about 20 percent of globally traded oil.  Oil declined 3.8 percent last month after the European
Union said it would resume talks with Iran over its nuclear
program for the first time in 15 months.  Saudi Arabia , the
world’s largest oil producer and a G-20 member, has pledged to
meet global demand.  Futures for May delivery rose $1.57, or 1.5 percent, to
$103.84 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 10:49
a.m.  The G-20 said in the draft statement it will continue to
enhance the transparency and functioning of energy markets, in
part by improving the database of the  Joint Organisations Data
Initiative , phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and look
at options to mitigate the economic impact of “excessive”
commodity prices.  The IMF will report on these policy options at a meeting of
G-20 leaders in June, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
