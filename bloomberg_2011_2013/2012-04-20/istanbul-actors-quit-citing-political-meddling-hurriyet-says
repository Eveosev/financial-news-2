Istanbul’s municipal theater has
been hit by a wave of resignations, as actors and directors
object to an effort by local politicians to take over its
management, Hurriyet newspaper said.  Kenan Isik, an actor who advises Mayor Kadir Topbas on
cultural issues, quit yesterday following the resignations of
art director Aysenil Samlioglu and her team, the Istanbul-based
newspaper reported. They are objecting to legislation that
places the theater’s administration in the control of a
committee appointed by the municipality, Hurriyet said.  Actors oppose the legislation because they don’t want
politicians to have a say in artistic decisions, Hurriyet
reported. Topbas pledged that there would be no interference and
people employed at the theater would continue to work as before,
Hurriyet said. The mayor is from Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s Islamist-rooted party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
