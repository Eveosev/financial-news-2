Turkeyâ€™s Finance Ministry is
increasing inspection of luxury vehicle sales for evidence of
 tax evasion ,  Milliyet  reported, citing Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek.  The ministry is evaluating sales documents and tax
statements from January 2007 to December 2011 after a
preliminary inspection found sales figures were often
underreported, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
