Russia’s richest man  Alisher
Usmanov  may quit business in 2016, before Vladimir Putin’s
six-year presidential term finishes, according to an interview
published in  Forbes Russia  magazine.  Billionaire Usmanov, who holds stakes in Internet companies
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Mail.Ru Group Ltd (MAIL) , told Forbes he is
considering retirement from “mercenary affairs” at the age
when Prophet Muhammad died, to focus on philanthropy. The
businessman, valued at $19 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires
Index, turned 58 in September.  Usmanov told Forbes his friends, lawmaker Andrey Skoch and
Iranian-born accountant Farhad Moshiri, will continue running
his business. He proposed uniting their assets into a new
company, USM Holding, where Skoch and Moshiri may get 30 percent
and 10 percent, respectively, according to the Moscow-based
edition of Forbes.  Usmanov and his partners control Russian iron-ore producer
 Metalloinvest (METIN) , 31 percent of the country’s second-biggest
mobile-phone operator OAO Megafon and part of London’s Arsenal
soccer club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
