Volatility for oil options expiring
in June fell to the lowest level in more than a year as
underlying futures rose for the first time in three days.  Implied volatility for June at-the-money options, a measure
of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of options
prices, was 24.3 percent as of 5:15 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , versus 25.6 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 78 cents to settle at
$103.05 a barrel on the Nymex. Crude since April 4 has traded in
a range of $100.68 to $105.07.  Crude for June delivery added $1.16 to $103.88. May futures
expired today.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $100 puts, which lost 45 cents to $1.38 a barrel at
5:15 p.m. with 1,934 contracts trading. June $135 calls were the
second-most active with 1,490 lots changing hands. They rose 1
cent to 5 cents.  Calls accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Calls accounted for 50.2 percent of the 110,694 trades in
