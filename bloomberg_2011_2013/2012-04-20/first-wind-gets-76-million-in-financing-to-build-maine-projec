First Wind Holdings LLC, a closely
held energy developer, received $76 million in financing to
build a wind farm in Maine.  Union Bank NA, a unit of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306) , provided a $70 million non-recourse construction loan and
$6 million in letters of credit, Boston-based First Wind said
today in a statement.  First Wind’s 34-megawatt Bull Hill project in Hancock
County will use 19  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  1.8-megawatt turbines
and is scheduled to begin delivering electricity to  Northeast
Utilities (NU)  by the end of 2012.  Union Bank will buy Bull Hill when it’s complete and lease
it back to First Wind, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
