Iraq will begin operating a second
offshore mooring facility for crude exports from the  Persian
Gulf , Dhia Jaafar, director general of Southern Oil Co., said.  The new single-point mooring unit, with a capacity of
900,000 barrels a day, will start pumping at noon today, Jaafar
said in a phone interview from Basra. It is the second of four
units planned.  Iraq’s production capacity from the southern region will
increase to 2.75 million barrels a day at the end of this year
from 2.15 million, he said. The nation’s export capacity from
southern terminals and the two offshore facilities are at 3.6
million barrels, according to Jaafar.  A third mooring facility will be ready “within a few
months” and would be used if exports increase, he said. Deputy
Prime Minister for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said in
December that a fourth unit will be in place next year.  Iraq is the third-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, behind  Saudi Arabia  and  Iran . The
nation’s output has been rising steadily after years of
conflict, sanctions and sabotage. It holds the world’s fifth-
largest crude deposits that also include Canadian  oil sands ,
according to data from BP Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
