Hess Corp. was sued by the U.S. and
 New Jersey  governments over air emissions at its petroleum
refinery in  Port Reading , New Jersey, and is expected to settle
the case today, a Justice Department spokesman said.  Hess violated federal and state laws in making a “major
modification” to the refinery that resulted in a “significant
net emissions increase” of nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide and particulates, according to the complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in  Newark , New Jersey.  A settlement is expected to be filed today, said Justice
Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle.  Jon Pepper , a Hess
spokesman, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  The refinery, which has a crude oil capacity of 65,000
barrels a day, was cited for violations at a fluid catalytic
cracking unit catalyst regenerator, a sulfur recovery plant, and
at flaring devices and heaters and boilers, according to the
complaint. New York-based Hess failed to operate those
facilities in a “manner consistent with good air pollution
control practice” and also failed to comply with benzene waste
requirements, government officials said in the complaint.  The complaint, by the U.S. Justice Department’s
environmental and natural resources division and New Jersey
Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa, seeks civil penalties of as
much as $37,500 a day for the various violations.  The case is U.S. v.  Hess Corp. (HES) , U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
