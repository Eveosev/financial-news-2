Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  Chief Executive
Officer Brian Roberts earned $26.9 million in salary, stock
options and other compensation last year, a decline of 14
percent from 2010.  Roberts’s compensation topped that of Executive Vice
President Stephen Burke, who is also CEO of the company’s NBC
Universal unit and received $23.7 million in 2011, down 32
percent from the previous year, according to a company filing.  Comcast rose 7.9 percent in 2011 as the Philadelphia-based
company limited video subscriber losses and added Internet and
phone customers. NBC’s broadcast unit lagged  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s CBS,
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox networks in prime-
time ratings, hampering advertising revenue in the segment.  Roberts earned $31.1 million in 2010 and $27.2 million in
2009 according to the filing. Burke received $34.7 million in
2010 and $34 million in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
