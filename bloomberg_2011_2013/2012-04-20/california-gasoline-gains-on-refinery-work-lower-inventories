California-blend gasoline
strengthened against futures after  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it plans
to flare gases at its Wilmington refinery through April 24 and
distillate inventories touched a seven-month low on the West
Coast last week.  The 97,000-barrel-a-day Tesoro Wilmington refinery in
 Southern California  will begin flaring gases at midnight local
time, according to a filing with the  South Coast Air Quality
Management District . The flaring isn’t related to a breakdown,
the filing said.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles rose
0.5 cent to a premium of 3.5 cents a gallon against futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:36 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  San
Francisco  Carbob climbed 0.5 cent to a premium of 7.5 cents a
gallon against gasoline futures.  Gasoline inventories  on the West Coast, known as the Padd 5
region, dropped 1.2 million barrels, or 3.9 percent, to 29.7
million barrels in the week to April 13, the Energy Department
said. That’s the lowest level since Dec. 30.  Distillate fuel oil inventories  on the West Coast tumbled
to the lowest level since November, falling by 803,000 barrels,
or 6.2 percent, to 12.2 million barrels, the department said.  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  slipped 0.25 cent to a premium
of 6.75 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in San Francisco increased 0.75 cent to a 12-cent
premium.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon  was
unchanged at a 5.5-cent premium against gasoline futures. Low-
sulfur diesel  there  fell 1 cent to a premium of 20.5 cents a
gallon versus heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
