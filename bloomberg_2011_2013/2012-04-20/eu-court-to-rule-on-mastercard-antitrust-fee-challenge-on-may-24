MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s challenge against
a European Union decision forcing it to revise how it calculates
a transaction fee paid by retailers will be decided by an EU
court next month.  The EU’s General Court will rule on May 24 on MasterCard’s
appeal against a 2007 decision by the European Commission over
transaction fees on cross-border credit-card payments, according
to a filing on the tribunal’s website. The case will test
whether such levies are unfair to retailers and customers.  Any decision in the case can be appealed at the region’s
top tribunal, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  The case is: T-111/08, MasterCard and others v. European
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
