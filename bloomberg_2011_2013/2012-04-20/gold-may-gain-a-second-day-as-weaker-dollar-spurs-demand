Gold may gain for a second day in
 New York  as a weaker dollar spurs demand for the metal as an
alternative asset and as commodities rise.  The euro climbed against the dollar amid speculation Group
of 20 officials meeting with the  International Monetary Fund 
today will step up efforts to quell Europe’s debt crisis. Other
commodities advanced as a report showed German business
confidence unexpectedly increased for a sixth month in April.  “The dollar is a bit weaker,”  Peter Fertig , owner of
Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany , said
today by phone. “This is giving some support,” as are higher
raw-materials prices, he said.  Gold for June delivery gained 0.2 percent to $1,645.50 an
ounce by 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices are down 0.9
percent this week. Bullion for immediate delivery rose 0.1
percent to $1,644.43 in London.  Holdings in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  were
little changed yesterday at 2,394.1 metric tons, about 0.7
percent below the March 13 record, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Prices are up 5 percent in 2012 after advancing for 11
consecutive years.  “There isn’t much investor and physical interest at the
moment,” said Xiang Nan, an analyst at CITICS Futures Co., a
unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage. “A lot of money is
sidelined as we get mixed messages from data, and gold just gets
pushed or pulled by what’s happening to other asset classes.”  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in a speech
in Washington the nation still needs monetary stimulus. Deputy
Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said two days ago the central bank
is ready to implement additional easing if necessary to shore up
the economy.  Silver for July delivery was little changed at $31.84 an
ounce. Palladium for June delivery gained 0.3 percent to $665.10
an ounce and is up 2.8 percent this week. Platinum for July
delivery was 0.3 percent higher at $1,583.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
