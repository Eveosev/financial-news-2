Matt Every takes a three-shot lead
into today’s second round of the Texas Open after shooting a
course-record 9-under-par 63 while seeking his breakthrough win
on golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour .  Every, a 28-year-old Floridian, had a bogey-free start to
the tournament at the TPC San Antonio yesterday. Hunter Haas,
who had an eagle at the 18th hole, is second, a shot ahead of
2003 British open champion Ben Curtis, who is 5 under.  Every’s lead is the biggest after the first round since
Jesper Parnevik took a four-stroke advantage into the second day
of the 2007 edition. The previous course-record score of 8 under
was shared by  Ryan Palmer  and Scott Percy.  Every, in his 40th start since joining the PGA Tour in
2010, has logged three top-eight finishes this year, including a
tie for eighth place at last week’s RBC Heritage.  In the past 12 years, only 2000 champion Justin Leonard and
2005 winner Robert Gamez have claimed the Texas Open title
having led after the first round.  Kelly Kraft , who won the U.S. Amateur last year, had a 1-
under-par 71 in his first start as a professional. In two events
on tour as an amateur this year, Kraft missed the cut at the
Arnold Palmer Invitational and at the  Masters Tournament .  To contact the reporter on this story:
