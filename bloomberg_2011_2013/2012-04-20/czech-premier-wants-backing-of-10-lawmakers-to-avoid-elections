Czech Premier Petr Necas will
cooperate with a group of lawmakers who split from the smallest
coalition party only if they guarantee at least 10 votes backing
the government, Necas’s party said.  Necas gave Deputy Premier Karolina Peake, who left the
Public Affairs Party this week, until April 23 to secure the
support of enough members of parliament to guarantee a majority
for the Cabinet, or he will initiate snap elections to be held
in June. Necas’s Civic Democrats this week began a formal
procedure to end coalition ties with Public Affairs.  “The solution to the situation is only an institutional
accord based on cooperation of three parliamentary caucuses,”
the Civic Democrats said in a statement late yesterday.
According to law, at least 10 deputies are needed to create a
parliamentary caucus.  The ruling coalition splintered as Necas’s 20-month-old
government prepares legislation including tax increases and a
cut in spending on pensions needed to trim the fiscal  deficit  to
within the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product next year.  The plan has helped attract investors into Czech bonds,
pushing the government’s borrowing costs to a record low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
