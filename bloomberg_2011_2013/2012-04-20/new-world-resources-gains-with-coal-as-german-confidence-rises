New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest coking-coal producer, gained after business
confidence in  Germany  unexpectedly improved, boosting investor
demand for commodities and other riskier assets.  The stock climbed 1.9 percent to 127.83 koruna by 1:17 p.m.
in Prague, making it the second-best performer in the 14-member
 PX (PX)  equity index, which rose 0.6 percent today.  European stocks rose after the Munich-based Ifo institute
said its business-climate index increased to a nine-month high,
adding to evidence the region’s largest economy and the biggest
buyer of Czech exports can weather the debt crisis. Benchmark
 coal  derivatives added 0.5 percent to $111.75 a metric ton in
the Netherlands, snapping a five-day fall to a three-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
