 Emerging-market equity funds
posted an outflow of $712 million in the week ended April 18,
Citigroup Inc. said.                 The consecutive weekly outflows from  Asia  excluding Japan
funds since early March have erased all the inflows in early
2012, analysts led by  Markus Rosgen  wrote in a report today,
citing data compiled by EPFR Global. The key losers of  
flows since March were South Korea and Taiwan, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
