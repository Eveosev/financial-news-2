SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. , a
brokerage unit of  Japan ’s second-biggest bank, was ordered to
improve its business by the country’s financial regulator after
leaking information ahead of a share sale.  SMBC Nikko must submit a report by May 18 showing who is
responsible for the rule breach and how the firm will improve
compliance and internal controls, the Financial Services Agency
said in a statement in  Tokyo  today.  The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission
recommended a week ago that the FSA penalize SMBC Nikko after it
found 23 sales staff disclosed information to 34 clients before
an unidentified company’s announcement of an equity offering.  The breach may affect business at the brokerage.  Japan Housing Finance Agency  said on April 17 that it
dropped SMBC Nikko as a manager of its bond sale. The agency had
hired the Tokyo-based firm, a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. (8316) , along with Nomura Holdings Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  SMBC Nikko may also be excluded from Japan Airlines Co.’s
planned initial public offering this year. Enterprise Turnaround
Initiative Corp. of Japan, the fund holding about 97 percent of
Japan Air, is “now carefully considering how to respond,”
spokesman Ryu Shimizu said on April 19, when asked about the
rule violation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
