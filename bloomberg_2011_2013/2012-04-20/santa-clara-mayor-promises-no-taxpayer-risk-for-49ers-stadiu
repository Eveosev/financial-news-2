The mayor of Santa Clara,
 California , welcomed the  San Francisco 49ers  to his Silicon
Valley city with a promise that taxpayers won’t be left footing
the bill for a planned $1.18 billion stadium.  The National Football League team held a groundbreaking
ceremony last night, complete with cheerleaders and bands, at
what will be the 50-yard line for a field scheduled to open in
2014.  Critics of the stadium plan have questioned whether Santa
Clara, a city of 116,500 located about 45 miles (72 kilometers)
south of San Francisco, overreached by borrowing $950 million
for the project from firms led by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Mayor Jamie Matthews said in an interview after the
ceremony that taxpayers are protected because the 68,500-seat
arena will be owned by the  Santa Clara  Stadium Authority, a city
affiliate set up to arrange the loan and finance the work.  “The city’s not taking on a penny of debt, the stadium
authority is taking it on,” Matthews said. “This is a day of
celebration and that’s why we’re here.”  The 49ers have been working since 2006 to move to Santa
Clara from their home in wind-swept  Candlestick Park  in San
Francisco. In December, two power outages at the 52-year-old
stadium held up a nationally televised game.  “This is surreal,” 49ers Chief Executive Officer Jed York
told reporters before the ceremony. “You see people when they
win a championship and they don’t realize what they’ve done yet.
I don’t realize what I’ve done yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
