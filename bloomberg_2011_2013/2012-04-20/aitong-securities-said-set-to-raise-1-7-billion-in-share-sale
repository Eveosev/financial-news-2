Haitong Securities Co. (600837) , the  third-
biggest  publicly traded Chinese brokerage, raised HK$13 billion
($1.7 billion) in  Hong Kong ’s biggest first-time stock sale
since December.  The company, already listed in  Shanghai , sold about 1.23
billion shares at HK$10.60 apiece, near the bottom of a range
marketed to investors, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday. The shares were originally offered at HK$10.48
to HK$11.18 each, according to the offering prospectus.  Haitong’s share sale is about 40 percent bigger than the
total amount raised in first-time offerings in Hong Kong in the
first quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Initial share
sales in the city are off to their slowest start to a year since
2009, with investors steering clear of new equity even after the
benchmark  stock index  advanced 14 percent.  Haitong, based in Shanghai, has a market value of 85
billion yuan ($13.5 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The country’s two largest brokerages are Beijing-
based Citic Securities Co. and GF Securities Co. in Guangzhou,
the data show.  The offer price values Haitong at about 1.31 times its
estimated 2012 book value, compared with 1.67 times for Citic
Securities’ Hong Kong-traded shares, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Haitong will begin trading in Hong Kong April 27.  Offer Discount  Citic Securities raised about $1.7 billion in a first-time
share sale in Hong Kong in September. The stock has gained 24
percent from its offer price of HK$13.30.  Haitong’s offer price is 17 percent below its close of
10.33 yuan yesterday in Shanghai. It also implies a 10 percent
discount to the volume-weighted average price over the last 20
trading days, adjusted for a dividend to be paid to investors in
 China . Chinese regulators typically require state-owned
companies that sell shares overseas to cap the discount to their
domestic share prices at 10 percent.  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) , the world’s biggest
listed jewelry chain, raised about $2 billion in a Hong Kong
initial sale in December. The company’s stock has fallen 21
percent from the offer price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
