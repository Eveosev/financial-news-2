Parlux Fragrances Inc.’s
$170 million sale to  Perfumania Holdings Inc. (PERF)  was completed
April 18 after a Delaware Chancery Court judge rejected
shareholders’ efforts to block it, according to documents made
public today.  Investors in  Fort Lauderdale , Florida-based Parlux sued
claiming directors should have sought higher bids for the maker
of celebrity brands including  Paris Hilton  perfume.  Directors “did negotiate presumably what they believed was
the best value available,” and, “Where there is no other
bidder and no coercion, an injunction risks stripping the
stockholders of their choice to realize a premium on their
shares with little corresponding  benefit,” Judge Sam Glasscock
said in a just-released April 5 telephone-ruling transcript.  Parlux announced Dec. 23 it would sell the company to
Perfumania, of Bellport,  New York , according to a company
statement at the time. Under terms of the sale, Parlux investors
received $4 in cash plus 0.20 share of Perfumania or 0.53333 of
the buyer, for each share they owned.  “We are pleased with the strong support that both
Perfumania and Parlux shareholders gave this transaction and are
excited about the opportunity to create additional value for our
shareholders, vendors, customers and employees,” Mike Katz,
Perfumania’s president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement after the buyout.  The case is Dias v. Purches, CA 7199, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
