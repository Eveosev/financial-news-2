Shandong Helon Co. (000677)  said it will
have difficulty paying overdue bank loans, just days after the
Chinese synthetic fiber maker paid off its 400 million yuan
($63.4 million) bond.  Its net loss reached 1 billion yuan last year, the company,
based in Weifang in  China ’s eastern province of Shandong, said
in a stock exchange statement today. The manufacturer will also
face difficulty extending current bank loans, it said.  The company didn’t give a source of the funds for its April
15 payment on the bond. Shandong Helon reported a first-quarter
loss of 149 million yuan today.  The manufacturer had negative net assets of 804 million
yuan at the end of 2011, it said.  The company also said it has guaranteed 1.43 billion yuan
of other borrowers’ debt.  Overdue loans at the company rose by 40 million yuan
between March 22 and April 10, it said in an April 11 statement,
accounting for 582 percent of its net assets.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
