The U.S. government said it will
allow publication of research by scientists who re-engineered
the avian influenza virus to make it more lethal.  The research is critical to understanding and detecting
bird flu strains, Health and Human Services Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius  and  Francis Collins , director of the  National
Institutes of Health , said today in a  statement . Publication has
been on hold since December, when Sebelius’s agency asked the
journals Science and Nature to censor some data in the interest
of national security.  Groups led by the two scientists -- Yoshihiro Kawaoka of
the  University of Wisconsin  and Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical
Center in Rotterdam -- engineered the H1N1 virus to be more
transmissible between ferrets, mammals whose response to the flu
is most like humans. Science, which is holding the Fouchier
paper, is waiting until after a meeting of Dutch regulators in
 The Hague  next week before deciding when it will publish the
work, Kathy Wren, a spokeswoman for the journal, said by phone.  “This information has clear value to national and
international public health preparedness efforts and must be
shared,” Collins said in the statement.  The U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity
recommended in March that Sebelius and Collins approve
publication. A World Health Organization panel met in Geneva in
February and recommended publication of the studies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
