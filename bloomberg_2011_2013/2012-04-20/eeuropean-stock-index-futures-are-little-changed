European stocks rose as German
business confidence unexpectedly gained and U.S. companies from
General Electric Co. to Schlumberger Ltd. reported earnings that
beat estimates, offsetting higher yields on Spanish bonds.  A gauge of European banks was among the best performers of
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx  Europe  600.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
and Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s largest lenders, advanced more
than 1.5 percent.  William Hill Plc (WMH)  climbed to its highest price

recommendation for the stock. Nokia Oyj slid 4.4 percent after
losing a patent lawsuit ruling in a German court.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 percent to 257.79 at

percent so far in April on renewed concern that the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen.  “There seems to be a tug-of-war between better first-
quarter corporate earnings sending a positive signal and concern
regarding the  European (SXXP)  debt crisis as a negative,” said  Manish Singh , the London-based head of investment at Crossbridge
Capital, which has more than $2 billion under management.
“There is a clear lack of conviction in the market. For every
piece of good news, there is always a negative that overrides
it. Worries about Europe still hang as a spectre, ready to fall
without a warning.”  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.5 percent yesterday, after U.S.
reports showed sales of previously owned houses dropped

obtained by Bloomberg News.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  is seeking more
than $400 billion in new reserves to increase a lending capacity
of about $380 billion and this week won promises of support from
 Japan  to  Denmark .  “Countries have to take measures,” Lagarde told Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness With Margaret Brennan” in  Washington .
“I am in charge of improving the stability and I need to have
the umbrella in case the clouds break into a nasty rain.”  National Benchmarks  National benchmark indexes gained in 16 of the 18 western-
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent, while the
