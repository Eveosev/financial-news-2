Asian currencies posted their
biggest weekly decline in a month, led by  India ’s rupee, as
weaker-than-forecast U.S. economic data and  Europe ’s debt crisis
damped demand for riskier assets.  More Americans filed claims for jobless benefits in the
week ended April 14 and sales of previously owned homes
unexpectedly dropped in March, reports showed this week. Spanish

securities on April 19. The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks

slowing U.S. recovery are making it a bit hard to add risk
positions,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based trader at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  The rupee slid 1.5 percent this week to 52.0850 per dollar
yesterday in Mumbai, the biggest drop since the five days ended

0.4 percent to 3.0643.  Global funds sold $1.23 billion more Indonesian, South
Korean and Taiwanese shares than they bought this week, exchange

drop to 370,000. Purchases of homes fell 2.6 percent to a 4.48

separate auction, up from 1.78 percent on March 15.  China ’s yuan declined 0.09 percent this week to 6.3085 per
dollar after the nation widened the currency’s trading band to 1
percent from 0.5 percent from April 16. The band, which is
centered on a rate set daily by the central bank, was last
broadened in May 2007 from 0.3 percent. The central bank
weakened the yuan’s daily  reference  rate against the dollar on
four out of five days this week.  Korea Risk  The won posted a second weekly loss, falling 0.4 percent to
1,139.55.  North Korea  said it will continue its space program
following the failure of a rocket launch on April 13, according
to a statement April 19 that the North’s official Korean Central
News Agency attributed to a spokesman for the Korean Committee
for Space Technology.  South Korea  unveiled new cruise missiles yesterday that it
said could hit anywhere in North Korea. The military has
deployed the missiles and is making preparations to ensure it

related risks and concerns about the global economic recovery,”
said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency trader at Busan Bank.  Elsewhere,  Thailand ’s baht weakened 0.6 percent from April
12 to 30.90. Thailand’s onshore financial markets were closed on
