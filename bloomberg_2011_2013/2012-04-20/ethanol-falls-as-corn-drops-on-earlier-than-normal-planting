Ethanol futures fell, capping a
second weekly drop, as corn declined because planting is ahead
of schedule for this time of year.  The biofuel slid 0.8 percent after an April 17 Agriculture
Department report showed about 17 percent of the corn crop had
been planted, up 5 percent from a year earlier, signaling lower
costs to make ethanol in the U.S. Corn fell 1.5 percent.  “We’re at a really early planting pace for corn,” said
Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management Inc. in
Galena,  Illinois . “There was just a big sell-off in corn.
You’ve got ethanol following.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slipped 1.8 cents to
settle at $2.148 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
dropped 3.1 percent this week and are down 2.5 percent so far
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.21 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In Chicago, the additive dropped 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.13.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 0.5 cent to $2.26 a gallon and
on the West Coast the biofuel added 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.305.  Corn for July delivery tumbled 9 cents to $6.03 a bushel in
 Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
