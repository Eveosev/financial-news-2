Derwent London Plc (DLN)  and Crossrail
Ltd. won approval for a plan to develop offices, shops and a
theater on  London ’s Oxford Street, the U.K’s busiest shopping
district.  Westminster City Council gave permission for the
development at 1 Oxford Street above the Tottenham Court Road
underground station, Derwent said in a statement today. The
REIT, which focuses on central London, will build two new
buildings measuring 25,500 square meters (275,000 square feet)
on the land, including a 350-seat theater designed with Nimax
Theatres Ltd., a London operator.  Derwent plans to exercise its option to acquire the site
when Crossrail, which owns the land, completes works on a
subterranean train line linking Heathrow Airport to east London
in 2017, it said in the statement. Derwent is betting that the
area will prove more attractive to office occupiers when the
station opens and that retailers will benefit from the number of
people using the trains, resulting in higher rents.  The development “will help in the much needed
revitalization of the eastern end of Oxford Street which is
essential for the long-term growth of the  West End ,”  John
Burns , chief executive at Derwent, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
