President Barack Obama’s proposed
budget would initially boost the  U.S. economy  though later in
this decade it would become a drag on growth, according to a
government report.  The nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  said today that
the administration’s tax-and-spending plan for fiscal 2013 would
increase economic growth next year by as much as 3.2 percent. By
extending at least some of the Bush-era income tax cuts, the
budget plan would stoke consumer demand for goods and services,
CBO said.  Between 2018 and 2022, the administration’s plan would cut
growth by 0.5 percent to 2.2 percent, according to the analysis.  The U.S. government would run a large  budget deficit  that
would require more borrowing, leaving fewer resources available
for business investment and producing a drag on growth, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
