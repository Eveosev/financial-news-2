Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , the
maker of products from flight controls to work boots, raised its
2012 forecast after posting quarterly profit that beat analysts’
estimates on demand for aircraft parts and energy technology.  First-quarter net income rose 17 percent to $823 million,
or $1.04 a share, from $705 million, or 88 cents, a year
earlier, the  Morris Township , New Jersey-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts expected 99 cents, the average of
21  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Honeywell is benefiting from airlines bringing older planes
back into active fleets, while  oil prices  topping $100 a barrel
and a shale-gas drilling boom are driving demand for the
company’s catalysts and refining processes. Per-share earnings
for this year will be $4.35 to $4.55, compared with a previous
forecast of $4.25 to $4.50, Honeywell said.  “We’ve seen good momentum in the U.S. and our key high
growth regions, which is more than offsetting softness in  Europe 
impacting our short-cycle businesses,” Chief Executive Officer
Dave Cote in the statement.  Sales rose 7.3 percent to $9.31 billion, compared with a
$9.15 billion average estimate by analysts. Honeywell narrowed
its forecast for 2012 sales to $38 billion to $38.6 billion,
from $37.8 billion to $38.9 billion.  Honeywell gained 2.4 percent to $59.39 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have advanced 9.3 percent this year.  Aerospace Sales  Aerospace sales rose 9.4 percent to $2.95 billion, on gains
of 22 percent from civil original equipment manufacturers and 16
percent for replacement equipment. Revenue from defense aviation
declined 1 percent from a year earlier.  Sales for the Performance Materials & Technologies unit,
which produces chemicals and provides supplies and service to
the oil and gas industry, jumped 19 percent to $1.62 billion.  “Performance Materials continues to outperform
expectations,” Robert Stallard, an RBC Capital Markets analyst
in  New York , said in a note. “Aerospace also had a good
quarter.” Stallard rates Honeywell shares outperform.  Honeywell forecast sales gains this quarter of as much as
15 percent for performance materials and up to 8 percent for
aerospace.  Revenue for Automation & Control Solutions, the largest
unit, gained 3.6 percent to $3.79 billion. Its sales may rise as
much as 4 percent this quarter, the company said.  Transportation Systems revenue declined 1.1 percent to $954
million. Honeywell said the unit, which sells auto turbochargers
 in Europe , may see sales fall as much as 9 percent this quarter
from a year earlier.  ‘Break From Conservatism’  In a  presentation  on its website, Honeywell forecast
second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 to $1.13.
That compares with the $1.09 average of 20 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The second-quarter forecast is “a break from conservatism
and showing confidence in the outlook, while the nudge to 2012
guidance is also a plus,” Steve Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a note. He rates the shares overweight.  Honeywell made pension and other postretirement benefit
payments of $289 million during the first quarter. Honeywell has
said it may make pension contributions of as much as $1 billion
this year to close the gap of its underfunded plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
