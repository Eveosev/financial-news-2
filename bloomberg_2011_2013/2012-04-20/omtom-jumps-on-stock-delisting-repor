TomTom NV (TOM2) , the maker of portable
navigation devices that dominated the industry before  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  took market share, rose the most in six
months following a report the company may delist its stock.  TomTom  gained  46 cents, or 16 percent, to 3.41 euros, the
biggest jump since Oct. 24. The stock rose as much as 24 percent
earlier, the largest intraday advance in three years.  The company’s four founders are considering making an offer
for the remaining shares, together with investment funds Cyrte
Investments BV and Janivo Holding, Management Team magazine
reported today on its website, without citing anyone. Kristina
Nilsson, a spokeswoman for Amsterdam-based TomTom, declined to
comment.  The market for personal navigation devices shrank 10
percent in  Europe  and 25 percent in the U.S. last year, Chief
Executive Officer Harold Goddijn, one of TomTom’s founders, said
in February. Devices such as Apple’s iPhone and smartphones
based on Google’s Android platform that feature maps and
navigation programs have hurt TomTom’s stock, which has slumped
80 percent in the past four years.  TomTom has gained 12 percent this year for a market value
of 756 million euros ($999 million). The shares reached as high
as 56 euros in 2007. TomTom competes with  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) , whose
shares are traded in the U.S.  “The question is how does management see the future for
TomTom and what do investors expect,” said Peter Olofsen, an
Amsterdam-based analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, who has a
reduce rating on the stock. “Obviously the market has its
doubts.”  Cyrte, owned by Dutch insurer  Delta LLoyd NV (DL) , and Janivo
jointly hold a 10.2 percent stake in TomTom, according to a
regulatory filing dated Feb. 29. CEO Goddijn and co-founders
Corinne Goddijn-Vigreux, Pieter Geelen and Peter-Frans Pauwels
each own about 12 percent, according to regulatory filings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
