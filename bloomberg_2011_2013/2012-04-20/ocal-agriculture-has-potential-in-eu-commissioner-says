Demand for locally produced food is
increasing in  Europe , and policy makers should do more to
support farming operations that ship their products over shorter
distances, according to the European Union.  Surveys in the U.K. and  Germany  have shown that one in two
consumers “regret the fact that it is difficult to find local
products,” said Dacian Ciolos, the European Commissioner for
Agriculture and  Rural Development . Food that is produced and
sold locally uses less fuel for transportation, and shorter
shipping distances mean fewer products are wasted or spoiled, he
said on a webcast of a meeting today in Brussels.  “Short supply circuits are part of agriculture diversity
that have not been taken on enough in the past,” Ciolos said.
“There’s huge potential in the EU to really be competitive and
sustainable. Europe has to harness the value of all its
agriculture models without any prejudices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
