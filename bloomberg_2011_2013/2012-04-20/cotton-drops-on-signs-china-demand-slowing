Cotton futures fell for the first
time in four days on renewed concern that worldwide consumption
will trail output.  Orange juice  jumped the most in eight weeks.  Global production will top demand in the season ending July
31 by 4.5 million metric tons, compared with a March forecast
for a surplus of 4.02 million, Cotlook Ltd., a research company
based in Birkenhead, U.K., said yesterday. The forecast on
consumption was cut 2.1 percent.  “The continued drop in demand is discouraging,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at Penson Futures in Atlanta, said in
an e-mail.  Cotton futures for July delivery slid 0.1 percent to 90.6
cents a pound at 10:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The
price rose 4 percent in the previous three days.  Before today, the commodity tumbled 47 percent in the past
12 months as demand dwindled in  China , the world’s biggest
consumer. The U.S. is the top exporter.  “Inquiry has gone flat as a pancake domestically and
overseas,” Jordan Lea, the president of Greenville, South
Carolina-based Eastern Trading Co., said in an e-mail. “It can
come back just as fast, but right now, demand is non-existent.”  Orange-juice futures for July delivery climbed 2.3 percent
to $1.508 a pound. A close at that price would mark the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
