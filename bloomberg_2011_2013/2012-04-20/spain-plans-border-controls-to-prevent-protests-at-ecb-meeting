Spain  will reinstate border
controls to prevent protesters from disrupting a meeting of the
 European Central Bank  in Barcelona, suspending a treaty on free
movement in Europe, a government official said.  The measure is designed to prevent “anti-system” protests
after security reports indicated there was a risk to public
order, said the Interior Ministry official, who declined to be
named in line with policy.  The ECB holds its rate-setting meeting in Barcelona on May
3, two days after May Day, which is traditionally marked by
union-led marches across Europe. Barcelona has seen some of
Spain’s most violent protests in the past year, most recently on
March 29, when demonstrators set fire to dumpsters and clashed
with police after a general strike.  Spain hasn’t suspended the Schengen treaty that allows free
movement since Prince Felipe, the heir to the throne, got
married in May 2004, two months after an al-Qaeda train-bombing
killed almost 200 people in  Madrid , the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
