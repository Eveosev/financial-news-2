The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment increased in Asia outside of
 Japan , according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1.5 basis points to 167.5 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is on course for its highest close since April
10, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index gained 4 basis points to
159 as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The measure is poised for the biggest weekly gain since
the week ending March 23 according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 170
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark has traded between 194.6 basis points and
136.2 basis points this year, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
