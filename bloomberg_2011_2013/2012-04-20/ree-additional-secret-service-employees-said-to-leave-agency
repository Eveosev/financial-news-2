Three more U.S. Secret Service
employees suspected of consorting with prostitutes while
preparing for President Barack Obama’s arrival at a summit in
 Colombia  are leaving the agency, said a congressional aide
familiar with the matter.  The Secret Service briefed congressional staff today on the
status of the employees, said the aide, who wasn’t authorized to
speak publicly.  The agency announced on April 18 that two other employees
linked to the prostitution case left the agency, and that a
third was in the process of being dismissed.  The employees were in Cartagena making security
preparations in advance of the Summit of the Americas. Obama’s
agenda at the economic and trade summit, which concluded April
15, was overshadowed by allegations of misconduct by the Secret
Service employees and military support staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
