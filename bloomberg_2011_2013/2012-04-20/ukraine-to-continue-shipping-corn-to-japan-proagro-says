Japan , the world’s largest corn
importer, will continue buying the commodity from Ukraine
although shipments have slowed recently on quality concerns,
Ukrainian analysts said.  “Shipments to Japan will be taking place anyway,” Nikolay Vernitsky, director of the Kiev-based agricultural researcher
ProAgro, said by phone from the city today. “They have indeed
reduced purchases of corn from Eastern Europe, although it
applies to  Romania ,  Hungary  and other origins, not just
Ukraine.”  Five Japanese trading companies purchased 800,000 metric
tons of Ukrainian corn in November as the price was about $20 a
ton lower than buying the commodity from the U.S., the Asian
country’s regular source, according to ProAgro’s website
yesterday.  Ukraine supplied 553,000 tons of corn to Japan as of April
18, ProAgro said on its website. Traders estimate that shipments
to Japan will be around 200,000 tons in April through June,
according to the statement.  “Japanese are complaining, but they are not refusing,”
Liza Malyshko, an analyst at the Kiev-based researcher
UkrAgroConsult, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
