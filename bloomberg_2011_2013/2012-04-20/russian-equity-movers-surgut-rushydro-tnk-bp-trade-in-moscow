The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6
percent to 1,505.10 in Moscow, its highest close since April 11.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO RusHydro (HYDR RX), Russia’s largest hydropower
producer, rose 2.9 percent to 1.0842 rubles. The company will
pay dividends this year at least as high as in 2010 and may
increase the payment by as much as 15 percent over the next
three to five years, Deputy Chairman George Rizhinashvili said
in an interview in  New York  yesterday.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGS RX) rose to the strongest level in
more than two weeks after Deputy General Director Vyacheslav
Nikiforov said  Russia ’s fourth-biggest oil company will publish
this year’s results to international standards and will increase
dividends. Preferred shares jumped 3.6 percent to 20.125 rubles,
the highest level since April 4, while the regular stock added
1.2 percent to 29.307 rubles.  TNK-BP (TNBP RX) retreated 1.2 percent to 89.77 rubles, the
lowest level since Feb. 10. Russia’s third-largest oil producer
sacrificed pipeline maintenance to pay out large dividends to
its shareholders, Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko told Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  yesterday. The volume of spilled oil
fell 60 percent, while “the environmental situation, especially
at old fields, is far from ideal,” the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
