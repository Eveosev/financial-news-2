The euro touched its strongest
level in two weeks versus the dollar after German business
confidence unexpectedly increased to a nine-month high, fueling
investor appetite for risk.  The 17-nation currency strengthened versus the yen as
governments committed more than $430 billion in fresh money to
the  International Monetary Fund  to help it protect the world
economy against  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis. The pound gained
for a fifth day against the dollar after U.K. retail sales
climbed.  Brazil ’s real rose for the first time in six days as
technical indicators showed it may have fallen too quickly.  “This is a broader sentiment recovery, and the euro is
being driven by better-than-expected Ifo readings,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc in London, referring to the German confidence
gauge. “U.K. retail sales were also quite constructive.”  The euro gained 0.6 percent to $1.3219 at 5 p.m. New York
time, for a 1.1 percent weekly advance, the first since March
30. It touched $1.3228, the highest level since April 4. The
shared currency rose 0.5 percent to 107.79 yen, appreciating 1.9
percent on the week. The yen was 0.1 percent stronger at 81.52
per dollar, paring its weekly drop to 0.7 percent.  The Munich-based  Ifo institute  said today its business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, rose to
109.9 this month from 109.8 in March. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast a drop to 109.5.  IMF Firepower  The near-doubling of the IMF’s firepower was announced
after Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers met
today in  Washington . While the U.K. and  Australia  were among
those making specific pledges, Brazil said  emerging markets 
would condition their help on getting more power at the fund.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, fell 0.5 percent to 79.144 as U.S. stocks
snapped a two-day decline amid better-than-estimated earnings
reports from Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  advanced 0.5 percent.  Brazil’s real rose versus the dollar, snapping five days of
losses as risk appetite increased. The central bank lowered the
benchmark rate this week by three-quarters of a percentage point
to 9 percent and signaled more cuts may come.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Brazilian
currency versus the dollar reached below 30 for a fourth day,
the longest stretch since September. The level indicates an
asset’s price may have fallen too far, too fast.  The real advanced 0.4 percent to 1.8724 per dollar after
touching 1.8935 yesterday, the weakest level since November.  Mexican Peso  Mexico ’s peso also rallied, climbing 0.7 percent to 13.1010
to the greenback, and South Africa’s rand gained 0.5 percent to
7.8123 per dollar.  The yen touched its weakest level since April 10 versus the
dollar, 81.78, on speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will add to
monetary easing at its next meeting on April 27. Bank Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said in a speech in Washington this week the
nation still needs monetary stimulus.  Futures traders  trimmed bets the yen will decline against
the dollar, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Net-
shorts fell to 57,803 in the five days ended April 17, from
66,084 a week earlier  The BOJ set a 1 percent inflation goal on Feb. 14 and
increased the size of its program to buy government debt. Deputy
Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said two days ago the central bank
is ready to implement additional easing if necessary.  ‘Political Pressure’  “Political pressure on the BOJ has increased, and that’s
why we’re looking for a higher dollar-yen,”  Mary Nicola , a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  New York , said in a
Bloomberg Radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom
Keene . BNP expects  Japan ’s currency to weaken to 85 by mid-year.  The yen fell against all of its major counterparts today
except the Taiwanese dollar and South Korean won. It has tumbled
8.7 percent this year, the worst performer among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar has lost 2.6 percent, and the euro
has fallen 0.5 percent.  Sterling recorded its biggest weekly gain versus the dollar
in 15 months after U.K. retail sales climbed more than forecast
in March.  Sales including auto fuel gained 1.8 percent, compared with
February, when they declined 0.8 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in  London .  The pound rose 0.4 percent today to $1.6122, for a 1.7
percent gain on the week, the most since January 2011. Its five-
day winning streak was also the longest in three months. The
U.K. currency added 0.2 percent to 81.97 pence per euro after
touching 81.62 pence yesterday, the strongest level since Aug.
26, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
