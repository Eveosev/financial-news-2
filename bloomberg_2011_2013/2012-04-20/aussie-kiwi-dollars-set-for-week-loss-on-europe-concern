New Zealand ’s dollar was headed for
a weekly loss amid concern that European leaders are struggling
to contain the region’s debt crisis, sapping demand for riskier
assets.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, touched a three-
week low as Asian stocks extended a decline in global shares.
The Australian dollar gained even as a report showed  export
prices  fell for a second quarter. Meetings hosted by the
International Monetary Fund start today in Washington, where
Group of 20 officials will discuss  Europe ’s fiscal health.  “This market is expecting bad news out of Europe,” said
Kurt Magnus, executive director of foreign-exchange sales in
Sydney at Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage.
“There is no conviction in the equity markets, which means
there is no confidence. Against the  U.S. dollar , the Aussie can
go down to about $1.0150 on the next phase of European worry.”  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 81.69 U.S. cents
at 12:01 p.m. in  New York , after touching 81.19, the weakest
since March 29. The currency has fallen 0.7 percent since April
13. The kiwi added 0.1 percent to 66.67 yen this week.  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0375,
paring its decline to trade little changed against the U.S.
dollar this week. The $1.0150 level was last seen on Jan. 9. The
Aussie fetched 84.65 yen from 83.94 last week.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks slid 0.4 percent.  Export Prices  Australia’s  export price index  dropped 7 percent from the
fourth quarter, when it declined 1.5 percent, the statistics
bureau said today. The index was forecast to fall 3 percent,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies were supported versus
the yen on prospects the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will ease policy next
week. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in a speech in Washington
