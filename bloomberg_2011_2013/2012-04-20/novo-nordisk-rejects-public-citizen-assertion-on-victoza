Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)  said it rejects
assertions by the U.S. group  Public Citizen  that the diabetes
drug Victoza should be pulled from the market.  “Novo Nordisk is committed to patient safety and rejects
Public Citizen’s assertion that the benefits of Victoza are
outweighed by its risks,” the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Public Citizen said yesterday the drug puts patients at
higher risk of thyroid cancer, pancreatitis and other problems.  “In the two years since Victoza was approved, Novo Nordisk
has continued to work closely with the FDA and the medical
community to monitor the benefits and appropriate use of
Victoza,” Novo Nordisk said. “Our experience in those two
years does not support the Public Citizen call to deprive
patients of the benefits of Victoza.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
