Turkey’s  bonds  rose for the first
time in six days on positive sentiment that followed the
unexpected improvement in German business confidence.  The yield on two-year benchmark bonds declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.47 percent, trimming this
week’s advance to seven basis points.  “The drop in yields can be referred to the positive
general  market sentiment  which was more in favor of somewhat
riskier emerging-market countries like Hungary and Ukraine,”
Felix Herrman, an analyst at DZ Bank AG, said in e-mailed
comments from Frankfurt.  Germany’s Ifo institute said its  business climate index 
climbed to 109.9, a nine-month high, adding to evidence  Europe ’s
largest economy can weather the debt crisis. Economists forecast
a drop, a Bloomberg survey showed.  “ Turkey  is for sure not playing at exactly the same league
as these countries, however, Turkish assets seem to take
advantage of flows going into this group of countries
currently,” Herrmann said.  The lira weakened for a third day, depreciating less than
0.1 percent to 1.7927 per dollar, increasing its weekly loss to
0.3 percent.  Turkish markets will be closed on Monday for a public
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
