The trading card that the  National
Baseball Hall of Fame  calls the sport’s “most famous
collectible” was sold today for $1.23 million in an online
auction, according to the dealer handling the sale.  The 1909  card  of Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Honus Wagner
sold to an unidentified man from  New Jersey , Bill Goodwin,
president of St. Louis-based sports memorabilia auctioneer
 Goodwin & Co ., said in a telephone interview. The card received
14 bids in the four-week auction.  “When you run auctions you always want one more bid,”
said Goodwin, who plans to deliver the card to the buyer in
person. “But overall I am very happy and the consignor is
happy.”  The Wagner card was part of Goodwin & Co.’s “Masterpieces
and Uncommon Commons XL,” an auction of 528 baseball cards from
the T206 series released in 1909 by the American Tobacco Co. for
distribution in cigarette packs. Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken
Kendrick purchased a version of the same card in better
condition for $2.8 million in 2007, making that the most
expensive baseball card ever sold.  All 528 cards were owned by a man in  Texas  whom Goodwin
also declined to identify. A longtime business associate of
Goodwin’s, the seller acquired the Wagner card in 1985 and
approached Goodwin in December to discuss auctioning off the
entire collection. Goodwin didn’t say how much the seller
originally paid.  Other lots in the auction included a card of former
Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Eddie Plank, which sold for
$330,000, and cards of Hall of Fame players Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and  Cy Young . The entire lot sold for
a total of $1.77 million, Goodwin said.  Plank’s Highest Price  “That’s the highest price ever paid for any Plank card,”
Goodwin said.  The Wagner card began with a minimum bid of $300,000, the
highest in the set. A similar card in the same condition sold
for $145,000 in 2000 and another in 2008 went for around
$950,000, according to Goodwin, who called it the “holy grail
of baseball cards.”  Wagner batted .329 in 21 seasons, winning eight National
League batting titles and five stolen base crowns. The second
player behind Cap Anson to reach 3,000 hits, Wagner was part of
the inaugural 1936 class at the Cooperstown, New York-based
National Baseball Hall of Fame, and died in 1955.  To contact the reporter on this story:
