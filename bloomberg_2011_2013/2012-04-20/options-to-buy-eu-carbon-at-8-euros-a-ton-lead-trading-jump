Options trading in European carbon
permits surged, with the most activity in contracts that give
holders the right to buy at a price of 8 euros, according to
data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Trading volume in calls linked to the December contract
jumped to 4 million metric tons yesterday, from 1 million tons
the day before, the data show. Call options give the buyer the
right to purchase at a certain price. Puts give the right to
sell. About 3.5 million tons of puts were cleared yesterday,
compared with none the day before. Today, 500,000 tons of calls
at a strike price of 10 euros were cleared on ICE.  About 2.5 million tons of call options with the 8-euro
strike price cleared yesterday on the exchange, according to the
data. The price for that option rose 3 percent to 1.36 euros a
ton, the highest since March 19, the data show.  Permits for delivery in December were little changed today
at 7.47 euros ($9.86) a metric ton on ICE at 12:05 p.m. London
time. They earlier rose to their 7.64 euros, their highest level
in a month, after reaching a record 5.99 euros on April 4.  Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said yesterday the
bloc may propose a delay in supply at carbon auctions starting
next year, tightening the carbon market. Lawmakers would also
continue to consider another plan to temporarily cut supply,
known as a set aside, she told reporters in Horsens,  Denmark .  To contact the reporter on this story:
