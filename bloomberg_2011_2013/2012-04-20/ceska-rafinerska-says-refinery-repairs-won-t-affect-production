Ceska Rafinerska AS, the Czech
refinery controlled by  Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , said routine maintenance on
one of its Litvinov units won’t affect operations.  The work includes replacing valves and pipes at one of the
smaller units, Ales Soukup, a spokesman, said by phone.  Unipetrol owns 51 percent of Ceska Rafinerska and  Eni SpA (ENI) 
is looking to sell its 32.5 percent stake in the refiner. The
rest of the company is owned by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
