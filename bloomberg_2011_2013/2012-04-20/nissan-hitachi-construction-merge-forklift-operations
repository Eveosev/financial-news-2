Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
biggest carmaker, and  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , the
world’s largest maker of giant excavators, agreed to merge their
forklift operations through a new venture.  Nissan will own 20 percent, and Hitachi Construction will
hold 26.7 percent of the venture, and the remaining shares will
be owned by the government-backed  Innovation Network Corp. of
Japan , which will provide 30 billion yen ($367 million) to the
new company, according to a statement from Nissan today.  The merger comes as Nissan targets to win 8 percent of the
global car market by March 2017, through cutting back on
businesses outside its main vehicle division.  Nissan Forklift
Co. , a fully owned unit of the Yokohama-based company, produces
about 30,000 forklifts a year in  Japan ,  Europe  and the U.S.,
according to its website. The new company, to be called
UniCarriers Corp., will begin operations this year.  Hitachi Construction Machinery, Japan’s second-largest
maker of excavators and wheel loaders, made  TCM Corp.  a forklift
unit in 2005 and acquired all the shares it didn’t already own
in December 2009.  Shares of Hitachi Construction rose 0.5 percent to 1,813
yen at the close of Tokyo trading, while Nissan’s  shares  added
0.5 percent to 844 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
