Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was the top buyer at a spring sale
of two-year-old thoroughbred racehorses in Newmarket,  England .  Sheikh Mohammed, the world’s biggest racehorse owner, spent
500,000 guineas ($845,250) on a colt sired by Shamardal, the
2004 European champion two-year-old. It was the third-highest
price ever paid at the two-day  Tattersalls  Craven Breeze Up Sale
for a horse ready to race.  The Sheikh, who was present at the sale, also bought a
Shamardal filly for 160,000 guineas and a colt sired by 2007
Kentucky Derby runnerup Hard Spun for 80,000 guineas. Horses at
Tattersalls,  Europe ’s biggest bloodstock auctioneer, are still
priced in guineas, an antique monetary unit that’s now equal to
1 pound, 5 pence ($1.69) and has otherwise disappeared from
usage.  The sale saw “plenty of action” by buyers from  Hong Kong 
and the Gulf region, Jimmy George, marketing director of
Tattersalls, said in a phone interview. The sale brought in 8.6
million guineas, 7.4 percent more than last year, and the
average price rose almost 3 percent to 73,316 guineas.  “A lot of the strength of this can be attributed to buyers
from parts of the world where they’ve either not been hit as
hard or are beginning to emerge from periods of economic
downturn,” George said. “But it would be wrong to pretend that
we all think everything is plain sailing at the moment because
there is still a lot of economic uncertainty in Europe.”  The sale of the Shamardal colt handed seller Roger
O’Callaghan at Tally-Ho Stud in Ireland a hefty profit. Tally-Ho
had paid 53,000 guineas for the horse when it was a foal at
Tattersalls in December 2010.  “He is easily our biggest sale,” O’Callaghan told the
auction’s website. “We were hoping for 100,000 or 150,000
guineas, but this far exceeded our expectations. We have loved
this foal from the day we bought him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
