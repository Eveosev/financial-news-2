President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election committee had 10 times the money of former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney’s campaign entering April,
Federal Election Commission reports show.  Obama reported a bank balance of $104.1 million after
raising $35.1 million in March. That included $7.5 million
transferred from a joint fundraising account with the  Democratic
National Committee . Romney finished March with $10.1 million to
spend after raising $13.1 million during the month, his best in
the campaign.  Through March 31, Obama raised $196.6 million for his re-
election, more than twice as much as the cumulative $88.7
million collected by Romney’s campaign.  Obama, as he did in his 2008 campaign, relied heavily on
small-dollar donors. Last month, 52 percent of the money going
directly to his campaign committee came in amounts of $200 or
less. Romney collected 13 percent of his money in those amounts.  The president also increased his large-dollar fundraising.
He identified 117 people who brought in at least $500,000 for
his re-election, up from 61 at the end of 2011.  Those newly identified as raising more than $500,000 for
the campaign include Laura Ricketts, co-owner of the  Chicago
Cubs  and the first openly gay owner of a major league sports
team; Stewart Bainum, chairman of  Silver Spring , Maryland-based
 Choice Hotels International Inc. (CHH) ; and Michael Sacks, chief
executive officer of Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management.  Naming Bundlers  Obama is the only candidate identifying all of his
bundlers, supporters who tap their own networks to raise money.
Romney disclosed just two, lobbyists Paul Mattera of Liberty
Mutual Group Inc. and Joseph Wall of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. By
law, candidates must identify lobbyists raising money for them.  Romney became the presumptive Republican nominee with the
April 10 departure from the race of his chief rival for the
nomination, former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum . Former
U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  and U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of  Texas  remain as Republican candidates.  “ Mitt Romney ’s continued strong fundraising shows that
voters across the country are tired of the failures from
President Obama,” said Romney’s national finance chairman,
 Spencer Zwick , in a statement. “We will continue the hard work
to raise the necessary funds to defeat President Obama and
change the direction of the country.”  Super-PAC Cash  A political action committee backing Romney, Restore Our
Future, took in $8.7 million last month and had $6.5 million
left to spend. Harold Simmons, chairman of Dallas-based Contran
Corp., gave $600,000; he gave $200,000 earlier this year.  The pro-Obama PAC Priorities USA Action raised $2.5
million, even after the president in February began urging
supporters to contribute. Top donors included $1 million from
writer Amy P. Goldman, who gave $1 million; comedian Chelsea Handler, who donated $100,000; and longtime Democratic giver
Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive officer of BLS Investments,
who also donated $100,000. The PAC ended the month with $5
million in the bank.  Santorum raised $5 million last month, bringing his total
to $20.7 million. He had $1.8 million in the bank and reported
debts of $2 million, including $760,009 for media to  John Brabender , his senior adviser, and $483,237 for online services
and ads.  Gingrich took in $1.7 million, and finished the month with
$1.2 million in the bank. He has now raised $22.6 million for
his campaign. He had $4.3 million in debts, almost triple what
he reported owing a month earlier. His debts included $271,776
to himself for travel expenses and $1.1 million to the air-
charter company Moby Dick Airways.  Paul raised $2.6 million last month, bringing his total to
$37 million. He had $1.8 million in the bank at the end of
March. He received 37 percent of his donations last month in
amounts of $200 or less.  To contact the reporters on this story:
