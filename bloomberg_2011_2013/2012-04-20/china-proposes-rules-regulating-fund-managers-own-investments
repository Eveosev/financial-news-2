China published proposed rules to
encourage fund-managerment companies to regulate purchases by
managers of funds that they or their employers run.  The rules will also allow employees of fund-management
companies to invest in closed-end funds using non-stock accounts
and cancel time limits on holding money-market and cash-
management funds, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
said in statement today.  The guidelines will regulate investment by fund-management
employees and protect the rights and interests of fundholders,
said the CSRC, which seeks public feedback on the proposals.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
