The premium buyers have to pay to
obtain coffee from  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest producer
of robusta beans, fell 20 percent this week, with buyers
“shying away” from high prices, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Indonesian coffee for shipment in May and June was trading
at a premium of $80 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today. That’s down
from $100 a ton last week, according to the report.  Coffee output in Indonesia will climb 38 percent to 9.1
million bags in the 2012-13 season that started there this
month, Volcafe estimated in February, from 6.6 million bags in
2011-12. Rains caused by the La Nina weather pattern, associated
with cooler-than-normal equatorial waters in the  Pacific Ocean ,
cut output in 2011-12.  “The crop is progressing well in all coffee areas now and
the flow has picked up,” the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader said in the report. Buyers are “shying away from the
rather high asking prices.”  Demand from local roasters remains “strong” and prices
“firm,” according to the report. Exporters are aiming “to get
some business for June shipments on the books,” Volcafe said,
adding that they were “reluctant to sell any further forward.”  In  Vietnam , the world’s biggest robusta grower, farmers are
still holding 20 percent to 25 percent of the 2011-12 crop, the
trader estimated. Exports so far in April have doubled compared
with the same period last year, Volcafe said.  Vietnamese coffee for May and June shipment was trading at
a discount of $10 a ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe exchange,
unchanged from last week, data from the trader show.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was up 2.3 percent at
$2,069 a ton by 3:39 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
