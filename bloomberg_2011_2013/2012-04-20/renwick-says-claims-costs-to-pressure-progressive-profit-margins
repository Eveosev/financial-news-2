Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-
largest U.S. auto insurer, may face pressure on profit margins
as claims costs increase, Chief Executive Officer Glenn Renwick
said.  “Severity trends in most coverages are increasing and, while frequency
trends are still generally favorable, it’s a dangerous combination that can
change quickly,” Renwick said in remarks to shareholders published
today in a regulatory filing by the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based
insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
