Perth’s rental property market is
“excessively tight,” with the city’s vacancy rate in March
falling 0.4 percentage point from a year ago to 0.5 percent,
according to  SQM Research Pty.   “Perth is now an area of major concern,” SQM Managing
Director Louis Christopher said in an e-mailed release. With the
Australian housing market “remaining sluggish, it is likely
that more and more individuals are choosing the rental market
over deciding to purchase property.”  Rental vacancies across  Australia  rose to 1.7 percent in
March from 1.5 percent a year ago, SQM said. Melbourne had the
highest level of vacancies, at 2.9 percent, up from 2.5 percent
a year earlier.  Rental yields, annual rental income as a percentage of the
purchase price, climbed to 4.8 percent for apartments and 4.2
percent for houses in Perth in March compared with 4.3 percent
and 3.6 percent in  Melbourne , according to real estate
researcher RP Data.  Home prices  rose 1.4 percent in Perth during
the month, while falling 0.2 percent in Melbourne, and rising
0.2 percent across the nation’s eight capital cities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
