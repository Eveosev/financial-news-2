Colombia hasn’t sold dollars in the
market this year in a bid to ease gains the peso, according to
the  Finance Ministry .  The finance ministry is “worried” about the strong peso,
it said in an e-mailed statement. To avoid pressuring gains in
the local currency, state-oil company  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  will make its
$1 billion dividend payment to the government in dollars,
according to the statement.   “The government continues to permanently analyze measures
to reduce the pace of gains in the peso,” the government said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
