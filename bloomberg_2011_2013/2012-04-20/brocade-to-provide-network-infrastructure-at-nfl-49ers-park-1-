Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD) 
is the first founding partner of the San Francisco 49ers’
planned $1.18 billion stadium and will provide the facility’s
network infrastructure.  49ers Chief Executive Officer Jed York discussed the deal
with the  San Jose , California-based maker of switches for data-
storage networks before last night’s groundbreaking ceremony for
the 49ers’ new stadium in neighboring Santa Clara.  “They’ll have sponsorship inside the stadium, areas inside
the stadium branded for Brocade, and they will be our network
provider,” York told reporters.  York didn’t provide details of the agreement. A spokesman
for the 49ers, Steve Weakland, said the deal had just been
finalized and that he didn’t yet have any details to release.  Brocade spokeswoman Katie Bromley said in an e-mail late
last night that she did not yet have details about the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
