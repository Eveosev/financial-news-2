U.S. stocks rose, halting a two-day
decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as profits from
companies including  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp. and  General Electric Co. (GE) 
beat estimates and German business confidence improved.  Equities pared gains as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped 2.5 percent,
extending its decline since April 9 to 9.9 percent. Microsoft,
the largest software maker, rallied 4.6 percent. GE jumped 1.2
percent as profit gains at the energy business outpaced finance
for the first time in two years.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  advanced 0.7
percent after reporting higher-than-estimated earnings.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  lost 4.7 percent, driving financial shares lower.  The S&P 500 increased 0.1 percent to 1,378.54 at 4 p.m. New
York time, paring a gain of as much as 0.8 percent. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  advanced 65.24 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 13,029.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to
3,000.45.  “Earnings are still playing into it,” Brian Jacobsen, who
helps oversee $211 billion as chief portfolio strategist at
Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said
during an interview. “In addition, the German data was
encouraging. It tells us that there’s the ability in  Europe  to
solve their debt crisis.”  Today’s rally extended this year’s  gain  in the  S&P 500  to
9.6 percent as investors bought stocks amid better-than-
estimated economic and corporate data. Earnings per share have
topped forecasts at  85 percent  of S&P 500 companies that
reported results since April 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Stocks also gained as German business confidence
unexpectedly increased to a nine-month high in April.  The analysts surveyed by Bloomberg raised their first-
quarter earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies this week. Per-
share profits grew 3.3 percent in the first three months of the
year, Bloomberg data showed. That’s up from last week’s
projection for a 1.7 percent increase. Earnings per share will
grow 8.8 percent during all of 2012, according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
