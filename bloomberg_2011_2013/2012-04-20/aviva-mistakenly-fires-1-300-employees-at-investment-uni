Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest insurer by market value, said the company’s investment
unit mistakenly sent an e-mail dismissing its entire staff
before retracting the message.  The e-mail, which was sent by the Aviva Investors human
resources department to 1,300 employees globally, told
recipients to turn over company property as they left the
building and reminded them of their obligation to guard the
firm’s confidential information, according to Paul Lockstone,
spokesman for the unit of the London-based insurer.  “It was intended that this e-mail should have gone to one
single person,” Lockstone said by phone. “Unfortunately, as a
result of a clerical error, it was sent to all of the Investors
staff worldwide.” Most people recognized immediately that the
e-mail was a mistake, he said, adding, “From time to time,
things go wrong.”  The human resources department issued an apology “fairly
quickly” after the message was sent, Lockstone said. The e-mail
is part of the company’s administration process when people
leave the organization, he said. News of the mistake was
reported earlier today by the  Daily Telegraph .  Aviva has been scaling back its asset-management business
as the European debt crisis and the deteriorating U.K. economy
crimps sales. The insurer said in January it would cut 160 jobs
at the unit. Some of the employees affected by that process
still haven’t departed, Lockstone said.  Shares of Aviva gained 2 percent to 305.5 pence in  London 
today. The insurer has increased 1.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
