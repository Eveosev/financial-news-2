U.S. stocks rose, breaking a two-
week slump, as industries considered the safest investments led
gains after reports on home sales and jobless claims tempered
optimism about the economy while earnings lifted companies from
Travelers Cos. to  General Electric Co. (GE)   Gauges (SPXL1)  for utilities, consumer staples, health-care and
phone stocks climbed the most among 10 groups in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, jumping at least 1.5 percent. Travelers and GE
added more than 2.5 percent after their profit beat analysts’
estimates. Technology companies were the only group to retreat,
falling for a second week. The industry was dragged down by
declines of 5.3 percent by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and 1.6 percent by
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , offsetting  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s 5.2 percent rally on better-than-estimated results.  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,378.53 for the first
weekly advance since March 30. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
added 179.67 points, or 1.4 percent, to 13,029.26.  “It’s just a small rotation as some investors reduced the
amount of risk in their portfolio, maybe trying to reposition in
anticipation of a correction,”  Robert Pavlik , who helps manage
$1.3 billion as chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC
in New York, said in a phone interview. “We’ve got some decent
earnings. But people are still a little bit nervous that we may
not see that continued follow-through with earnings expansion.”  The week’s gain extended the benchmark index’s 2012 rise to
9.6 percent as investors bought stocks this year amid better-
than-estimated economic and corporate earnings.  S&P 500 (SPX) 
companies are on pace to beat analysts’ profit estimates for a
13th straight quarter. Of the 94 companies that have reported
results since April 10, 85 percent have topped expectations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Estimates  Analysts raised their first-quarter  earnings estimates  this
week, projecting per-share profits grew 3.3 percent, up from
last week’s 1.7 percent estimate. Earnings will grow 8.8 percent
for all of 2012, according to the data.  “We are bullish,” Thomas Sowanick, chief investment
officer of Omnivest Group LLC, which oversees $3 billion in
Princeton, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “We have
powerful earnings. If you look at the underlying trends of the
economy, things are not as fast as they were, but they are not
falling apart.”  The  S&P 500  jumped the most in a month on April 17 after
the  International Monetary Fund  raised its 2012 global growth
projection to 3.5 percent. Stocks retreated April 19 as more
Americans than forecast filed claims for jobless benefits and
sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly dropped.  A Reversal  The outperformance in defensive stocks this week marked a
reversal from the first quarter, when the S&P 500 jumped 12
percent, led by a surge of at least 21 percent in the financial
and technology industries. During that period, utilities posted
the only decline among the 10 groups while phone stocks gained
only 0.6 percent.  The gauge of utilities had the biggest gain this week,
rallying 2.1 percent, the most since December.  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) ,
the Princeton, New Jersey-based power producer, jumped 5.6
percent to $15.39, after being boosted to buy from hold by
Deutsche Bank AG.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  helped drive phone stocks to a
1.6 percent advance. The second-largest U.S. phone company rose
4 percent to $38.73 after earnings beat analysts’ estimates as
smartphone demand boosted subscriber count.  Travelers rallied 8 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$62.75. The insurer said first-quarter profit beat analysts’
estimates as policy sales increased. The company also boosted
its dividend 12 percent.  Trading Revenue  Among other financial companies that announced results,
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  advanced 1.2 percent to $17.48 after beating
estimates and reporting stock- and bond-trading revenue that
rose more than at any other major U.S. bank.  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
climbed 1.4 percent to $33.89 after fixed-income trading revenue
more than doubled from the fourth quarter.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell 3.7 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $8.36 even as its earnings beat estimates. Mike Mayo, an
analyst at CLSA Ltd., cut the bank’s rating to sell from
underperform.  GE rose 2.5 percent to $19.36. The maker of jet engines and
power generation equipment topped analysts’ estimates as profit
gains at the energy business, its largest industrial division,
outpaced finance for the first time in two years.  The S&P 500  Information Technology Index (S5INFT)  fell 1.5 percent.
Apple sank 5.3 percent to $572.98 amid speculation that demand
for the iPad may wane and that mobile-phone carriers will cut
subsidies for the iPhone, eroding profitability of Apple’s best-
selling products. The company has erased 9.9 percent since April
9, when it reached an all-time high of $636.23. The stock is
still up 41 percent in 2012.  IBM, Intel  IBM retreated 1.6 percent to $199.60. The world’s biggest
computer-services provider said first-quarter revenue was $24.7
billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $24.8
billion.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  slipped 1.7 percent to $27.60. The world’s
largest semiconductor maker forecast gross margin that was lower
than some analysts predicted.  IBM’s revenue climbed 0.3 percent, while Intel sales rose
0.5 percent, the smallest increases for both companies since the
third quarter of 2009, when the  U.S. economy  was just emerging
from recession. Even so, Intel predicted a pickup in sales for
the current quarter.  Microsoft increased 5.2 percent to $32.42. The world’s
largest software maker reported fiscal third-quarter profit that
topped estimates on better-than-expected sales of Windows and
Office software for business.  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  surged 12 percent to $40.29, reaching the highest
level since 2006 on April 19. The world’s largest Internet
marketplace reported sales and profit that topped analysts’
estimates, led by growth in its PayPal online-payments business.  -- Editors: Jeff Sutherland, Nick Baker  To contact the reporter on this story:
