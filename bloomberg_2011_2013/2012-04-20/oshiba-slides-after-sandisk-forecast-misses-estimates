Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the second-largest
maker of  flash memory , fell the most in five months in Tokyo
trading after SanDisk Corp. gave a second-quarter sales forecast
that fell short of some analyst estimates.  Toshiba  dropped  as much as 4.4 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since Nov. 10, to 323 yen and traded at 326 yen
as of 10:12 a.m. in Tokyo. Milpitas, California-based SanDisk,
the world’s largest maker of flash-memory cards, said yesterday
sales will drop as demand has been weaker than it expected.  “Sentiment worsened because of SanDisk,” said  Mitsuo
Shimizu , an analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It gave
the impression that the whole chip industry may be in the same
situation.”  Industry demand in the memory business was lower than
expected in the first quarter, while supply grew faster than
estimated,  SanDisk (SNDK) ’s Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra
said in prepared remarks yesterday. The trend will probably
continue in the second quarter, he said, causing revenue to
decline to about $1 billion. Analysts had expected sales of
$1.28 billion, according to the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
