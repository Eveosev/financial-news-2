China ’s stocks are poised to rally
as the People’s Bank of China may cut reserve-requirement ratios
to boost economic growth, Andrew Economos, head of sovereign and
institutional strategy Asia ex-Japan at JPMorgan Asset
Management in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview.  “China is probably due for a rally here as the PBOC begins
to understand the extent of the problems globally and internally
with the  property market ,” Economos said. “I think we will
start to see easing in terms of reserve-requirement ratio cuts
as well as reverse repo, basically to flood the market with
capital. That’s going to be good news for equities in China.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
