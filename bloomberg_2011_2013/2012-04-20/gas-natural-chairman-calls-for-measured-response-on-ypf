Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  Chairman
Salvador Gabarro urged the Spanish government to temper its
response to Argentina’s expropriation of  YPF SA (YPFD)  to avoid
sparking a trade war that could damage other companies.  The government’s measures should have “an intelligent
degree of force that helps Repsol,” Gabarro said today at a
news conference in Barcelona. “It’s absolutely necessary that
governments support companies and I understand that’s what this
government will do.”  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is discussing with the cabinet
today how best to react to Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s decision this week to seize 51 percent
of YPF from Madrid-based  Repsol YPF SA. (REP)  Gas Natural made about
24 million euros ($31.6 million) in earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization from its Buenos Aires-based
unit last year, Gabarro said ahead of the company’s annual
shareholder meeting.  The Barcelona-based utility is targeting more than 5
billion euros of Ebitda this year and net income of 1.5 billion
euros, according to a presentation published today. Chief
Executive Officer Rafael Villaseca is investing in operations
outside  Spain  to increase profits as his home market endures its
second recession since 2009.  Ebitda from international businesses rose 10 percent last
year while the company’s fleet of liquefied natural gas tankers
saw sales of gas outside Europe jump 38 percent, according to
the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
