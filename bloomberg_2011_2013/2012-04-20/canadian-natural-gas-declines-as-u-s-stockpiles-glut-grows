Canadian natural gas fell as U.S.
inventories rose to 2.512 trillion last week, 871 billion higher
than a year earlier.  Alberta  gas slid 1.2 percent one day after the Energy
Department released its stockpiles report. If supplies continue
to grow at normal rates, U.S. storage could reach its capacity
of about 4.1 billion cubic feet by mid-September, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “People are slowly coming to grips with the enormity of
the surplus,” said  Martin King , an analyst with FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. in Calgary. “There’s still a way to go on the
downside.”  Alberta gas for May delivery fell 1.75 cents to C$1.45 a
gigajoule ($1.37 per million British thermal units) as of 12:25
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 49 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 1.8 cents to $1.925 per million Btu as of 12:27
p.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 74 million below target.  Pipeline Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.21 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.12 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.15 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet today, or 57 percent of
its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.89
billion cubic feet at 11:20 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
