Cyprus Airways Ltd. (CAIR)  will close
unless it finds a group to invest 45 million euros ($49.3
million) in the company’s planned share capital increase,  Ta Nea 
said, citing George Mavrocostas, the airline’s chairman and
chief executive officer.  The air carrier is in discussions with possible investors
and has already talked with Aeroflot,  Transaero Airlines (TAER) , Middle
East Airlines and with Qatar, the Athens-based newspaper cited
Mavrocostas as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
