Socialist challenger Francois Hollande is bettors’ pick to unseat French President Nicolas Sarkozy in elections that start in two days.  William Hill Plc (WMH)  offers odds of 1-5 for Hollande to win,
meaning that a $5 bet returns $1 plus the original stake.
Sarkozy is 10-3, meaning a $3 bet wins $10 on top of the
original stake.  Both  Paddy Power Plc (PAP)  and  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  offer 1-8 on
Hollande and 9-2 on Sarkozy.  The French choose April 22 among 10 candidates, with a May
6 runoff between the top two, almost certainly Hollande and
Sarkozy.  Every opinion poll over the past 11 months has placed
Hollande as the favorite to win the decisive round, even if some
put him behind Sarkozy in the first round. Paddy Power is
quoting odds of 33-1 on Sarkozy and 40-1 on Hollande to fail to
progress out of the first round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
