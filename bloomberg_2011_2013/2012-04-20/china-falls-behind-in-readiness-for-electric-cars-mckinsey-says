China , the world’s largest
 automobile  market, slipped in its readiness for electric
vehicles as existing subsidies failed to stimulate demand.  China ranked fifth globally behind  Japan , U.S., France and
Germany in the adoption of battery-powered vehicles, falling
from third place in 2010, according to a McKinsey & Co. report
released today. A lack of consumer demand, limited models and
inadequate charging stations were other reasons contributing to
the decline, McKinsey said.  “You can’t just buy an electric vehicle and when you find
one, you have no place to charge it,” Axel Krieger, Beijing-
based partner at McKinsey, said in a phone interview today.
“There are just a limited number of cars you can get and they
might not fit your needs.”  The findings underline the challenges that China faces in
trying to expand the use of cars beyond conventional fossil
fuel-powered vehicles. The State Council, or cabinet, this week
approved a plan to stimulate the development of electric
vehicles through financial support and individual subsidies,
recycling batteries and building charging points.  Automakers including  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and
 Daimler AG (DAI)  have announced plans to introduce hybrids or electric
vehicles in China, as the government seeks to cut smog and its
reliance on imported oil.  China built about 16,000 charging points last year, less
than 5 percent of the government’s 2015 target for 400,000
charging stations, according to McKinsey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
