Donald Trump , the U.S. real estate
developer, opened a $400 million twin-tower complex in Istanbul
and will partner Turkish owner and billionaire businessman  Aydin Dogan  in more real estate in the city.  Trump Towers Istanbul, two skyscrapers each about 150
meters (492 feet) tall in the central Mecidiyekoy district,
include 204 apartments on sale for as much as $6 million and
43,000 square meters (463,000 square feet) of offices and
stores.  “We have a great relationship with Dogan,” Trump said in
an interview at the towers in Istanbul today. “We are going to
invest in real estate with them in Istanbul within two years. It
will be something like Istanbul Trump Towers.”  About 75 percent of residences at Trump Towers have been
sold at prices ranging from $600,000 to $6 million, Trump and
Dogan told reporters at a news conference in Istanbul today.
Dogan and his family also own  Turkey ’s biggest media group.  “This project has been a great success,” Trump said in
the interview. “It has made Turkey one of our priorities for
real estate investment.”  All of the larger residences have been sold off, Trump and
Dogan said. The size of the apartments range from about 85
square meters to 680 square meters.  Trump also said he plans to invest in hotels in Turkey “as
soon as possible”. Donald Trump is the Chairman and President
of Trump Hotel Collection, which features boutique luxury hotels
in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Panama .  To contact the reporter on this story:
