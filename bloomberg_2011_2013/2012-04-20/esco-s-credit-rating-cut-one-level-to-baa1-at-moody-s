Tesco Plc, (TSCO)  the U.K.’s biggest
supermarket owner, had its long-term credit rating cut one level
to Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service after pledging 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) to revive domestic stores.  The grocer’s plan to win back market share at home will
weigh on U.K. profitability in the current fiscal year, Yasmina Serghini-Douvin, vice president and senior analyst at Moody’s,
said today in a statement. “This will slow down the progress in
its credit metrics that had been factored into our previous
rating.”  Tesco said this week it plans to revamp stores, add 8,000
supermarket workers and pump 150 million pounds into expanding
its online offer after its Big Price Drop campaign failed to win
back shoppers drawn away by price-matching programs at rivals
such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda and  J Sainsbury Plc. (SBRY)   Moody’s had placed Tesco’s A3 long-term senior unsecured
 rating  on review for a possible downgrade on Jan. 20. The
retailer had the fourth-lowest investment-grade rating at
Moody’s since July 30, 2008.  A Baa1 rating puts Tesco one level below  William Morrison
Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  and one level ahead of  Metro AG. (MEO)  Sainsbury
doesn’t have a rating from Moody’s.  Tesco rose 0.9 percent to 322.95 pence at 3:08 p.m. in
London trading. The  shares  are down 20 percent this year after
the retailer cut profit guidance in January for the first time
in two decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
