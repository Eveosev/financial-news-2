Vietnam ’s government bonds had the
biggest weekly advance since early March on speculation
consumer-price gains will slow. The dong strengthened.  Yields reached the lowest level since 2010 today as online
newswire VnExpress reported that month-on-month inflation is
forecast to be below 0.1 percent in April, citing Bui Quang Vinh,
minister of planning and investment. Consumer prices increased
0.2 percent in March from February, official data show.  “There is still good demand for bonds as inflation is
easing,” said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head of fixed-
income and  currency trading  at the Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam. “Banks also have abundant liquidity.”  The yield on the benchmark  five-year  bonds slid 33 basis
points this week to 10.89 percent, the lowest level since
November 2010, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, today.  The  dong  strengthened 0.4 percent to 20,838 per dollar this
week, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency was steady today. The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed its
daily reference  rate  at 20,828, unchanged from Dec. 26,
according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
