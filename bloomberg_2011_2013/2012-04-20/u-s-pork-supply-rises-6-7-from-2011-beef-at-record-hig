Pork stockpiles in the U.S.
were 6.7 percent higher on March 31 than a year earlier,
the government said. Beef supplies were the highest ever
for the date.  Warehouses held 612.7 million pounds of pork at the
end of March, up from  574.4 million  on March 31, 2011, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Inventories fell 1.6 percent from the end of February. Beef
supplies rose 14 percent from a year earlier to 507.9
million pounds, breaking the record for the date set in
1977, the USDA said.  U.S. commercial pork  output  in the three months
through March 31 totaled 5.858 billion pounds (2.7 million
metric tons), up 2.4 percent from 2011, government data
show. Wholesale pork  prices , a gauge of demand, fell 5.8
percent in March, the sixth straight monthly decline,
according to the USDA.  “If we see a month-to-month increase, it would signal
that demand was poor,”  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught
Futures Insights, said in a telephone interview from Altus,
 Arkansas , before the report. Consumers may have been
deterred by high retail prices, he said.  Boneless ham averaged $3.735 a pound at the
supermarket in March, the highest since at least 1991,
government data show. Prices are up 5.7 percent from a year
ago.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.4 percent to
87.55 cents a pound at 12:59 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the most-active contract rose 5.3
percent this year.  As of March 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, surged 26 percent from a
year earlier to 66.1 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham plunged 26 percent to
77.9 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of March were 17
percent smaller than a year earlier at 577 million pounds,
the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
