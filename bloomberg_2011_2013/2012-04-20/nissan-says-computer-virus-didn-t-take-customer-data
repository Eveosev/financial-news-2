(Corrects headline for clarity.)  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  said it found and
removed a virus from its global computer network before any
customer or company data was misused.  The company, Japan’s second-largest automaker, found the
malware on April 13, and has spent a week removing it and
investigating potential  data theft , Scott Becker, Nissan’s North
American senior vice president for finance and administration,
said in an interview today. The virus appears to be new and is
designed to collect and transfer user IDs and passwords, he
said.  While some IDs and passwords were transmitted, “there’s no
indication that any personal information and e-mails were
compromised,” he said.  Nissan’s customer-call center will provide additional
information on the matter, said David Reuter, a company
spokesman. U.S. operations for Yokohama-based Nissan are in
Franklin,  Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
