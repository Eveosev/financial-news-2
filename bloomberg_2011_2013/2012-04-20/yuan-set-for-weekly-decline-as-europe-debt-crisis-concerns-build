China ’s yuan had a weekly decline
on speculation the global recovery will stall as  Spain  threatens
to re-ignite Europe’s debt crisis.  The Chinese currency weakened for a third day after Spain
auctioned 10-year debt to yield 5.74 percent yesterday, compared
with 5.40 percent at the last sale on Jan. 19. The People’s Bank
of China lowered the yuan’s  fixing  by 0.26 percent this week,
the most since November.  “The market’s concern about the European debt crisis has
worsened this week,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender.  The yuan declined 0.09 percent this week to 6.3085 per
dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency fell 0.07 percent
today. The central bank set the daily fixing 0.06 percent weaker
at 6.3042.  The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the  reference rate . China widened the band from
0.5 percent, effective April 16. The new trading band was
untested in its first week.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 27 basis
points this week to 2.03 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan declined 0.11
percent this week to 6.3075. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards dropped 0.17 percent to 6.3433, a 0.6 percent discount
to the onshore spot rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
