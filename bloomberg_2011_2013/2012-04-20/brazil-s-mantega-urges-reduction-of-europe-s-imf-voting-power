Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  urged International Monetary Fund members to grant
 emerging markets  a greater say in management of the lender,
saying that the overrepresentation of some European countries no
longer reflects the balance of global economic power.  Mantega, in a speech that will be delivered tomorrow at the
IMF meetings in Washington, calls for implementation of a 2010
reform of the quota shares, which determine a nation’s strength
within the fund, to better reflect the changing balance of the
world economy in favor of nations like Brazil, Russia, India and
 China  -- the so-called BRIC nations.  “Brazil’s economy is larger than that of any European
country but Germany and France,” Mantega said, according to the
text of his speech distributed in advance. “Yet, Brazil’s
calculated quota share is equivalent to that of the Netherlands
and smaller than those of  Spain , Italy and the United Kingdom.”  Earlier today, Mantega said that Brazil would insist on
emerging markets having a greater voice in the institution as a
condition to joining an international effort to increase the
fund’s resources by more than $400 billion.  He urged quotas to be calculated based on the gross
domestic product of members, instead of a formula that takes
into account the openness of their economies.  “The quota of Spain, amazing as it may seem, is larger
than the sum total of the quotas of all forty-four Sub-Saharan
African countries,” Mantega said. “These and other anomalies
are a product” of the current formula.  To contact the reporters on this story:
