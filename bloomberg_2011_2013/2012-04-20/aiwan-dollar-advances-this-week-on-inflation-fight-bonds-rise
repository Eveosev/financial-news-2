Taiwan’s dollar advanced for a
second week as the government vowed to contain inflation. The
 overnight interbank lending rate  reached a three-year high.  The currency advanced for a second day after the Cabinet
said in a statement yesterday that it will “closely monitor”
inflation, and may use monetary policy to counter rising prices
if needed. The central bank may allow faster gains in the
overnight rate and the local dollar, the Commercial Times
reported on April 17, citing an unidentified official. Consumer
prices rose 1.21 percent in March from a year earlier, after a
0.23 percent increase the previous month, government data show.  “The central bank is quite determined to control
inflation,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank
of Taiwan in Taipei. “It’s allowing rises in the overnight rate
to drain excess cash from the system.”  Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened 0.04 percent today to
NT$29.521 against its U.S. counterpart and advanced 0.02 percent
this week, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, dropped 20 basis points today to 3.5 percent,
capping a decline of 40 basis points for the week. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The overnight  money-market  rose 0.6 basis point to 0.491
percent this week, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.493 percent
yesterday, the highest level since December 2008, and was little
changed today.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent securities due
January 2017 fell 0.6 basis point to 1.038 percent this week,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It was little changed
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
