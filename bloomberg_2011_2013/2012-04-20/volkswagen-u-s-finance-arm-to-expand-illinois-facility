Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s U.S. financing arm
said it will expand its  Illinois  office, adding about 150 new
jobs through 2018, as it prepares for the German automaker’s
expanding American business.  VW Credit Inc. is breaking ground today on a 30,000-square-
foot (2,787-square-meter) expansion to about double the size of
its facility in Libertyville, Illinois, as part of efforts to
align itself with VW’s “ambitious growth strategy,” Andrew
Stuart, chief executive officer of the credit union, said in a
statement.  U.S. deliveries for the VW brand rose 41 percent during the
first quarter, driven by sales of the redesigned Passat sedan
built at the automaker’s Chattanooga, Tennessee, assembly plant.
The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker wants to double U.S.
vehicle sales by 2018, including the Audi luxury brand.  VW had its best sales month ever with the Passat in U.S.
when it sold 10,032 in March, the company said in a statement.
VW sold 12,497 combined Passat sedans and wagons for all of
2010.  “To now hit a run rate of in excess of 10,000 units for
the month is a real step in the right direction and, I think, a
further endorsement of our product and investment strategy for
the U.S. market,”  Jonathan Browning , CEO of Volkswagen Group of
America, told reporters earlier this month. VW’s U.S. operations
are based in Herndon, Virginia.  The automaker in March said it would add 800 jobs at its
Chattanooga plant to meet demand for the Passat.  VW Credit, which has about 850,000 accounts valued at $20
billion, services 940 dealers in the U.S. and employs about 850
people, the unit said in a statement. The unit serves VW- and
Audi-brand customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
