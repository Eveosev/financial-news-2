European Union  governments will
probably suspend most sanctions against Myanmar to reward the
country for progressing from military rule toward democracy, an
EU official said.  The decision, to be confirmed by EU foreign ministers on
April 23, comes after the government freed political prisoners
and let the party of dissident  Aung San Suu Kyi  back into
parliament, the official told reporters in Brussels today on
condition of anonymity.  The EU plans a 12-month suspension of a ban on investment
in Myanmarâ€™s lumber and gem industries and of visa curbs and
asset freezes on the military leaders and their associates, the
official said. The strategy will be reviewed in October.  Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi, 66, spent more than a
decade under house arrest before being released in 2010 as the
military regime started loosening its grip.  The purpose of suspending instead of scrapping the
sanctions is to give the EU the opportunity to reimpose them in
case the first stirrings of democracy are snuffed out, the
official said.  An EU arms embargo will stay in place, according to the
official. The U.S. also lifted some sanctions against Myanmar
after Suu Kyi was among 43 members of her party to win seats in
parliament in April 1 elections.  Current EU sanctions target 491 government officials,
military officers and family members and 101 companies. Curbs on
87 of the people were already eased in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
