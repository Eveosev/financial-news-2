Portugal  may need to ask for a
second bailout by September as the nation is hamstrung by weak
economic growth and lack of access to bond markets at affordable
rates, according to Morgan Stanley.  The nation agreed to a 78 billion-euro ($102 billion) aid
plan from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund 
last year. Yields on the country’s 10-year bonds are at an
unsustainable 11.85 percent and credit-default swaps signal a 61
percent probability of default.  “We expect a deeper recession than official projections
and consensus estimates,’ Morgan Stanley analysts including
London-based Daniele Antonucci said in a report. ‘‘Our base case
is a second bailout package by September 2012; however, we see
risks of possible derailment in the medium term.’’  Gross domestic product will fall 3.4 percent this year
after declining 1.6 percent in 2011, the Bank of Portugal said
March 29. Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho , who
plans to resume bond sales next year, has said a failure to
regain  market access  would trigger additional ‘‘support’’ from
EU peers.  ‘‘The current determination in  Europe  to avoid another debt
restructuring may be challenged further down the road, if the
fundamentals deteriorate,’’ the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  Investors with exposure to Portugal should switch from
short term to long terms bonds, said the analysts, recommending
selling Portugal’s bonds due 2017 and buying debt maturing 2037.  To contact the reporter on this story:
