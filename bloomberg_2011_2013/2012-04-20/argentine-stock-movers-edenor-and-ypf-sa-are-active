The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of the close in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 0.6 percent to 2,338.48.  Empresa Distribuidora & Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  
fell 2.7 percent to 0.73 pesos, its seventh consecutive loss.
The power distributor known as Edenor dropped on concern
companies that depend on government regulation to increase
revenue will face a more “complicated” scenario after YPF is
nationalized, Ruben Pascuali, an analyst at Buenos Aires-based
brokerage Mayoral Bursatil, said in a telephone interview.  YPF SA (YPFD AF) rose 1.2 percent to 82 pesos. Argentina’s
largest oil company gained for a second day as investors assume
the government taking a 51 percent stake in the company from
Spain’s Repsol YPF SA “won’t lead to ultimate nationalization
of shareholder value,”  Sachin Shah , an arbitrage strategist at
Tullet Prebon Americas Corp., said by phone from Jersey City,
New Jersey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
