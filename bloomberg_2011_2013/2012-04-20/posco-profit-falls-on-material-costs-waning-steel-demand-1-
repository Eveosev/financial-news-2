Posco, the world’s third-biggest
steelmaker by output, said first-quarter profit fell 42 percent
because of rising raw-material costs and waning demand for the
metal used in cars, ships and buildings.  Net income fell to 538.6 billion won ($472.6 million) in
the three months ended on March 31 on a parent basis from 927
billion won from a year ago, the Pohang, South Korea-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. The result beat the
465 billion won average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Posco joins Asian rivals including  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) 
and China Steel Corp. in reporting lower profit after the debt
crisis in  Europe  curbed global economic growth and steel demand.
The first quarter would probably be the worst for earnings this
year, Chief Executive Officer Chung Joon Yang said Jan. 17.  “The overall steel sector in the region remains in the
doldrums and the demand picture is still pretty bleak,” Lee Jin Woo, who helps manage $3.5 billion in equities at Seoul-based
KTB Asset Management Co., said before the earnings announcement.
“While margins may improve slightly in the second quarter as
raw material prices drop, the key question is if the company can
cut discounts to customers, which appears to be a very difficult
task for now.”  Posco (005490)  fell 0.4 percent to close at 378,500 won in Seoul
trading today. The announcement came after the stock market
closed. The shares have declined 0.4 percent this year, compared
with a 8.2 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index. Baoshan
Iron has gained 2.7 percent this year, while Nippon Steel Corp.
rose 5.2 percent.  Operating Profit  Posco’s first-quarter operating profit fell about 54
percent to 422 billion won, falling short of the 471 billion won
average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose to 9.46 trillion won from 9.11 trillion won.  Iron ore contract prices probably rose to $144 a ton in the
first quarter from $137 a year earlier and coal prices to $235 a
ton from $225, Jeon Seung Hun, an analyst at  Daewoo Securities
Co. (006800) , wrote in a March 30 report. The prices fell from $165 and
$285 for ore and coal respectively in the previous quarter,
according to the report.  Posco’s domestic selling price for benchmark hot-rolled
coils probably fell to 840,000 won a ton in the first quarter
from 849,000 won in the previous quarter and 854,000 won a year
earlier, Will Byun, an analyst with Woori Investment &
Securities Co., wrote in a March 27 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
