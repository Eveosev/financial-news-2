Curtis Granderson  hit a career-high
three home runs to help the  New York Yankees  defeat the
Minnesota Twins 7-6.  Granderson went 5-for-5 and hit home runs in the first,
second and fourth innings at Yankee Stadium last night to became
the 20th Yankee to hit at least three homers in a Major League
Baseball regular-season game.  Mark Teixeira  added a two-run
homer in the first for  New York  (7-6).  “A lot of work went into today before we stepped on the
field,” Granderson said. “I was struggling to get myself in a
good position to be able to do things when I wanted to do it.
That’s what we worked on today.”  Granderson, who marked his 12th career multi-homer game, is
the first Yankee to collect at least five hits and at least
three home runs in a single game.  “You don’t see that very often,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said. “So he should cherish it and it’s fun to watch as
a manager.”  Shortstop  Derek Jeter  got his 3,110th career hit with a
second-inning single to tie former Yankee Dave Winfield for 18th
place on baseball’s career list.  “I hope he pauses for just a moment to admire the view
with me and then keeps on going,” Hall of Famer Winfield said
last night in a statement. “This is just one more achievement
in an incredible career.”  Ryan Doumit hit a two-run single in the first and a two-run
homer in the sixth to drive in four runs for the Twins (4-9).  Yankees starter Phil Hughes (1-2) gave up six runs on six
hits and struck out four for the win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
