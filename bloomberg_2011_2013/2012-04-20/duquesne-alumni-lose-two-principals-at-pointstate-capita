PointState Capital LP, the $5
billion hedge fund founded two years ago by former employees of
Stan Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital Management LLC, said two
principals are leaving the firm.  Anuj Malhotra, 41, who was a global macro adviser at the
firm, is retiring effective May 31, according to a letter to
clients, dated today. Sean Cullinan, 46, chairman and chief
executive officer, who oversaw Malhotra’s work at PointState,
will also leave at the end of May.  With the departure of Malhotra, who worked in asset
management for 15 years, the firm will “significantly reduce”
macro investing, PointState said in the letter. Zach Schreiber,
39, a founding partner of the firm, will replace Cullinan.  Druckenmiller said in August 2010 that he would close
Duquesne, his 30-year-old hedge fund, and return client capital.
His colleagues founded PointState a few months later and
Druckenmiller invested about $1 billion in the firm, which is
now closed to new investments. The balance of the $5 billion the
partners raised came from other Duquesne investors.  PointState returned 3.38 percent since the start of this
year through yesterday, according to the letter. Jonathan
Gasthalter, a spokesman for PointState, declined to comment.  Schreiber will continue to manage the largest portfolio,
which is focused on commodity-related investments. Josh Samuelson, 38, another co-founder, will assume the role of vice
chairman and join the firm’s management committee.  Because of the changes, PointState is giving clients the
right to pull all or part of their investments on May 31. Fund
executives don’t expect the changes to have a significant impact
on the firm’s assets, according to people familiar with
PointState.  Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Druckenmiller, declined to
comment.  Duquesne, which never had a money-losing year, posted an
average annual return of 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
