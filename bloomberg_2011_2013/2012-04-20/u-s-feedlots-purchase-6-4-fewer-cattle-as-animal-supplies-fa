U.S. feedlots reduced
purchases of young cattle by 6.4 percent in March as fewer
animals were available for sale because of a shrinking herd
and as improving conditions allowed cattle to graze on
pastures.  Feedlots bought 1.792 million head of cattle last
month, down from 1.914 million in March 2011, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 7.7 percent
drop, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 11.482 million
as of April 1, up 2 percent from a year earlier and in line
with analysts’ expectations.  The U.S. cattle herd at the beginning of the year was
the smallest since 1952 as ranchers culled herds after a
drought in the South destroyed pastures. They sold more
cattle to feedlots in June, July, September, November and
February than in the same months in the previous year.  “Stronger placements in February and previous months
finally meant fewer feeder cattle sold at markets, and
therefore available for placement into feedlots,” Tim Petry, a livestock economist at North Dakota State
University in Fargo, said in an e-mail before the report.  Greener Pastures  Improved weather conditions also prompted more
ranchers to leave animals on pasture, rather than move them
to feedlots. The first three months of 2012 have been the
 warmest  on record in the contiguous U.S., according to the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  “Increased rains and warmer temperatures allowed for
good pasture growth and is likely keeping feeders out of
feedlots,” Elaine Johnson, an analyst at CattleHedging.com
in Westminster,  Colorado , said in an e-mail before the
report. “The decline in fed cattle prices during the month
may have discouraged placements as well.”  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for about four to five months
until they weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.918 million animals to
meatpackers last month, down 3.6 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected 5.7 percent drop,
on average.  Fattened cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.5
percent to $1.1525 a pound at 12:57 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price dropped 4.6
percent in 2012.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement were
little changed at $1.555575 a pound, and before today, the
commodity was up 4.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
