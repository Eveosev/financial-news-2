OAO RusHydro (HYDR)  will pay dividends
this year at least as high as in 2010 and may increase the
payment by as much as 15 percent over the next three to five
years, Deputy Chairman George Rizhinashvili said.  Russia ’s largest hydropower producer, which is majority-
owned by the government, paid shareholders 2.5 billion rubles
($84.7 million) in 2010, Rizhinashvili said. The future dividend
policy will depend on the administration’s plan for selling part
of its holdings, he said.  “We have an intention to pay a dividend of no less this
year than last year,” Rizhinashvili said in an interview at a
conference run by Russian lender VTB Group in New York
yesterday. “We plan on increasing our dividends in the future
compared with this year. The increase of 10 to 15 percent would
be appropriate.”  RusHydro’s  American depositary receipts  gained 2.6 percent
in New York trading, the most since Feb. 24, as the  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. added 0.6 percent to 103.25 yesterday. Futures expiring
in June on Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 1.1
percent to 155,215 in U.S. trading.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 1.2 percent to $29.98 yesterday.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, was little changed at 30.11 points in New York.  RusHydro’s ADRs have gained 16 percent this year in New
York, compared with the 6.7 percent increase on Moscow’s 30-
stock Micex Index. The U.S. stock trades for 8.3 times analysts’
estimated earnings, compared with an average valuation of 11.9
times for power and utilities companies on the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index.  State Holdings  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who will return to Russia’s
presidency for his third term in May, pledged in a Jan. 30
article in the Vedomosti newspaper to divest the government’s
stakes in major non-commodity companies and to lower state
holdings in some resource producers by 2016, excluding utilities
and defense enterprises.  The government owned 60.38 percent of RusHydro as of March
31, 2012, according to the company’s  website . Russia may start
selling holdings in energy companies such as RusHydro this year,
Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said in Moscow on March 29.  Should the price of the sale be a priority for the
government, “it does make sense to look at a different timing,
I’d say year 2013 would be a transition period in which it’s
possible to consider selling a significant stake,”
Rizhinashvili said. “The maximum price for the stake can be
reached in a short-term perspective as well, when a certain
model of privatization is used. There are different approaches
towards it.”  Crude Falls  RusHydro’s ADRs climbed to to $3.51 yesterday in New York,
the first advance in four sessions. The stock added 2.8 percent
to 1.05 rubles, or 4 U.S. cents, in Moscow yesterday, and
RusHydro’s  depositary receipts  listed in  London  jumped 3.1
percent to $3.56.  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, lost 0.4 percent to
$102.27 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday,
while Brent oil for June settlement gained 0.1 percent to $118
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief
export blend, rose 0.5 percent to $114.56.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-largest wireless operator
by subscribers, fell 0.9 percent to $10.20 in New York, the
lowest level since Jan. 10.  Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s largest phone company and
the biggest shareholder in VimpelCom, said yesterday that it
complied with Russian law in buying a stake in the company from
Weather Investments II S.a.r.l., according to a statement.  The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service filed a claim
asking Telenor to return the 234 million VimpelCom preferred
shares it bought from Weather for $374.4 million on Feb. 15,
Telenor said, adding that it has not been formally notified of
the claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
