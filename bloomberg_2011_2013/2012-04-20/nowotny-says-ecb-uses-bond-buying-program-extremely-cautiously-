European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the bank only buys  government
bonds  in certain situations and with “extreme” caution.  “This program is not to be seen as a permanent feature of
our tool box,” Nowotny said in an interview with Bloomberg News
in Washington today. “We use it extremely cautiously and
according to the specific situation” and it is not needed “for
the time being.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB hasn’t bought any government bonds
as part of its Securities Markets Program for five straight
weeks, even as officials in Spain have called on them to do so
as the country’s borrowing costs have surged. Policy makers
including ECB President  Mario Draghi  have said the program is to
keep the monetary policy transmission mechanism functioning and
doesn’t constitute the financing of governments.  Nowotny said  Spain ’s government needs to be given time for
the fiscal reforms they have made to take effect.  “The Spanish government has introduced a very far-reaching
program, and we all know that these programs need some time to
bring positive results,” Nowotny said.  Nowotny, who is the governor of Austria’s central bank,
said the rate of inflation in the 17-member euro area may exceed
the ECB’s target of 2 percent for a period, as monetary policy
can have little effect on  oil prices  driven by political
instability.  “We had an undershooting of inflation for a number of
years, we can have an overshooting for a certain period,”
Nowotny said, adding that he didn’t see signs of energy price
increases feeding through to wage deals in so-called second
round effects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
