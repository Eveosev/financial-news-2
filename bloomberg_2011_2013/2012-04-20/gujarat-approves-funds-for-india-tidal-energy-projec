The western Indian state of Gujarat
plans to spend 250 million rupees ($4.8 million) to help develop
the nation’s first project to produce power from ocean tides.  Gujarat approved the funding along with an additional 100
million rupees for a pilot geothermal power project in its
budget for the financial year that started April 1, D.J.
Pandian, the state’s principal energy secretary, said today.  “After we see how these pilot projects do, then we’ll take
a look at developing a policy to attract more investment,”
Pandian said in an interview in Gandhinagar.  The state may work with the International Finance Corp.,
the  World Bank ’s private-sector financing arm, which is
interested in supporting a tidal-energy project with a loan or
equity investment, he said.  Atlantis Resources Corp., a tidal-turbine maker backed by
 Morgan Stanley (MS) , is developing a marine energy project in the
Gulf of Kutch with the  Gujarat Power Corp . with an initial
capacity of 50 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
