Bank Austria AG, a  UniCredit SpA (UCG) 
unit, lost a Zurich retrial over German demands for repayment of
more than 245 million euros ($324 million) linked to the former
East German Communist Party.  A Zurich high court upheld its 2010 decision to order Bank
Austria to restore the funds to the German government, said
Martin Halama, a spokesman for the Vienna-based unit. The
retrial was ordered last year.  When the dispute first went to court in 1994, Germany said
Bank Austria’s former AKB Privatbank Zuerich unit helped launder
250 million deutsche marks ($173 million) that vanished from the
accounts of two former East German trading companies after the
fall of communism. Germany said the funds were East German state
assets that AKB helped shift to the Austrian Communist Party in
the 1990s after German reunification.  Germany  is also seeking
interest on the amount dating from 1992.  Bank Austria has denied wrongdoing and said it had evidence
contradicting Germany’s claims. Germany is being represented by
Bundesanstalt fuer vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben, the
legal  successor  of the group that was in charge of managing the
assets of the former East Germany.  Bank Austria plans to appeal in the Swiss Federal Supreme
Court, Halama said. The verdict was first reported by  Der
Standard .  To contact the reporter on this story:
