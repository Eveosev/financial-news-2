Ukraine’s Donetskstal-Metallurgical
Plant may invest in  Zelezara Smederevo ,  Serbia ’s sole steel
mill, that the  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  sold earlier this year.  “Donetskstal is participating in the tender,” Olga
Medvedovskaya, a Donetskstal spokeswoman said in an e-mail
today.  Serbia announced last week it is seeking offers for the
plant and set May 4 as the deadline for binding bids. The
government is looking for a “strategic partner” for the mill,
southeast of Belgrade, after buying it back from the U.S.
steelmaker for a token amount of $1 in January. The plant works
at half capacity of 2.2 million tons of crude steel a year.  “Donetskstal is a serious candidate, considering their
size, the large resource base and the huge quantities of coke
they have,” Serbia’s Deputy Premier Jovan Krkobabic said in a
phone interview in Belgrade, adding that the Ukrainian
steelmaker will also have good access to Smederevo by the Danube
river from the  Black Sea .  Other contenders for Zelezara Smederevo may include  United
Group SA , a Luxembourg-based holding company comprising Pilsen
Steel Sro and Baummash OJSC, said the Serbian government which
held talks with United Group last month.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
