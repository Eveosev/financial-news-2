U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
slipped as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
crude narrowed.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on June futures prices,
narrowed 20 cents to $15.08 a barrel at 2:09 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent decreases versus WTI, it typically diminishes the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
lost 50 cents to $17.75 a barrel at 12:05 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
decreased 50 cents to a premium of $16.75 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium was unchanged at $14.85 a barrel
over WTI, and Mars Blend lost 45 cents to a premium of $11.30.
Poseidon’s premium decreased 50 cents to $10.25, while Southern
Green Canyon’s was unchanged at $9.75.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.60 a barrel, Syncrude’s discount was steady at $1 and Bakken
oil’s discount was unchanged at $6.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
