Argentina’s Economy Minister Hernan
Lorenzino said Spain has the right to respond to the
nationalization of oil producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  as it sees fit and the
government has no plans to respond to a possible import ban on
Argentina biofuels.  “We’re not going to respond to the action of a sovereign
country,” Lorenzino told reporters in  Washington . “They have
every right to take the actions they consider adequate.”  Any import ban on Argentine biofuels can be offset by an
increase in domestic sales, he said. “An economy that grows at
the levels that Argentina has recently can perfectly absorb”
such a shock, he added. “It’s precisely the advantage of an
economy that invests in its internal market.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
