market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names.  Palm-oil producers: Crude palm-oil futures for July
delivery dropped as much as 1 percent in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. (GGR)  , the world’s second-
biggest palm oil producer by sales, decreased 1.3 percent to 75
Singapore cents.  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  , the world’s
biggest palm oil processor, slid 0.6 percent to S$4.86.  Frasers Commercial Trust (FCOT)   gained 1.1 percent to
88.5  Singapore  cents after the office landlord reported second-
quarter distributable income increased 11 percent from a year
earlier to S$11.2 million ($9 million).  Keppel Corp. (KEP SP), the world’s largest oil-rig maker,
dropped 1.4 percent to S$11.39, its first decline in three days,
after its offshore engineering unit reported profit margins
dropped to 15 percent in the first quarter from 21 percent a
year earlier as it worked on lower-priced orders.  “Lower-than-expected offshore and marine margins in the
next one to two quarters could be a negative share price
driver,” Nancy Wei, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. in
Singapore, said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
