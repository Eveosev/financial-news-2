(Corrects lower end of range in headline.)  United Co. Rusal Chief Executive
Officer  Oleg Deripaska  expects aluminum prices to be in a range
of $2,200 to $2,400 a ton this year.  While the aluminum market is “very shaky,” high physical
demand is pushing up premiums, Deripaska told reporters at a
briefing in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
