The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for a second week to the lowest in more
than eight months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 48 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate
at 11:45 a.m. in London, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
measure has fallen for two weeks from 54 basis points on April 6
to the cheapest cost since Aug. 1.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 55 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed. The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another
was 40 basis points, the lowest since Aug. 1.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 746 billion euros ($981
billion) with the ECB from 757 billion euros the day before.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.734 percent from 0.737 percent.
One-week Euribor rose to 0.319 percent from 0.318 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.466 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
