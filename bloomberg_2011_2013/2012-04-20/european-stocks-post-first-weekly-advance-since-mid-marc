European stocks  capped the first
weekly gain since mid-March as the  International Monetary Fund 
raised its forecasts for global economic growth, U.S. corporate
earnings beat estimates and German business confidence improved.  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, Britain’s largest retail broker,
jumped 13 percent after posting an 11 percent increase in assets
under management.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  rallied 10 percent on
speculation it may be acquired by its Chinese rivals.  Repsol YPF
SA (REP) , the Spanish  oil company  whose Argentine unit was
nationalized, fell 15 percent.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/) 
dropped 14 percent after India’s Tata Communications Ltd.
decided against making an offer for the U.K. network operator.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  advanced 1.7 percent to 257.79
this week, after four weeks of losses. The benchmark gauge has
climbed 5.4 percent so far this year as the  European Central
Bank  disbursed more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to the
region’s financial institutions, U.S. economic reports topped
estimates and Greece won a second bailout.  “The market has stabilized after a couple of down weeks,”
said  Lawrence Peterman , investment director at Eden Financial
Ltd. in  London . “The earnings coming through positively, both
in the U.S. and in  Europe , seems to be quite reassuring.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 2.1 percent,
Germany’s DAX added 2.5 percent and France’s CAC 40 was little
changed. Spain’s IBEX 35 Index lost 2.9 percent. The measure
closed at the lowest since March 2009 on April 19.  Global Economic Growth  The global economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and
4.1 percent in 2013, the Washington-based IMF said on April 17
in its World Economic Outlook, raising forecasts made in January
from 3.3 percent for 2012 and 4 percent for next year.  In the U.S., 80 of the 94 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
companies that reported  quarterly earnings  since April 10 beat
analysts’ estimates, while 13 missed them, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co. were
among the companies that exceeded projections.  In  Germany ,  investor confidence  unexpectedly rose for a
fifth month in April to the highest in almost two years. The ZEW
Center for European Economic Research’s index of investor and
analyst expectations, which aims to predict economic
developments six months in advance, climbed to 23.4 from 22.3 in
March.  Another report on April 20 showed German  business
confidence  unexpectedly rose to a nine-month high in April. The
Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a survey of
7,000 executives, increased to 109.9 from 109.8 in March.
Economists had forecast a drop to 109.5.  Spanish Bond Yields  Spanish two-year notes  fell for the seventh week, extending
the longest run of weekly declines since January 2007, as the
Group of 20 nations said the euro-area debt crisis poses a
threat to global growth.  Spain  tapped the debt markets this week in the face of
rising yields. The nation’s Treasury sold 2.54 billion euros of
two-year and 10-year bonds at an auction on April 19, meeting
the maximum target of 2.5 billion euros. Spain also sold 3.18
billion euros of bills on April 17, compared with a maximum
target of 3 billion euros.  “The bond auctions are another piece of the jigsaw, but
that situation is not going to go away for the next few months
and it will be a drag on markets,” Peterman said.  Non-performing loans for Spanish banks as a proportion of
total lending jumped to 8.16 percent in February, the highest
level since 1994, from less than 1 percent in 2007, according to
Bank of Spain data. The total credit in the economy that the
regulator lists as “doubtful” reached 143.8 billion euros.  Slowing China  House prices  fell in a record 37 of  China ’s 70 cities
tracked by the national government in March. Foreign direct
investment into the country sank for a fifth month, while the
economy expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter, the slowest
pace in almost three years.  In the U.K., Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  ended
his support for more stimulus to drive the economy, joining the
majority of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee in seeking
no change to the 325 billion-pound ($521 billion) asset-purchase
target. Minutes of the BOE’s latest meeting showed officials
took note of the twin risks of a recession and inflation in the
British economy.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., a report on April 16 showed that  retail sales 
climbed 0.8 percent in March. The increase was almost three
times as large as economists had predicted and followed a 1
percent advance in February.  A Labor Department report showed  initial jobless claims 
fell to 386,000 from a revised 388,000 the previous week that
was higher than initially estimated. The median forecast of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had called for a drop to
370,000.  Hargreaves Lansdown (HL/)  climbed 13 percent after saying assets
under management rose 2.6 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) to 26
billion pounds in the three months to March 31. Fiscal third-
quarter revenue increased 17 percent from a year earlier to 62.1
million pounds amid fund inflows and recovering markets.  Vestas jumped 10 percent. The shares surged 13 percent on
April 16 after Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten reported that
Chinese turbine makers Sinovel Wind Group Co. and Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. were considering a bid for the
Aarhus, Denmark-based company.  Commodity Shares Gain  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  rallied 5.9 percent, leading a
 gauge of European commodity companies  higher. Xstrata Plc also
rose 5.9 percent.  International Power Plc added 3.3 percent after GDF Suez SA
agreed to pay 6.4 billion pounds for 30 percent the stake in the
U.K. utility that it doesn’t already own.  Repsol, Spain’s largest oil company, plunged 15 percent
after Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  seized
YPF, the Argentine oil company majority-owned by Repsol.
Argentina also rejected Repsol’s demand for $10.5 billion in
compensation for the unit. S&P lowered the company’s rating to
the lowest investment grade.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide tumbled 14 percent after
Vodafone Group Plc received an extension of the deadline to make
a bid for the company after Tata walked out.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  declined 8.9 percent for the third successive
week of losses, after posting a first-quarter operating loss of
1.34 billion euros, burdened by costs at the unprofitable
equipment venture with Siemens AG. Nokia also lost a patent
lawsuit over wireless technology that could remove its third-
generation handsets from the German market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
