The pound headed for its biggest
weekly increase against the dollar since January before a report
economists say will show U.K. retail sales rose, adding to the
case for the  Bank of England  to pause its stimulus program.  Sterling weakened for the first time in four days against
the euro. Minutes released this week of the Bank of England’s
April meeting showed officials said inflation may be quicker
than previously forecast as they agreed to keep the bank’s asset
purchase target at 325 billion pounds ($521 billion). The U.K.
plans to sell as much as 3 billion pounds of bills today.  The pound was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.6079 at 9:26 a.m.
 London  time, heading for a 1.5 percent weekly gain, the most
since the five days ended Jan. 20. The U.K. currency was little
changed at 81.93 pence per euro. It strengthened to 81.62 pence
yesterday, the strongest level since Aug. 26, 2010.  Sterling has climbed 1.4 percent in the past month, the
second-best performer after the yen among the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The euro dropped 0.7 percent.  U.K. 10-year gilt yields were little changed at 2.14
percent. The rate has climbed 10 basis points this week. The 4
percent security due March 2022 changed hands at 116.435 percent
of face value.  Retail sales including auto fuel gained 0.5 percent in
March from the previous month, when they slid 0.8 percent,
according to the median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The  Office for National Statistics  is set to
publish the data at 9:30 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
