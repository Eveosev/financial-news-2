Tellabs Inc. (TLAB)  Chief Executive
Officer Rob Pullen  said  he has been diagnosed with  colon cancer 
and began chemotherapy a few weeks ago.  Pullen hasn’t shared what stage his cancer is in and
continues working at the company full time, George Stenitzer, a
spokesman for the Naperville, Illinois-based company, said in an
interview. Pullen was named CEO of the networking equipment
supplier in 2008, and has worked at the company since 1985.  Tellabs, which reported a loss of $188.4 million for 2011
citing economic uncertainty,  appointed  Andrew Szafran as chief
financial officer this month. He succeeded Timothy Wiggins, who
left the company in December to take a similar role at  DeVry
Inc. (DV)  Tellabs is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on
April 26.  “I am determined to fight it and beat it,” Pullen said in
a statement today. “The doctors already are seeing some
positive signs. My energy level is great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
