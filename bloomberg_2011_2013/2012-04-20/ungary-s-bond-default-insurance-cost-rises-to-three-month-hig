The cost of insuring against
default on Hungarian sovereign debt increased to the highest in
three months.  Hungary’s five-year credit default swaps rose four basis
points to 600 by 11 a.m. in  London , the highest since Jan. 20,
according to data provider CMA. The forint appreciated 0.3
percent to 296.4 per euro, set for a 0.4 percent gain this week.  Hungary remains in disagreement with the European Union
over legislation which has blocked the start of talks on an
International Monetary Fund bailout five months after Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  requested the aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
