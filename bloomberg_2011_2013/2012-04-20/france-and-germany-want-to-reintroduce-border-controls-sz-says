France and  Germany  want to
reintroduce border controls to stem the flow of illegal
immigrants entering the European Union’s southern and eastern
fringes, the  Suddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  Such a move, which would entail rewriting the EU’s Schengen
border agreement, would not be decided before June and is
designed to be temporary, the newspaper said, citing a joint
Franco-German letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
