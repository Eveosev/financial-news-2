Best Buy Co. (BBY)  named directors Lisa Caputo, Ronald James and Sanjay Khosla to its committee
searching for a successor to  Brian Dunn , who resigned as chief
executive officer last week.  The committee, to be headed by director Kathy J. Higgins
Victor, will hire a search firm to identify external and
internal candidates, including interim CEO Mike Mikan, the
Richfield, Minnesota-based company said today in a statement.
That firm will be announced in a few weeks.  Dunn, CEO since 2009, resigned amid a board investigation
centering on his “personal conduct.” The company, struggling
to compete with online rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple
Inc., announced plans last month to close 50 big-box U.S. stores
and cut 400 corporate jobs.  Separately today, Rogelio M. Rebolledo resigned as a
director, effective June 20, after having joined the board in
2006.  Best Buy  declined  2.4 percent to $21.47 at the close in  New
York . The shares have dropped 8.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
