Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chairman  Eric Schmidt 
was paid $101 million last year, including stock awards and
options that vest over a four-year period, as he turned over
control of the company to co-founder  Larry Page .  Schmidt, who was paid $313,219 in 2010, received $55.6
million in share awards and $38.1 million in options, the
Mountain View, California-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The remaining $7.2 million came from
Schmidt’s $937,500 salary and other compensation.  Schmidt, 56, who was named CEO in 2001, stepped down a year
ago, putting Page back in charge of the world’s largest Internet
search engine. Page and co-founder  Sergey Brin , Google’s largest
shareholders, were each paid $1 last year, part of a plan put in
place in 2004. While shareholders should monitor to ensure
Schmidt’s incentives are in line with the company’s goals, his
pay shouldn’t be seen as reward just for 2011, said David
Larcker, a corporate governance professor at Stanford’s  Graduate
School of Business .  “It’s a big enough number that it would get your
attention, and it’s appropriate for shareholders to ask why it’s
that big,” Larcker said in an interview. “You’d want to feel
pretty comfortable that that corresponds with his new position,
the new things he wants to do. But this is a multiyear grant --
it’s not like you’re going to see this every year.”  Target Value  Schmidt was granted the equity awards with a target value
of $100 million in connection with his transition last year to
executive chairman, according to the filing. The awards will
vest over a four-year period with no performance requirements,
the filing said.  “That kind of volatility in pay over time is unusual,”
Larcker said. “But the awards of stock and stock options, those
are expected values -- they could go up or down.”  Niki Fenwick, a Google spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  also got a
compensation package that vests over time. Cook will receive pay
for 2011 worth $378 million, one of the biggest packages on
record. That includes $376.2 million in shares, half of which
will vest in five years and the remaining amount in 10 years,
Cupertino, California-based Apple said in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
