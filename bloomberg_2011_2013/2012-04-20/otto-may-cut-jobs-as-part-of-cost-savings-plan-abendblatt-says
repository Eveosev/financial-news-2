Otto Group, the world’s largest
mail-order company, may cut jobs as part of a restructuring
program that aims to lower costs amid falling sales and
increasing competition from the Internet,  Hamburger Abendblatt 
reported, citing Otto spokesman Thomas Voigt.  Code-named “Fokus,” the program may affect employees at
the Otto, Baur and Schwab brands in Hamburg, Burgkunstadt and
Hanau,  Germany , the newspaper said. Otto Group’s Voigt declined
to say how many jobs may be cut,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
