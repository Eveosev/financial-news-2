(Corrects date of announcement in last paragraph.)  PSA Peugeot Citroen,  Europe ’s
second-biggest automaker, plans to merge the national
subsidiaries of its two main brands in European countries as
part of a broader plan to reduce costs.  “It is indeed a general policy on the continent to try to
find synergies where we can,” Valerie Gillot, a spokeswoman for
the Citroen brand, said today by phone. “Local entities will
communicate at their pace in each country they’re located.”  Peugeot Suisse and Citroen Suisse’s headquarters, the
carmaker’s Swiss subsidiaries, will soon merge in Geneva, where
Citroen is already located, Gillot said. Peugeot and Citroen
German headquarters will also merge, the Paris-France-based
company said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
