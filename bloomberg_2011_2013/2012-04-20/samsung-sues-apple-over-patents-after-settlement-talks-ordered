Samsung Electronics Co. sued  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  again in the U.S. over patent infringements, one day after
the companies were ordered by a federal court to discuss
settling a year-long intellectual property dispute.  The maker of the Galaxy smartphones filed the additional
suit on April 18 in the District Court for the Northern District
of California, claiming Apple violated eight of its patents,
Samsung said in an e-mailed statement today. The claim is in
response to a February complaint by Apple, the Suwon, South
Korea-based company said.  The world’s two largest smartphone sellers have been suing
each other on four continents since April last year when
Cupertino, California-based Apple accused Samsung of copying its
mobile devices. Their chief executive officers were ordered by
the  California  court on April 17 to attend a settlement
conference.  Steve Park , a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment beyond the company’s previous statement that the iPhone
maker needs to protect its innovations.  Both companies told the court they are willing to
participate in the settlement conference, U.S. District Judge
Lucy Koh in  San Jose  wrote in the April 17 order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
