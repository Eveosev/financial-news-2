Azvirt MMC , an Azeri construction
company, began work on a highway section in central  Serbia ,
supported by a 308 million-euro ($406.5 million) loan.  The 40-kilometer (25 miles) stretch between the towns of
Ljig and Preljina, part of a future highway running from
Serbia’s northeastern border with  Romania  to the southwestern
border with Montenegro on the Adriatic, is to be completed in
three years, said Sanja Stavric, spokeswoman for  Koridori
Srbije , Serbia’s state-run road development company.  Azerbaijan’s parliament approved the 15-year loan on April
6, with a 4 percent annual interest rate and a 3-year grace
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
