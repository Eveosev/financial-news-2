     April 20 (Bloomberg) -- Nigeria ’s naira headed for its third
weekly gain against the dollar after the state oil company was
said to have sold foreign exchange after central bank auctions
this week.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer was little
changed, declining less than 0.1 percent to 157.095 per dollar
as of 1:01 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, giving it a
weekly gain of 0.2 percent. The naira has advanced 3.3 percent
this year, the best performer in Africa after the South African
rand.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. periodically sells
dollars to lenders to meet local spending needs. The oil
industry is the second major supplier of foreign exchange to the
market after the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which sold $270
million at foreign currency at auctions on Monday and Wednesday
this week to stabilize the naira.  “The naira was strongly supported by foreign-exchange
sales from the NNPC and oil companies earlier this week,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging markets strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd., said in e-mailed comments today. “As the oil
flows dry out, we expect the unit to trend higher from these
lows, but this will be a marginal move since foreign exchange
demand has dissipated in recent months.”  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 was unchanged at 5.434 percent. Borrowing costs of domestic
bonds due 2015 rose two basis points to 15.15 percent, according
to the April 19 data on the Financial Markets Dealers
Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.821 per dollar
in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
