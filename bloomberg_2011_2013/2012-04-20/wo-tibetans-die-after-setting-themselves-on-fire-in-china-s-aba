Two Tibetan herdsmen died after
setting themselves on fire in the Aba prefecture of  China ’s
Sichuan province, bringing the number of self-immolations in the
area to at least 25, a rights group said.  People who gathered around the dead men, identified as
Cheopak Kyap and Sonan, blocked police from taking the bodies
away, the International Campaign for  Tibet  said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday, citing exiled Tibetans it did not identify.
The group said the self-immolations occurred near a monastery in
the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture.  Tibetans accuse China of attacking their culture, religion
and environment with policies that have moved thousands of
ethnic Han Chinese into Tibet in the name of economic
development.  The International Campaign for Tibet said the two men were
related. The local government  website  had no information about
the incident and calls to the Aba government went unanswered.  Tibet’s spiritual leader, the  Dalai Lama , has lived in
northern India since fleeing in 1959 from China’s military
takeover of the region. China accuses the Dalai Lama of waging a
campaign for independence while the spiritual leader says he is
seeking autonomy for Tibet.  A Tibetan protester set himself on fire in central  New
Delhi  last month in protest over the Chinese President Hu Jintao’s visit to India.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
