The television unit of LOV Group,
online gaming-site owner Stephane Courbit’s holding company,
plans an acquisition in Europe “soon” and is in talks for
another property in France,  Les Echos  said today, citing an
interview with Courbit.  The TV unit has a goal to double in size by 2015 and to
explore a public offering next year, said the newspaper.  Courbit said nine offers have been made directly and
through a mediation procedure to find a way of resolving  L’Oreal
SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt’s 143-million-euro ($188 million)
investment in LOV Grroup as agreed with her family, according to
Les Echos.  All the proposals have been refused, leaving Bettencourt as
an investor, the newspaper said, citing Courbit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
