The  Michigan Supreme Court  declined
to hear an appeal over alleged secret meetings of the financial
review board formed to address  Detroit ’s fiscal crisis,
according to a court order.  Robert Davis , a staff representative of Council 25 of the
 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ,
sued the Detroit review board and Governor Rick Snyder Feb. 1,
alleging that holding private hearings and failure to provide
public notice of hearings violated the state Open Meetings Act.  The high court in Lansing denied the appeal “because we
are not persuaded that the questions presented should be
reviewed,” according to today’s order.  After the lawsuit was filed, Ingham County Circuit Court
Judge William Collette barred the team from violating the law
and holding closed-door sessions, according to Davis’s lawyer,
Andrew Paterson. An appeals court on March 23 ordered Collette
“to take no further action” in the case.  Paterson isn’t sure whether the board is still meeting, and
said in a phone interview today that  Michigan ’s Court of Appeals
is scheduled to hear oral arguments May 3 on the lawsuit.  The case is Davis v. City of Detroit Financial Review Team,
309219, 309250, Court of Appeals, State of Michigan (Lansing).  To contact the reporters on this story:
