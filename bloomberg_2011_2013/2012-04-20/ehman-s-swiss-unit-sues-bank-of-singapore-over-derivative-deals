Lehman Brothers Finance SA claims
Bank of  Singapore  Ltd. owes it $20 million over the termination
of a series of equity derivative deals that took place between
2006 and 2008.  The Zurich-based arm of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
argues that Bank of Singapore owes it the money dating from when
the Asian bank gave notice of early termination of the contracts
following the bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008, according
to court documents filed at the High Court in  London  last month.  The Lehman unit, which specialized in derivatives, alleges
that the Bank of Singapore wrongly calculated the amount it owed
following the cancellation of the deals valued at more than $3.5
million.  “The defendant said that it had arranged payment of that
amount together with interest; however, no payment was made,”
Lehman Brothers Finance said in the court filings.  This week the administrator of Lehman’s London unit said it
will start returning money to creditors before the end of 2012,
more than three-and-a-half years after the bank’s collapse
sparked a global financial crisis.  Lehman’s lawyers, Field Fisher Waterhouse, declined to
comment.  Isabella Chia, a spokeswoman at Bank of Singapore, declined
to comment.  The case is Lehman Brothers Finance AG v. Bank of Singapore
Limited at the  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division
