Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-
largest U.S. auto insurer, fell the most since August as Chief
Executive Officer Glenn Renwick said rising claims costs may
pressure profit margins.  The insurer dropped $1.01, or 4.5 percent, to $21.37 at
4:01 p.m. in New York.  The combined ratio, a measure of how much of each premium
dollar is spent on claims and expenses, may increase to 96 after
climbing in both 2011 and 2010, Renwick told shareholders today
in prepared remarks at the company’s annual meeting. Progressive
and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Geico unit have been able to
dilute the effect of higher claims costs by adding policies
through the Internet to gain market share from Allstate Corp.  “A year-over-year comparison of net income doesn’t suggest
the same positive tone, but does reflect the current market
reality that our combined ratios for now will be more likely
closer to our target 96 than 90,” Renwick said.  Progressive’s first-quarter  net income  fell 29 percent to
$257.6 million, the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based insurer said
April 11. The combined ratio climbed to 94.1 from 90.3. Higher
costs per claim, or so-called severity, can worsen the combined
ratio as can an increased frequency of accidents.  “Severity trends in most coverages are increasing and, while frequency
trends are still generally favorable, it’s a dangerous combination that can
change quickly,” Renwick said. “Our respect for these conditions
is extremely high.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
