The  Biennale des Antiquaires, 
 France ’s oldest art fair, is looking to profit from the growth
of Asian wealth by starting a mini-biennale in  Hong Kong .  The fair, which hired  Karl Lagerfeld  to stage, decorate and
design its Paris Biennale this September, has now chosen Hong
Kong along with Istanbul, Moscow and  New York  for mini-fairs in
alternating years when the French show doesn’t take place.  “We need to go in front of people instead of them just
coming to us,” said Christian Deydier, president of the
 Syndicat des Antiquaires , an organization of French dealers that
runs the fair.  The decision to bring to Hong Kong next year a scaled-down
version of the Biennale, which Deydier describes as the
“world’s most expensive art fair,” demonstrates the city’s
growing importance on the international art market.  Last year,  China  overtook the U.S. to become the world’s
largest art and antiques market, a report by the Netherlands-
based European Fine Art Foundation said last month. The annual
 Hong Kong International Art Fair  is a stop on the global
circuit, dealers said.  Deydier said in an interview that he was still looking at
several possible venues, including the former Legislative
Council Building, for the Hong Kong fair in October 2013.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter at large for Muse, the arts
