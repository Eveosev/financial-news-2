Dennis Tan and Linan Liu,
strategists at Deutsche Bank AG comment on the outlook for the
yuan’s exchange rate and offshore yuan-denominated assets after
the People’s Bank of  China  widened the currency’s trading band
this week.  They made the comments in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
questions yesterday.  On the yuan:  “The behavior of the PBOC fixings will likely be
ultimately more important for driving longer-term expectations
of foreign-exchange implied volatility, than either changes to
the policy bands or greater realized volatility of the yuan’s
spot rate against the dollar.  “In May 2007, after China widened the policy band to 0.5
percent from 0.3 percent, foreign-exchange implied volatility
did move higher immediately, but stabilized at the higher level
shortly after that, as China continued to allow steady
appreciation in yuan fixings.  On Dim Sum bonds:  “There should be limited upside risk to the yields on
offshore yuan bonds, though markets could come under some
pressure because of potentially higher volatility of the yuan
spot and forwards.  “At the same time, the signal which this move gives for
capital account convertibility should ultimately drive a
strategic allocation into yuan assets in the offshore market,
along with the expansion of RMB business in other regional
centers, capping the upside pressure on bond yields.  On yuan deposits in  Hong Kong :  “The band widening is unlikely to have any significant
impact on offshore yuan deposits. Growth in offshore yuan
deposits is determined more by the volume of yuan trade
settlement flows, availability and attractiveness of yuan
investment products, as well as expectations of yuan
appreciation. The yuan trade settlement scheme is expanding and
will help the offshore yuan deposits to grow too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
