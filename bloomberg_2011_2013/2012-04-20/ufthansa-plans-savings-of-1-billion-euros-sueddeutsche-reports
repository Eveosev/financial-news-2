Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  plans cost
savings of almost one billion euros ($1.3 billion),  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported an e-mailed preview of an article to appear
tomorrow, citing a letter from Chief Executive Officer  Carsten Spohr  to employees.  The plan restricts growth in the fleet, calls for decisions
on investment, including for long-haul aircraft, only after the
savings are achieved, and eliminates first class on many long-
range flights, the newspaper said.  Spohr attributed pressure on the company after a net loss
of 13 million euros last year to competition from low-cost
airlines and new rivals in the long-haul business and said that
meant the existing corporate structure was no longer tenable,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
