months, rising 2.6 percent to 2.40 liras, after saying it will
close its plant in Istanbul’s Topkapi district and make plans to
sell the property.  Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS (DOHOL)  , a group of
companies with interests in media and energy, rose 4.2 percent
to 75 kurus after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood
side-by-side with honorary chairman Aydin Dogan at an opening

public appearance together comes after years of feuding and
after the company’s shares plunged on April 12 amid reports
Aydin Dogan could be arrested in connection with a round-up of
suspects in an investigation into the 1997 toppling of Turkey’s
government.  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL)  , Dogan’s media holding
company, gained 3.1 percent to 67 kurus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
