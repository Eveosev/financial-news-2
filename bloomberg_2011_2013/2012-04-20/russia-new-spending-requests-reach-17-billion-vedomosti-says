Russia ’s Finance Ministry has
received 512 billion rubles ($17.3 billion) in special spending
requests to the government’s three-year budget that was
published in December, including from President-elect Vladimir Putin, Vedomosti  reported .  The ministry opposes 79 percent of the requests, including
64 billion rubles sought by Putin for items including housing
for veterans and the disabled, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported, citing government documents. It also opposes 87
billion rubles requested by outgoing President  Dmitry Medvedev .  No final decisions on the extra spending have been made,
Vedomosti reported, citing Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov. This
year’s deficit may narrow to 0.1 percent of gross domestic
product from a planned 1.5 percent because of higher revenue
from rising oil prices, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
