The owner of Spanish soccer team
Getafe said he will cancel the sale of the club to Royal
Emirates Group unless the bidder meets a payment deadline next
month.  Angel Torres said in an interview today that he is no
longer in contact with representatives of the group led by
chairman Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum of Dubai. A call and
e-mail to Royal Emirates Group managing director, Kaiser Rafiq,
wasn’t immediately returned.  The Dubai-based group, whose website says it represents 64
companies and brands in the region, planned to use Getafe to
network with business leaders in  Spain  and possibly invest in
tourism and solar-energy projects, Rafiq said in an interview
last October.  Under the plan agreed on 12 months ago, Torres would have
remained as president and Royal Emirates would have invested as
much as $130 million in the team over four years. Madrid-based
Getafe is 11th in the 20-team La Liga.  To contact the reporters on this story:
