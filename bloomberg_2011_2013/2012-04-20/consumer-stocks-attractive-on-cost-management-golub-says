Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. market
strategist at UBS AG, said stocks of consumer-focused companies
are becoming attractive as they manage costs better and lower
gasoline prices encourage Americans to spend.  “Consumer companies -- which typically haven’t had the
same kind of fiscal discipline that industrials and energy and
materials companies have -- are doing a brilliant job,” Golub
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with  Tom Keene . “It
is a slower growth economic environment so companies are going
to be forced to really look at the bottom line much more
aggressively.”  Golub said while U.S. economic data continue to beat
forecasts,  Europe ’s debt crisis is still a cause for concern for
financial, energy and commodities stocks.  “I would rather be positively exposed to the economy in
technology, in consumer discretionary, even maybe in industrial
companies which are a play on the success of the economy but
don’t necessarily have the same stock-price exposure to those
macro concerns,” he said. “The one thing I can be certain of
is that some point between now and the end of the year these
issues are going to rise up again and they’re going to be
disruptive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
