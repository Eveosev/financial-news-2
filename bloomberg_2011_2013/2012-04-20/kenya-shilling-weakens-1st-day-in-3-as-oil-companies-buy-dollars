Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first time in three days on increased dollar demand from
petroleum companies.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy was trading
0.1 percent weaker at 83.15 per dollar by 3:54 p.m. in Nairobi,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is demand from the energy sector, the problem is
there was some shortage of oil in the international market, that
is why they have come in heavily,” John Muli, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp. said by phone today. “We
are not seeing a lot of inflows.”  Oil rose for the first time in three days in  New York ,
paring this week’s decline, after German business confidence
unexpectedly increased.  The Ugandan shilling retreated 0.2 percent to 2,515 per
dollar.  “The shilling was weakened by increased local demand
especially from oil importers,” Ahmed Kalule, the head of
 currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.2 percent to 1,585, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There are inflows coming in from the tourism sector
today, and that has contributed to the shilling appreciating”
Emmanuel Mwasanguti, a dealer with CRDB Bank Plc, said by phone
today from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  Tanzania generated $1.2 billion from tourism in 2010,
according to a government report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
