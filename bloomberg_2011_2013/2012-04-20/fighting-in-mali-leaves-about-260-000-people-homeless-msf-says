About 260,000 Malians have been
made homeless by fighting in the West African nation since late
January, according to Medicins Sans Frontieres.  An estimated 1,500 refugees arrive at Mbera refugee camp in
neighboring  Mauritania  every day, MSF spokeswoman Kate Ribet
said in an e-mailed statement from Johannesburg today. About
57,000 refugees are currently living in the camp, which has only
100 latrines, she said.  About 132,000 displaced Malians are in camps in the
country, while 129,000 have fled to refugee centers in
Mauritania, Niger and  Burkina Faso , Ribet said.  The majority of the refugees are ethnic Touareg people from
the Timbuktu region in the northwest, where a group of
insurgents declared independence for the area they call Azawad
on April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
