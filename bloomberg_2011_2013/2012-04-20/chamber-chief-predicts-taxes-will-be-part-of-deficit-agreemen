The president of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce acknowledged that any deficit-reduction deal
probably will include tax increases, and proposed that everyone
except those living in poverty pay taxes.  “If there is a real deal that addressed the questions of
jobs, of growth and of expenditures, there will be some taxes in
there,” Chamber President Thomas Donahue said today in an
interview to be broadcast April 22 on CSPAN’s “Newsmakers.”  Higher taxes won’t necessarily mean an increase in the  tax
rate , though some deductions and credits may be eliminated
during negotiations, Donohue said.  The U.S. House passed a budget last month that reduced the
deficit through spending cuts and lower taxes for high earners.
The proposal by Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  of  Wisconsin 
eliminated $5 trillion in the next decade from programs
including  food stamps , Pell educational grants and Medicaid. The
Chamber, the nation’s largest business group, says on its
 website  that it opposed higher taxes.  Donohue proposed that all Americans above the poverty line,
or $23,050 for a family of four, pay some income tax.  “I don’t care if it is $100, $200 or $500, I want them to
be able to be at risk that somebody could raise it,” Donohue
said. “But if half of the people in the country have no risk of
anybody raising their income tax, what do they care about what
Congress does?”  To contact the reporters on this story:
