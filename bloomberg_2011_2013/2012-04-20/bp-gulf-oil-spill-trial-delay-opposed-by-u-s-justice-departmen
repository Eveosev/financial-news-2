The U.S. Justice Department opposes
delaying a liability trial for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, said acting U.S. Associate Attorney General  Tony West .  The department plans to file court papers objecting to a
request from  BP Plc (BP/)  and lawyers suing the company to delay the
start of the trial until after a proposed Nov. 8 hearing on
their suggested $7.8 billion settlement for spill and cleanup-
related injuries, West said in an interview in Washington today.  The proposed settlement doesn’t include claims by the
federal and state governments or financial institutions, casinos
and some private plaintiffs.  “We are ready to go to trial and we would like to have a
trial as soon as is reasonable and practicable,” West said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
