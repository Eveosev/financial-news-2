Credit-default swaps on  Spain  rose
to a record and the cost of insuring French and Italian
government debt climbed to the highest levels since January as
countries struggle to tame their budget deficits.  Swaps on Spanish debt jumped as much as 16 basis points to
a record 514, and were trading at 507 at 10:40 a.m. in London.
 Italy  and France headed for the biggest weekly increases in
about four months.  Perceptions of European creditworthiness have been
deteriorating since Spain said it won’t meet its 2012 deficit
target, fueling speculation the nation will need a bailout.
Italy will also miss its goal next year, the  International
Monetary Fund  said this week, and investors are concerned a
French presidential election victory for Socialist candidate
 Francois Hollande  will lead to anti-business policies that will
undermine efforts to control its deficit.  “As we flipped the page into the second quarter, there
were question marks over the Spanish deficit, contagion spread
to Italy and more recently there’s been concern about the French
election,” said  Suki Mann , a strategist at Societe Generale SA
in London. “It’s almost a three-pronged attack on the market
from those three countries and people have positioned
accordingly.”  Deficit Overshoot  Fiscal deficits in all peripheral euro-region countries may
overshoot official estimates in 2012 and 2013, Citigroup Inc.’s
London-based economist  Michael Saunders  wrote in the note to
investors. The first round of voting in France’s election takes
place on April 22.  Contracts on Italy rose 16 to 472, heading for a fifth
weekly increase. Swaps on  France  climbed one basis point to 202
and are up from 187 last week.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 3.5 basis points to 286.5,
and is headed for a third weekly increase.  Indexes measuring the cost of insuring corporate and
financial debt all rose for the fourth or fifth week to the
highest levels since January.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 3.5
basis points to 6885. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose one basis points to
146.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 3.5 basis points to 258.5 and
the subordinated index rose 3.5 to 415.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
