Equatorial Guinea will keep exports
of its Zafiro crude for June unchanged from this month at four
cargoes of 1 million barrels each, according to a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The west African nation will also export two 1 million-
barrel consignments of its Ceiba blend, also unchanged from May,
a separate schedule showed.  Exports of  Chad â€™s Doba grade will be three 950,000-barrel
cargoes in June, one less than next month, according to another
shipping plan.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
