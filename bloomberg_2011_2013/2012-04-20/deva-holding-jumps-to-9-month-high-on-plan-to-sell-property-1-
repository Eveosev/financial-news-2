Istanbulâ€™s Topkapi district and make plans to sell the property.  Deva gained 2.6 percent to 2.40 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the highest since July 15.  Deva will close its Topkapi plant by the end of the year
and move all equipment and personnel to other plants in
northwestern Turkey, it said in a statement to the  Istanbul
