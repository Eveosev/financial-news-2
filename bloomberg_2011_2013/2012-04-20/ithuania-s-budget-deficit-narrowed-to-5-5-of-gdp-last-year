Lithuania’s budget deficit narrowed
to 5.5 percent of  gross domestic product  last year, missing the
government’s estimate.  The shortfall shrank from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2010, the
 statistics office  in the capital, Vilnius, said today in a
statement on its website. Government debt rose to 38.5 percent
of GDP last year from 38 percent in 2010, the service said.  The Baltic nation’s government planned for a deficit of 5.8
percent of GDP before revising the outlook to 5.3 percent as
economic growth accelerated to the second-fastest pace in the
European Union. Rising spending on social security signals the
government may struggle cutting the gap further, said Rokas Bancevicius, a senior analyst with DNB Bank AB in Vilnius.  “Social security is the biggest concern,” Bancevicius
said in an e-mail. “The deficit stemming from social security
alone accounts for 1.9 percentage points and it’s difficult to
see improvement here long-term. This deficit won’t retreat
because of demographic trends.”  Lithuania plans to cut the budget shortfall to 3 percent of
GDP this year to meet a 2012 deadline set by the EU as the
shortfall has breached the 3 percent limit since 2008. Reducing
the deficit to 3 percent would also move the country closer to
euro adoption in 2014.  Neighboring Latvia said yesterday its  budget deficit 
narrowed to 3.5 percent of GDP last year from 8.2 percent in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
