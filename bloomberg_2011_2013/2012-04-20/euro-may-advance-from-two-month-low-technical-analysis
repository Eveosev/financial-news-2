The euro may extend its rally from
a two-month low against the yen, according to Gaitame.com
Research Institute Ltd., citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency formed three-consecutive white bars
on its candlestick chart and exceeded the colored bar formed on
April 13, signaling “the euro is bottoming out,” said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at Tokyo-based Gaitame.com. White bars
show that the currency’s closing price is higher than the
opening level, while the colored ones indicate the opposite.  The euro may be headed for a high reached on Feb. 27, a
most that would form a so-called head-and-shoulders pattern with
a March 21 high being the head, said Kawabata, whose company is
a unit of  Japan ’s largest foreign-exchange margin firm. A head-
and-shoulders pattern appears when a currency makes three
consecutive peaks, with the middle the highest.  The euro was little changed 107.25 yen as of 10:45 a.m. in
 Tokyo  after touching 104.63 on April 16, the lowest since Feb.
20. The common currency reached 109.93 on Feb. 27 and advanced
to as high as 111.44 on March 21, a level unseen since October.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
