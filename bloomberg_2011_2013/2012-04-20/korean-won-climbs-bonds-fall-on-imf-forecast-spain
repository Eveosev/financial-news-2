South Korea ’s won posted its second
weekly drop as worse-than-expected U.S. economic data and
 Europe ’s lingering debt crisis damped demand for riskier assets.
 Government bonds  rose amid heightened tensions with North Korea.  More Americans than forecast filed claims for jobless
benefits in the week ended April 14 and sales of previously
owned homes unexpectedly dropped in March, figures showed
yesterday.  Spain  auctioned 10-year bonds to yield 5.74 percent
yesterday, compared with 5.40 percent at the last sale on Jan.
19. South Korea’s central bank cut its 2012 economic growth
forecast this week to 3.5 percent, from a December estimate of
3.7 percent, and overseas investors cut their holdings of the
nation’s shares by $586 million in the last four days.  “The won is facing downward pressure with North Korea-
related risks and concerns about the global economic recovery
persisting,” said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency trader
at Busan Bank. “The currency has been traded within a range
recently, with steep losses being limited by exporters’ selling
of the dollar and speculation the government may intervene.”  The won slid 0.4 percent this week to 1,139.55 per dollar
at the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency weakened 0.1 percent today. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, slid 71 basis points, or 0.71 percentage
point, this week to 7.87 percent.  South Korea unveiled new missiles yesterday that it said
could hit anywhere in  North Korea . The military has deployed the
missiles and is making preparations to ensure it can respond
firmly to North Korean provocations, Defense Ministry spokesman
Kim Min Seok said. North Korea said it will continue its space
program following the April 13 failure of a rocket launch,
according to its state media late yesterday.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 declined three basis points to 3.47 percent this week,
Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate fell two basis points
today.  Three-year debt futures climbed 0.11 to 104.16 this week
and the one-year interest-rate swap declined two basis points to
3.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
