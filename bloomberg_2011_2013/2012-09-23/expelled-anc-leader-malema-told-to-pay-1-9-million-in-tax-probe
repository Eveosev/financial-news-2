Julius Malema , expelled as a youth
leader from  South Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress , was
ordered to pay about 16 million rand ($1.9 million) by a court
this month, according to the country’s revenue service.  The court ruling was confirmed today by Marika Muller, a
Pretoria-based spokeswoman at the South African Revenue Service.  The police service’s Hawks anti-corruption unit issued a
warrant for Malema’s arrest, his lawyer Nicqui Galaktiou of
Brian Kahn Attorneys in Johannesburg said in an interview on
Sept. 21. “We still do not have confirmation of the charges,”
Galaktiou said today in a mobile phone text message.  Malema, 31, was expelled from the ANC in March for sowing
divisions in the party and damaging its reputation. Since then
he has lobbied for the ousting of South African President  Jacob
Zuma  from his position in the ruling party. The ANC will hold a
conference with elections in December. Malema criticized Zuma
and the ANC after mining strikes that led to violence in the
past month while calling for more walkouts and nationalization.  “We are arranging with the National Prosecuting Authority
for Mr Malema to appear in court” in Polokwane next week,
Galaktiou said Sept. 21. Malema will appear in the regional
court on Sept. 26, the Johannesburg-based City Press newspaper
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
