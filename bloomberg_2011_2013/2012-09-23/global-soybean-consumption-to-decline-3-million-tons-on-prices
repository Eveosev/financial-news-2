Global soybean consumption will
drop about 3 million metric tons in 2012-2013 as record prices
curb demand for the oil made from the oilseed for food and
biofuel, Thomas Mielke, executive director of Oil World, said.  “Higher prices of oils have affected consumption in the
food sector but a larger impact is stemming from a slowdown in
biodiesel sector,” according to a presentation by Mielke handed
out an industry conference in Mumbai today. “The growth rates
in usage of oils and fats in biodiesel consumption are going to
slowdown further in 2013.”  The rally in soybean meal prices have cooled demand among
livestock producers and poultry meat production is already
declining, Mielke said.  Soybeans rose to a record $17.89 a
bushel also on Sept. 4.  Import demand will shift to more attractively priced palm
oil next year, he said. “This will result in seizable increase
in exports from Indonesia and  Malaysia , reducing their
stockpiles,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
