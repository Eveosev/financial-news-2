An Egyptian administrative court
ruled that members of the former ruling  National Democratic
Party  can run in local and parliamentary elections, Judge Magdy
el-Agaty, who presided over the case, said by telephone.  El-Agaty said that former NDP officials can run in the
elections so long as they have not violated any rules that would
preclude them from office.  The Supreme  Constitutional Court  on June 14 ruled
unconstitutional the political isolation law, which prevented
former senior officials who served the previous leadership in
the past 10 years from standing for office. The ruling paved the
way for ex-premier Ahmed Shafik to contest the presidency, which
he lost.  The June ruling triggered hundreds of protestors to flock
to  Tahrir Square  in Cairo to express their objections. The NDP
was dissolved by court order in April last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
