Palm oil , used in everything from
candy to biofuels, is set for the largest annual decline in four
years as inventories surge in Indonesia and  Malaysia , the
biggest producers, and a global economic slowdown curbs demand.  Futures in Malaysia, the global benchmark, plunged as much
as 6.7 percent to 2,577 ringgit ($839) a metric ton today on the
Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, before ending at 2,646 ringgit.
The intraday slump exceeded the median estimate of a decline to
2,600 ringgit by December in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts
and importers who attended an industry conference in Mumbai
yesterday. A year-end close at 2,600 ringgit would show a loss
of 18 percent, the biggest decline since 2008.  Palm oil, the world’s most-used cooking oil, has slumped as
demand slowed from importers including  China  and the European
Union, and stockpiles surged because of an increase in
production. The plunge may cut revenues for producers including
 Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  and  IOI Corp. (IOI)  and cap increases in food costs.  “Demand for palm oil in particular, and for vegetable oils
in general has been softer than expected in 2012,” said  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd., who has traded
palm oil for more than three decades. Demand was hurt by slower
growth in the production of biofuels from vegetable oils and a
slowdown in economic growth in the  developing countries  amid
high prices, he said.  Mistry Forecast  Intraday futures tumbled today to the lowest since 2010.
The low surpassed Mistry’s prediction yesterday that he expected
futures to drop to 2,600 ringgit to 2,700 ringgit a ton by
December. The probability of a drop to 2,300 ringgit has risen
to 50 percent from 20 percent in June, he said.  The tropical oil has fallen 23 percent since the end of
March and is heading for a second straight quarterly decline on
concern that a pick-up in production will drive stockpiles in
Malaysia and  Indonesia  to records.  Stockpiles in Malaysia will continue to expand in October,
November and December and may reach as high as 3 million tons by
January, Mistry said. Inventories in Indonesia have hovered
between 3.5 million tons and 4 million tons since 2010 as
against popular estimates of 1.5 million tons to 2 million tons,
he said. Production in Indonesia may climb to 27.5 million tons
in 2012, higher than the 27 million tons estimated on Sept. 6,
while  Malaysia’s output  may be 18 million tons, less than the
18.2 million tons forecast previously, he said.  Biofuel Demand  “The supply position on palm oil is therefore extremely
comfortable and is likely to remain that way for the next
several months,” Mistry said.  Prices may drop to 2,500 ringgit a ton by December because
of rising stockpiles, said Dinesh Shahra, managing director of
 Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. (RSI) , the country’s biggest importer of
cooking oils. Futures may slump to 2,575 ringgit in the fourth
quarter if  Brent crude  falls to $95 a barrel, according to James
Fry, chairman of LMC International Ltd.  “There is a large potential for prices to go down
substantially,” Shahra said on Sept. 22. “There is a slowdown
in China, and  Europe  has slowed purchases for biodiesel. The
discount between  soybean oil  and palm oil will further widen.”  The gap between the two oils  widened  to $329.61 a ton
today, the most since 2008, data tracked by Bloomberg showed.
The record is $493.76 in August 2008. Soybean oil and palm oil
are used in foods and fuels.  Indian Imports  Global vegetable-oil supplies will increase by 3.05 million
tons in 2012-2013, while demand may expand by 3.5 million tons,
Mistry said. Soybeans may reach a record $20 a bushel in
December or January and drop with the swelling of harvests in
Brazil and Argentina, he said.  Sunflower oil prices will remain in line with soybean oil
and compete for market share in importing countries such as
 Iran ,  Egypt , parts of the  Middle East  and India, Mistry said.  Cooking oil imports by India, the largest palm oil buyer,
may climb to a record 10 million tons in the oil year ending
Oct. 31 on lower domestic oilseed output, Mistry said.
Stockpiles in India at the end of October will be higher than in
previous years, he said.  Vegetable-oil imports  climbed 19 percent to 8.16 million
tons between November and August, according to the Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India. Stockpiles, including those at
ports and in the pipeline, totaled 1.55 million tons as of Sept.
1, it said on Sept. 14.  The 33 percent jump in soybean futures this year is set to
reduce demand. Global consumption will drop about 3 million tons
in 2012-2013 because of record prices, according to Thomas
Mielke, executive director of Oil World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
