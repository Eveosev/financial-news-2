A.J. McCarron threw for three
touchdowns to lead top-ranked  University of Alabama  to a 40-7
rout of Florida Atlantic University in college football.  No. 2  Louisiana State University  rallied from a one-point
halftime deficit on Drew Alleman’s 30-yard field goal yesterday
to defeat Auburn 12-10.  In other games among the Associated Press Writers’ Poll’s
Top 10 schools, it was No. 3 Oregon 49, No. 22  Arizona  0; No. 4
Florida State 49, No. 10 Clemson 37; No. 5 Georgia 48,
Vanderbilt 3; No. 15 Kansas State 24, No. 6 Oklahoma 19; No. 7
South Carolina 31, Missouri 10; and No. 8 West Virginia 31,
Maryland 21.  At Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, McCarron
completed 15 of 25 passing attempts for 212 yards and three
touchdowns, including an 85-yard pass to Kenny Bell. Cade Foster
and Jeremy Shelley each added two field goals for the Crimson
Tide (4-0).  McCarron hit Bell on  Alabama ’s third play.  “It was a great touchdown,” Bell said. “I felt like it
was time for me to make a big play to get the offense going.
When AJ saw me, he threw it to me, threw a pass to me then I
just had to use my legs to get to the touchdown.’  Graham Wilbert connected on seven passes for 34 yards and
one touchdown for the Owls (1-3).  ‘Great Defense’  “That’s a great defense that we faced,” Florida Atlantic
coach Carl Pelini told reporters. “I mean, I don’t know if it
was a slow start or if it was a fast start for them defensively.
They’re a very good defensive football team and they were just
physically handling us upfront early in the game.’  At Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Alabama, Sam Montgomery
tackled Tre Mason in the end zone, Michael Ford ran one yard for
a touchdown and Alleman added his field goal for LSU (4-0),
which trailed 10-9 at halftime.  Montgomery said the Auburn threat was “a shock to our
system. It was really a shock to our whole program, but we
adjusted. We stuck our backs up.”  Onterio McCalebb scored on a four-yard run and Cody Parkey
kicked a 40-yard field goal for Auburn (1-3).  “It’s something we’ll certainly be able to teach from in a
very aggressive manner,” LSU head coach Les Miles said.
“There’s work to do, but we’ll take a victory on the road at
Auburn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
