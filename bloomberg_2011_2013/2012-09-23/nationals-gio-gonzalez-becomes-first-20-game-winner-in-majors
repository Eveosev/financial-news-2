Washington Nationals lefthander Gio Gonzalez became the first 20-game winner in  Major League
Baseball  after a 10-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.  Gonzalez, 27, went seven innings in the Nationals’ win over
the Brewers yesterday, allowing two runs on three hits and
striking out five at Nationals Park.  “In a way, you kind of smile about it, because we finally
reached our goal,” said Gonzalez, who had targeted 20 wins this
season with his personal trainer. “Now it’s time to change it
up and continue to try and get better goals and higher goals.”  Gonzalez, who holds a 20-8 record, also is the sixth
pitcher in history to win 20 games in his first season in the
National League after pitching in the  American League , according
to Elias Sports Bureau. He joins  Roy Halladay  of the
Philadelphia Phillies (2010), Danny Jackson of the Cincinnati
Reds (1988), Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1971) and
Carl Mays (1924) and George Suggs (1910) of the Reds.  The Nationals sent four prospects to the  Oakland Athletics 
in exchange for Gonzalez, who signed a $42 million, five-year
deal in the offseason.  Ryan Zimmerman  and Ian Desmond each hit a three-run homer
in the fourth inning as the Nationals, whose 92-59 record is the
best in the majors, broke the Brewers’ six-game winning streak.  The team already has secured a postseason spot.  Milwaukee starter Wily Peralta (2-1) gave up three runs and
five hits, along with four walks and a wild pitch in 2 2/3
innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
