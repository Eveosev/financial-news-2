Dubai’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in almost two weeks before companies in the emirate
report third-quarter financial results and after oil dropped.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
construction company, fell to the lowest level since March 8.
 Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, decreased 1.1 percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
dropped 0.8 percent, the most since Sept. 10, to 1,592.78 at the
close. The measure has soared 9.7 percent this quarter. Qatar’s
 QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.4 percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) 
of the region’s top 200 equities lost 0.1 percent.  “We’re getting closer to third-quarter results, so traders
are waiting for signals, especially because the markets have
already rallied,” said Nabil Rantisi, managing director of
brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based Menacorp.  Gulf Cooperation Council countries are scheduled to
announce quarterly results next month. Arabtec, which has the
fourth-heaviest weighting on Dubai’s gauge, may post third-
quarter profit of 15 million dirhams ($4.1 million), according
to an estimate by Securities & Investment Co. and 7 million
dirhams, according to  National Bank of Kuwait . That’s down from
39.1 million dirhams in the year-earlier period. Emaar may
report a 14 percent drop in net income, a  National Bank of
Kuwait (NBK)  estimate on Bloomberg shows.  Oil’s Slump  Crude oil  tumbled 6.2 percent last week, the most since the
week ended June. 1, to $92.89 a barrel in New York. Oil may
decline this week after data from Asia, Europe and  North America 
increased investors’ concern that global economic growth is
slowing, a Bloomberg survey showed. A Chinese manufacturing
survey last week signaled the industry contracted for an 11th
consecutive month, while Japan’s exports declined in August. The
U.A.E.,  Saudi Arabia (SABIC)  and four other members in the GCC supply
about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Arabtec dropped 4 percent to 2.63 dirhams, trimming this
year’s rally to 74 percent. Emaar, up 26 percent in the third
quarter, fell to 3.54 dirhams.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  declined 0.2 percent and
Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  fell 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s  BB All Share
Index (BHSEASI)  gained 0.3 percent and  Kuwait’s Stock Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX) 
rose 0.2 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  climbed 0.9 percent. The yield on the
benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.29
percent.  In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30 (EGX30)  closed 0.2 percent lower at
5,815.40. An Egyptian administrative court affirmed a June
ruling by the country’s highest court that led to the
dissolution of parliament’s lower house, the state-run Middle
East  News Agency  reported.  Saudi Arabia’s stock market is closed for a national
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
