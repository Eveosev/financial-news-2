Richard Ryan, chief executive
officer of Armajaro Trading Group Ltd., left the company,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  The three people declined to be identified because the
departure from the London-based company hasn’t been made public.
Ryan became CEO in 2007 when he took over for  Anthony Ward , co-
founder of the trading company’s parent, Armajaro Holdings Ltd.
The trading division supplies cocoa, sugar and coffee.  Simone Selzer, a spokeswoman for Armajaro from the public
relations company Brunswick Group, declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg. A call to Ryan’s desk was not answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
