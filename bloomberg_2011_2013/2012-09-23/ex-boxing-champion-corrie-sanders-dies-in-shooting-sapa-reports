Former world heavyweight boxing
champion Corrie Sanders died after being shot during a robbery
at a restaurant, the South African Press Association reported,
citing police.  The 46-year-old South African, who was celebrating a family
birthday last night, was wounded in the hand and stomach after
three armed men arrived in the restaurant near  Pretoria  and shot
randomly, SAPA said. He died in the hospital today.  Sanders won the World Boxing Organization title in March
2003 with a win over  Ukraine â€™s Wladimir Klitsckho. He retired in
2008, with 42 wins from 46 fights.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
