Hungary’s  economic-sentiment  index
fell to an eight-month low in September as a drop in business
confidence outweighed an improvement in consumers’ outlook.  The sentiment index fell to minus 25 from minus 24.7 in
August, the lowest since January, the GKI research institute in
Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. The  business-confidence 
index dropped to minus 16.4 from minus 14.9 while the  consumer
confidence  gauge rose to minus 49.5 from minus 52.7.  “Expectations worsened by a smaller-to-larger extent in
all business sectors with the exception of commerce,” GKI said.  Hungary’s  economy  entered its second recession in four
years in the second quarter as gross domestic product shrank 1.3
percent from a year earlier. The country requested  International
Monetary Fund  aid in November as its  credit rating  was cut to
junk.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
