Belgium’s Philippe Gilbert won the
men’s cycling world road race title today after an attack on the
final climb.  The 30-year-old finished ahead of Norway’s Edvald Boasson
Hagen and Alejandro Valverde of  Spain  after his Belgian
teammates helped chase down an earlier breakaway group.  Britain’s  Mark Cavendish , winner of the title last year,
failed to finish. He’d said the 267-kilometer (166-mile) course
in Limburg, the Netherlands, was unlikely to suit him.  Gilbert is the first Belgian winner of the event since Tom
Boonen in 2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
