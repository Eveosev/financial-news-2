After surgery, radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, 80 visits to oncologists and more than 300 hours
in clinics, Stephanie Butland decided she had had enough cancer
treatment for one lifetime.  The British author quit  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s cancer drug
Herceptin after half the time it’s normally prescribed.  “I was ready to say, I’m done with cancer now and am back
to my life,” Butland said. “I think it’s not uncommon for
people to feel that Herceptin is kind of like the straw that
breaks the donkey’s back.”  In cutting her treatment short, Butland took a bet that her
cancer wouldn’t return. Many more women may be encouraged to do
the same after next week’s meeting of the  European Society for
Medical Oncology , where a French medical team will present the
results of a study of whether Herceptin is just as effective at
postponing the recurrence of cancer and helping women live
longer after six months as it is after one year of treatment,
the current standard of care.  Roche will also attend the Vienna event armed with its own
test results that may argue for women not cutting their
treatment short. The results could, in fact, support a case for
doubling treatment to as long as two years.  Billions of dollars are at stake. If the French trial shows
six months of treatment are better than a year, it will provide
cash-strapped governments with ammunition to trim health-care
spending, while causing a hit to Roche’s bottom line. If the
Roche tests make a strong case for doubling treatment times, the
outcome could be the reverse.  Doubling Treatment  Were doctors around the world to start prescribing
Herceptin to post-surgery breast cancer patients for six months
instead of a year, it could cost Roche as much as 12 percent of
its earnings per share,  Tim Anderson , a New York-based analyst
for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note to investors on
Sept. 21. If half the doctors in the European Union adopted the
shorter treatment period, earnings could drop 2 percent,
Anderson said.  “There’s a downside” here for Roche, Pascal Soriot, the
company’s former pharma head now set to become chief executive
officer of  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , acknowledged to analysts in July.  Yet should the findings go the other way and suggest
treatment times be extended, Roche stands to profit handsomely.
The Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker made 5.29 billion Swiss
francs ($5.7 billion) in sales last year from Herceptin.  Sales among breast cancer patients who underwent surgery
may increase 25 percent -- worth about another $1 billion a year
-- if Roche can show two years of Herceptin beat one, analysts
from Jefferies Group Inc. estimated in a Sept. 12 report.  Downside for Herceptin  What would be good for Roche’s bottom line would be bad
news for governments working to save money as they face
financial turmoil. In  England , where Butland was treated,
Herceptin  costs  about 24,600 pounds ($39,975) to 28,000 pounds
per patient per year. The country’s cost-conscious  National
Health Service  agreed in 2006 to pay for a year’s treatment to
help prevent  breast cancer  from returning after women have
surgery.  The debate isn’t about whether Herceptin works. Rather, the
trials should help determine whether doctors can achieve the
same results with fewer side effects by treating women for a
shorter period of time, said Helena Earl, an oncologist at
Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.  ‘Shivering and Exhausted’  Earl is one of the leaders of Persephone, a U.K. trial also
comparing six months of Herceptin to one year. The drug often
leaves women with flu-like symptoms and is administered through
an IV in a hospital or clinic, requiring patients to go back to
the doctor for several hours every few weeks.  “I had quite bad flu-like symptoms, shivering, feeling
achy,” Butland recalled. “The inside of my nose was always
bleeding, and I felt exhausted. I’d get myself picked up, but
I’d never feel 100 percent. It got worse with each round of
Herceptin.”  Butland writes about her “dance with breast cancer” on a
blog called  Bah!tocancer . She was first diagnosed in November
2008, stopped Herceptin in 2010 after consulting with her
oncologist about the body of evidence hinting that six months’
treatment might be enough, and now describes herself as
thriving.  Earl, the University of Cambridge oncologist, recalls the
day she squeezed into a lecture hall at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting in 2005 to hear the trial results that
made Herceptin a standard treatment. Even then, she remembers
one of the speakers raising the important question of how long
women should take the medicine.  Pragmatic Decision  There’s no obvious scientific rationale for Roche having
tested the drug for a year in the first place, she says.  “It was a pragmatic decision,” Stefan Frings, Roche’s
head of medical affairs for oncology, said in a telephone
interview. The company knew the majority of cancer relapses
would occur within the first two years. Testing Herceptin for a
year allowed the treatment to cover “a substantial portion of
that period,” he said.  Taking the medicine for less time might reduce the risk of
heart damage, a potential side effect, according to Earl.  Roche’s two-year trial, dubbed Hera after the wife of Greek
god Zeus, is the continuation of one of the studies that
established the drug as crucial for patients with a  gene
mutation  that results in extra proteins known as HER2 being
pumped out of their cancer cells -- making their tumors
susceptible to Herceptin. About one in five breast cancer
patients fall into this category.  Not Black, Not White  The other trial due to be presented next week, the French
study called  PHARE , also has its roots in the 2005 studies that
established Herceptin as the gold standard of breast-cancer
treatment. After French authorities saw those results, they
decided to pay for a year’s treatment for breast cancer patients
after surgery, said Xavier Pivot, an oncologist at the
University Hospital of Besancon and principal investigator of
the trial. At the same time, they decided to fund their own
trial to see whether the medicine could be given for less time
with the same benefit, Pivot said.  Spurring the French researchers forward was a smaller study
in  Finland  that showed nine weeks of Herceptin -- given with
chemotherapy -- resulted in no heart failure side effects, Pivot
said. The short course of Herceptin staved off cancer recurrence
and death in the trial, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine in 2006.  Data from Hera and PHARE will be presented back-to-back at
the ESMO conference in Vienna on Oct. 1.  The results probably won’t give “a black and white
answer,” Pivot said, adding that the researchers will probably
need to look at subsets of patients to see who benefits from six
months of treatment and who should get a full year. “More work
will probably be needed.”  ‘To Be Well’  Countries with tighter budgets may opt to interpret the
results differently than richer ones, according to Pivot. Six
months of Herceptin might be better than nothing in places where
a year’s treatment is considered prohibitive, he said.  There may be similar shades of gray among patients, with
some keen to stay on the drug as long as possible to ensure
cancer stays away and others, like Butland, wanting their life
back.  “The decision is not simply to stop Herceptin,” Butland
wrote in a blog posting that spelled out her rationale. “The
decision is to be well. The decision is to get on with living in
a world that doesn’t have cancer at the heart of it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
