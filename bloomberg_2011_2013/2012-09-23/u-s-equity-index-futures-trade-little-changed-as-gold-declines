U.S. equity-index futures were
little changed after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index finished
last week near the highest level since 2007. Gold fell.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,453.1 as of 7:19 a.m. in Tokyo. Gold retreated 0.2 percent to
$1,774 an ounce. The euro was at $1.2975.  U.S. stocks declined last week as concern about slowing
global growth overshadowed optimism about central bank stimulus.
Financial and commodity shares dropped the most for the week
among 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 as Bank of America Corp.
and Alcoa Inc. declined more than 4.6 percent. The S&P 500
slipped 0.4 percent to 1,460.15, snapping a two-week  rally .  Chancellor Angela Merkel  and President  Francois Hollande 
underlined Franco-German disagreement over the weekend as they
clashed on a timetable to introduce joint oversight of the
region’s banking sector, with Merkel rebuffing Hollande’s appeal
to activate it “the earlier, the better.”  Consumer spending  in the U.S. probably stagnated in August
after adjusting for inflation, showing the expansion is
struggling to gain momentum, economists said before a report
this week. Household purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy, rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.4
percent increase in July, according to the estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of Sept. 28 figures from
the Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
