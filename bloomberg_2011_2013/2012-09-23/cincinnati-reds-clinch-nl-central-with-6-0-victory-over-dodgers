The  Cincinnati Reds  clinched the
National League Central division title with a 6-0 shutout of the
 Los Angeles Dodgers .  The division title is the fifth for manager  Dusty Baker ,
63, who missed yesterday’s celebration as he spent the day in a
Chicago hospital. He was admitted Sept. 19 with an irregular
heartbeat.  “It’s a shame he’s not here,” third baseman Scott Rolen
said as he and his teammates toasted their division title. “He
digs this stuff. He’s missed, there’s no doubt about that.”  The Reds (92-60) are a half-game behind the Washington
Nationals (92-59) for the best record in Major League Baseball.  At Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Jay Bruce gave
the Reds a 1-0 lead with a home run in the fourth inning.
 Brandon Phillips  scored on a single in the fifth inning, added a
solo homer in the seventh, and the Reds tacked on three more
runs in the eighth.  Mat Latos (13-4) pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing
six hits and striking out seven.  Stephen Fife (0-2) gave up two runs on five hits and struck
out four in five innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
