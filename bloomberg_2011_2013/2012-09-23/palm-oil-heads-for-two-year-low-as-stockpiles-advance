Palm oil, the world’s most-used
cooking oil, is poised to tumble to a two-year low as
inventories surge in Indonesia and  Malaysia , the biggest
producers, and a global economic slowdown curbs demand.  Futures in Malaysia, the global benchmark, may slump to
between 2,600 ringgit ($852) and 2,700 ringgit a metric ton by
December,  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd.
said in Mumbai today, lowering his forecast from the 2,900
ringgit to 3,300 ringgit made on Sept. 6. The commodity last
traded below 2,600 ringgit in September 2010. With the recent
sell-off, the probability of prices falling to 2,300 ringgit has
risen to 50 percent from 20 percent in June, he said.  Palm oil, used in everything from candy to biofuels, has
fallen 8.5 percent this month as demand slowed from importers
including  China  and the European Union, and stockpiles surged
because of a seasonal increase in production. Falling prices may
reduce revenues for producers including  Sime Darby Bhd (SIME)  and IOI
Corp. and help cap increases in global food costs.  “Demand for  palm oil  in particular, and for vegetable oils
in general has been softer than expected in 2012,” said Mistry,
who has traded palm oil for more than three decades. Demand was
hurt by slower growth in the production of biofuels from
vegetable oils and a slowdown in economic growth in the
 developing countries  amid high prices, he said.  Futures have fallen 20 percent since the end of March and
are heading for a second straight quarterly decline on concern
that a pick-up in production will drive stockpiles in Malaysia
and Indonesia to records. The December-delivery contract fell 2
percent to 2,763 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange on Sept. 21, the lowest price at close for the most-
active contract since October 2010.  Record Reserves  Stockpiles in Malaysia will continue to expand in October,
November and December and may reach as high as 3 million tons by
January, Mistry said. Inventories in  Indonesia  have hovered
between 3.5 million tons and 4 million tons since 2010 as
against popular estimates of 1.5 million tons to 2 million tons,
he said. Production in Indonesia may climb to 27.5 million tons
in 2012, higher than the 27 million tons estimated on Sept. 6,
while Malaysia’s output may be 18 million tons this year, less
than the 18.2 million tons forecast previously, he said.  “The supply position on palm oil is therefore extremely
comfortable and is likely to remain that way for the next
several months,” Mistry said.  Faltering Biofuel  Prices may drop to 2,500 ringgit a ton by December because
of rising stockpiles, said Dinesh Shahra, managing director of
 Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. (RSI) , the country’s biggest importer of
cooking oils.  “There is a large potential for prices to go down
substantially,” Shahra said. “There is a slowdown in China,
and  Europe  has slowed purchases for biodiesel. The discount
between  soybean oil  and palm oil will further widen.”  The gap between the two oils, which jumped to a four-year
high this month,  widened  to $304.67 a ton on Sept. 21, data
tracked by Bloomberg showed. The record is $493.76 in August
2008. Soybean oil and palm oil are used in foods and fuels.  Global vegetable-oil supplies will increase by 3.05 million
tons in 2012-2013, while demand may expand by 3.5 million tons,
Mistry said. Soybeans may reach a record $20 a bushel in
December or January and drop with the swelling of harvests in
Brazil and Argentina, he said.  Sunflower oil prices will remain in line with soybean oil
and compete for market share in importing countries such as
 Iran ,  Egypt , parts of the  Middle East  and  India , Mistry said.  Cooking oil  imports  by India, the largest palm oil buyer,
may climb to a record 10 million tons in the oil year ending
Oct. 31 on lower domestic oilseed output, Mistry said.
Stockpiles in India at the end of October will be higher than in
previous years, he said.  Vegetable-oil imports climbed 19 percent to 8.16 million
tons between November and August, according to the Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India. Stockpiles, including those at
ports and in the pipeline, totaled 1.55 million tons as of Sept.
1, it said on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
