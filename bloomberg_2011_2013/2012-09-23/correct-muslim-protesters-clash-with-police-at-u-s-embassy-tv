(Corrects spelling of location name in second paragraph)  Several hundred Muslim protesters
clashed with  Hong Kong  police outside the U.S. Embassy in the
city as they were blocked from submitting a letter to diplomatic
mission, Hong Kong Cable TV reported today.  About 1,000 protesters gathered in Chater Garden in
Central, Hong Kongâ€™s main financial hub, to protest an anti-
Islam movie produced in the U.S., according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
