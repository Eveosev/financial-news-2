Top seed  Caroline Wozniacki  routed
Kaia Kanepi 6-1, 6-0 in today’s final of the Korea Open to win
her first WTA tennis title since August 2011. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
secured his second ATP World Tour title of the year.  Wozniacki, a 22-year-old Dane who started the year as world
No. 1 but is now ranked 11th, beat the third-seeded Kanepi from
Estonia in 62 minutes.  “I want to build up for the next season and hopefully my
results this week will help me move forward and get back to
playing my best,” Wozniacki said in comments on the  WTA Tour’s
website.   Wozniacki now has 19 WTA titles. Her last victory was in
 New Haven .  Yesterday, Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-Wei beat Britain’s Laura
Robson 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 in the Guangzhou Open final.  Tsonga beat Italy’s Andreas Seppi 6-1, 6-2 today to
successfully defend his Moselle Open title in Metz, France. The
Frenchman has all eight of his ATP titles on hard courts.  At the St. Petersburg Open, Slovakia’s Martin Klizan
defeated Fabio Fognini of Italy 6-2, 6-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
