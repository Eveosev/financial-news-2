The  Baltimore Ravens  defeated the
New England Patriots 31-30 in a rematch of last season’s
American Football Conference championship game as Justin Tucker
kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired.  The  New York  Jets beat the Miami Dolphins 23-20 in one of
yesterday’s three National Football League games to go to
overtime, while the  Arizona  Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia
Eagles 27-6 for their first 3-0 start since 1974.  The Ravens missed a chance to reach the Super Bowl in
January when they lost to the Patriots 23-20, a game in which
kicker  Billy Cundiff  missed a 32-yard field goal with 11 seconds
left. Baltimore avenged that loss last night as Torrey Smith
caught two touchdown passes, one day after his 19-year-old
brother, Tevin, was killed in a motorcycle crash.  “I didn’t know whether or not I was going to play,” Smith
said in a televised interview. “But we were able to come out,
get a win and play well. That’s my little brother and I love him
to death, so we just thank you for all the support from everyone
around the league and all the fans in general. My family really
appreciates it.”  Joe Flacco  passed for 382 yards and three touchdowns for
the Ravens (2-1), who rallied from a 30-21 fourth-quarter
deficit. Smith caught a 5-yard touchdown pass with 4:01 left and
Flacco drove the Ravens 70 yards to set up Tucker’s winning
kick, which curled to the right and appeared to go directly over
the upright. Patriots coach  Bill Belichick , whose team had 10
penalties for 83 yards, shouted at one of replacement officials
and grabbed his arm as they ran off the field. He may face a
fine from the NFL for making contact with an official.  No Comment  “I’m not going to comment on that,” Belichick said after
the Patriots fell to 1-2. “You saw the game, what did we have,
like 30 penalties called in the game?”  The Jets earlier won on a 33-yard field goal by  Nick Folk ,
who got a second chance because the Dolphins had called timeout
just before blocking his first attempt.  Mark Sanchez  passed for
306 yards in Miami and his 38-yard completion to Santonio Holmes
set up Folk’s winning kick, which came after Dan Carpenter had
missed a 48-yard attempt for the Dolphins.  “We certainly got some breaks,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said.
“No question about it.”  The Cardinals raced to a 24-0 first-half lead against the
Eagles in a matchup of unbeaten teams, as  Kevin Kolb  threw two
touchdown passes and the Arizona defense forced three fumbles.
Philadelphia quarterback  Michael Vick  fumbled twice, including
one that was returned 93 yards for a touchdown.  In another Week 3 matchup of 2-0 teams, the  Atlanta Falcons 
rolled past the San Diego Chargers 27-3 on the road as  Matt Ryan 
threw three first-half touchdown passes.  Unbeaten Texans  The NFL’s only other 3-0 team is the Houston Texans, who
got four touchdown passes from Matt Schaub in yesterday’s 31-25
win over the Broncos and  Peyton Manning  in Denver.  The Jets were joined as overtime winners by the Tennessee
Titans and  Kansas City Chiefs . It marked the first time since
Nov. 7, 2010, the NFL had three overtime games on the same day.  The Titans beat the Detroit Lions 44-41 on a 26-yard field
goal by Rob Bironas after allowing two touchdowns in the final
18 seconds of the fourth quarter.  Calvin Johnson  caught a 3-yard
score to pull Detroit within 41-34 and, after the Lions
recovered an onsides kick, Titus Young caught a 46-yard pass
from Shaun Hill as time expired to tie the game at 41-41.  After Bironas’s field goal, the Titans held on for the win
by stopping Hill -- who came into the game after a hamstring
injury to starting quarterback  Matthew Stafford  -- on a 4th-
and-1 sneak from the Tennessee 7-yard line. Lions coach Jim Schwartz said Detroit planned to try to draw an offsides call
and the ball was snapped before he could call a timeout for an
attempt at a tying field goal.  ‘Miscommunication’  “That was a miscommunication,” Schwartz said in a news
conference. “I’ve been around a lot of crazy games. I don’t
think I’ve ever been around one like that.”  In a meeting of winless teams, the Chiefs beat the New
Orleans Saints 27-24 in overtime after rallying from a 24-6
deficit. Ryan Succop tied the game with a 43-yard field goal
with three seconds left in the fourth quarter and then won it
with a 31-yard kick in overtime. The Saints, with all three of
their losses against 1-2 teams, are 0-3 for the first time since
losing four straight games to start the 2007 season.  “We need to take a hard look in the mirror at what’s
gotten us beat the last three weeks,” Saints quarterback  Drew Brees  said at a news conference.  49ers Fall  The San Francisco 49ers lost for the first time this
season, 24-13 to the Minnesota Vikings, while the Cincinnati
Bengals spoiled rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III’s home
debut with a 38-31 victory over the Washington Redskins.  The Jacksonville Jaguars secured a 22-17 win against the
host Indianapolis Colts as Blaine Gabbert found Cecil Shorts
with an 80-yard touchdown pass with 45 seconds to play. The
winning score came 11 seconds after the Colts had taken a 17-16
lead on a 37-yard field goal by  Adam Vinatieri .  The  Oakland Raiders  got their first win of the season by
beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 34-31 on Sebastian Janikowski’s
43-yard field goal as time expired.  Elsewhere, it was Chicago 23, St. Louis 6; Buffalo 24,
Cleveland 14; and Dallas 16, Tampa Bay 10.  Week 3 play began Sept. 20 with the New York Giants beating
the Carolina Panthers 36-7 for their second win of the season.
The schedule concludes tonight with the Green Bay Packers (1-1)
at the Seattle Seahawks (1-1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
