The commander in chief of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guard Corps. for the first time said  Israel  may
attempt to attack the Persian Gulf country, a move he said would
result in the Jewish country’s destruction.  “The Zionist regime seeks to go to war with us and it’s
unclear when such a war would be,” Major General Mohammad Ali
Jafari said yesterday in Tehran, according to the state-run  Mehr 
news agency. “They don’t realize that if they undertake this
act they will be destroyed.”  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  and Defense Minister  Ehud
Barak  have indicated that, as Iran proceeds with its nuclear
work and negotiations stall, Israel is considering a strike
against the country’s atomic facilities. While Iran says its
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, Israel and the U.S.
say the Islamic Republic is trying to build an atomic weapon.  Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  on Feb. 10 said threats
of a military strike against the country are “empty.” Iran
doesn’t recognize the existence of Israel and Khamenei in a Feb.
3 sermon called the Jewish state a “cancerous tumor.”  “We can’t deny that a war will happen in the future but
one must know that it won’t be a repeat of the eight-year war
with  Iraq ” in the 1980’s, Jafari said. “Iran’s armed forces
and the Guards now have efficient equipment at their disposal
and no country will be able to resist us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
