Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  had a release
of hydraulic oil in the  Gulf of Mexico , according to a filing.  About 20 gallons of hydraulic oil were released in the
water because of an incident at the South Timbalier 300A
platform, according to a  filing  with the National Response
Center dated Sept. 21.  A turbine shut because of a low oil level, which alerted
operators, the filing showed. There was a turbine oil cooler
leak, according to the filing.  “This was an isolated leak and has been stopped,” Kelly
op de Weegh, a Shell spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that
described the release as lube oil. “We are investigating the
cause.”  Companies in the U.S. must notify the response center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
