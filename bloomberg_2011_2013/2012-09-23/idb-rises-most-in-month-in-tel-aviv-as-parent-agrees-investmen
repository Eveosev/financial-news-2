IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) ’s rose the most
in almost a month in Tel Aviv trading after its parent Ganden
Holdings Ltd. won an agreement with an investor for an injection
of as much as $100 million. IDB’s bonds also advanced.  The shares gained as much as 5.8 percent, the most since
Aug. 27. Eduardo Elsztain will buy 10 percent of Ganden for $25
million and get an option to invest an additional $75 million in
the company, IDB said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The yield on IDB’s 5.1 percent notes maturing December 2020
dropped 219 basis points, or 2.19 percentage points, the most
since Sept. 12 to 69.77 percent as of 11:21 a.m. in  Tel Aviv ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The shares advanced
0.7 percent to 13.37 shekels.  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , 74
percent owned by IDB, jumped 4.3 percent to 7.341 shekels.  IDB is seeking funds after second-quarter results included
a so-called going-concern warning. Ganden planned to inject part
of Elsztain’s investment into IDB, the unit said on Sept. 19.  IDB was ordered by a Tel Aviv court on Sept. 5 to place 35
million shekels ($9 million) owed to Series Bet bondholders in
trust. It was given 21 days to agree payments with holders.  The benchmark TA-25 share index rose 0.8 percent.  Cellcom
Israel Ltd. (CEL) , 47 percent  owned  by Discount, climbed 4.7 percent
to 34.04 shekels, the highest since May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
