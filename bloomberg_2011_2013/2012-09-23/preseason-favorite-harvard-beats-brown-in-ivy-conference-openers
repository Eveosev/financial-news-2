Treavor Scales scored four
touchdowns as  Harvard University  defeated Brown University 45-31
in their Ivy Conference college football season openers.  Scales carried 18 times for 136 yards for the Crimson
yesterday at Brown Stadium in Providence, Rhode Island.  Harvard is the preseason favorite to win the Ivy League
football title, receiving 13 of 17 first-place votes from a
panel of media representatives.  The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Crimson, who went
undefeated in league play last season to win their 14th Ivy
League championship, were ranked ahead of the  University of
Pennsylvania  in Philadelphia;  Cornell University  in Ithaca,  New
York ; and Brown.  Harvard had a 17-10 lead at the half after Scales scored on
a one-yard run, David Mothander kicked a 22-yard field goal and
Seitu Smith II took a 30-yard scoring pass from Colton Chapple,
who threw for one touchdown and ran six yards for a second.  Brown quarterback Patrick Donnelly completed 27 of 40
passing attempts for 336 yards and three touchdowns.  In other Ivy League contests, it was Fordham 20, Columbia
13; Dartmouth 13, Holy Cross 10; Cornell 45, Yale 6; and
Villanova 24, Pennsylvania 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
