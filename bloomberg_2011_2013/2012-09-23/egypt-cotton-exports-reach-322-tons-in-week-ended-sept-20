Egypt  agreed to export 322 metric
tons of cotton in the week through Sept. 20, according to the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association.  The country has shipped 2,739 tons of the fiber, valued at
$8 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in a
weekly bulletin. In the week through Sept. 20, 22 tons were of
the Giza 88 variety and 300 tons were Giza 86, the association
said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
