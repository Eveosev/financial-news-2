Pakistan’s  Awami National Party , a
central government coalition partner, distanced itself from a
minister who promised a bounty to kill the maker of an anti-
Islam film that has sparked protests in the Muslim world.  The threat isn’t in keeping with the party’s policy of non-
violence, Zahid Khan, a party spokesman, said in a phone
interview from Peshawar today. Federal Railway Minister Ghulam
Ahmed Bilour yesterday told reporters that he would pay $100,000
to have the movie producer killed, according to local media
outlets, including the Dawn newspaper.  The film, called “Innocence of Muslims,” has been
responsible for deadly attacks on U.S. and European targets from
the Middle East to Southeast Asia. Pakistanis protesting the
movie clashed with police in several cities where mobs set fire
to movie theaters, banks, fast-food outlets and vehicles. Bilour
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  “It is the minister’s personal opinion,” Khan said.
“This is not Pakistan’s policy.”  Pakistani television channels have aired an advertisement
by the State Department with President  Barack Obama  and
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  disavowing the film.  Anti-American sentiment has been running high in Pakistan
after years of U.S. drone missile attacks, the raid that killed
 Osama bin Laden  in a Pakistani town last year and other
confrontations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
