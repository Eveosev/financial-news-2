The  San Francisco Giants  clinched
the National League West title with an 8-4 victory over the  San
Diego Padres .  Marco Scutaro  had three hits and drove in three runs, while
Brandon Belt scored three runs, including his eighth-inning
homer, before the home crowd at AT&T Park. Scutaro’s two-run
single in the fourth provided the margin, giving the Giants (89-
63) a 5-1 lead.  “I’ll take this one,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.
“I like a margin of error.”  Madison Bumgarner (16-10) allowed three runs on five hits
and struck out six for the Giants, who ended a 56-year World
Series drought in 2010.  “It never gets old,” Brian Sabean, the team’s general
manager, told reporters as a champagne celebration commenced in
the clubhouse.  Chris Denorfia scored two runs for the Padres on Chase Headley’s ground outs in the first and eighth innings. Yonder
Alonso hit a two-run homer in the sixth.  Andrew Werner (2-2) surrendered five runs on six hits,
while striking out three in 3 2/3 inning.  The Padres (72-80) are in fourth place in the five-team NL
West, 17 games behind the Giants.  The Giants have been playing out the season without
outfielder Melky Cabrera, who was leading the NL in batting
before his 50-game suspension on Aug. 15 for testing positive
for testosterone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
