The daughter of former Iranian
president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was taken into custody
late yesterday to serve a six-month sentence on charges of
“propaganda against the regime,” the state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported.  Faezeh Hashemi’s trial started in December, her lawyer
Gholam-Ali Riyahi said at the time.  Hashemi was arrested twice for joining anti-government
rallies following the unrest triggered by president Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
