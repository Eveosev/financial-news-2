Iraq  placed Jeongshin Engineering &
Construction Co. and Archirodon Construction Co. on a shortlist
of two to build a breakwater for the $6 billion first phase of
its Grand Fao port development.  Archirodon submitted the lowest bid of 204 billion dinars
($175 million) and had the highest technical evaluation among 16
initial bidders, Omran Radhi, director general of the State Co.
for Iraqâ€™s Ports, said today in an interview from the southern
port city of Basra. Jeongshin offered 206 billion dinars.  The winner of the project to build the breakwater in the
south in 18 months will be selected within two weeks, he said.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., Daewoo Engineering
& Construction Co., Dredging International, China Communications
Construction Co. and Al Habtoor Leighton Group were among the 16
bidders for the 480 billion-dinar breakwater.  Iraq has the fifth-largest crude deposits, according to BP
Plc data. The government is trying to attract foreign investment
and expertise to help rebuild infrastructure and boost energy
exports to revive an economy shattered by years of conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
