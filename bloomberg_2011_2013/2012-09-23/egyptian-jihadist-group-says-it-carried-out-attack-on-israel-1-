A jihadist group based in  Egypt 
claimed responsibility for a cross-border attack that killed an
Israeli soldier in Sinai, in what the group says was a response
to an anti-Islam film that sparked protests in the  Middle East .  Another Israeli soldier was injured and three militants
killed in the Sept. 21 clash. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis posted a
statement on a website often used by militant groups, claiming
it carried out the attack.  Egypt launched a sweeping operation in the  Sinai Peninsula 
to root out extremists after a raid in August that left 16
Egyptian border guards dead.  Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said today that
Egypt has sufficient forces in the Sinai to deal with security
problems and his country would not accept changes to the peace
treaty to increase the number of troops there.  “There is no chance that  Israel  will agree to any change
in the Camp David agreement, not regarding the military appendix
or the accord itself,” Liberman said in an interview with
Israel Radio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
