Acromas Holdings Ltd. said it has
no plans to sell its AA roadside recovery and Saga insurance
businesses after the Sunday Telegraph reported it appointed
Ernst & Young to explore a potential sale.  “We have no current plans to sell the businesses,” Paul
Green, a spokesman for Acromas, said today by phone. “We’re
very much focused on driving both Saga and the AA. We’re
constantly reviewing the options we have.”  The Telegraph reported today that Ernst & Young would
assess the value of the Saga unit, without saying where it got
the information. The AA business may be valued at as much as 5
billion pounds ($8.1 billion) and Saga, valued at 3 billion to 4
billion pounds, could be sold or listed on the U.K. stock
market, the newspaper said.  When asked about whether Acromas had appointed Ernst &
Young, Green said the company doesn’t comment on its contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
