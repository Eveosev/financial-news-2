Arik Airlines Ltd. ,  Nigeria ’s
largest operator, resumed domestic flights today after resolving
a dispute with an airport union that had blocked passengers from
the company’s planes for three days by locking boarding gates.  Customers are again able to book tickets for Nigerian
flights, the company said in a statement on its  website .  Planes were stopped from flying from Lagos, the commercial
capital, on Sept. 20 after the  Federal Airports Authority of
Nigeria  union locked the gates. Director-General George Uriesi
of the airport authority said Lagos-based Arik must pay the 18
billion naira ($114 million) owed for use of airport facilities.  The airline, operating  23 aircraft  and flying at least
three times weekly to  London  and  New York , said yesterday its
international operations weren’t affected by the suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
