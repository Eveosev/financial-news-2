French Finance Minister  Pierre
Moscovici  said he’ll present a budget for 2013 that will aim for
a public deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product, down
from a target of 4.5 percent for 2012.  “The budget is difficult to build,” the minister said
today on  France  3 television. “I don’t want France to get into
Spain’s situation, in which we would pay very interest rates to
pay our debt, which would stiffle growth.”  Tax increases will mostly affect rich households and large
companies, and will protect small and medium-sized companies,
Moscovici said. He ruled out an increase in the so-called CSG
and VAT taxes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
