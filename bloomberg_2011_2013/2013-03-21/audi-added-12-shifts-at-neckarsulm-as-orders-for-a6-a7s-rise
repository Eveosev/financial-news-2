Audi AG, the premium brand and
largest earnings contributor of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , added 12 extra
shifts in the first quarter at its plant in Neckarsulm, Germany,
and is planning more in April due to strong demand for the A6
and A7 models.  Audi has produced around 2,600 cars more in Neckarsulm than
initially planned in quarter, personnel director Thomas Sigi
said during a staff meeting today, according to an e-mailed
statement. Neckarsulm is Audi’s second-largest plant after its
main factory in Ingolstadt.  Economic conditions remained “difficult” though in the
first three months of the year, Audi said in the statement.  Robust order intake for the Ingolstadt, Germany-based
automaker underscores the resilience of the luxury-car segment,
compared with the shrinking total market in  Europe .  Audi is targeting an increase in revenue and deliveries
this year on demand for its expanding SUV lineup and the new-
generation A3 model, the company said March 12. The world’s
second-biggest maker of luxury vehicles wants to nab the top
spot from  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  by the end of the decade.  Audi will invest 11 billion euros ($14.2 billion) by 2015
to increase production and widen its model lineup in pursuit of
BMW and is expanding a plant in  Hungary  and opening a new
factory later in 2013 in Foshan,  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
