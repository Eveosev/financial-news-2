Suntech Power  Japan  Corp., a unit
of  Suntech Power Holdings (STP)  Co., said its supply of solar panels
in Japan won’t be affected by the bankruptcy filing against one
of the company’s main plants in  China .  The Japanese unit is supplied by a factory that isn’t
covered in the bankruptcy petition filed by eight Chinese banks,
according to the e-mailed statement. Suntech Power Holdings said
it won’t object to the filing in Wuxi Municipal Intermediate
People’s Court. Suntech defaulted last week on $541 million of
bonds.  “Operations will go on as usual at Suntech Power Holdings,
the parent company, as well as its units including Suntech Power
Japan, despite the bankruptcy filing,” the Japanese unit said
in the statement.  About three-fourths of Suntech’s total cell manufacturing
capacity is in Wuxi, and about 1,200 megawatts of its 1,800
megawatt total can be attributed to the Wuxi Suntech unit,
according to Suntech’s last annual report. The remaining
capacity is in joint ventures. The unit makes both cells and
panels.  Suntech’s corporate parent is incorporated in the  Cayman
Islands , and the unit in insolvency is a Chinese company. It has
additional cell and module production in Wuxi, Shanghai and
Luoyang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
