Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the
most in more than two weeks as the East African nation awaits
the outcome of a challenge to Uhuru Kenyatta’s presidential
election victory.  The currency of the region’s biggest economy retreated as
much as 0.4 percent and traded 0.3 percent lower at 85.77 per
dollar by 1:37 p.m., the most on a closing basis since March 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Outgoing Prime Minister  Raila Odinga , whose dispute of the
2007 election triggered ethnic clashes that left more than 1,100
people dead, filed a Supreme Court petition on March 16,
challenging Kenyatta’s March 4 vote win. Odinga today canceled
plans to hold rallies after Chief Justice Willy Mutunga told the
leaders to keep from making public statements about the case.  “The shilling is on a weakening mode as the markets await
the outcome of the presidential case,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of
trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone today
from Nairobi.  The currency will probably be “range-bound until new
information comes into the market, as most players are on the
sidelines waiting to see how the petition will go,” Nairobi-
based NIC Bank Ltd., said in an e-mailed note today.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya is offering 12 billion shillings
($140 million) in seven-day  repurchase agreements  today, which
it uses to reduce  money supply  and support the shilling,
according to an official who asked not to be identified in line
with policy said by phone.  Uganda’s currency gained 0.4 percent to 2,630 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,621
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
