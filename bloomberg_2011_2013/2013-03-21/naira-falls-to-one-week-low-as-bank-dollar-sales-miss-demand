The naira depreciated for a second
day and headed for lowest in a week as the central bank offered
fewer dollars than buyers expected at an auction yesterday and
as investors’ demand for Nigerian debt waned.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fell as much
as 0.2 percent to 159.05 per dollar, the weakest level on a
closing basis since March 14, and traded at 158.85 per dollar by
1:12 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $280 million at a foreign-
currency auction yesterday, less than the $300 million sold on
March 18, according to data on the institution’s website.  “Dealers demanded more than the central bank offered
yesterday,” Sewa Wusu, an analyst at Lagos-based Sterling
Capital Ltd., said by phone today, declining to give an amount.
“The CBN was expected to supply more to offset a shortfall in
offshore inflows and rising import demand,” he said.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined two basis points to 11.24 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined three basis
points to 4.301 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.4 percent to 1.9415 per dollar in
Accra, the capital, the lowest on a closing basis since Aug. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
