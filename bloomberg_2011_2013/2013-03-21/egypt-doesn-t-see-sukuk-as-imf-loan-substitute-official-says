Egypt  doesn’t see sukuk as a
substitute for a $4.8 billion International Monetary Fund loan
being sought by the government, an adviser to the finance
minister told reporters today.  The sukuk law, which would allow Egypt for the first time
to offer Islamic sovereign debt, has been sent by parliament’s
upper house to President Mohamed Mursi for approval, and will be
implemented in July, the  Finance Ministry ’s Ahmed Al-Nagar said.  Egypt has been searching for additional funds alongside
talks with the IMF on a loan that has been delayed amid
political unrest. The government says an IMF accord will restore
investor confidence and help revive an economy that has stalled
since the 2011 uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  The parliament’s upper house, which is serving as the
legislature after the lower house was disbanded last year under
court order, approved the sukuk law earlier in the week, capping
a months-long process.  The government plans to sell sukuk backed by revenue from
electricity and transportation projects under the law, Al-Nagar
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
