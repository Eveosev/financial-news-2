Suntech Power Holdings Co. Ltd.
said a court in  China  accepted the petition of eight banks to
push the main operating subsidiary of the solar cell
manufacturer into insolvency.  The Wuxi Municipal Intermediate People’s Court in China’s
Jiangsu Province made the ruling today, according to a statement
from Suntech, which is based in Wuxi.  “The insolvency and restructuring procedure is designed to
facilitate an orderly process for both Wuxi Suntech
and its creditors,” Suntech said in the statement. “The
primary goal is to restructure Wuxi Suntech’s debt
obligations, while continuing production and operations.”  Suntech said yesterday that it wouldn’t resist the
petition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
