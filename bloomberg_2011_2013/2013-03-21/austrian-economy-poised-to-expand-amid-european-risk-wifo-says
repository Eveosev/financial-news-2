Austria’s economy, driven by
exports and buoyed by consumer spending, is set to expand in the
face of risks posed by other countries sharing the euro
currency, the state-supported Wifo research institute said.  Wifo reiterated its forecast that gross domestic product,
the sum of all goods and services, will expand 1 percent this
year and 1.8 percent in 2014, according to an e-mailed statement
from the Vienna-based group. Exports, about a third of which go
 Germany , are expected to increase 3.8 percent this year and 6
percent next year.  “The domestic economy is still poised for a long and
broad-based recovery,” Wifo said. “There are still risks,
however in the external environment.”  Private consumption will increase 0.6 percent in 2013 and
0.9 percent next year, Wifo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
