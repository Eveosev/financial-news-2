The following is the text of
Canadaâ€™s retail sales report for January as released by
Statistics Canada.  Retail sales rose 1.0% to $38.9 billion in January,
partially offsetting the decline in December. Gains were
reported in 7 of 11 subsectors, representing 52% of total retail
trade. The increase was led by higher sales at motor vehicle and
parts dealers.  After removing the effects of price changes, particularly
higher prices at new car dealers, retail sales in volume terms
were flat.  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers rose 2.8% in
January, partially offsetting the 6.5% decline in December.
Higher receipts at new car dealers (+2.4%) accounted for most of
this gain. Used car dealers (+5.3%) reported higher sales for a
third straight month.  General merchandise stores reported a 2.8% increase.
Department stores sales advanced 11.5%. Despite this gain, sales
in this store type have been on a downward trend since the
middle of 2012. Sales at other general merchandise stores
declined 3.5%.  Miscellaneous store retailers reported a 9.4% gain in
January, the fourth increase in five months. Stores in this
subsector include office supplies and stationery stores, gift
stores and pet supplies stores.  Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores rose 1.2%,
a second consecutive monthly gain. Higher sales at clothing
stores led the gain, rising 1.7%. Shoe stores (-0.5%) and
jewellery, luggage and leather goods stores (-0.3%) reported
sales declines in January.  Following double-digit fluctuations in November and
December, sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 2.3% in
January.  The largest decline occurred at gasoline stations (-1.4%),
where sales decreased for a third consecutive month.  Food and beverage store sales decreased 0.4%, mainly
reflecting lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores
(-0.8%). Following eight straight monthly gains, sales at
speciality food stores declined 2.8% in January. Beer, wine and
liquor store sales increased 2.2%, more than offsetting the
decline in December. This gain coincided with the resumption of
the National Hockey League season.  Quebec leads sales gains  Retail sales rose in six provinces in January. Quebec
(+2.1%) reported the largest increase in dollar terms, in part a
result of higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers.  Following two consecutive monthly declines, retailers in
Alberta registered a 1.3% sales gain.  The 0.5% rise in sales in Ontario did not offset the
decrease in December.  British Columbia retail sales advanced 1.0%, nearly
offsetting the decline in December. Sales in this province have
been relatively flat since the middle of 2012.  The largest decline in dollar terms occurred in Nova Scotia
(-0.3%).  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
