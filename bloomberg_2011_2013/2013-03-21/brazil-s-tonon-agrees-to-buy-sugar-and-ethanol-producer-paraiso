(Corrects to say Paraiso owns one mill and that Amyris
produces farnesene in third paragraph of story originally
published March 21.)  Tonon Bioenergia SA, a Brazilian
sugar and ethanol producer, will expand sugar-cane capacity by
almost half after it agreed to buy Paraiso Bioenergia SA.  Tonon will pay for the acquisition mostly with existing
shares, the Bocaina, Brazil-based company said in a  statement 
posted on its website. The company didnâ€™t disclose how much it
paid for the deal. The Pinheiros family, owner of Paraiso, will
take a 7 percent stake in Tonon, according to the statement.  The acquisition will boost sugar-cane crushing capacity to
about 8.2 million metric tons, from 5.7 million tons now, Tonon
said. Paraiso owns a mill and is a supplier of sugar-cane syrup
to Emeryville, California-based  Amyris Inc (AMRS) , which produces
farnesene, a renewable hydrocarbon fuel, in Brazil.  In January, Tonon sold $300 million in bonds due in 2020
with a coupon of 9.25 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
