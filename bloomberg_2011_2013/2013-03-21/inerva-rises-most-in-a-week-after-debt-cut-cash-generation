Minerva SA,  Brazil ’s least indebted
meatpacker, rose the  most  in almost a week after lower cattle
prices helped it to generate cash and cut debt.  Minerva rose 2.9 percent to 12.97 reais at 12:09 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Earlier the stock rose to 13.15 reais, the most
intraday since March 15. The  Bovespa (IBOV)  stock index dropped 0.5
percent.  Minerva, which generated free cash flow for a fifth
consecutive quarter, had cash flow of 63.9 million reais ($32.1
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31 after cattle
acquisition prices fell, it said in a statement yesterday. The
company, based in Barretos, Brazil, cut debt to 2.8 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in the fourth quarter from 3.7 times a year ago, it said.  Minerva had “positive cash flow generation, despite
pressure from operating expenses,” Ricardo Boiati, an analyst
with  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , said in a note to clients today. He has
the company’s rating under review.  The company posted a net loss of 21.8 million reais in the
quarter, compared with a gain of 14.8 million reais a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
