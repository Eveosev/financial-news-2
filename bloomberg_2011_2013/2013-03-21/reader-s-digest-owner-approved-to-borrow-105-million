RDA Holding Co., the publisher of
Reader’s Digest magazine, won final court approval to borrow
$105 million from a group of lenders while it reorganizes in
 bankruptcy protection .  The so-called debtor-in-possession loan arranged by a
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  unit was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Robert Drain at a hearing in White Plains,  New York , where
the company is based.  The 91-year-old publisher filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
petition on Feb. 17, the second such filing in four years, in a
bid to shed debt as consumers shift to electronic media. The
company had reached a restructuring deal with its secured lender
and more than 70 percent of its secured noteholders to convert
$465 million of senior notes into equity in the company.  The financing, arranged by Wells Fargo Principal Lending
LLC as administrative agent, includes a $45 million term loan,
$11 million of which was approved on an interim basis last
month; a refinancing  term loan  of $49.6 million and $9.5 million
in letters of credit that are outstanding under its current
credit agreement, according to court papers.  Reader’s Digest, founded by DeWitt and Lila Wallace, went
public in 1990. An investor group led by private-equity firm
Ripplewood Holdings LLC bought it in 2007 for $1.6 billion and
the assumption of about $800 million in debt.  The company previously filed for bankruptcy in August 2009,
citing a drop in advertising spending and the debt load incurred
in its acquisition. In its filing last month, the company listed
more than $1 billion in debt.  The case is In re RDA Holding Co. Inc., 13-22233, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).
The previous bankruptcy was In Re Reader’s Digest Association
Inc., 09-23529,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
