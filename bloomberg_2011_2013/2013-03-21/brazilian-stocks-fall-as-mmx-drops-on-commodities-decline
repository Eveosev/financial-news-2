The  Bovespa index  fell for a third
day as mining company  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3)  led Brazilian
commodity exporters lower amid concern that slower growth in
Europe will sap demand for raw materials.  The MSCI Brazil/Materials dropped the most among 10
industry groups. Power utility  Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais 
advanced after yesterday posting its biggest one-day plunge in
12 weeks.  The Bovespa declined 0.6 percent to 55,671.40 at 10:44 a.m.
in  Sao Paulo . Forty-four  stocks  dropped on the measure while 23
advanced. The real was little changed at 1.9894 per dollar. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials slid 0.4
percent after a report showed German manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted this month.  “There’s concern that things in Europe will take a turn to
the worse, and the Bovespa is tracking this bad mood,”  Pedro Galdi , the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW
Corretora, said in a phone interview. “When you look at
valuation, the Bovespa is not really cheap, and with things
getting worse abroad, investors get worried.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.3 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.7 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  MMX fell 2.8 percent to 2.77 reais. Steelmaker  Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3)  lost 2.3 percent to 9.20 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
