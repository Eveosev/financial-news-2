India ’s Karnataka state plans to
tender for 130 megawatts of solar power projects next month, the
state electricity utility said.  Developers may submit bids for building one or more
projects having three to 10 megawatts capacity, according to a
 tender document  from state-owned Karnataka Renewable Energy
Development Ltd. Companies may submit bids for both solar
photovoltaic and solar thermal projects, it said.  The developers will be responsible for laying  power lines 
from their project to the nearest substation at their own cost
and for ensuring water availability, it said.  Developers offering to sell power at the highest discount
to a tariff approved by the state electricity regulator will
win, it said. Winners will sign  power-sale contracts  with the
state electricity supply company and have as long as 24 months
to build the plant from the day of signing the agreement.  Companies have until April 23 to submit their bids, which
will be opened on April 26, according to the utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
