Hungarian television journalist
Ferenc Szaniszlo, whose program has been fined for its racist
statements, returned a state award after protests, including
from  Israel  and the U.S.  Szaniszlo,  speaking  on his program on Echo TV yesterday,
said the outcry was triggered by “untrue” allegations and
offered the award he received last week as “war booty” to the
U.S. and Israel.  Szaniszlo’s “anti-Hungarian conspiracies” incited hatred
against minorities, according to a 2010 media regulator ruling.
 Hungary  is suffering from “gypsy terror” and has been torn
into “three parts” -- Hungarian, Jewish and gypsy -- and that
“at the end someone will have to leave,” Szaniszlo said in a
Feb. 11, 2011 program.  Hungarian Human Resources Minister Zoltan Balog asked
Szaniszlo to return the Tancsics prize he awarded the journalist
last week, saying he had made a “bad decision” and hadn’t been
aware of the reporter’s views.  To contact the reporter on this story:
