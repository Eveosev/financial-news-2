Light, sweet crude on the U.S. Gulf
Coast weakened on the  spot market  by the most since Jan. 28 as
Brent fell against West  Texas  Intermediate and operators
prepared to load a pipeline to the Gulf.  The premium of Brent over WTI, the U.S. benchmark, shrank
to $15.02 from $15.22, based on settlement prices. Gulf crudes
compete for space in coastal U.S. refineries with foreign oils
priced against Brent, the European benchmark.  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  will begin filling the
Longhorn pipeline this week, a company spokesman said last week.
The reversed line will initially pump up to 75,000 barrels of
crude a day to Houston from Crane, Texas.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium  to WTI on the spot market
in Cushing,  Oklahoma , narrowed by $3 to $20 a barrel at 11:56
a.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil weakened $3.95 to a $20.30
premium. The 16 percent decline was the biggest since Aug. 27.  Mars Blend, a medium sour crude from the Gulf, weakened by
$2.25 to $16.75 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s premium fell $2.75
to $16.50 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon slid 75 cents to a premium of $14.75
a barrel and  Thunder Horse  weakened by $2.40 to $18.85 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
