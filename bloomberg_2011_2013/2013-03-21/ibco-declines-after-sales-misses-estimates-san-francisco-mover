Tibco Software Inc. (TIBX) , a maker of
programs for running corporate-data centers, tumbled in late
trading yesterday after reporting fiscal first-quarter revenue
and a sales forecast that were shy of estimates.  The stock fell 16 percent to as low as $19.56 in extended
trading yesterday, after declining less than 1 percent to $23.17
at the close. Through yesterday, Tibco shares had gained 5.4
percent this year, compared with a 11.3 percent climb in the
Standard & Poor’s 400 Midcap Index.  Sales for the fiscal first quarter, which ended March 3,
were $237.8 million, compared with a December forecast for
revenue of $241 million to $245 million, the  Palo Alto ,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. For the
current period, Tibco forecast profit, excluding some items, of
17 cents to 19 cents a share, compared with the 18-cent average
estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue in the current quarter will be $242 million to $252
million, Tibco said on a conference call with analysts. That’s
shy of the $264.6 million average projection, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Tibco cited execution challenges as the
reason for the shortfall and said its pipeline of potential
future deals is strong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
