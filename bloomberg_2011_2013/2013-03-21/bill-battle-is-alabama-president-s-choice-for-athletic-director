University of Alabama  President
Judy Bonner will support hiring former Crimson Tide football
player Bill Battle as the school’s athletic director.  Battle, 71, also received an endorsement from Mal Moore,
the athletic director for the past 14 years, the school
announced yesterday on its website. Moore stepped down two days
ago, citing unspecified health problems.  Alabama ’s board of trustees will meet via conference call
today at 10 a.m. Tuscaloosa time to vote on the recommendation,
according to the Birmingham News.  “Based on Mal’s strong endorsement as well as Coach
Battle’s affiliation with UA as a player, partner and donor, his
experience as a coach and his significant business background, I
am confident that he is the right person to serve UA in this
position,” Bonner said in the release.  Battle was a starter for the Crimson Tide under Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant from 1960 to 1962, including the school’s
national championship in 1961. He was coach of the  University of
Tennessee  for seven years in the 1970s, and later founded the
Collegiate Licensing Company, serving as president and chief
executive until 2002. The company was acquired by  IMG  in 2007.  Alabama’s football team won the Bowl Championship Series
national title this year, its third in four years. The men’s
basketball team plays tomorrow in the second round of the
National Invitation Tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
