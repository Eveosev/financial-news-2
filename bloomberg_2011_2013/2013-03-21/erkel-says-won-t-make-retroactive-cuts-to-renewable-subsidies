German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
abandoned plans to cut subsidies for existing clean-energy
generators to calm investors in  Europe ’s biggest market for the
industry after pressure from the opposition.  Germany  won’t make retroactive cuts as doing so once may
spread concern that the support framework is changed
continually, Merkel said today after talks with state leaders on
energy in Berlin. Two of her Cabinet ministers had proposed the
plan last month.  “This is an important signal and should calm all those who
want to invest and all those operating these units,” Merkel
told reporters. “We don’t want constant insecurity.”  State leaders and the renewable-energy industry had said
retroactive cuts would throttle the renewable expansion as
Germany replaces nuclear reactors with a greater share of  wind
turbines  and solar panels. Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier 
and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler had jointly proposed
retroactive cuts on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
