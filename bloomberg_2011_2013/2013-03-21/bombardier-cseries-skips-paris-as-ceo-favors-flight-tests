Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  will forgo
displaying its CSeries at the  Paris Air Show  in June in order to
finish testing before the jetliner’s first flight the same
month, Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin said.  The world’s third-largest planemaker reiterated its
commitment to that timetable in a presentation to investors
yesterday in  New York . The goal is already six months later than
Bombardier originally planned, a delay the company attributed to
unspecified issues with suppliers.  “We plan to fly in June, but to go to an air show with an
experimental airplane would take at least a month away from our
flight-test program because we’d have to prepare it to go,”
Beaudoin said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg
headquarters in New York. “That’s not the kind of expense that
makes sense for investors in Bombardier.”  The air show, held at  Paris-Le Bourget Airport  near the
French capital, is the year’s largest aviation and aerospace
industry trade event. Customers such as airlines and lessors
ordered more than 1,400 aircraft when it was last held in 2011.  The CSeries, with a $3.4 billion development program, will
be Bombardier’s largest jet, capable of seating as many as 160
people and competing with the smallest jets produced by Airbus
SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA)  The first flight-test craft was shown to
reporters and investors two weeks ago at the company’s Mirabel,
Quebec, plant.  Atlantic Flight  “The notion of flying across the Atlantic just to showcase
it didn’t make much sense,”  Walter Spracklin , an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets  in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “By
the time of the air show, they will have just gotten the
aircraft in the air, if that.”  The CSeries isn’t the only new jet that won’t be making an
appearance at the air show. Airbus’s new A350 wide-body plane
likewise won’t make its first flight by then, Thomas Enders, CEO
of Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., said
two weeks ago.  “A better assessment is probably summer, July or August,”
Enders told reporters at a briefing in New York on March 7.  Beaudoin reiterated yesterday Bombardier’s expectation that
the CSeries will contribute $5 billion to $8 billion annually in
new revenue starting in 2018. Altogether, the Montreal-based
manufacturer said new products are expected to yield additional
sales of as much as $16 billion -- almost doubling its 2012
revenue of  $16.8 billion .  Bombardier’s widely traded Class B shares fell 2.9 percent
to C$4.06 at the close in Toronto. The  stock  has gained 13
percent since Nov. 6, the day before the company disclosed the
first-flight delay, outpacing the  Standard & Poor’s/Toronto
Stock Exchange Composite Index. (SPTSX)   CSeries Orders  Bombardier has racked up 180 firm orders for the CSeries so
far, and the company is on track to meet a goal of 300 by the
time the plane enters service in mid-2014, the CEO said.  The CSeries will cost about 15 percent less to operate and
burn about 20 percent less fuel than existing competitors,
Bombardier has said. The plane will feature composite materials
and the new geared turbofan engine from  United Technologies
Corp.’s (UTX)  Pratt & Whitney.  The smaller CS100 model, with about 100 to 125 seats, sells
for a list price of $62 million, while the CS300, which will
carry 135 to 160 people, sells for $71 million, though airlines
typically negotiate discounts.  Pricing Challenges  “When you sell before the first flight, the customers want
discounts because they’re taking a risk and there’s only so much
discount we’re willing to give,” Beaudoin said in the
interview. “The first people who come to the CSeries are
obviously getting a better price, but at some point we have to
say it’s enough and then we’ll sell on the demonstrated merits
of the product.”  Bombardier expects setting prices to remain “challenging”
for “probably another year or two,”  Guy Hachey , president of
Bombardier’s aerospace unit, told investors at the presentation.  As the company moves forward with the CSeries, Airbus and
Boeing are developing reworked versions of their own narrow-body
planes, the 737 Max and the A320neo, which will be powered by
more fuel-efficient engines.  Bombardier said last year it expects that 6,900 aircraft
seating 100 to 149 people will be delivered globally between
2012 and 2031.  Besides the 180 firm orders, Bombardier also has
commitments for at least 200 CSeries jetliners.  Jet Lessors  “We know an airplane will have a long life and better
residual value if it has wide distribution of its customers
across the world, and many customers,” Beaudoin said. “So it’s
important for us to get landmark names in terms of airlines, but
also to get many airlines in different countries.”  Delivery slots for the CSeries are sold out for 2014 and
2015 and “almost” sold out for 2016, Hachey said.  Bombardier’s most recent sale was Feb. 20, when Russian
leasing company Ilyushin Finance Co. converted a letter of
intent into an order valued at about $2.56 billion at catalog
prices.  Ilyushin is “going to help us get the CSeries in  Russia 
and sell it,” Hachey said. “They are the largest lessor in
Russia.”  Over time, Bombardier expects leasing companies to account
for 30 percent to 40 percent of all CSeries aircraft sold
globally, Hachey said.  Leasing companies are key “because when an airline buys
product, it will buy some and lease some,” Beaudoin said.
“Getting that right balance is important. For me it’s not only
about selling to one airline, it’s also planning it well because
we’re in this for 20 years.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
