Triodos Renewables Plc, an arm of
Netherlands-based Triodos Bank NV, purchased a stake in a wind
farm in southeast  England  and said it’s seeking to increase its
power generating capacity by a further 20 percent this year.  The unit and the bank’s Renewables Europe Fund bought 49.8
percent of the 10-megawatt facility in Cambridge, Zeist-based
Triodos said today in an e-mailed statement. The farm produces
enough electricity to supply power to about 5,720 homes.  Triodos plans to raise capacity by a fifth later this year,
on top of 20 percent growth from today’s deal and commissioning
of a wind farm earlier this month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
