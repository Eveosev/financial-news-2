Prime Minister Julia Gillard called
a ballot for the leadership of the Labor party, after a senior
member of her government said it canâ€™t win elections due in six
months from its current position.  The ballot of the 102-member Labor caucus for a new leader
and deputy leader of the governing party will take place at 4:30
p.m. local time in Canberra today, Gillard told parliament.  Simon Crean, who led Labor in the early 2000s, earlier
urged former leader Kevin Rudd to stand against Gillard and said
he will stand for the deputy position. Speculation about a
challenge to Gillard intensified in recent weeks after she
announced Sept. 14 as the election date and polls forecast that
Labor under Rudd would win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
