Swiss companies expect revenues to
rise after economic activity revived early this year, according
a survey prepared for the  Swiss National Bank ’s most recent
policy review.  “The outlook for real growth in turnover over the next few
months has brightened further in all sectors,” the SNB said its
 Quarterly Bulletin  published in Zurich today.  The survey is based on talks SNB representatives held in
January and February 2013 with 238 members of various industries
on the current and future situation of their companies and the
economy. The SNB didn’t identify the companies it spoke to.  At its policy review on March 14, the SNB kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at zero and also maintained its cap of
1.20 per euro on the franc, citing the risk of a worsening of
the euro-area crisis.  The 17-nation currency block is  Switzerland ’s top trading
partner. The strong franc, which nearly touched parity with the
euro in August 2011, prompting the SNB to impose the upper limit
a month later, has pressured profits at export-oriented
companies.  The survey found that the manufacturing and --- to a lesser
extent -- the services sectors are experiencing an improvement
in the first quarter.  Companies across all sectors said margins
had improved in the first quarter, compared with late 2012,
according to the report.  The real export-weighted external value of the Swiss franc
has largely remained unchanged since July 2012, though still
significantly above its long-term average, the SNB said in the
Quarterly Bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
