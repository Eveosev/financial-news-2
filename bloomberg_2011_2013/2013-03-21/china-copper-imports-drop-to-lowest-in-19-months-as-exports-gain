Imports of refined  copper  by China,
the biggest user, declined in February to the lowest level in 19
months, while exports rose for a sixth month.  Inbound shipments were 214,949 metric tons last month, the
lowest since July 2011, data from the General Administration of
Customs showed today. Exports expanded to 38,569 tons, the
highest since May, from 26,213 tons in January, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  The drop in arrivals due to Chinese New Year holidays in
February may help curb the highest inventories in at least 10
years. A preliminary reading of  Purchasing Managers ’ Index stood
at 51.7 in March, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. That compares with a final reading of 50.4 for
February and median estimate at 50.8 in a Bloomberg survey.  “Imports in the second quarter are likely to remain
relatively low compared with last year,” Liang Lijuan, an
analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing. “The
huge inventory and shrinking demand to use the metal as a
financing tool will probably curb imports.”  Inventories tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose
to 231,872 tons last week, the highest since Bloomberg started
to compile the data in 2003. Trading firms in China have
imported the metal to use as collateral to obtain cheaper loans,
known as financing, even as the arbitrage window is closed.  Net imports dropped 19 percent to 176,380 tons last month
from 216,961 tons in January, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on the customs data. Refined-copper imports
in the first two months fell 36 percent from a year ago to
458,123 tons, according to the customs office.  Copper-concentrate  imports  by  China  fell to 681,148 tons in
February from 761,098 tons a month earlier, data from the
customs bureau showed today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
