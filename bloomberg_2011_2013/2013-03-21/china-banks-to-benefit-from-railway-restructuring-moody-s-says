China ’s plan to abolish the
Ministry of Railways while continuing its support for the
industry is positive for the nation’s banks, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  Chinese lenders hold a “large” portion of the 759 billion
yuan ($122 billion) of bonds issued by the ministry, with total
liabilities from the government body reaching 1.3 trillion yuan,
or 2 percent of the nation’s loans, the ratings company said in
a  Credit Outlook report .  China will transfer rail regulatory functions to the
Ministry of Transportation, the State Council said last week in
a statement. Commercial operations and liabilities will go to
the newly established China Railway Corp., a state-owned
enterprise that will receive government backing for its debt as
the ministry did, according to the statement.  “We expect the CRC to continue to benefit from strong
public support, but to have stronger corporate governance and
more funding channels than its predecessors,” Bin Hu, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Moody’s, wrote in the report.  The former ministry had more than 2 million employees and
2.66 trillion  yuan  of debt, larger than  Denmark ’s annual gross
domestic product. Liu Shiyu, a deputy governor of the People’s
Bank of China, said this week he had received many calls from
institutional investors about the railway bonds in the wake of
the announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
