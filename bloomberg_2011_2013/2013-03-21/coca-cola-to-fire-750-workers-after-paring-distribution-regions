Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soft drink maker, plans to fire 750 employees in its U.S.
division following a February decision to pare its distribution
regions from seven to three.  The cuts in the coming months will represent about 1
percent of jobs in Coca-Cola’s North American unit, which covers
the U.S. and  Canada , Scott Williamson, a spokesman, said today
in an interview. A quarter of the job losses will be in Atlanta,
where Coca-Cola is headquartered, he said.  Chief Executive Officer  Muhtar Kent  has worked to
restructure distribution in the U.S. since buying the North
American operations of  Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE)  in 2010. Coca-
Cola, which now bottles about 80 percent of its drinks volume
sold in the U.S., said in February it was paring the
distribution regions to improve efficiency and cut costs.  The Coca-Cola Refreshments bottling unit now includes East,
Central and West divisions.  The shares  rose  1.3 percent to $40.37 at 11:45 a.m. in New
York. Coca-Cola had gained 10 percent this year through
yesterday compared with a 9.3 percent increase for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  The job cuts were reported earlier by the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
