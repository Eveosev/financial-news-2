Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) ,
 Australia ’s largest sports-wear company, fell to a record low
today as it awaited takeover offers from two private equity
groups that have made provisional approaches.  The stock slumped as much as 22 percent to 63 Australian
cents, the lowest level since an August 2000 stock-market
listing, before paring losses to 69 cents at 11:37 a.m. in
Sydney.  Two groups, consisting of Altamont Capital Partners and  VF
Corp. (VFC)  on one side and Sycamore Partners Management and Billabong
Americas head Paul Naude on the other, have said they may offer
A$1.10 for the  Gold Coast , Australia-based company, valuing the
business at A$527 million ($547 million).  “Volume today is quite heavy which suggests that something
might be up,” said Anson Rosewall, an institutional dealer at
BBY Ltd. in Sydney. “It may have been operator error, the
second thing going round is that there’s going to be no bid.”  Chris Fogarty, a Sydney-based spokesman for Billabong,
didn’t return a mobile-phone message and e-mail seeking comment.  The company last month posted a record loss on A$567
million ($588 million) of charges as it wrote off most of the
value of its main brand. Billabong will post 80 percent of its
assets and 85 percent of its earnings as security to its lenders
after brand and goodwill writedowns put it in breach of terms on
its debt, it said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
