Russian lenders including  VTB Group (VTBR) 
face “limited” risks as Cypriot authorities struggle to save
the Mediterranean island’s banking system, Fitch Ratings said.  The likelihood of a customer-deposit tax is “receding,”
and another “burden sharing” measure involving creditors of
Cypriot banks probably won’t lead to “material losses” for
Russian lenders, Fitch said in a statement today.  In the event that Russian lenders choose to absorb some
losses for clients, any shortfall would be “small relative to
the equity of the banks,” Fitch said. “Unless interbank
deposits are subject to a levy, we believe risks from placements
of Russian banks in Cypriot banks are limited.”  VTB,  Russia ’s second-largest bank, said on March 20 it will
“re-examine” its business in Cyprus if a tax on deposits is
introduced even though it may lose “only tens of millions of
euros.” The company operates Russian Commercial Bank Cyprus
with about 14 billion euros ($18 billion) of assets, Fitch
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
