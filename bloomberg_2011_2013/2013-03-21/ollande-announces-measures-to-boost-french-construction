French President  Francois Hollande 
said his government set a goal of building 500,000 homes and
renovating the same number annually by 2017 to meet growing
demand after new construction dropped 20 percent last year.  Speaking today at a recently completed public-housing
project near Paris, Hollande said the government will cut
administrative obstacles to construction projects by speeding up
approval processes, loosening zoning rules, offering some tax
breaks and freezing housing standards for at least two years.  The value-added tax will be reduced to 5 percent from 7
percent for work on improving residential energy efficiency and
families will receive as much as 1,300 euros ($1,588) for
renovations, Hollande said.  About 340,000 new housing units were built last year and
150,000 upgraded. Families in  France  spend a bigger percentage
of their salaries on housing than in neighboring countries, say
French officials, who credit the lower cost of homes in  Germany 
to greater wage moderation and mobility in that country.  Advisers to Hollande said the housing program will cost the
government less than 1 billion euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
