Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest
maker of online customer-management software, has approved a
four-for-one stock split amid a surge in cloud computing that
has propelled the stock to records.  The change will take effect for stockholders of record on
April 3 and increase the total number of authorized shares to
1.6 billion from 400 million, the San Francisco-based company
said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Marc Benioff  is seeking to
accelerate growth by  pushing beyond  cloud-computing software for
sales management. Heâ€™s offering customer service, online
marketing and human-resources software over the Web. Salesforce
closed at a record high on March 1 after reporting sales and
profit that topped estimates as those expansion efforts prompted
more businesses to sign bigger deals.  The shares rose as much as 2.4 percent in extended trading,
and they earlier increased less than 1 percent to $172.73 at the
close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
