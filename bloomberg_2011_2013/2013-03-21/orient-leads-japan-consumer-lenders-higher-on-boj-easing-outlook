Orient Corp. (8585)  rose the most this
year in  Tokyo  trading, leading Japanese consumer lenders higher
in anticipation of deeper monetary easing under new central bank
leadership.  Orient, a provider of services from credit cards to loan
guarantees, jumped 26 percent, making it the  biggest gainer  on
the benchmark Topix Index, to 301 yen at 1:42 p.m. local time.
 Aiful Corp. (8515) , which has more than tripled in the past six months,
surged 17 percent to 545 yen.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who took the post
this week after pledging to do whatever is needed to end the
country’s  deflation , is scheduled to brief the press on monetary
policy later today. Additional easing may help to reduce
consumer lenders’ borrowing costs, according to investment
adviser Yoku Ihara.  “The non-bank sector is pretty cheap and monetary easing
will improve the financing environment and boost the economy,”
said Ihara, who works at Retela Crea Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Japan ’s consumer credit industry is showing signs of a
recovery from regulations that forced lenders to cap rates and
refund overcharged interest. The crackdown led to the bankruptcy
of Takefuji Corp. in 2010 and prompted some politicians to
consider easing the rules.  Acom Co. (8572) , the country’s largest consumer lender and partly
owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., rose 6.3 percent
today, extending its six-month gain to 24 percent. J Trust Co.,
which bought Takefuji last year, climbed 15 percent and has more
than doubled since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
