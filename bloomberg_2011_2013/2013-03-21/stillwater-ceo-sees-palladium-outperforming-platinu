Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC) , the U.S.
miner facing demands for change from an activist investor, said
palladium prices will continue to outperform platinum this year
on rising auto industry demand and a lack of new mine supply.  It’s “highly probable” that palladium prices will
increase to reach 65 percent of platinum’s value per ounce,
Stillwater Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Francis McAllister said yesterday by phone. He declined to provide a
timeframe.  Palladium futures have risen 7.6 percent this year to
$756.85 an ounce. That’s 48 percent of the platinum spot price
of $1,580.10, compared with an average of 42 percent in 2012 and
30 percent in 2003. Platinum futures have risen 2.4 percent in
2013.  Stillwater, which operates mines in  Montana , produces
roughly three ounces of palladium for each ounce of platinum,
McAllister said. The Billings, Montana-based company will
benefit because its costs have risen at a slower rate than
competitors, he said.  The company is facing calls from Clinton Group Inc. to
retire McAllister and reassess plans for projects in Argentina
and  Canada . It has nominated an eight-person slate of directors
that includes former Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer.  Shareholders should vote for management’s slate of
directors, Stillwater said yesterday in a statement.  “We’ve been on a multiyear plan at Stillwater for the
purpose of making sure that we would have a future, number one,
and number two is that we would be able to maximize that future
for our shareholders,” McAllister said. “We don’t want to be
sidetracked from that course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
