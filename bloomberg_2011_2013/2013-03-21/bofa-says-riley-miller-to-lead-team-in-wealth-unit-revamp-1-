Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, said Ed Riley and  Jonathan Miller 
will lead a new team catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients.  Riley was named head of platforms and originations and
Miller head of coverage, according to an employee memo sent
today from Liam O’Neil, leader of the firm’s markets group.
Riley is responsible for creating investment products and Miller
delivers them to financial advisers and clients, O’Neil said
today in a telephone interview.  The moves reinforce the wealth division’s focus on
Americans who typically have more than $10 million in assets to
invest. About one-third of assets managed by the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company’s Merrill Lynch unit stem from
ultra-high-net-worth clients, according to O’Neil.  “They have different needs in terms of the way their
wealth is structured,” O’Neil said. “We might do something on
a customized basis for them because they have a philanthropic
strategy, or want a particular way to structure their legacy.”  Riley, who has worked at Merrill Lynch or Bank of America
for 14 years, had previously run equity risk management in the
global wealth and retirement solutions unit. Miller joined from
Barclays Plc in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
