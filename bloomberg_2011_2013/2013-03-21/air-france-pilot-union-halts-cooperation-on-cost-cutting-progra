Air France (AF) ’s main pilot union said
it will refuse to cooperate with a cost-cutting plan aimed at
restoring earnings, two days after revealing that it was looking
at withdrawing its support over terms offered to cabin crew.  While Air France needs structural changes, its strategy is
being driven by financial and accounting concerns, with little
regard for social considerations or long-term strategy, the
SNPL, which represents 70 percent of the pilots, said today.  The union will “freeze” all cooperation with measures set
out in the Transformation 2015 program, it said in a statement.  The SNPL said March 19 it was checking if the provisions of
an accord with flight attendants delivered the 20 percent boost
in productivity sought from all workers.  The union said today it’s also concerned about future
governance after La Tribune reported that Jean-Cyril Spinetta
will quit as Air France-KLM Group chief nine months before his
70th birthday, by which he’s obliged leave, with Alexandre de Juniac, architect of Air France’s cuts, taking the top post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
