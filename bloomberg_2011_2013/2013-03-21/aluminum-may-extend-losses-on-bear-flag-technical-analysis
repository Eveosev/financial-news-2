Aluminum prices, down 6.5 percent
this year, probably will extend the slump to the lowest since
October on the London Metal Exchange, according to  technical
analysis  by Matt McKinney at Zaner Group LLC.  After touching a low of $1,934.85 a metric ton on March 11,
prices jumped two days later to $1,996.25, creating a so-called
bear flag pattern that signals a drop by the end of this month
to $1,887, the lowest since Oct. 29, McKinney said. A bear flag,
named for its resemblance to an inverted flag on a pole, occurs
when a security is declining, pauses and consolidates, and then
continues its drop.  “There was a valiant effort to get prices back up, but
sellers came in heavy the past few days,” McKinney said in a
telephone interview from  Chicago . “There’s considerable
momentum to the downside now. It’s a convincing bear flag.”  Aluminum for delivery in three months rose 0.1 percent
yesterday on the LME, paring the metal’s decline in March to 3.3
percent. Prices tumbled 4.1 percent in February, the biggest
monthly loss since October.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
