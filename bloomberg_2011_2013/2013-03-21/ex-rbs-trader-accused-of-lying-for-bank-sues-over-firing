A former  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  trader, who was criticized by a judge for giving
dishonest testimony on behalf of the bank in a 2010 trial, sued
at a London tribunal saying he was unfairly fired.  Sam Griffiths, a former leveraged-loan trader at RBS,
testified in a lawsuit brought by Highland Capital Management LP
accusing the lender of fraudulently terminating a
collateralized-debt obligation at the height of the 2008 credit
crunch. Judge Michael Burton said Griffiths tried to hide
information and gave misleading evidence about the bank’s
conduct. “He has lied,” the judge said in a 2012 ruling.  At a tribunal hearing this morning, lawyers for Griffiths
contested the use of privileged evidence ahead of the official
start of his unfair dismissal case. No further information about
the claim was given at the hearing and Griffiths’s lawyer Raja
Nadarajan didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  While damages in unfair dismissal cases are capped at about
70,000 pounds ($106,000), bank employees can seek to reclaim
lost or withheld bonuses if a tribunal rules they were dismissed
improperly.  RBS asked a London judge last year to block Dallas-based
Highland’s $100 million U.S. lawsuit over the deal, which
happened during the credit crisis that followed the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The money-management firm said RBS
held a sham auction and used an accounting provision to profit
from improperly seizing loans.  RBS declined to comment on the employment litigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
