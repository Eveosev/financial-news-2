Freezing temperatures in southern
 Russia , the country’s main wheat-exporting area, didn’t damage
winter grain crops, the state weather center said.  Temperatures fell as low as minus 7 degrees Celsius (19.4
degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the Stavropol region during the
night on March 19, the Federal Hydrometeorological Center said
yesterday on its  website .  “Temperatures this low were unfavorable for winter crops,
but there is not yet any visible damage to plantings from this
short-term chill,” the center said. Crops continued to develop
as temperatures rose to as high as 9 degrees Celsius the same
day, it said. The chill was “dangerous” for fruit trees
because they were blooming at the time, a month earlier than
normal, it said.  Weather conditions for winter crops will be “mainly
satisfactory” across Russia’s grain growing regions in the last
10 days of March, the center said. Russia’s southern regions
accounted for about 35 percent of the national grain crop of
70.9 million metric tons in 2012-13, and Stavropol alone
harvested 6.8 percent, according to the state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
