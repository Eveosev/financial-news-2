The Democratic chairman and a
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee called on
President  Barack Obama  today to conduct air strikes in Syria and
help establish a “safe haven” for opposition groups.  Chairman  Carl Levin  of Michigan and Senator  John McCain  of
Arizona cited reports of chemical weapons used in Syria in
urging Obama to take military action.  “We write to express our strong belief that it is in our
national security interest to take more active steps, together
with our friends and allies in the Middle East and Europe, to
stop the killing in Syria and force Bashar al-Assad to give up
power,” the senators wrote in a letter to Obama.  The United Nations today said it will investigate Syrian
government claims that rebels used a chemical weapon.  “The potential use of chemical weapons only makes the case
for greater action more compelling and urgent,” Levin and
McCain said in their letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
