U.K. stocks  fell for a fifth day,
for the longest run of losses in 10 months, after a contraction
in euro-area manufacturing added to signs that Britain’s largest
trading partner is struggling to emerge from a recession.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.,  CRH Plc (CRH)  and Smith Groups
Plc paced the selloff, each falling at least 2 percent in London
trading.  Next (NXT)  Plc rallied to the highest price in at least 24
years after the clothing retailer reported profit that topped
analyst estimates.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 44.15 points, or 0.7
percent, to 6,388.55 at the close in London as all but 24 stocks
fell. The gauge has slid 2.2 percent since this year’s high on
March 14, its the highest level since December 2007, after euro
area ministers proposed an unprecedented levy on Cyprus bank
deposits to help pay for the island nation’s rescue package.  “Downside risks have started to materialize and another
leg of recession might be the baseline scenario in early 2013,”
Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Strategy in  London  wrote
in an e-mail. “The Italian political situation and the turmoil
related to the Cyprus bailout have certainly weighed on
confidence as companies struggle to see the light at the end of
the tunnel.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index lost 0.6 percent today.
Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.9 percent after rallying to its
 highest level  in 4 1/2 years in Dublin yesterday.  Euro-Area Industry  Stocks retreated as euro-area services and manufacturing
 output  shrank contracted. A composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries fell to 46.5 this month
from 47.9 in February, London-based Markit Economics said.
Economists had forecast a reading of 48.2, according to a
Bloomberg survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  In Cyprus, the  European Central Bank  said it will withdraw
Cypriot banks’ access to emergency funds on March 26 if the
government failed to agree to a bailout from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . Russia has also rebuffed
Cyprus’s request for a bailout loan as the euro-area nation
sought to salvage talks in Moscow.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 10 percent lower than its 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ENRC Loss  ENRC (ENRC)  fell 4.1 percent to 294.3 pence, the lowest price this
year. The London-listed metals and power company yesterday
posted an unexpected full-year loss and said it is in talks with
its five main owners on selling new shares to expand its free
float and raise cash.  CRH, the world’s second-largest maker of construction
materials, slid 2.3 percent to 1,493 pence today, while Smiths
Group, which yesterday predicted tough trading conditions in the
second half, dropped 2.7 percent to 1,284 pence today.  Next climbed 4 percent to 4,314 pence, its highest price
since at least 1988. The U.K.’s second-largest clothing retailer
posted a 9 percent increase in underlying pretax profit to 621.6
million pounds ($940 million). That topped the average analyst
estimate of 620.3 million pounds.  Travis Perkins Plc (TPK)  rose 2.4 percent to 1,443 pence,
reaching its highest price since August 2007 and extending
yesterday’s 2 percent rally, after U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  pledged 3.5 billion pounds to help
buyers of new homes. Analysts including those at Dublin-based
Goodbody Stockbrokers today said the builders merchant may
profit most from the government initiatives.  SIG, Grafton  SIG Plc (SHI) , which distributes specialty building products,
advanced 3.1 percent to 162.5 pence, while Ireland’s  Grafton
Group Plc (GN5)  increased 2.8 percent to 4.98 euros in Dublin.  United Utilities Group Plc climbed 1.9 percent to 709
pence. The U.K.’s largest publicly traded water company said
investments including infrastructure upgrades for the year
ending March rose 10 percent to 750 million pounds.  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  rallied 2.7 percent to 145 pence after the
engineering company’s Chief Executive Officer James Moffat said
he sees 2013 as a “recovery” and “break-even” year.  “We see a good pipeline of business between new rig builds
and rig repairs,” he said in an interview. “We have a sound
platform looking forward.” The company posted a 2012 loss of
$110.5 million.  Premier Farnell Plc (PFL)  gained 2.7 percent to 224.7 pence after
the company reported full-year results that met analyst
estimates and said the new financial year had started
positively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
