Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, denied it’s considering a takeover of
the French water utility Saur with  Seche Environnement SA. (SCHP)   There is “no plan being studied” for a takeover, EDF
spokeswoman  Carole Trivi  said by telephone. She was responding
to a report published in  Le Monde  today that Seche wants to join
forces with the nuclear operator to take control of Saur,
France’s third-largest water and waste company.  Seche Environnement Chief Executive Officer Joel Seche has
long sought to gain a majority stake in Saur, increasing his
holding from the 33 percent currently held. Saur’s other
shareholders include the investment fund FSI with 38 percent,
Axa Private Equity with 17 percent and Cube Infrastructure Fund
with 12 percent, according to its  website .  Seche is trying to convince EDF Chief Executive Officer
 Henri Proglio  to enter into a “longterm partnership” with
Seche Environnement to take over Saur, Le Monde reported, citing
a letter from Seche to Proglio.  The report came after Le Figaro yesterday said that three
banks holding 53 percent of Saur’s 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion) of debt want to control 100 percent of the company’s
holding company Hime.  Representatives of Seche and Saur couldn’t be reached
immediately for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
