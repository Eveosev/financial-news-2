The lira gained for a second day
and bonds pared losses after imprisoned Kurdistan Workers’ Party
leader Abdullah Ocalan called on militants to quit the armed
struggle and leave  Turkey .  Ocalan’s call for peace boosts Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s initiative to end the conflict, which has left more
than 30,000 people dead and cost hundreds of billions of
dollars. His government has engaged in talks with the PKK
leader, whose group is classified as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union.  “This is positive and the lira is appreciating,” said
Burcin Metin, head of currency trading at ING Bank AS in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  The Turkish currency pared this month’s loss to 0.9
percent, outperforming all major emerging-market currencies in
 Europe , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The lira jumped
0.2 percent against the dollar at 1.8147 at 2:12 p.m. in
Istanbul. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds reversed an earlier
increase of as much as six basis points and traded one basis
point lower at 6.17 percent.  “This war has cost the Turks hugely in terms of human life
and financial expenditure,” Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF
Global Trading UK Ltd in  London , said in an e-mailed note.
“There’s a big dividend for the Turks here in terms of reducing
military expense and perhaps in securing favorable terms to
import oil from Northern Iraq, lower their energy deficiency and
improve their current-account deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
