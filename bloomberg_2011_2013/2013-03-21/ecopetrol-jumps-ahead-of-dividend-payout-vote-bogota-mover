Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  rose the most in four
months on speculation shareholders will approve a plan for the
state-controlled  oil company  to pay its annual dividend in a
lump sum instead of installments.  The shares gained 2.4 percent to 5,020 pesos at 10:59 a.m.
in Bogota, the biggest increase on a closing basis since Nov. 8.
The stock was the best performer in the  benchmark Colcap index ,
which fell 0.2 percent.  Ecopetrol shareholders will decide on the number of
dividend installments at a shareholder meeting today in Bogota,
according to a Feb. 22  regulatory filing . The Bogota-based
company’s board has proposed a 291 peso per share  dividend  for
2012, according to the filing.  “The market is betting on the dividend,” Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Alianza brokerage, said in an electronic
message.  The government, which has an 88.5 percent stake in
Ecopetrol, favors paying the dividend in one installment to
minority shareholders, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told
 Blu Radio  today.  “The idea is that minority shareholders will get one lump
sum and the government will get the dividend in payments
throughout the year,” Cardenas told the station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
