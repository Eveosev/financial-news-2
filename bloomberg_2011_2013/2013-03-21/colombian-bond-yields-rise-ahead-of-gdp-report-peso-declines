Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose to
a six-week high on speculation a report today may show the
economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter, leading
the central bank to delay cutting  interest rates .  Yields on peso bonds due 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.11 percent at 10:16 a.m. in Bogota,
the highest since Feb. 5, according to the central bank. The
yield has jumped 20 basis points this week.  There is “speculation we may see a pause in the cycle of
interest-rate cuts,” Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores
Asociados brokerage in Bogota, said in a phone interview.  Colombia’s economy probably expanded 3 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier after growing 2.1 percent in
the third quarter, according to the median  estimate  of 30
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The national statistics agency
is slated to publish the report at 11 a.m. in Bogota.  Banco de la Republica will lower borrowing costs by 25
basis points to 3.5 percent on March 22, according to 29 of 32
analysts and economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other three
expect rates to remain unchanged. Policy makers have cut the
 overnight lending rate  by 150 basis points since July to buoy
growth in the Andean country.  The peso depreciated 0.4 percent to 1,825.80 per  U.S.
dollar  in its sixth day of losses, the longest losing streak
since October.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told flower growers in
Bogota yesterday that Colombia must do everything possible to
weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
