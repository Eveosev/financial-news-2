Natural gas futures slid after
trading at an 18-month high above $4 following a government
report showing that U.S. stockpiles declined by less than
expected last week.  Gas slipped 0.6 percent after rising to $4.025 per million
British thermal units, the highest intraday price since Sept.
15, 2011. Energy Information Administration data showed that
inventories fell 62 billion cubic feet in the week ended March
15 to 1.876 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected withdrawal of 70 billion.  “It’s the first bearish storage number we’ve had in a
while, so you would expect to see some selling,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston. “The
market may not be ready to sustain this $4 pricing.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 2.5 cents to settle at
$3.935 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was more than double the 100-day
average at 2:44 p.m. The futures have climbed 17 percent this
year, the second-best performer after cotton on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI spot index of 24 commodities.  Open interest in gas futures rose to a fourth-straight
record yesterday, reaching 1.348 million contracts.  The discount of April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, widened 1 cent to 12.3 cents. The
discount of October to January widened 0.2 cent to 30.2 cents.  Options Trading  April $4 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They dropped 39 cents to $1.7 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,609 contracts as of 3:10 p.m. Calls
accounted for 49 percent of options volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money gas options expiring in
May was 32.19 percent at 3 p.m., down from 33.44 percent
yesterday.  Inventories in the so-called producing region in the south-
central U.S. increased by 4 billion cubic feet because one or
more producers reclassified supplies from base gas, or supplies
needed to maintain adequate pressure, to working gas, or
stockpiles available for delivery, the department said.  The stockpile decrease was bigger than the five-year
average decline for the week of 26 billion cubic feet, the EIA
report showed. A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 9.5
percent, the narrowest since Dec. 7, from 11.4 percent the
previous week. Supplies were 21.1 percent below year-earlier
inventories, the widest year-on-year deficit since April 2008.  WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts , said temperatures may
be mostly normal or warmer-than-average in the lower 48 states
from March 31 through April 4. About 50 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating, according to EIA data.  Above Normal  The low in New York on April 3 may be 43 degrees Fahrenheit
(6 Celsius), 2 more than the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania .  Cleveland  may
see 44 degrees, 7 higher than the norm.  Barclays Plc recommends for U.S. natural gas “a short
position in the calendar 2014 versus calendar 2015 average price
spread, which has narrowed significantly in recent weeks as the
front end of the curve has been supported by forecasts for
colder-than-normal weather,” Kevin Norrish, a managing director
at the bank in  London , said in a note to clients today.  The price gap may widen as industrial demand accelerates,
U.S. liquefied natural gas exports commence and exports to
 Mexico  grow, Norrish said. The retirement of coal-fired power
plants will also boost gas consumption, he said.  Price Forecast  The U.S. decreased its outlook for prices in a March 12
report. Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
 Louisiana , will average $3.41 per million Btu this year, lower
than the previous estimate of $3.53, according to the EIA’s
Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The forecast for total gas consumption fell to 70.02
billion cubic feet a day from 70.31 billion in the report.
Rising prices will curtail gas demand from power generators, the
agency said.  Gas output rose to an all-time high of 28.5 trillion cubic
feet in 2011, led by record output from shale deposits, the EIA
said in a report Jan. 7. Shale accounted for 30 percent of total
production in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous year.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 11 months of last year, government
data show. If the trend continued through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
