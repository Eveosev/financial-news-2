Spot gasoline weakened versus
futures for a second day in  Chicago  as refineries  boosted 
processing by the most in 20 months and  area supplies  grew.  Refiners in the Midwest, the PADD 2 region, increased
processing of crude and other feedstock by 272,000 barrels to
3.38 million in the week ended March 15, the  biggest increase 
since July 2011, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
Inventories rose 157,00 barrels to 53.9 million.  The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in Chicago slipped 8.75 cents to 21 cents a gallon below futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:34 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel
 strengthened  1 cent to a premium of 9.50 cents a gallon above
Nymex heating oil futures.  The processing and inventory increases may have been aided
by the scheduled restart of some units at  Marathon Petroleum
Corp. (MPC) â€™s 240,000-barrel-a-day Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery,
which has been in a turnaround since early February, according
to state regulators.  The plant  was to restart a fluid catalytic
cracker and sulfur recovery unit between March 9 and March 11, a
Feb. 6 filing showed.  Shane Pochard, a company spokesman based in Findlay,  Ohio ,
confirmed at the time that the dates provided to state
regulators were correct. He declined today to comment until all
Catlettsburg refinery work is complete.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma ,  declined  $3.54 to $29.01 a
barrel, the lowest level in three weeks, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
