German government bonds pared an
advance as state-run broadcaster CYBC reported Cyprus Popular
Bank Plc will be shut down with proceeds from the sale of good
assets to be returned to depositors.  The rate on 10-year  bunds  was two basis points lower to
1.37 percent at 3:53 p.m. London time, after falling as much as
four basis points to 1.35 percent.  Cyprus’s central bank told CYBC that it hasn’t been
informed or taken such a decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
