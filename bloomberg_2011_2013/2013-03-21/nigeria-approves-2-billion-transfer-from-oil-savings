Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan approved the distribution of $2 billion from oil-
revenue savings to be shared by the country’s 36 states and
federal government.  The funds, which will be distributed within the next two
weeks, will be used to “facilitate various development projects
being executed by the different tiers of government across the
country,” Akwa Ibom state Governor Godwill Akpabio said today
in an e-mail from the capital, Abuja.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, relies on crude
exports for about 95 percent of its foreign-currency earnings
and 80 percent of government revenue, according to the Finance
Ministry. The West African country saves oil revenue above the
budgeted price in the Excess Crude Account to meet spending
shortfalls. The account currently has $7.82 billion, Akpabio
said.  Nigeria’s 36 states shared $1 billion last month from the
oil savings to help them complete projects that have already
been started.  To contact the reporter on this story:
