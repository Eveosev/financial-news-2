Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, said it will miss its
2013 profit target after net income dropped for the  first time 
in four years as a sluggish U.S. economy damped demand.  Li & Fung will “miss the three-year plan,” Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive officer, told reporters in Hong Kong
yesterday. He had set a goal in 2010 of $1.5 billion operating
profit for 2013.  The  supplier  to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Target Corp. (TGT)  gets
about 60 percent of its revenue from the U.S., where an increase
in payroll taxes, higher fuel costs and federal spending cuts
have hurt  consumer confidence . Net income fell 9.4 percent from
a year earlier to $617 million for 2012,  missing the $671
million  average of 17 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Li & Fung gained 1.7 percent to HK$10.74 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong, compared with a 0.5 percent drop in the
benchmark Hang Seng index.  The company booked a $38.9 million operating loss for its
 distribution  unit, which licenses and supplies brands to
retailers. LF USA, the distribution business in the U.S., was
also hurt by higher costs and weaker margins.  “We had issues in the way we operated it, in the way we
managed it,” Rockowitz said of LF USA. The company has changed
management and is working to revive margins at the unit, which
will be profitable this year, he said.  It moved some jobs from New York to Asia last year, he said
in an interview.  Direct Sourcing  The company, which traces its beginnings to 1906 when
parent Li & Fung Group was founded, supplies U.S., European and
Asian retailers with clothes, toys and furniture.  “A lot of focus this year will be on less hiring,”
Rockowitz said, referring to the company’s measures to cut
costs. Li & Fung usually hires 1,000 people a year worldwide, he
said, without specifying how many it will hire in 2013.  The company hasn’t lost customers at the sourcing unit,
with only a “handful” opting to source directly, Rockowitz
said. Its sourcing business for Wal-Mart “is steady,” he said
in an interview. “We haven’t seen any contraction at all.”  Li & Fung has relied on acquisitions to boost growth,
spending about $3 billion on  deals  from 2006 to 2011, including
the  purchase  of Integrated Distribution Services Group Ltd. in
2010, driving up both sales and profit in the five-year period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company “won’t use acquisitions to pad up sales,”
Rockowitz said. It will consider “strategic” deals in Europe,
he said.  The supplier in March last year raised HK$3.9 billion ($502
million) in its biggest share sale since listing in 1992.
Rockowitz in August said the company has the “firepower” to
spend as much as $1 billion on acquisitions.  The company booked a $326 million writeback for 2012
related to acquisitions, according to a presentation following
the earnings statement. The company had said in January that
2012 net income was “unlikely to exceed” the year earlier
profit, without giving a figure.  Core operating profit slumped 42 percent from a year
earlier to $511 million, according to the statement. The decline
dragged  margin , or core operating profit as a percentage of
revenue, down to 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
