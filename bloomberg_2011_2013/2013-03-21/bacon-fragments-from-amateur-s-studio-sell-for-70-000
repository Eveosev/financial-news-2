Francis Bacon  works discovered on
the backs of amateur paintings sold for almost $70,000 today at
an auction in Surrey, southern  England .  The six works, showing background and architectural
elements from what appear to be 1950s “Pope” paintings by
Bacon, were on the reverse of canvases by the little-known
artist Lewis Todd offered by  Ewbank’s  on the second day of a
sale in Guildford.  A top price of 27,544 pounds ($41,000) with fees was paid
by a telephone bidder for a fragment showing the leg of a chair
and a glimpse of ecclesiastical clothing. Concealed beneath a
1958 studio interior by Todd, it had been estimated at 25,000
pounds to 35,000 pounds, based on hammer prices. Three Bacons
were successful, selling for a total of 44,822 pounds.  Some blue background brushstrokes by Bacon fetched a
further 11,268 pounds, again just more than the low estimate.
The group had been valued at as much as 145,000 pounds.  Todd, who died in 2006 at the age of 81, was a caricaturist
for the Cambridge Daily News. After World War II, he was
encouraged to paint by the local artists’ suppliers Heffer, who
also provided materials for Bacon.  Bacon favored painting on the unprimed reverse of canvases.
Heffer provided rejected examples to Todd, who was asked to cut
them up and then painted his own impressionist compositions on
the unused fronts, the auction house said.  Five of the works were confirmed by the  Francis Bacon
Authentication Committee . Paint samples were analyzed by
 Northumbria University  and conform to those used by the artist
in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 2007, Ewbank’s sold a group of rejected and damaged
Bacon paintings retrieved from a skip outside the artist’s
 London  studio by electrician Mac Robertson. Valued at about
50,000 pounds, that collection sold for 1.1 million pounds.  Graff’s Girl  The London jewelry dealer  Laurence Graff  has paid almost a
million pounds for one of the most widely reproduced paintings
of the 1950s and 1960s.  The original canvas of “Chinese Girl” by Vladimir
Tretchikoff, a Russian artist who settled in Cape Town, was
offered by Bonhams in a sale of South African art in London
yesterday. It was bought by Graff for 982,050 pounds with fees,
a record for the artist and almost double the 500,000-pound
upper estimate, based on hammer prices.  The painting will be displayed in the Delaire Graff Estate,
a boutique hotel owned by the jeweler and collector in the
Stellenbosch vineyard region of  South Africa .  More than 500,000 full-size lithographic reproductions of
this 1952 painting of a green-faced Oriental beauty are
estimated to have been sold by the time Tretchikoff died in
2006. It was the biggest-selling print in history, the London-
based auction house said.  The model for the painting was Monika Sing-Lee, who was
spotted by Tretchikoff working in her uncle’s launderette at Sea
Point,  Cape Town . The original canvas was acquired by 16-year-
old Mignon Buhler of  Chicago  in the early 1950s when the artist
was on a promotional tour of the U.S. It has remained in the
same family ever since, Bonhams said.  Muse highlights include  Warwick Thompson  on London theater,
 Jeremy Gerard  on  New York  theater, New York  weekend guide  and
 Lewis Lapham  on history.  To contact the writer on the story:
