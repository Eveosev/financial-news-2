Meritor Savings Bank current
shareholders are the proper recipients of $276 million from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over broken promises that led to
the company’s 1992 seizure, a U.S. appeals court ruled today.  Former shareholder Steven Roth and Interstate Properties
argued that owners of Meritor shares at the time it failed
should be given a share of the money. The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in Washington posted the opinion on its
website.  Meritor, formerly Philadelphia Savings Fund Society,
claimed the government reneged on special accounting treatment
after the FDIC in 1982 asked the company to take over the
failing Western Savings Fund Society. Meritor was seized a
decade later after struggling to absorb Western’s bad loans.  Roth sold his shares after the bank’s failure and said were
he not given a share of the $276 million, it would “lead to a
bizarre outcome in which the shareholders of Meritor who were
injured by the government receive no compensation, while post-
seizure speculators who were never injured are compensated,”
according to the three-judge panel’s opinion.  “Roth easily could have avoided this ‘bizarre outcome’ if
he had simply held onto his shares,” the court ruled.  The case is Slattery v. U.S. 12-5041, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is
Slattery v. USA, 93cv280, U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
