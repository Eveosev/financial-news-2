Canada’s dollar strengthened the
most in a week against its U.S. peer as Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said he plans to eliminate the country’s deficit before
the next election in 2015.  The currency rose earlier as Canadian retail sales gained
in January to recoup some of the previous month’s plunge, a sign
the economy may be recovering, and fewer Americans than forecast
filed for first-time jobless claims. The so-called loonie
climbed against the majority of its most-traded peers after a
report showed services and manufacturing in  Europe  contracted in
March and Standard & Poor’s lowered Cyprus’s long-term sovereign
credit rating to CCC from CCC+ with a negative outlook.  “The government is very clearly trying to show some
restraint from a fiscal-policy perspective, trying to
differentiate Canada from the rest of the Group of 10, at least
in terms of overall fiscal health, which is broadly supportive
for the Canadian dollar,” said Mark Frey, chief market
strategist at Cambridge Mercantile Group, a corporate currency
brokerage, by phone from Victoria, British Columbia.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0252
per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto after gaining as much as
0.6 percent, the most since March 14. One loonie buys 97.54 U.S.
cents.  Canada ’s benchmark  10-year bond  rose, with yields falling
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.81 percent.
The 2.75 percent security maturing in June 2022 gained 44 cents
to C$107.91.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest export, fell 1.2
percent to $92.42. The Standard & Poor’s Index of 500 U.S.
stocks declined 0.8 percent.  Fiscal Forecast  Flaherty’s budget projected Canada will swing to a surplus
of about C$800 million in the fiscal year that begins April
2015, from a C$25.9 billion deficit in the year ending this
month. Spending growth is forecast to average 2.1 percent over
the next five years, after rising about 26 percent, or 4.9
percent a year, since 2007. Revenue is projected to grow an
average 4.6 percent, more than double the current year’s pace,
as Flaherty bets the country’s expansion will pick up steam.  Canadian  retail sales  climbed 1 percent to C$38.9 billion
($38.1 billion), Statistics Canada said in Ottawa, following a
revised drop of 2.3 percent in the prior month, the biggest
since April 2010. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast
a 0.9 percent increase, based on the median of 22 projections.  ‘Early Strength’  “There was probably a little bit of early strength in the
Canadian dollar against the euro on the back of the softer
European economic numbers this morning,” said Matthew Perrier,
director of foreign exchange trading at Bank of Montreal by
phone from Toronto. “The market is waiting to see what happens
over the next couple days with Cyprus.”  Perrier said the U.S. dollar would find support if it sunk
to C$1.0150, where buy orders may be clustered. The loonie
gained 0.3 percent to C$1.3229 per euro today.  The loonie gained as applications for jobless benefits in
the U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, increased by 2,000
to 336,000 in the week ended March 16, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists projected 340,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The monthly average,
which smooths the week-to-week volatility, dropped to the lowest
level since February 2008.  Canada’s dollar advanced 0.3 percent yesterday after the
U.S. Federal Reserve led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said it
will keep buying bonds at a pace of $85 billion a month to spur
growth and reduce unemployment. Policy makers said they plan to
hold the target interest rate near zero as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5 percent and inflation is projected to be no
more than 2.5 percent.  ‘Status Quo’  “The overriding factor is the Fed looking like it’s
remaining status quo and it looks like people will be selling
U.S. dollars,” said John Curran, a senior vice president at
CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer, by phone
from Toronto.  Curran said there would be “demand to buy U.S. against
Canada if we get down to the C$1.0180 area, C$1.0150 to
C$1.0180.”  The loonie lost ground against the currencies of fellow
commodity-exporting countries, falling as much as 1.3 percent
against the New Zealand dollar to 85.25 Canadian cents, its most
since Dec. 2011. The loonie declined as much as 0.5 percent
against the Australian dollar to 93.44 Canadian cents.  The loonie has gained 0.8 percent in the past month against
nine developed nation peers tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar is up 1.1 percent, the euro is
down 1.4 percent and the yen has dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
