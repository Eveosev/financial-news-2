Chinese stocks  rose, extending the
biggest one-day gain in two months, as a private survey showed
manufacturing is expanding at a faster pace in March.  FAW Car Co. (000800)  gained 3.2 percent after rallying by the daily
10 percent limit yesterday. Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and
 GoerTek Inc. (002241)  led an advance by technology companies. The
preliminary reading of a Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to
51.7, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said, quicker than
both last month’s 50.4 final reading and the 50.8 median
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.3 percent to 2,324.24
at the close. The CSI 300 Index climbed 0.2 percent to 2,614.99.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  fell 0.4 percent in  Hong
Kong . The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  rose 2.2 percent in New
York yesterday.  “The data shows the economy is on a recovery path,” said
Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co.,
which oversees $285 million. “But there’s still concern over
the strength of the recovery.”  The Shanghai index has dropped 4.5 percent from its Feb. 6
peak on concern that an economic recovery will falter as
officials take steps to cool the property market and counter
risks for banks from an expansion in credit. The gauge jumped
2.7 percent yesterday as Market Studies LLC’s Tom DeMark said
the equity index will resume a rally to gain as much as 28
percent by September.  Trading volumes  Thirty-day  volatility  in the benchmark stock index rose to
the highest level since February 2012 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge is valued at 9.5 times
projected 12-month earnings, compared with the seven-year
average of 15.8, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Trading volumes were 0.5 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “The Chinese economy is still on track” for a “gradual
growth recovery,”  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist for HSBC in
Hong Kong, said in a statement. “Inflation remains well
behaved, leaving room for Beijing to keep policy relatively
accommodative.”  Growth in consumer prices may ease to 2.5 percent in March
from a year earlier as production costs are likely to fall, the
China Securities Journal reported today, citing  Liu Yuhui , a
researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Inflation
accelerated to 3.2 percent last month.  FAW Car climbed 3.2 percent to 8.61 yuan. More than 10
Chinese provinces and central government departments procured
“large batches” of the parent’s Red Flag H7 cars, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported March 19, citing Xu Xianping, its
general manager.  A  measure  of technology stocks in the CSI 300 advanced 2.9
percent, the most among the 10 industry groups. Zhejiang Dahua,
which makes security surveillance equipment, advanced 7.2
percent to 67.15  yuan , a record-high close. GoerTek, a supplier
of Apple Inc., jumped 5 percent to 49.32 yuan.  Technology shares will rise this year as spending in the
industry increases, Zhou Liqian, an analyst at Everbright
Securities Co., said in a phone interview today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
