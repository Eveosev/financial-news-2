Norway ’s NVE regulator approved
Statkraft AS’s osmotic pilot project, the first in the world to
attempt to derive energy from the difference in the salt
concentration between sea water and river water.  Construction of the 2-megawatt pilot project will take two
years. The plant will be located in Sunndalsoera in central
Norway. Statkraft had announced the project plans last year.  IDE Technologies Ltd., an Israeli water technology
developer, said last month it planned to work with Statkraft to
design the plant. Osmotic energy technology, used by Statkraft
at a prototype facility in Tofte, Norway, enables clean-power
production anyplace where rivers and lakes meet the sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
