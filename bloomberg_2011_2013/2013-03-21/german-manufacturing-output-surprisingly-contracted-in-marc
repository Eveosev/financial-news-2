German manufacturing output
surprisingly contracted in March.  A German index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  in
the manufacturing industry declined to 48.9 this month from 50.3
in February, while a services gauge fell to 51.6 from 54.7,
London-based Markit Economics said in an e-mailed report today.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists had
forecast a reading of 50.5 for the  manufacturing index  and 55.0
for the  services gauge , according to the median estimates in
Bloomberg News surveys.  The Bundesbank predicts the German economy will expand in
the current quarter after contracting 0.6 percent in the final
three months of last year. Still, political turmoil in  Italy  and
the specter of a bank run in Cyprus are spooking financial
markets and threatening to derail an economic recovery in the
euro area,  Germany ’s biggest export market.  “Germany looks set for a return to growth over the first
quarter of 2013, but there are risks that the recovery will have
subsided appreciably by the time GDP data arrives to herald an
upturn at the start of the year,” Tim Moore, senior economist
at Markit, said in the report. “Moreover, the loss of output
growth momentum over the month in March was the greatest since
the PMI surveys flagged up a rapid slowdown around the middle of
2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
