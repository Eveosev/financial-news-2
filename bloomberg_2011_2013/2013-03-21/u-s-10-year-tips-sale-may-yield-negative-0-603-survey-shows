The government’s $13 billion
auction of 10-year inflation-indexed notes may draw a yield of
negative 0.603 percent, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of nine of the Federal Reserve’s 21
primary dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which mature
in January 2023, yielded negative 0.610 percent in trading
before the auction. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $15 billion sale on
Jan. 24, drew a yield of negative 0.63 percent, the seventh
consecutive time an auction of the securities yielded less than
zero. The record auction low of negative 0.75 percent was
reached on Sept. 20.  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  The January sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.71,
versus an average of 2.68 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a category of investor that includes
foreign central banks, bought 53.3 percent of the securities at
the January auction, compared with 48.3 percent at the November
sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 43.5 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 11.3 percent of
the notes at the last sale, versus 10.4 percent in November and
an average of 15.6 percent at the past 10 auctions.  TIPS Returns  U.S. inflation-linked debt maturing in 10 or more years
returned 11.8 percent last year, compared with a 7.3 percent
gain in the broader TIPS market and a 2.2 percent advance in the
overall Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  This year, longer-term inflation-protected Treasuries have
lost 3 percent, while all TIPS have fallen 1 percent. That
compares with a negative 0.6 percent for regular U.S. government
debt, the indexes show.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
