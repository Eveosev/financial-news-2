LeBron James scored 25 points to
help the Miami Heat overcome a 27-point third-quarter deficit
and extend the team’s winning streak to 24 games with a 98-95
victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers.  The Heat are within nine games of matching the National
Basketball Association win-streak record of 33 held by the 1971-
72 Los Angeles Lakers.  The  New York  Knicks won to stay one game ahead of the
Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic division. The
Nets also won last night.  The Heat, trailing 67-40 with seven minutes, 43 seconds
left in the third quarter, started a rally to overtake the
Cavaliers at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.  James, who also recorded 12 rebounds and 10 assists in his
fourth game back in Cleveland since he left in 2010, hit a 3-
pointer with 9:40 left in the game to give the Heat an 80-79
advantage.  Mario Chalmers had 17 points and Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade
and Shane Battier each added 11 points for the Heat, who have
the NBA’s best record at 53-14.  Wayne Ellington scored 20 points, Tristan Thompson had 18
and Shaun Livingston contributed 14 for the Cavaliers (22-46).
Cleveland was playing without its top three scorers -- All-Star
guard Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters and Anderson Varejao.  The Knicks (40-26), led by reserve J.R. Smith’s 22 points,
won 106-94 at home against the Orlando Magic. The Nets (40-28)
defeated the host Dallas Mavericks 113-96.  Carmelo Anthony scored 21 points in his return from a
three-game injury absence, and Kenyon Martin added 11 for the
Knicks. Tobias Harris and Andrew Nicholson each contributed 14
points and Beno Udrih added 13 points for the Magic (18-51).  At the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Brook Lopez had
38 points and 11 rebounds and Deron Williams added 31 points for
the Nets. Dirk Nowitzki scored 16 points and Chris Kaman added
14 for the Mavericks (32-36).  To contact the reporter on this story:
