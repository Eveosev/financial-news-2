Orascom Construction  Industries
gained the most in more than three months on speculation that a
possible tax settlement would pave the way for regulatory
approval of a tender offer for the shares.  Shares of Egypt’s biggest publicly traded company climbed
3.5 percent, the most since Dec. 16, to 238.27 Egyptian pounds
at the close in Cairo, trimming the stock’s quarterly decline to
5.6 percent. Orascom Construction, or OCI, was the biggest
gainer on the benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) , which rose 1.2 percent.  The Egyptian Tax Authority will study an offer from OCI to
settle a tax dispute for 7 billion pounds ($1 billion), Ahmed
Abdel Rahman, head of the authority’s tax-evasion unit, said in
a phone interview today. The settlement could help OCI secure
regulatory approval for a transaction to transfer its Cairo-
listed shares to NYSE Euronext Amsterdam, according to analysts
including Hassan Kenawi, equities trader at Cairo-based HC
Brokerage.  “Investors are speculating a settlement will help the
tender offer go through,” Kenawi said by phone. “But there’s
still a lot of uncertainty about how such an offer, if it’s
accepted by the government, will affect tender offer price, and
when it might take place.”  Omar Darwazah, OCI’s head of investor relations, declined
to comment on negotiations with  Egypt ’s tax authorities. The
government claims OCI owes 14 billion pounds of back taxes
related to the 2007 sale of its cement business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
