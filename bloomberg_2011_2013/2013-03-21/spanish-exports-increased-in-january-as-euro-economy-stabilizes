Spanish  exports  rose for the first
time in three months in January, suggesting that foreign trade
will cushion a recession in the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy.  Exports increased to 17.9 billion euros ($23.1 billion)
from 17.8 billion euros in December, the  Economy Ministry  said
in an e-mailed statement. Exports rose 7.9 percent from a year
earlier.  Business confidence in Spain increased for a sixth month in
February, even as the economy remains mired in recession, and
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  signaled this week that he may cut
his forecast for an economic contraction of 0.5 percent in 2013.
The euro area, Spain’s largest export market, is already
stabilizing and the recovery the  European Central Bank  predicts
for the second half of the year should also support the Spanish
economy.  Spain is waiting for the European Commission to propose new
deficit targets before presenting an updated budget plan through
2014. The goals are currently 4.5 percent of gross domestic
product for 2013 and 2.8 percent for next year. That compares
with a shortfall of 9.99 percent in 2012, or 6.74 excluding
European aid for the country’s banking sector.  The nation’s  trade deficit  in January narrowed 4.3 percent
from a year ago to 3.5 billion euros, as imports rose 5.7
percent. The commission said on Feb. 22 that net exports are the
only source of growth on the horizon for  Spain  as it predicted a
4.2 percent increase in foreign sales this year after 3.1
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
