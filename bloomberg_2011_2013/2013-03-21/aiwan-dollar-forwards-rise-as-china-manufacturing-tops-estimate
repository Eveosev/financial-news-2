Taiwan dollar  forwards gained as a
report showing Chinese manufacturing improved by more than
economists estimated brightened the island’s export outlook.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was 51.7 in March,
compared with the median estimate of 50.8 in a Bloomberg survey
and 50.4 in February, according to a preliminary reading
published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. China
is Taiwan’s biggest export market. In the five months since
President Ma Ying-jeou cut taxes, the island’s tycoons have
pledged $5.9 billion in local investment proposals, triple the
amount in 2011, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  “The PMI data shows a broad-based improvement including
new orders, output and export orders, so it’s bullish sign,”
said Jackit Wong, a regional economist in  Hong Kong  at Natixis
Asia Ltd. “Taiwan stands to gain most by trade ties.”  Three-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.2 percent to
NT$29.693 per dollar as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The local dollar rose 0.2 percent to
NT$29.789, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  Three-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
3.73 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 was steady at 1.31 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed
at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
