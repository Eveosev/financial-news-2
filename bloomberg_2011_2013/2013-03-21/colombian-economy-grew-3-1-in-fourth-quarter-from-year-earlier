Colombia’s economy grew more than
forecast by the central bank last year on a fourth-quarter
rebound in construction, reducing the odds of a fifth straight
interest rate cut tomorrow. Bond yields rose.  Gross domestic product expanded 4 percent in 2012, the
national statistics agency said in Bogota, compared with the
central bank forecast of 3.3 percent to 3.9 percent. The economy
grew 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
exceeding the median forecast of 3 percent of 30 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  “This was higher than the central bank expected,” said
 Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota. “This reduces
the probability of a rate cut tomorrow from about 95 percent to
about 70 percent.”  Policy makers have cut the  benchmark interest rate  six
times since June, to the lowest in the region, citing slowing
growth, a weak global economy and cooling inflation. The central
bank has repeatedly said that the economy is expanding below its
potential, after it slowed from revised growth of 6.6 percent in
2011. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said March 5 that the
economy can grow 4.8 percent a year without stoking inflation.  Colombia’s 2012 growth compares with 5.6 percent in  Chile ,
and 0.9 percent in  Brazil .  The yield on government peso bonds due May 2014 rose 15
basis points to 3.95 percent at 11:53 a.m. in Bogota. The peso
weakened 0.1 percent to 1,820.78 per U.S. dollar.  Construction Boom  The lowest inflation rate in six decades frees policy
makers to concentrate on boosting growth, Cardenas said this
month.  The economy grew 1.8 percent from the previous quarter, led
by a 10.6 percent increase in construction activity, and a 2.6
percent increase in mining. Construction contracted 9 percent
percent in the third quarter, while mining contracted 1.6
percent.  Banco de la Republica will cut its policy rate a quarter
point at its March policy meeting tomorrow, to 3.5 percent,
according to 28 of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Three
forecast the central will keep borrowing costs unchanged. If
they cut rates, policy makers will then probably hold the rate
at 3.5 percent until the end of the year, Perez said.  Annual  inflation  slowed to 1.83 percent last month, its
lowest level since 1955, and outside the 2 percent to 4 percent
target range. Cardenas said yesterday he hopes the central bank
will continue to reduce rates.  Exports grew 6 percent to $61 billion last year, compared
with growth of 43 percent in 2011. The central bank has cited
lower export growth in its decisions to cut interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
