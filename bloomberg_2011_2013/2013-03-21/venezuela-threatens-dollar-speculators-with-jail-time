Venezuela  acting President  Nicolas Maduro  said today that the South American country is
investigating cases of foreign exchange corruption and
threatened “speculators” with jail time.  “We’re investigating, and we’re going to pursue them,”
Maduro said on state television. “We hope to have those
responsible for dollar speculation soon. We want to see them in
prison.”  A shortage of dollars in Venezuela has deepened since
February, when former President  Hugo Chavez  approved a 32
percent devaluation and shut down a separate central bank-
administered  currency market . While the government sells dollars
for priority imports at 6.3 bolivars, those who can’t access the
system pay as much as 24 bolivars per dollar on the black
market, according to Dolar Today, a website that tracks the
 exchange rate  on the Venezuelan border with Colombia.  Venezuela on March 19 announced a “complementary” foreign
exchange system that will auction dollars to importers and is
studying the inclusion of small businesses and individuals with
travel emergencies, Maduro said. The country’s official currency
board, known as Cadivi, is meeting almost 95 percent of the
economy’s need for dollars, he added.  “The new system was created to guarantee another way for
those who go to the streets looking for dollars and encounter a
stampede of the parasitic bourgeoisies who sell them a dollar
for 20 or 25 bolivars,” Maduro said. “We’re going to defeat
the parallel dollar.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
