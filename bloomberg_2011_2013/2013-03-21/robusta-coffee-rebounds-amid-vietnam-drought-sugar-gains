Robusta coffee rebounded in London
on speculation prices that fell for three consecutive sessions
dropped too far amid a drought that may cut output in  Vietnam ,
the world’s largest producer of the variety. Sugar gained.  Robusta coffee futures fell to $2,152 a metric ton
yesterday as rain fell over growing areas in Vietnam. That was
the lowest close for a most active contract since March 6.
Showers and thunderstorms will be scattered across the country
through tomorrow, bringing 0.1-0.4 inch of rain, according to
forecaster AccuWeather. Dry weather in Vietnam earlier this year
may cut output next season by as much as 30 percent to 1 million
tons, according to the median of eight trader and shipper
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “There were some small rains in the coffee areas,” Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive officer at trading company NC Group
Ltd., which has offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, said in an
e-mail today, adding that the “threat of drought” was still
there. The “domestic price eased off a little bit.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in May gained 0.7 percent to

Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said March 5.  Coffee prices in Vietnam fell to 43,900 dong ($2.10) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) yesterday,  data  from the Daklak Trade &
Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed. That is down from 45,500
