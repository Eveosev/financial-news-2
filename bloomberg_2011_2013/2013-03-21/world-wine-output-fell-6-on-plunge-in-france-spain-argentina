World wine production dropped 6
percent in 2012 to the lowest level in at least 37 years on
smaller grape crops in  France , Spain and  Argentina , according to
the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, or OIV.  Output fell to 250.9 million hectoliters (6.63 billion
gallons) from 266.8 million hectoliters in 2011, the OIV wrote
in documents handed out to reporters in Paris today. That beat
an October outlook for production of 248.2 million hectoliters.  Bulk white-wine prices in France, the world’s largest
producer, jumped 45 percent since the start of August, while
those for bulk reds advanced 17 percent,  data  from crop office
FranceAgriMer show.  “We’re starting to dip into stocks to meet the needs,”
Federico Castellucci, the OIV’s director general, said at
today’s meeting. “In a time of shortage there is less bulk
available. It’s starting to create tension in the market.”  France,  Spain ,  Italy  and Argentina all suffered weather
damage to their vineyards last year, including hail and drought.
Last year’s production was the lowest in OIV records going to
back to 1975.  French wine production fell 17 percent to 42.2 million
hectoliters last year from 50.8 million hectoliters in 2011,
according to the OIV. In Italy, output dropped 6.3 percent to
40.1 million hectoliters and in Spain the decline was 11 percent
to 29.7 million hectoliters, the group’s data show.  Wine output in Argentina slumped 24 percent to 11.8 million
hectoliters, based on OIV data. In the U.S., production
increased 6.9 percent to 20.5 million hectoliters.  World wine consumption in 2012 was 245.2 million
hectoliters, climbing from 243.8 million hectoliters in 2011,
according to the OIV. The wine organization estimates an
additional 28 million to 30 million hectoliters of wine is used
to make spirits, vermouth and vinegar.  The world faces a wine shortage of at least 10 million
hectoliters, the equivalent of 1.3 billion bottles, Bertrand
Girard, chief executive officer of Groupe Val d’Orbieu, France’s
biggest wine cooperative, said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
