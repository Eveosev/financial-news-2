Gonzaga University defeated
Southern University 64-58, using an 8-2 scoring run in the
closing minutes to avoid becoming the first No. 1 regional seed
to ever lose to a 16th seed at the men’s college basketball
national tournament.  The University of Louisville, the top seed in the Midwest
region, had an easier time, routing North Carolina A&T 79-48 in
its opening game. Marquette, Wichita State, Butler, Michigan
State,  Saint Louis ,  Memphis , Michigan,  Arizona ,  California ,
 Oregon , Virginia Commonwealth and Colorado State also won today
as the first full round of tournament play began at four
regional sites around the U.S.  No. 1 regional seeds are now 114-0 against 16th seeds since
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament field
expanded in 1985. Gonzaga had been tied 56-56 against the
Southwestern Athletic Conference champions with 3 1/2 minutes
remaining. Southern’s six-point loss was the closest by a 16
seed against a No. 1 since 1996, when Western Carolina lost by
two against Purdue.  “Southern was a heck of a basketball team,” Gonzaga coach
Mark Few, whose team is the top seed in the West region, said in
a televised interview. “The more I watched tape on them, the
more I kept saying, ‘Uh oh.’ They were a handful.”  Gonzaga (32-2) advanced to face ninth-seeded Wichita State,
which topped No. 8 Pittsburgh 73-55 in the Panthers’ final game
as a member of the Big East conference. Pittsburgh joins the
Atlantic Coast Conference next season.  Louisville Rolls  Louisville never trailed in its rout of 16th-seeded North
Carolina A&T, forcing 25 turnovers and shooting 56 percent in
Lexington,  Kentucky . Russ Smith had 23 points and seven steals
for the Cardinals (30-5), who next play No. 8 Colorado State,
which defeated ninth-seeded Missouri 84-72.  Marquette, the No. 3 seed in the East region, erased a
seven-point deficit in the final two minutes to pull out a 59-58
win against Davidson College. The Golden Eagles hit three
straight 3-pointers after missing 11 of their first 12 attempts
and got a driving layup from junior guard Vander Blue with one
second left to pull out the victory.  Marquette moves on to face No. 6 seed Butler, which beat
No. 11 Bucknell 68-56 by outscoring the Bison 37-19 over the
final 10 minutes in Lexington.  Wichita State got its first NCAA tournament win since 2006
as senior guard Malcolm Armstead led all scorers in the Salt
Lake City matchup with 22 points. The Shockers limited
Pittsburgh to 35 percent shooting, including one 3-pointer in 17
attempts.  Spartans Advance  Michigan  State, the third seed in the Midwest, defeated
Valparaiso 65-54 behind a 23-point, 15-rebound effort from
Derrick Nix. The Spartans led by as many as 27 points in  Auburn
Hills , Michigan, and will next face No. 6 Memphis.  Memphis survived a last-second 3-point attempt by 11th-
seeded Saint Mary’s to win 54-52.  Saint Louis, the No. 4 seed in the Midwest, topped 13th-
seeded New Mexico State 64-44. The Billikens next face 12th-
seeded Oregon, which beat No. 5 Oklahoma State 68-55 in the
first significant upset in the round of 64.  Fellow Pac-12 conference member California, the 12th seed
in the East, followed with a 64-61 win against No. 5 Nevada Las
Vegas. At least one No. 12 seed has now beaten a fifth seed for
six straight years and 12 of the past 13. The winner of
tonight’s game between No. 4 seed Syracuse and No. 13 seed
 Montana  will play California in the next round.  Michigan Cruises  Michigan, which is seeded fourth in the South region,
cruised past No. 13 South Dakota State 71-56 as Tim Hardaway Jr.
and Glenn Robinson III each scored 21 points. Next up for the
Wolverines is No. 5 Virginia Commonwealth, which routed 12th-
seeded Akron 88-42 in the most lopsided game of the day.  West No. 6 seed Arizona beat No. 11 Belmont 81-64 to drop
the Bruins to 0-6 all-time in NCAA tournament games. Mark Lyons
scored 23 points to lead the Wildcats, who will play the winner
of tonight’s West regional game between third-seeded New Mexico
and No. 14 seed Harvard.  The NCAA championship game is April 8 in Atlanta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
