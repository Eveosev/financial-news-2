Supplies of arabica coffee, favored
by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , will trail demand by 1 million bags in the
season starting in October in most countries, the biggest
shortage since 2009-10, Rabobank International said.  The shortage, following a surplus of 6.6 million bags in
the current season, is partly due to higher consumption and
falling production in Central America and Mexico due to leaf
rust disease known as roya, Rabobank said in a report e-mailed
today. Demand for the more expensive beans will climb because of
lower prices and a smaller premium to the robusta variety, used
in instant coffee and espresso, it said.  “The 2013-14 arabica supply and demand outlook point to
tighter fundamentals due to lower off season yields and higher
demand,” Keith Flury, an analyst at the bank in  London , wrote
in the report. “The worst case of roya in Central America and
Mexico since 1976 is expected to reduce production,” he said.  Arabica coffee fell 37 percent last year, making it the
worst performing commodity in the  Standard & Poor’s  gauge of 24
raw materials. Futures are down 6.9 percent this year, heading
for a third annual decline, the longest slump since 1993.
Arabica’s  premium  over robusta fell to 34.1 cents a pound today,
the lowest since December 2008.  “The reduced arbitrage between robusta and arabica prices
should support arabica consumption, stopping the shift from
arabica to robusta in blends,” he said. Roasters have increased
robusta usage in blends in the past two years.  Central America  Coffee output in Central America and  Mexico  will fall 14
percent in 2013-14 after declining 4 percent this season, the
bank forecast. That is equal to 3.3 million bags, according to
the report. Farmers will shift to other crops because of lower
arabica prices, and higher costs to fight leaf rust, he said.  Output in Central America and Mexico is falling at the same
time the Brazilian government may help growers store beans,
resulting in falling  stockpiles  in warehouses monitored by ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , according to Rabobank. That will help
support prices, Flury said. Futures will average $1.65 a pound
in the fourth quarter, 24 percent more than now.  Robusta coffee demand will be 300,000 bags bigger than
supplies in 2013-14, according to the bank. Consumption of the
cheaper beans will remain a function of consumption in  emerging
markets , Flury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
