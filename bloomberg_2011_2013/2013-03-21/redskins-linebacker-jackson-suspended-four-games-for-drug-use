Washington Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson was suspended for four games without pay for violating
the  National Football League ’s substance-abuse policy.  Jackson, 27, will miss the first four games of the 2013
season, Randall Liu, an NFL spokesman, said today in an e-mail.
Liu didn’t specify what drug was found.  A seventh-round pick by the Redskins in 2008, Jackson had a
career-high 37 tackles and 4 1/2 sacks last year. He’s played 42
games in his five-year career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
