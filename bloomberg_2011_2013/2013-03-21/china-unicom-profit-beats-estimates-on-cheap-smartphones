China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, posted fourth-
quarter profit that beat analyst estimates as it boosted users
through low-priced smartphones and reduced subsidies.  Net income  rose to 1.64 billion  yuan  ($264 million), from
14 million yuan a year earlier, based on figures derived from
12-month earnings the Beijing-based company reported yesterday.
Profit surpassed the 1.41 billion-yuan average of eight  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman Chang Xiaobing pared costs by luring new
smartphone subscribers with low-cost devices priced at 1,000
yuan or less after the company lost its advantage as the only
Chinese carrier to offer  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone with a service
plan. The greater variety of devices has helped Unicom close the
gap with larger  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , which operates a third-
generation service that isn’t compatible with popular handsets
like the iPhone. China Telecom Corp. started offering subsidized
Apple handsets last March to gain share.  “The handset subsidies were much less than expected even
though they launched iPhone 5 last quarter,” said Ricky Lai, an
analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd. in Hong
Kong, who cited his estimate of 7.5 billion yuan in subsidies
for the full year compared with the company’s 6.1 billion yuan
figure. “We expected handset subsidies would be much higher
when they started sales of the new iPhone.”  China Unicom said yesterday that 3G handset subsidies as a
percentage of service revenue were cut to 10 percent last year,
from 18 percent in 2011.  Revenue Gains  Revenue rose 20 percent to 63.7 billion yuan in the fourth
quarter. That compares with the 65.5 billion-yuan average of
analyst  estimates .  Unicom rose 3.7 percent to HK$10.74 at 9:57 a.m. in Hong
Kong trading, poised for the largest gain since Aug. 23. The
stock has dropped 18 percent in the past year, compared with a 6
percent advance for the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Unicom had 76.5 million 3G subscribers at the end of
December, lagging behind the 87.9 million for market leader
China Mobile, according to data the companies released in
January. The smaller operator, which also offers fixed-line
broadband Internet services, had a mobile customer base of 239.3
million, or 34 percent of China Mobile’s 710.3 million.  China Mobile on March 14 reported fourth-quarter  net income 
climbed 6.1 percent to 36 billion yuan, beating analyst
estimates. China Telecom on March 20 reported profit that
surpassed analyst estimates as customers using the iPhone helped
boost sales of wireless data.  “China Unicom is the most competitive one among the three
operators,” Tony Yang, an analyst at BOCI Research Ltd. in  Hong
Kong , wrote in a note to clients on March 20. “China Unicom’s
3G advantage will last till mid-2014,” when its 3G subscriber
base will reach 150 million to 200 million, he wrote.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
