(Corrects prices received in seventh paragraph.)  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region unexpectedly expanded in March, reflecting a pickup in
orders and factory employment.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
 index  rose to 2 from minus 12.5 February. Readings greater than
zero signal expansion in the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania ,
southern  New Jersey  and  Delaware . The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increased to
minus 3.  The data follow a  report  last week showing expansion at
factories in the  New York  region and more optimism from industry
managers. Gains in housing and auto sales at the same time
businesses rebuild  inventories  are leading to increased
production, indicating manufacturing is a source of strength for
the economy.  Estimates of the 55 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from minus 8 to 8.5.  The Philadelphia Fed’s new orders measure climbed to 0.5
from minus 7.8 in February, while shipments increased to 3.5
from 2.4. The inventory index advanced to zero from minus 10.  An index of employment index increased to 2.7 from 0.9.  The measure of prices paid eased to 8.5 in March from 8.9
the prior month while the index of prices received decreased to
minus 0.8 from minus 0.5.  Economists monitor the Fed’s regional surveys for clues
about the Institute for Supply Management national figures on
manufacturing. The next ISM  report  is due March 1. Manufacturing
makes up about 12 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
