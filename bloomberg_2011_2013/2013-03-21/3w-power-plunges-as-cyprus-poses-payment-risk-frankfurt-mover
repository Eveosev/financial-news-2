3W Power SA fell the most ever
after saying the banking  crisis in Cyprus  may damage a key
client’s ability to pay what it owes the company’s  AEG Power
Solutions BV  energy control-systems division.  3W Power dropped as much as 51 percent and traded down 47
percent at 61 cents at 11:54 a.m. in Frankfurt. That reduced 3W
Power’s market value to 33.5 million euros ($43.3 million).
Volume was almost 32 times the three-month daily average. The
company’s stock started trading in July 2008.  The company, which reported a 16 percent drop in AEG’s
fourth-quarter order backlog and an 82 percent plunge in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
postponed the publication of its annual report. The board needs
more time to prepare the forecast and risk sections amid payment
delays from an undisclosed European customer, Luxembourg-based
3W Power said in a statement late yesterday.  The delays “have been exacerbated by the current banking
situation in Cyprus,” 3W Power said. Failure to collect the
money owed from the client, which centralizes procurement
through a Cyprus subsidiary and which contributes more than one-
third of AEG’s receivables, “could present significant
financial difficulties for the company.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
