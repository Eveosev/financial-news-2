Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in almost a month on speculation that an increase in
exports from  Malaysia  and a decline in output will reduce
inventories in the world’s largest producer after Indonesia.  The contract for delivery in June advanced 0.5 percent to
2,455 ringgit ($786) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price at close for the most-active
contract since Feb. 25.  Exports from Malaysia gained 14 percent to 922,987 tons in
the first 20 days of this month from the same period in
February, Societe Generale de Surveillance said yesterday.
Inventories dropped 7.2 percent to 2.44 million tons in February
from an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December,
according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “Exports are encouraging and that’s quite positive,” said
Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. “We are
still supposed to be going through a low-production period, so
hopefully we can see stockpiles drop a bit sharper in March.”  Output, which is the lowest in the first two months of the
year, may drop this month as well due to a change in the
cropping pattern, Tan said. Production slumped 19 percent to 1.3
million tons last month, palm oil board data show.  Soybean oil  for May delivery climbed 0.8 percent to 50.24
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May gained 0.8 percent to $14.31 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery advanced 1.1
percent to close at 6,412  yuan  ($1,032) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil rose 0.6 percent to end at 8,146
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
