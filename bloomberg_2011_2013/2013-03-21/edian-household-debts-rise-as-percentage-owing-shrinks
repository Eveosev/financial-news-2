The percentage of U.S. households
in debt shrank over a decade, even while the median amount owed
shot to $70,000, the  Census Bureau reported  today.  Almost three-quarters of American households reported
holding some form of debt in 2000. Eleven years later, the share
had fallen to 69 percent in the wake of the worst economic
downturn since the Great Depression, the first drop in median
household debt in more than a decade.  The Census Bureau report underscores the fragile nature of
the  U.S. economy  and  household income , which has remained
stagnant for a generation.  “Wealth and debt are important bellwethers of household
financial security and prospects in the  United States ,” the
Census Bureau wrote in a  blog post . Debt, the government said,
“is often used by households in times of economic prosperity to
finance large purchases -- such as a home or a vehicle -- or to
pay for a household member’s education.”  The percentage of American households holding any type of
debt peaked in 2002 at 75 percent and has been declining
steadily. The total median  household debt  hit its high of
$74,619 in 2010, the Census Bureau said.  Even after the 2008 financial crisis, median secured debt,
which includes real estate and  auto loans , rose to $91,000 in
2011, a 30.5 percent increase from the median $69,749 amount
owed in 2000.  Biggest Borrowers  The largest amounts of secured debt were held by American
households led by people between 35 and 44 years old, the Census
Bureau said. The typical secured debt for those households in
2011 was $128,500, a 31.2 percent increase from the $97,917
typically owed in 2000.  Americans 35 to 44 years old had the highest percentage of
households in debt, with 79.6 percent reporting they owed money
to someone. Only 44.4 percent of households led by people older
than 65 said they were in debt.  Households led by people younger than 35 owed the most
unsecured debt in 2011, with a median $9,700 tab. The bill
represented a 57.2 percent increase over the median $6,170 owed
in 2000.  Unsecured debt, which includes credit cards and  student
loans , rose for all U.S. households to $7,000, a 30.5 percent
increase from the $5,365 median tab registered in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
