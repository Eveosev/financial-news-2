Hungary’s borrowing costs rose at a
bond auction on speculation the central bank and the government
may use unconventional methods to boost the economy amid a
deepening  European debt crisis . The forint weakened.  The Debt Management Agency raised 60 billion forint ($254
million) in debt maturing in 2016, 2018, 2023 at today’s sale,
15 billion forint more than planned. The issuance included 15
billion forint in bonds due 2023 at an average yield of 6.44
percent, compared with a rate of 6.3 percent at the last auction
two weeks ago. Financing costs also rose for the two other
maturities. The forint slid 0.1 percent to 305.35 per euro by
12:47 p.m. in Budapest.  The currency slumped 3.3 percent this month and yields on
longer-dated Hungarian debt advanced after Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban  called for lower  interest rates  and pledged measures to
help foreign-currency debtors. Former economy minister  Gyorgy
Matolcsy , who Orban picked this month to lead the central bank,
said he will do more than his predecessor Andras Simor to
support economic growth, while turmoil in Cyprus cut demand for
riskier assets.  “Uncertainty regarding monetary policy and potential
further measures on foreign currency loans, and to a lesser
extent the impact from Cyprus lifted yields compared with two
weeks ago,” Sandor Jobbagy, a Budapest-based analyst at CIB
Bank Zrt., a unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , wrote by e-mail on the
auction.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which reduced its benchmark rate
in seven consecutive steps to 5.25 percent by last month,
matching a record low, may trim an additional 25 basis points on
March 26, according to 15 out of 19 analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg. Three economists expect a 50 basis-point cut and one
projects no change.  The debt agency sold three-month Treasury bills at an
average yield of 4.79 percent on March 19, the lowest on record,
as traders wagered on further rate cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
