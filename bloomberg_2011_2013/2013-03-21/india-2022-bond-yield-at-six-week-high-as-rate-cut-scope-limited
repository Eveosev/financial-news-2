The yield on India’s 2022 bonds
rose to a six-week high on speculation accelerating inflation
gives the central bank less room to reduce borrowing costs.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered its  repurchase rate  to
7.50 percent from 7.75 percent on March 19 and said high food
costs are “exacerbating the challenge for monetary management
in anchoring inflationary expectations.” Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam, one of nine partners in the ruling alliance, said the
same day it would stop supporting the government over its
approach to alleged  war crimes  in Sri Lanka, leaving Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  more reliant on regional parties.  “The central bank seems to have cut rates reluctantly as
inflation is still a concern,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a
fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.
“The prevailing political uncertainty also raises questions
about fiscal consolidation.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose one
basis point to 7.94 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the highest level since Feb. 4.  Wholesale-price inflation  unexpectedly accelerated to 6.84
percent in February from a year earlier, while  consumer prices 
rose 10.91 percent, official data show. Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram vowed last month to cut the fiscal
deficit to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year
beginning April 1, from 5.2 percent this year.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.56 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
