Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , owner of the Paramount
film studios and cable networks such as Nickelodeon and MTV, is
adding TV journalist Deborah Norville and  World Economic Forum 
adviser Cristiana Falcone Sorrell to its board.  The changes will increase the size of the board to 13
members from 11, the company said today in a statement.
Norville, 54, is the anchor of “Inside Edition,” a syndicated
news show. Falcone Sorrell, 40, is the wife of  WPP Plc (WPP)  Chief 
Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  and serves as a senior 
adviser  to the chairman of the World Economic Forum, a group 
known for its Davos summit of world leaders.  “Cristiana’s experience across global economies and her
track record of launching innovative development campaigns and
Deborah’s depth of knowledge based on her exceptional career in
the media industry will provide important ongoing guidance and
perspective,”  Sumner Redstone , executive chairman of New York-
based Viacom, said in the statement.  Viacom’s governance committee is continually evaluating
candidates and seeking to improve diversity, said Mark Jafar, a
spokesman for the company. Until now, the board only had two
female directors, including Redstone’s daughter Shari.  “This was an opportunity to add to the experience and
diversity of the board,” Jafar said.  Viacom shares fell less than 1 percent to $61.24 at the
close in New York. The stock has climbed 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
