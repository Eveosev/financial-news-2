Gold climbed to a three-week high
after reports in the U.S. and  Europe  revived concern that
economic growth will slow, boosting demand for the precious
metal as a haven asset.  U.S. jobless claims increased by 2,000 to 336,000 in the
week ended March 16, the Labor Department said today. An index
for German manufacturing fell this month, while a measure of
euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted more than
forecast, London-based Markit Economics said. Gold climbed
during the past two weeks mainly on concern that the debt crisis
in Europe is deepening.  “The jobless numbers perked up the market,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “Also, Europe
remains a big issue.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle
at $1,613.80 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
after touching $1,616.50, the highest for a most-active contract
since Feb. 26. Prices are up 2.6 percent since March 1.  Open interest in Comex futures declined 3 percent in four
days through March 19, the latest data available from the
exchange showed.  “The decline in open interest reported by the Comex
yesterday suggests to us that recent buying has been short-
covering rather than new buying,”  Dennis Gartman , an economist
and trader, said in his daily Gartman letter.  Gold is up 82 percent since the end of 2008 as central bank
measures intended to stimulate economic growth increased
speculation that inflation will accelerate. The Federal Reserve
yesterday left unchanged plans to hold its target  interest rate 
near zero as long as U.S. unemployment remains above 6.5
percent. The jobless rate last month was 7.7 percent.  Silver, Platinum  Silver futures for May delivery jumped 1.4 percent to
$29.212 an ounce in New York, the biggest gain since Feb. 25.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery retreated 0.2 percent to $1,580.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$756.85 an ounce, the third drop in four sessions. Futures
trading was 48 percent lower than the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
