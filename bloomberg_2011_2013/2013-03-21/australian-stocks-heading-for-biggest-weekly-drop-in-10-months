billion. “Its leadership keeps looking at the hole in the hull
and wondering why they are waist deep in water, rather than
fixing the damage.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, yesterday traded at 15 times average estimated
earnings compared with 14 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)

compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. The S&P 500 yesterday fell 0.8 percent, with the
