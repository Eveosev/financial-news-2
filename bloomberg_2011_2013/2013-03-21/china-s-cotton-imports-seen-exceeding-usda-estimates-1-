Cotton imports by  China , the
biggest consumer of the fiber, will exceed a U.S. estimate for
the 12 months through July as government stockpiling to boost
farmers’ incomes exacerbates a shortage.  Imports will be 3.8 million metric tons, according to the
median of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  forecast 3.3 million tons in a report
on March 8.  Cotton in New York has jumped 18 percent this year, the
most among 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index. The fiber on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange has
climbed 6.6 percent this year after dropping 33 percent in the
previous two years. The Chinese government bought 6.41 million
tons as of March 19, or 84 percent of the harvest, according to
industry website cncotton.com.cn.  “Imports will increase in the months ahead as the
government may issue more quotas to quench demand from textile
makers, allowing more shipments to come in,” Kuang Bo, an
analyst at Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou.  The contract for May delivery on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  fell 0.2 percent to 88.90 cents a pound at 4:15 p.m. in
Beijing. Futures for September delivery in Zhengzhou climbed 0.2
percent to close at 20,205 yuan ($3,252) a ton.  Demand Recovery  China’s textile makers have seen a recovery in demand since
September last year, Zhang Hongxia, chairwoman at  Weiqiao
Textile Co. (2698) , the world’s largest yarn maker, said in a statement
on March 18. A reduction in inventory by textile makers also
contributed to an industry wide recovery, Zhang said.  Government inventories are set to climb to about 9 million
tons by end of March, as the government also bought 3.13 million
tons of cotton in 2011-2012, Yongan’s Kuang said.  With warehouses filling, the government may also step up
sales from its reserves at below 19,000  yuan  a ton, she said. Du
Ying, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said from Urumqi in the
nation’s western cotton-growing region, China may sell about
900,000 tons of new-crop cotton from its stockpiles.  The USDA forecast an 18 percent drop in production this
year from the U.S., the biggest exporter, to 14 million bales
(3.1 million tons).  On March 28, the department will release its first estimate
of planting intentions based on a survey of growers. In 2011,
output was 15.57 million bales, after the worst drought in at
least a century decimated crops in  Texas , the biggest producer.  China’s 2013-2014 harvest will be above 7 million tons,
lower than 7.6 million tons estimated for 2012-2013, Xi Jin,
manager of international cooperation at the China National
Cotton Information Center, said in  Singapore  today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
