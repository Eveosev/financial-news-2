KBC Groep NV (KBC)  of Belgium and  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  of Spain will sell 21.4 percent of  Bank Zachodni
WBK SA (BZW) , Poland’s No. 3 lender, for 4.9 billion zloty ($1.5
billion), according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The two banks will sell the combined stake at 245 zloty a
share, said people, who asked to not be identified because the
process is private. The banks had narrowed the price to between
240 zloty and 255 zloty apiece from a previous range of 240
zloty to 270 zloty, the people said. The banks got bids for all
20 million shares on offer in the sale that closed today.  KBC planned to sell its entire 16.2 percent stake in
Zachodni, while Santander was offering as much as 5.2 percent,
Zachodni said March 18. Santander, which completed Zachodni’s
merger with KBC’s Kredyt Bank SA in January, is under pressure
from Polish regulators to boost the proportion of Zachodni
shares available to other investors. The sale will increase the
Polish bank’s so-called free-float to 30 percent.  Zachodni  shares  fell 0.2 percent to 255 zloty at the close
in Warsaw today. Warsaw’s benchmark WIG20 Index declined 1.1
percent, extending its decline to 7.2 percent in 2013.  The offering comes two months after sales of stakes in PKO
Bank Polski SA and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s largest lenders. The
government and state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego sold a
5.24 billion-zloty stake in PKO Bank, while Italy’s  UniCredit
SpA (UCG)  sold a 3.7 billion-zloty holding in Pekao in January.  Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, Bank of
America, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, KBC
Securities NV, Santander Investment, Dom Maklerski Bank Zachodni
WBK SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG managed Zachodni’s
sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
