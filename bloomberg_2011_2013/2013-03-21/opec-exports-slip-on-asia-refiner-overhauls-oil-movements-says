The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will trim crude shipments through early
April while refiners in Asia perform seasonal maintenance work,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will reduce crude shipments by 40,000 barrels a day, or 0.2
percent, to 23.72 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
April 6, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
figures exclude Angola and Ecuador.  “Asia is heading into the peak of their maintenance,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder, said by phone from Halifax,
England. “Runs start to pick up toward the end of the quarter,
which means crude demand picks up at the end of next month. But
April itself is a dead month.”  Middle East shipments will decrease by 0.2 percent to 17.37
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.41 million
in the four weeks to March 9, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 473.51 million barrels,
up 1.6 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
