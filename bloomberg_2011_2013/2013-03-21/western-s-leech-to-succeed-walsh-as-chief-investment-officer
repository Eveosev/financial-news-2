Western Asset Management Co., the
$462 billion bond unit of  Legg Mason (LM)  Inc., said S. Kenneth Leech
will become chief investment officer next year to succeed
 Stephen Walsh , who will retire.  Walsh and Leech, who have both been with the firm for more
than 20 years, will share the CIO role until Walsh’s departure
on March 31, 2014, Western’s Chief Executive Officer James
Hirschmann said in a letter to clients today. Leech, 58, held
the CIO role from 1998 to 2008. Walsh, 54, said in an interview
he plans to spend more time on working for charitable causes
when he retires.  Under Walsh, Western turned around performance following
the 2008 financial crisis, with returns that rank among the
industry’s best. Still, Western, like its Baltimore-based
parent, has been struggling to reverse five years of customer
redemptions. Legg Mason last month named Joseph A. Sullivan
chief executive officer, ending a five-month search, as the firm
seeks to stanch investor defections and revive its slumping
share price.  “You never want to lose someone like Steve but our team is
as good as ever,” Hirschmann said in a telephone interview from
his office in  Pasadena ,  California .  Western has had withdrawals of more than $200 billion since
the end of 2007. Hirschmann said a portion of the money that
left the firm was in low-yielding accounts, including money-
market funds.  Beating Peers  The $10.5 billion  Western Asset Core Plus Bond Fund (WACPX) , which
trailed more than 80 percent of peers in 2007 and 2008,
outperformed 97 percent of rivals over the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $3.4 billion
Western Asset Core Bond Fund beat 95 percent of comparable funds
over the same stretch.  “Their problems back in 2007 and 2008 may have left a bad
taste in people’s mouths,”  Geoff Bobroff , a consultant based in
 East Greenwich ,  Rhode Island , said in a telephone interview,
explaining Western’s inability to attract more assets even as
performance has improved.  Western, which is Legg Mason’s biggest investment
affiliate, said last year it was removing the Legg Mason name
from its U.S. mutual funds as part of a rebranding to increase
sales to individual investors. The firm is also seeking more
control of its fund sales, a person familiar with the matter
said in November.  Walsh joined Western in 1991 and has served as the unit’s
investment chief since 2008. Leech, 58, who joined Western in
1990, stepped down from the role of CIO in August 2008 and later
took the role of chairman of the global strategy committee with
oversight of the firm’s global bond portfolios. He was named
Morningstar’s fixed-income manager of the year in 2004.  Assets Fall  Western Asset accounts for about 70 percent of Legg Mason’s
$661 billion in assets as of the end of February. Legg Mason’s
funds under management have declined by one-third since swelling
to a peak of $1 trillion in 2007.  Legg Mason’s  stock  is down more than 75 percent from its
2006 high. The shares advanced 24 percent through March 20,
compared with the 18 percent gain in  Standard & Poor’s  index of
asset managers and custody banks. The shares of money managers
including New York-based  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and Baltimore-based T.
Rowe Price Group Inc. have reached all-time highs this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
