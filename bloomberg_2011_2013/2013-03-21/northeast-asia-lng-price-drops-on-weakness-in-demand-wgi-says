Liquefied natural gas for delivery
to Northeast Asia fell for a fifth straight week on continued
weakness in demand for short-term, or spot, cargoes, according
to Energy Intelligence.  Cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks cost $16 per
million British thermal units in Northeast Asia, the research
company said on the website for its World Gas Intelligence
publication yesterday. Thatâ€™s down from $16.90 per million Btu
on March 11.  The price in Southwest Europe was $14.10 per million Btu,
down 50 cents from last week, according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
