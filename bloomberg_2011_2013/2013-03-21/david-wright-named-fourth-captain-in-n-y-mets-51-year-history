Third baseman  David Wright  was
named the fourth captain in the  New York Mets ’ 51-year history.  Wright, 30, joins first baseman Keith Hernandez (1987-89),
catcher Gary Carter (1988-1989) and pitcher John Franco (2001-
2004) as the Mets’ only captains since their inaugural season in
1962, the Major League Baseball team announced in an e-mailed
release.  “One of the proudest days of my career,” Wright said. “I
try to lead by example. I’m crazy about the direction we are
headed.”  Six-time All-Star Wright said yesterday on the Mets’
Twitter account that he and the team agreed he won’t wear a
“C” on his jersey.  The Mets were 78-88 last year, their fourth consecutive
season with a losing record, and have made the playoffs once in
12 seasons.  In nine seasons with the Mets, Wright has hit .301 with 790
runs scored, 204 home runs and 818 runs batted in.  In December Wright signed an eight-year contract that will
keep him with the club through the 2020 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
