China’s  gasoline exports  rose to
the highest level in almost a year in February as the nation
ramped up production of the motor fuel before the Lunar New Year
holiday, when workers traveled back to their home towns.  Overseas shipments climbed 62 percent from a year earlier
to 333,309 metric tons, the General Administration of Customs
said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the equivalent of
101,000 barrels a day, the most since March 2012.  Diesel exports 
exceeded imports by 209,135 tons, or 56,000 barrels a day, the
least in four months.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, boosted
gasoline production by 14 percent in the first two months of the
year, according to government data. While refineries strive to
meet domestic demand, they also risk generating a surplus as new
refining capacity comes online. The nation faces a fuel glut
this year,  China  National Petroleum Corp. said in its annual
report Jan. 30. China may add 770,000 barrels a day of
processing capacity in 2013 to be run at a relatively high
utilization rate, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a Feb. 26 note.  Diesel exports  in February more than tripled from a year
earlier to 254,871 tons and imports fell 74 percent to 45,736
metric tons, today’s data show. Domestic diesel production fell
0.5 percent in the first two months from a year earlier.  Fuel Oil Purchases  China’s  fuel oil imports  slid 13 percent to 2.44 million
tons, or 58,000 barrels a day, from the prior month. Imports for
January and February combined climbed 13 percent from a year
earlier to 5.25 million tons.  Fuel oil  imports from  Iran  were 232,183 tons, the customs
figures show. That’s biggest volume since June 2008 from the
Persian Gulf country, which is under Western sanctions on its
energy exports because of its nuclear program.  Crude imports
 from Iran rose 74 percent from a year earlier and 52 percent
from January to 2 million tons, or 520,000 barrels a day, the
data show.  Coal imports , including lignite, increased 13 percent from
a year earlier to 23.3 million tons, the customs bureau said.
That’s the lowest volume in four months and down 34 percent from
December’s record of 35.1 million.  Liquefied natural gas imports  were at 1.41 million tons, up
71 percent from a year earlier, and pipeline natural gas
imports, mostly from  Turkmenistan , climbed 19 percent to 1.52
million tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
