European Union emission permits for
December rose to their highest level in more than two weeks
after the EU presidency said governments were closer to
supporting a rescue plan for the carbon market.  The benchmark December futures contract climbed as much as
15 percent before closing 11 percent higher at 4.42 euros
($5.70) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange,
the highest settlement since March 4. The contract has gained 26
percent in the past two sessions, ICE data show, the biggest
two-day increase since Feb. 4.  There is growing support among EU governments for an
amendment to EU emissions law that would enable delaying
auctions of some carbon permits, an EU presidency official said,
asking not to be identified citing policy. Slovenian and Irish
government officials today said their countries were in favor of
delaying auctions to strengthen the emissions market.  “The market’s optimism was rewarded today,” Milan Hudak,
an analyst at Virtuse Energy in  Prague , said by e-mail. “The
biggest prize, a final decision in favor of backloading, is
still far away.”  UN Certified Emission Reductions for December were
unchanged at 32 euros cents a ton on ICE Futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
