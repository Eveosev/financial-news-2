AT&T Inc. (T)  was told to pay $27.5
million for infringing a Colorado company’s patents for
controlling how audio or video is streamed online.  AT&T’s U-verse TV services infringed two patents owned by
Two-Way Media LLC, the federal jury in  San Antonio  said
yesterday. The jury rejected Dallas-based AT&T’s efforts to have
the patents deemed invalid.  The Two-Way patents cover live streaming technology as well
as ways to record detailed usage data by customers, according to
the company’s lawyers at Susman Godfrey. Boulder, Colorado-based
Two-Way had sued Akamai Technologies Inc. and  Limelight Networks
Inc. (LLNW)  over the same technology; those two companies settled.  “‘This was a very hard-fought case,’’ Parker Folse, a
Seattle-based Susman lawyer representing Two-Way, said in a
statement.  The trial focused on three Two-Way patents. The jury found
U-Verse infringed two of them. AT&T said it would seek to have
the verdict overturned.  ‘‘While the verdict was a small fraction of what the
plaintiff sought in this case, we will challenge the amount that
was awarded,’’  Marty Richter , an AT&T spokesman, said in a
statement.  The case is Two-Way Media LLC v. AT&T Inc., 09cv476, U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Texas (San Antonio).  To contact the reporter on this story:
