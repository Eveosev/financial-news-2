Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s plan to merge
its U.S. unit  T-Mobile USA  with  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) 
cleared the last regulatory hurdle, leaving the decision to
MetroPCS shareholders next month.  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
approved the deal, Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom said in an e-
mailed statement today. The merger of the nation’s fourth- and
fifth-largest wireless carriers was cleared by the Federal
Communications Commission and the Department of Justice last
week.  Deutsche Telekom is trying to revitalize T-Mobile USA after
a $39 billion sale to AT&T Inc. failed in 2011. Two of
MetroPCS’s largest shareholders, Paulson & Co. and P. Schoenfeld
Asset Management, have said they’re opposing the transaction,
which would give the German phone company a 74 percent stake in
the combined company. MetroPCS shareholders are scheduled to
vote on the deal on April 12.  Deutsche Telekom shares  declined  as much as 1.2 percent and
were down 0.7 percent as of 10:23 a.m. in  Frankfurt  today. The
combined U.S. carrier would have an enterprise value of about
$30.5 billion, based on MetroPCS’s closing stock price
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
