UBS AG (UBSN)  sold $1.25 billion of
covered bonds through its London branch, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Switzerland’s biggest bank issued 0.75 percent, dollar-
denominated securities due 2016 that pay 46.5 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. The bonds may
be rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service, according to a person
familiar with the transaction who asked not to be identified,
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Covered bonds, a form of secured financing pioneered in
18th-century Prussia, are backed by assets such as mortgages or
loans and guaranteed by the issuer, letting banks fund more
cheaply than traditional debt and providing investors with top-
rated securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
