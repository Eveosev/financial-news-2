U.S. mortgage rates fell as concern
that Cyprus’s debt crisis might worsen drove investors to the
safety of the government bonds that guide home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.54
percent in the week ended today, down from a six-month high of
3.63 percent, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a
statement. The average 15-year rate dropped to 2.72 percent from
2.79 percent.  Low borrowing costs are fueling demand for housing as buyer
competition for a shrinking  supply  of listings bolsters prices.
The 10-year Treasury yield reached a two-week low on March 19
before Cyprus’ parliament rejected an unprecedented levy on bank
deposits that was part of European plans to force savers to
shoulder part of a bailout of the country.  “For American mortgage borrowers, bad news is good news,”
said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a Pompton
Plains, New Jersey-based mortgage-information website. “Every
time it looks as though things are calming down, something else
crops up to throw another set of jitters into the marketplace.”  The housing market’s recovery from a five-year slump is one
of the U.S. economy’s bright spots.  House prices  rose 6.5
percent in the 12 months through January, the Washington-based
Federal Housing Finance Agency said today.  Rising prices helped about 200,000 homeowners regain
positive equity in their properties in the fourth quarter,
according to CoreLogic Inc. At the end of last year, 10.4
million homes, or 21.5 percent of all residential properties
with a mortgage, were underwater, with owners owing more than
the property was worth. That was down from 10.6 million homes,
or 22 percent, at the end of the third quarter, the  Irvine ,
California-based data firm said March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
