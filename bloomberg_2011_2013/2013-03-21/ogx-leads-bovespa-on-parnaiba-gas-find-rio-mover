OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes
SA , the oil explorer that has lost 85 percent in the past year,
led gainers after reporting additional natural gas discoveries
in northeastern  Brazil .  OGX, controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , rose 4.6
percent to 2.74 reais at 1:21 p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier
rising to as much as 2.78 reais, the highest intraday since
March 11. Brazil’s benchmark stock index was down 0.4 percent.  The company based in Rio de Janeiro found additional signs
of gas in the PN-T-49 block in the Parnaiba Basin, the National
Petroleum Agency reported on its website today. OGX, which began
producing gas at the Gaviao Real field in Parnaiba in January,
increased output to the equivalent of 5,500 barrels a day in
February, the company said on its website.  OGX is down 37 percent for the year after output declined
at its three oil wells in the Campos Basin off the coast of Rio
de Janeiro, where most of the company’s deposits are located.
The wells produced 3,800 barrels a day on average in February,
compared with original estimates of as much as 20,000 barrels a
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
