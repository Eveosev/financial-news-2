Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, plans to increase Yoho crude exports in May to three
cargoes of 950,000 barrels each, one more shipment than next
month, according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News .  The grade is the first of Nigeria’s planned crude sales for
May to be released. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
