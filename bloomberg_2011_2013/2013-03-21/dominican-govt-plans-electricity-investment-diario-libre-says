The Dominican Republic government
will launch a $3.6 billion public-private investment next week
in an effort to generate an additional 1,500 Megawatts of
electricity, Diario Libre says.  The investment will be used to convert existing fuel
generators to natural gas and coal plants, the Santo Domingo-
based newspaper said. Two new coal generator plants will also be
constructed with the investment, Diario Libre says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
