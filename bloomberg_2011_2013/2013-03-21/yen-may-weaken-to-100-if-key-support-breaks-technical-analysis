The yen may decline to its weakest
level in almost four years versus its U.S. counterpart in the
second quarter if a key support level fails to hold, according
to Credit Suisse AG.  The Japanese currency will face a test at the 96.71 level,
according to  David Sneddon , a technical analyst at Credit Suisse
in  London . The yen may depreciate to 100, which would be its
lowest level since April 2009, if it breaches that support
level, Sneddon said. The yen has gained 1.2 percent versus the
dollar over the past five days.  “We view the current phase that we’re seeing as just a
correction in an underlying uptrend in dollar-yen,” Sneddon
said in a telephone interview. “When we can get above 96.71,
which is the high we posted earlier in March, that will be the
trigger to suggest we’re resuming that rally again and we can
head up to the 100 area. We think the dollar-yen will hit 100
sometime in the second quarter.”  The yen increased 1.2 percent to 94.92 per dollar at 1:58
p.m. in  New York .  The yen has fallen 6.8 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored
by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained
3.1 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
