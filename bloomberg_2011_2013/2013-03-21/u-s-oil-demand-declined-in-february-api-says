U.S. oil demand in February fell to
the lowest level for the month in 20 years as gasoline rose to
the highest price for the time of year, the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported.  Total petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, dropped
4.1 percent from a year earlier to 18 million barrels a day, the
lowest February level since 1993, the industry-funded group said
in a monthly report today. The retail price for regular
gasoline, averaged nationwide, rose to $3.786 a gallon on Feb.
26, the  highest  for the month in AAA data going back to 2004.  “There is the price effect,” said  John Felmy , chief
economist at the API. “Consumers are being very cautious.”  February gasoline deliveries were 8.36 million barrels a
day, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier and the lowest demand
for the month since 2001, the API said.  Use of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, slid 7.3 percent from a year earlier to 3.69
million barrels a day. Demand for ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the
type used by the trucking industry, fell 6.1 percent to 3.21
million.  Jet fuel consumption decreased 8.7 percent from a year
earlier to 1.23 million barrels a day.  U.S. crude-oil production jumped 14 percent from a year
earlier to 7.09 million barrels a day, the highest February
output in 21 years. Output rose 15 percent in the lower 48
states to 6.51 million barrels a day and decreased 0.2 percent
to 581,000 in  Alaska .  To contact the reporter on this story:
