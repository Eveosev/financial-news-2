The main coffee growing region in
 Vietnam , the top producer of robusta variety used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
in instant drinks, may get more rain in the final days of March,
potentially helping the crop.  Parts of Dak Lak province, which represents about a third
of the country’s harvest, will receive between 10 millimeters
and 20 millimeters in the period to March 31, the Dak Lak
Meteorology and Hydrology Department said today. Water levels in
rivers and streams will be lower than the average in previous
years, the department said in a report. The government said on
Feb. 26 that the drought would hurt the crop.  The  harvest  starting in October may decline to an eight-
year low, according to a Bloomberg survey this month, cutting
supplies from  Asia  where exports from  Indonesia , the third-
largest shipper, are also falling because of higher domestic
consumption. Buyers of the Vietnamese variety are paying a
larger premium, according to Volcafe Ltd.  “There has been rain but the amount is not huge, so the
drought conditions haven’t improved much yet,” said Cao Van Tu,
chairman of Dak Lak-based Ea Pok Coffee Co. Trees usually flower
from January and most would have formed fruit by now, according
to growers.  The harvest may plunge as much as 30 percent to 1 million
tons in 2013-2014, according to the survey published March 15.
The decline will be at least 10 percent, the survey showed.  Beans in Vietnam are at a premium of $50 a ton to the price
on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London , the highest level since
the 2012-2013 season began on Oct. 1, Volcafe, a unit of
commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said March 15. Beans
in  Dak Lak  traded at 44,000 dong ($2.10) a kilogram yesterday,
up 15 percent this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
