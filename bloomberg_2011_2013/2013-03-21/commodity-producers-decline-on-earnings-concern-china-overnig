Chinese stocks fell the most in a
week in New York as  PetroChina Co. (PTR) ’s lower-than-estimated 2012
earnings stoked concern other commodity producers will also
report disappointing results.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. dropped 1.1 percent to 91.35
yesterday for the biggest decline in six days. Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. slid to a six-month low and  China Petroleum and
Chemical Corp.  sank the most in six weeks before earnings
release scheduled for today. PetroChina slipped 2 percent, while
 Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  tumbled to a record low after banks
petitioned for its bankruptcy.  PetroChina, the country’s biggest oil producer, posted
lower-than-forecast profit in 2012 as refining losses and import
costs outpaced growth in production. China, which has capped
retail fuel and natural gas prices to contain inflation, may cut
gasoline and diesel prices next week, commodity researcher ICIS
C1 Energy said yesterday. China Petroleum, Asia’s biggest
refiner, will post a 16 percent drop in 2012 net income today,
according to analyst estimates collated by Bloomberg.  “Weakness in commodity prices may be a signal that the
outlook for Chinese demand is not strong, which has impacted the
shares of energy and commodity producers,” Michael Wang, an
emerging-markets strategist at Amiya Capital LLP in London, said
by phone. “We really haven’t seen good earnings so far, with
more companies missing consensus than beating them, and guidance
not that strong.”  Oil Prices  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., retreated 1.1 percent to
$36.84 in New York, after jumping the most in two months the
previous day. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  dropped 0.8
percent to 1,545.80.  Crude prices have lost 14 percent over the past year on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, while coal futures have dropped
3.8 percent.  Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-largest coal miner, declined
2.6 percent to $13.78 in New York, the lowest closing level
since Sept. 6.  PetroChina’s American depositary receipts slid to $132.11,
the lowest since Dec. 3. Net income dropped 13 percent to 115.3
billion yuan ($18.6 billion) last year, the state-owned company
said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.
That compared with the 119.8 billion  yuan   mean  of 27 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sinopec Sinks  Gasoline and diesel prices in China are set by the National
Development and Reform Commission under a system that tracks the
22-day moving average for a basket of crudes, comprising Brent,
Dubai and Indonesia’s Cinta. Former NDRC Chairman Zhang Ping
said March 6 that the body plans to shorten the fuel price
adjustment window.  China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, sank 2.6 percent to
$111.64 in U.S. trading, the biggest decline since Feb. 7. The
Beijing-based company may report net income of 61.8 billion yuan
for 2012, according to the median of 16 analysts’ projections
compiled by Bloomberg, from 73.2 billion yuan for 2011.  Suntech, the world’s largest solar-panel maker in 2011,
plunged 25 percent to 44 cents in New York, extending its loss
this week to 37 percent. The company said a court in China
accepted the petition of eight banks to push its main operating
subsidiary into insolvency.  Trading volume on the company’s ADRs was six times the
daily average over the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the biggest silicon-based
solar panel maker by capacity, based in Baoding, China, fell 7.9
percent to $2.32.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , based in Changzhou, slipped
3.3 percent to $4.05 in New York.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.3 percent to
10,944.35 yesterday, slipping from a three-day high. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares added 0.3
percent to a two-week high of 2,324.24, rallying a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
