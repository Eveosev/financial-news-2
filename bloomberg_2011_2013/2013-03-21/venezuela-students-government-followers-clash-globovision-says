Venezuelan government supporters
attacked a march by students to the headquarters of the
country’s electoral council, Globovision reported on its
website.  The students planned to hand in a petition asking for
civilian militias to be barred from forming part of the security
personnel at polling centers in next month’s national election,
Globovision said, citing student leader Roderick Navarro.  They were also calling for the resignation of Defense
Minister Diego Molero for openly calling on people to vote for
the government and are requesting that fingerprinting be
eliminated from the electoral process, the TV network said.  Three people were injured, Globovision reported, citing
student leader Gaby Arellano.  To contact the reporter on this story:
