Travelers Cos., the lone property-
casualty insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said Chief
Executive Officer Jay Fishman’s bonus climbed 44 percent last
year as return on equity improved.  Fishman’s bonus of $6.5 million compares with $4.5 million
a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. His total compensation was reported as $15.7
million, including salary and stock and option awards.  Travelers advanced 21 percent last year, the sixth best
performance in the 30-company Dow average. The ROE climbed to
9.8 percent from 5.7 percent in 2011. Fishman, 60, has been
raising prices for coverage to counter losses from natural
disasters and lower investment returns from the bond portfolio.  Top Travelers executives “performed at superior levels,”
the insurer said in the filing. “This was particularly the case
in light of the company’s strong 2012 results, driven in
significant part by proactive steps to improve profitability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
