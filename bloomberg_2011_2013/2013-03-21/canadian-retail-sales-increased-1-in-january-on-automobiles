Canadian  retail sales  gained in
January to recoup some of December’s plunge on advances at auto
dealerships and department stores.  Sales climbed 1 percent to C$38.9 billion ($38.1 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, following a revised drop
of 2.3 percent in the prior month, the biggest since April 2010.
Economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  forecast a 0.9 percent
increase, based on the median of 22 projections.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  presents a budget this
afternoon he has said will reflect signs of “modest” economic
growth, as consumers are weighed down by record debts while
exports and investments sagged late last year.  Motor vehicle and parts sales rose 2.8 percent to C$8.78
billion in January, following December’s 6.5 percent plunge.
Purchases  excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category rose
0.5 percent, faster than the 0.3 percent economists predicted.  Sales advanced in seven of 11 categories marking 52 percent
of total sales. Beer, wine and liquor store sales rose 2.2
percent to C$1.65 billion as the  National Hockey League ’s
lockout ended, Statistics Canada said.  Department store receipts jumped 11.5 percent to C$2.23
billion in January, while  gasoline station  sales fell a third
month, by 1.4 percent to C$4.84 billion.  The volume of sales were little changed in January. That
measure excludes the effects of price changes and more closely
reflects the industry’s contribution to economic growth.  Sales in January were 0.1 percent lower than  a year
earlier ,  Statistics Canada  said.  The agency also said today the number of Canadians
receiving jobless benefits fell a third straight month in
January. The number of regular beneficiaries declined by 1.6
percent, or by 8,540, to 531,120. The figure declined by 8.8
percent over the same month a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
