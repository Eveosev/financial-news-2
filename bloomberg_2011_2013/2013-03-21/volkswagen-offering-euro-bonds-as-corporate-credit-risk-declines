Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is marketing 2
billion euros ($2.6 billion) of bonds as corporate credit risk
fell for the first time in five days.  Europe ’s biggest carmaker is selling 1.25 billion euros of
three-year notes that will be priced to yield 37 basis points
more than the mid-swaps rate, and 750 million of eight-year
securities with a spread of 67 basis points, according to people
familiar with the transaction. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of
credit-default swaps linked to 125 investment grade companies
fell 1.5 basis points to 117.5.  Corporate credit risk jumped this week amid concern the
prospect of financial collapse in Cyprus will reignite the
region’s debt crisis. European car sales contracted 10 percent
in February as a steepening decline in  Germany , the region’s
biggest market, hurt previously resilient Volkswagen, Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG.  “Volkswagen is a routine issuer,” said Brian Studioso, an
analyst at CreditSights Inc. in  London . “It issues often, has a
huge financial services business and the credit strength to
almost issue if and when it chooses.”  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
