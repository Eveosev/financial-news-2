Peter Fulton’s first Test century
and Kane Williamson’s 83 lifted New Zealand to 250-1 against
 England  on day one of their cricket series decider in Auckland.  Fulton’s unbeaten 124, which came at the ground where he
made his Test debut seven years ago, surpassed his previous best
score of 75. The 34-year-old right-hander shared an unbroken
171-run partnership with Williamson after Hamish Rutherford got
out nine balls before the lunch interval for 37.  Fulton and Williamson batted through the next two sessions
to give New Zealand a platform for a large total after being
sent in to bat as it seeks a first Test series win against
England in 14 years.  England captain Alastair Cook, who took a catch at first
slip off Steve Finn’s bowling to dismiss Rutherford, won the
toss and opted to give his bowlers first use of the pitch at
Eden Park, which was lowered into place last weekend just hours
after a rugby league match finished.  Nicknamed “Two-Meter Peter,” the 6-foot-6 Fulton batted
the entire day, scoring 15 fours and three sixes in his 277-ball
innings. Williamson, 22, was 17 runs short of his fourth century
in elite five-day matches at the close of play.  England made one change to the team that took the field for
the first two matches, which ended in rain-affected draws, as
Jonny Bairstow replaced injured batsman Kevin Pietersen.  New Zealand, which was unchanged, has only beaten England
once before in a home Test series when it won a best-of-three
contest 1-0 in 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
