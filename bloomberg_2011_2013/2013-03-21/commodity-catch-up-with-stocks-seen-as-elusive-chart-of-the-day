Stocks and commodities are more
likely to go separate ways than to move together, according to
Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief global strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, the Standard &
Poor’s/GSCI Index of commodity prices was little changed from
the end of 2011 through yesterday. During the same period, the
S&P 500 climbed as much as 24 percent and approached a record
set in October 2007.  Even though they rose with equities yesterday, commodities
have failed to keep up because of a rising dollar and “global
slack” in the economy, Chadha wrote two days ago in a report.
There will be more weakness to come because commodities are
still overvalued, the New York-based strategist wrote.  The Dollar Index, based on the currency’s value against
those of six major U.S. trading partners, was 14 percent higher
as of yesterday than its April 2011 low. The increase made oil,
gold and other commodities priced in dollars more expensive for
international buyers.  Slack refers to idle factories, unemployed workers and
other signs of a production slump. U.S. plants have operated at
less than 80 percent of capacity since April 2008, according to
data compiled by the Federal Reserve. The unemployment rate, as
tracked by the Labor Department, has exceeded 7.5 percent since
January 2009.  Yesterday, the S&P/GSCI index of 24 commodities advanced
0.9 percent to 648.70. Higher prices for copper, oil and farm
products contributed to the gain. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent
to 1,558.71 after falling for three straight days, its longest
losing streak this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
