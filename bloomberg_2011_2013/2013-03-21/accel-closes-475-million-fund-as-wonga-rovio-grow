Accel Partners, the venture-capital
firm that backed Facebook Inc. and  Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , said it closed a
$475 million fund focused on future investments in Europe and
 Israel .  The Accel London IV fund will invest in companies focused
on consumer Internet businesses, data storage and analysis, and
software as a service, the firm said in a statement. It was
raised in eight weeks, said Accel, which is based in Palo Alto,
 California .  Accel is among venture-capital investors looking to attract
capital to back fast-growing European companies. Rovio Oyj, the
Finnish maker of “Angry Birds” mobile games, and U.K. online
lender Wonga.com are adding users and signaling plans for
initial public offerings. Fundraising for European-focused
venture funds fell almost 55 percent last year to about $2.5
billion, according to research firm Preqin Ltd.  “There’s more evidence and more data points that you can
build big, category-defining companies with European origins,”
said Kevin Comolli, an Accel partner in  London .  In addition to Rovio and Wonga, the firm’s European
investments include Mind Candy, the maker of “Moshi Monsters”
online games, and Russian classifieds site Avito.ru.  Editors:  To contact the reporters on this story:
