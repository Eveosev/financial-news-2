Mongolia hopes to bring factories,
offices, technology and jobs to a corner of the Gobi Desert
provided it can get investors for an industrial park envisioned
next to a railway line that slices through the country and
connects Russia and  China .  The government approved a plan to sell 66 percent of the
Sainshand Industrial Complex, Myagmarsuren Batgerel, director,
department of restructuring and policy implementation in the
State Property Committee, said today.  About $4 billion is needed to build infrastructure such as
a power distribution network and a waste water facility, said
Chuluunkhuu Ganbat, managing director of Liberty Partners, which
is advising companies to invest in the park. Potential
investments in the park, designed by civil engineering company
Bechtel Group Inc. of the U.S., may exceed $10 billion,
according to a Bechtel presentation seen by  Bloomberg News .  “This industrial complex is going to help diversify the
economy, bring technology, create jobs and provide more
opportunities for Mongolia,” said Ganbat, a Columbia
University-educated banker, who spent six years working for
 Germany ’s Commerzbank AG on  Wall Street .  Sainshand, a city of 20,000 people and 420 kilometers (261
miles) southeast of the capital Ulan Bator, may eventually house
coking coal plants, a copper smelter and facilities to process
food, make clothes, iron pellets and cement, he said.  Raising the $4 billion could take as many as five years and
an investor presentation is scheduled for early April, Ganbat
said, without providing names of interested parties.  Development Bank  of Mongolia is considering lending 14.1
billion tugrik ($10 million) to cover engineering and
environmental impact studies for the project, Chief Executive
Officer Jan Jing Kim said in an interview this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
