Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) , the world’s
largest publisher of children’s books, fell 14 percent in New
York trading after posting a deeper quarterly loss, hurt by a
shrinking appetite for “The Hunger Games” trilogy.  The fiscal third-quarter  net loss  widened to $20.1 million,
or 63 cents a share, from $10.3 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier, Scholastic said today in a statement. Sales tumbled 19
percent to $380.5 million in the period, which ended on Feb. 28.  The New York-based publisher blamed the shortfall on lower-
than-expected orders of “The Hunger Games,” a dystopian novel
about teens forced to fight to the death. The trilogy of books
have helped fuel sales since the first installment was published
in 2008 and inspired a movie series. Scholastic’s investments in
digital technology also hurt its bottom line, the company said.  “We knew that fiscal 2013 would be challenging,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard Robinson said in the statement.
“However, third-quarter sales of ‘The Hunger Games’ trilogy
were significantly lower than our expectations, particularly in
the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia .”  The shares  fell $4.32 to $26.75, marking the biggest one-
day decline since November. Before the plunge, the stock had
climbed 5.1 percent this year.  Dimmer Outlook  Scholastic also cut its forecast for fiscal 2013, which
ends on May 31. The company now expects  sales  of $1.75 billion
to $1.8 billion, down from a previous projection of as much as
$1.9 billion. Excluding one-time items such as cost-cutting
programs, earnings will be $1.10 to $1.30 a share, compared with
an earlier forecast of as much as $1.60.  Sales of “The Hunger Games” got a boost in the year-
earlier period from the March 2012 debut of the first movie in
the trilogy. A second film, “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,”
is coming, though it’s not slated to  reach theaters  until
November.  Meanwhile, Scholastic is looking to other series, such as
the “Captain Underpants” series and “Tea Time with Sophia
Grace and Rosie,” to help maintain revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
