Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) , China’s
biggest maker of SUVs and pickup trucks, reported profit surged
to a record last year, helped by demand for its Haval vehicles.  Net income rose 66 percent to 5.69 billion  yuan  ($916
million), from 3.4 billion yuan, Great Wall, which disclosed
preliminary earnings in January, said in a statement filed to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Revenue rose 43 percent to
43 billion yuan.  SUV sales jumped 90 percent as the Baoding-based company
led Chinese companies in the fastest-growing segment of the
nation’s auto market last year. Great Wall also benefited after
tensions flared over the ownership of a group of uninhabited
islands -- known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China --
which drove down demand for  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s CRV and Toyota
Motor Corp.’s RAV4 in China.  Great Wall, whose shares  more than doubled  last year,
closed unchanged at HK$28.40 in Hong Kong before the earnings
announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
