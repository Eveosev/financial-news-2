Thailand ’s baht fell from a 16-year
high on concern the central bank will intervene to slow gains
that may hurt exports. The government’s 10-year bonds fell for
the first time in eight days.  Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said
yesterday the baht gains were “excessive,” though added that
special measures to stem fund inflows weren’t necessary as yet.
The dollar’s 14-day relative strength index against the baht
stayed below the 30 threshold for a third day, a sign that the
greenback is oversold. The baht has strengthened 1.1 percent
this week, the biggest advance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Even though the central bank seems to be quite tolerant
with the baht’s gains, it doesn’t mean it won’t step in,
especially since the baht has risen so much in such a short
time,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “In the short term, we may see
some technical correction too. But the basic trend of fund
inflows and currency gains will continue.”  The baht slid 0.4 percent to 29.22 per dollar as of 9:26
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 29.08 yesterday, the strongest level since July 1997.  Global funds  purchased  $2.5 billion more sovereign debt
than they sold this month after putting in a net $2.7 billion in
February and $3.7 billion in January, Thai Bond Market
Association data show.  Interest Rates  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday that
Thailand’s relatively attractive interest rates were encouraging
inflows. The nation’s  policy rate  of 2.75 percent compares with
a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in  Japan .
It is still lower than  Indonesia ’s 5.75 percent, the
 Philippines ’ 3.5 percent and  Malaysia ’s 3 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, slumped 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 4.91 percent.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023
rose one basis point to 3.59 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The rate dropped for seven days through yesterday, the
longest streak since Feb. 8. It touched 3.58 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
