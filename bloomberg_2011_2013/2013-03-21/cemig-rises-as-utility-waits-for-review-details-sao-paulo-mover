Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais ,
 Brazil ’s third-biggest power utility by market value, rebounded
after plunging 14 percent yesterday on concern a rate review
next month may lead to lower-than-expected profits.  Shares of Cemig, as the company is also known, rose 2.5
percent to 22.75 reais at 2:10 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  after jumping
as much as 3 percent in the biggest intraday gain since March 7.
The benchmark Bovespa index slid 0.4 percent.  Cemig is waiting for its regulator to provide a technical
explanation of the rate review’s new parameters so it can
question them, according to an e-mailed statement from the
company yesterday after the market closed. The stock tumbled
yesterday as Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit cut its
 recommendation  to the equivalent of hold, citing the rate
review.  On March 11, Brazil’s electric-utility regulator, Aneel,
lowered a preliminary asset valuation that’s used to gauge the
company’s costs and set rates. The lower valuation may reduce
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
by 247 million reais ($124 million) a year from previous
forecasts, according to  Banco Bradesco .  The utility’s earnings guidance, published in May 2012,
already incorporates the impact of the rate review, Cemig Chief
Financial Officer Luiz Fernando Rolla told investors and
analysts on a teleconference yesterday.  “We said several times there would be a reduction with
Aneel’s methodology,” Rolla said. “We don’t think the result
of this rate revision should be surprising for the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
