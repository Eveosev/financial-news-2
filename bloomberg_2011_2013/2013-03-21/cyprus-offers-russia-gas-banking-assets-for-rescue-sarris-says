Cyprus is offering Russia
“opportunities” including banking and natural gas assets in
return for help in bailing out the island nation, Finance
Minister Michael Sarris said.  “We are asking for help clearly, but something that would
make also economic sense for Russia,” Sarris told reporters in
Moscow today before a second day of talks between Russian and
Cypriot officials.  The euro region’s third-smallest economy is seeking to
overcome a deadlock after Cypriot lawmakers rejected an
unprecedented 5.8 billion-euro ($7.5 billion) levy on bank
deposits imposed by the European Union as a condition for a 10
billion-euro rescue. Cyprus is asking Russia, which granted it a
2.5 billion-euro loan in December 2011, to delay repayment of
the credit until 2021 and grant a new facility of 5 billion
euros, the Vedomosti newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  The two nations will hold a second day of talks today,
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said. Cyprus needs
between 6 billion and 10 billion euros to recapitalize its
financial industry, central bank Governor Panicos Demetriades
was cited as saying in an interview with Vedomosti published
today. If Russia gives a new loan “it will be a good
investment,” Demetriades was cited as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
