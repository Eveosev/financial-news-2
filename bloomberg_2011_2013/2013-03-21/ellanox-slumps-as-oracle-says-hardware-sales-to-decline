Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  slid a
sixth day in  Tel Aviv  and fell in New York after Oracle Corp.
said sales of hardware that use the Israeli company’s products
will decline.  Mellanox, the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based maker of
technology used to transfer and store data,  sank  3.4 percent in
Tel Aviv to a two-week low of 197 shekels, and lost 0.7 percent
to $54.84 by 12:03 p.m. in New York.  Oracle, the second-largest maker of business applications,
reported fiscal third-quarter sales and net income that were
below analysts’ estimates as customers moving to Internet-based
programs bought less hardware. Product revenue in the segment
will fall 13 percent to 23 percent in the current quarter,
 Oracle (ORCL)  said yesterday. The  Redwood City , California-based
company accounted for 5.6 percent of Mellanox revenue in 2012,
according to Piper Jaffray Cos.  “Oracle’s results last night called out weakness in
hardware,” Andrew Nowinski, an analyst at Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis who rates Mellanox the equivalent of buy, said by
phone. “Unfortunately, Mellanox products went into every piece
of Oracle hardware.”  Mellanox forecast Jan. 23 first-quarter sales that trailed
analysts’ estimates by as much as 48 percent amid a build-up in
inventory by one of its customers. Sales for the three months
ending this month will reach $78 million to $83 million, the
company said. Earlier in January, Mellanox cut its fourth-
quarter revenue forecast on weaker demand and a product glitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
