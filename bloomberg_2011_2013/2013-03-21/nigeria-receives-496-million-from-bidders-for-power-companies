Nigeria said all 14 companies
bidding for the country’s power utilities, including
 Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  China
Machinery Engineering Corp. (1829) , have paid the required 25 percent
value of their offers.  All the buyers “have met the deadline for the payment of
the mandatory 25 percent of the offer value of their bids,” the
Abuja-based Bureau of Public Enterprises, or BPE, said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s equal to $559.4 million, according
to the BPE.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, is selling majority
stakes in power plants and letting private investors acquire as
much as 60 percent holdings in six state-owned transmission and
11 power distribution companies spun out of the former state-
owned utility. After signing sales pacts with the government on
Feb. 22, the buyers had 15 days to pay 25 percent of the amounts
they bid. Full payment is due within 90 days.  Blackouts are a daily occurrence in Nigeria,  Africa ’s most
populous country with more than 160 million people. Electricity
demand is almost double the supply of about 4,000 megawatts. The
government is offering incentives to investors, including five-
year tax breaks and permission to charge higher electricity
tariffs, according to the BPE.  The country expects to earn $1.3 billion from the sale of
the power distributors and about $700 million from the
generators.  To contact the reporters on this story:
