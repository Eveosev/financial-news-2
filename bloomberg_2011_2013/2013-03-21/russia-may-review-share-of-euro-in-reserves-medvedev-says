Cyprus’s financial crisis may force
 Russia  to review the share of euros in its international
currency reserves, the world’s fourth-largest stockpile,
according to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.  An unprecedented levy on deposits in Cyprus banks that was
backed by European finance officials as a condition for the
country to receive a bailout, was “not just unpredictable, it’s
evidence of some inadequacy,” Medvedev said, according to a
 transcript  of his interview with Interfax and foreign media on
the government’s website.  “We have 41 percent or 42 percent of our reserves in
euros,” Medvedev said. “It’s big money, and we, like any
country, value predictability.”  Russia’s foreign currency and gold reserves stood at $522.1
billion last week. The dollar accounts for 46 percent of the
stockpile, while 40.5 percent is held in euros, First Deputy
Central Bank Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  was cited as saying by
RIA Novosti Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
