A case of Carruades de Lafite
2006, the second wine of Bordeaux first-growth Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild, sold for 1,758 pounds ($2,660) on  London ’s
Liv-ex wine market yesterday, its lowest price on the exchange
since February 2010, according to Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  A case of Carruades 2006 sold for as much as $7,380 and two
others for $6,765 at an Acker Merrall & Condit auction in Hong
Kong in March 2011 at the height of Chinese demand for wines
associated with Lafite, and fell to $3,388 at a Zachys sale
in New York last April as prices cooled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
