Cypriot central bank Governor
Panicos Demetriades issued the following statement in Nicosia
today. The text of his statement was emailed from the Cyprus
President’s Office.  “The  Central Bank of Cyprus  has proposed the urgent
submission and immediate vote by the  House of Representatives  of
a legal framework on the reform and recovery of the Cypriot
banking system. With the restructuring process, the risk of bank
collapse is averted and the entirety of insured deposits, up to
the amount of EU100,000, are protected. Similarly the conditions
for the recovery of the banking system are created and jobs are
safeguarded.  “The reform is a significant step towards achieving an
agreement for financial support for the Republic of Cyprus from
the European Stability Mechanism and the  International Monetary
Fund , at the same time as creating the conditions for the
extension of the necessary liquidity for the Cypriot banking
system.  “With the adoption and activation of this legal
framework, reform measures will be applied to  Cyprus Popular
Bank (CPB)  so that it is in a position to continue to extend banking
services to its clients, with the reopening of banks on Tuesday.
Otherwise Cyprus Popular Bank will be led to immediate
bankruptcy and cession of operations, with catastrophic
consequences for workers, depositors in their entirety, the
banking system and the economy of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
