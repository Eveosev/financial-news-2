Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  headed
for the biggest drop in a month after IBI- Israel  Brokerage &
Investments said Shlomo Eliahu sold the stock and as Israel’s
biggest lender reported its first quarterly loss since 2008.  Shares of the bank  fell 2.8 percent , set for the largest
retreat since Feb. 21, to 12.75 shekels at 3:12 p.m. in Tel Aviv
on volume of 4.6 times the three-month daily average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Bank Leumi was the third-biggest
decliner on the benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25) , which lost 0.5 percent.  Businessman Shlomo Eliahu sold about 37 million shares at
12.75 shekels a share, IBI said in an e-mailed note today. The
move comes after Eliahu was asked by the  Bank of Israel  in
October to sell his entire holding in the lender within three
years in exchange for being allowed to acquire a majority stake
in  Migdal Insurance & Financial Holding Ltd. (MGDL) , which  owns a stake 
in Bank Leumi.  “Leumi’s share is down due to a combination of factors
including Eliahu selling part of a stake in the company,
according to press reports,” Zach Herzog, head of international
sales at Psagot Investment House Ltd., said today by phone.
“The net loss for the fourth quarter was higher than the
guidance given and provisions were higher than what the market
had forecast.”  A spokesman for Eliahu didn’t immediately answer a text
message from  Bloomberg News  today seeking comment. Eliahu
already sold 200 million shares in Bank Leumi at 12.25 shekels a
share in October, IBI said at the time.  Last Loss  The Tel Aviv-based bank, which has the fifth-biggest
weighting on the TA-25, also reported a fourth-quarter loss of
259 million shekels ($70 million), the first time it hasn’t
turned a profit since the final three months of 2008, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bank Leumi  warned earlier this month
that it would report a provision to cover costs related to an
investigation by U.S. authorities of clients’ tax evasion.  The fourth-quarter loan loss provision was 386 million
shekels compared with 385 million shekels in the comparable
period.  Excellence Investments Ltd (EXCE)  analyst Micha Goldberg
estimated a provision of 364 million shekels, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Total assets of Leumi on Dec. 31 totalled 376.2 billion
shekels, up 2.8 percent from 365.9 billion shekels from the
previous year, according to bank data. Net return on equity for
2012 was 3.8 percent. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio reached
14.87 percent of which the core capital ratio was 8.55 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
