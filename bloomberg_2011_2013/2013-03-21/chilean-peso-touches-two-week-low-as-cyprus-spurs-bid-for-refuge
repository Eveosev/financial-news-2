Chile’s peso touched a two-week low
after turmoil in Cyprus spurred demand for a refuge in the
dollar and as copper prices declined.  The peso was little changed at 473.15 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:52 a.m. in Santiago after touching 473.40, its weakest
intraday level since March 6. The price of copper, Chile’s
biggest export, dropped 0.2 percent in New York after rising as
much as 1.4 percent.  The  European Central Bank  said it may cut Cypriot banks off
from emergency funds after March 25 as the island nation’s
president, Nicos Anastasiades, pursued options at home and in
 Russia  to stave off financial collapse.  “Everybody is looking at what will happen in Cyprus,”
Alexis Osses, an analyst at xDirect Chile Ltda. in Santiago,
said in a telephone interview. “If there is a run on banks,
then demand for dollars will jump.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
