Serbia  can’t accept the conditions
offered by the European Union during yesterday’s round of talks
on improving bilateral ties with its former breakaway province
of Kosovo, state news agency Tanjug said, citing Deputy Prime
Minister Aleksandar Vucic.  Serbia remains committed to getting a start date of EU
entry negotiations “but the paper on the table yesterday did
not give Serbia a one percent chance to accept it,” because no
one else was ready for any kind of compromise or concession,
Tanjug quoted Vucic as telling the Cabinet today.  Serbia and Kosovo held a seventh round of EU-mediated talks
in Brussels yesterday. Prime Ministers Ivica Dacic and Hashim Thaci are scheduled to meet again on April 2 as Serbia seeks
political and other rights including in education, the judiciary
and police in Serbian-dominated municipalities in northern
 Kosovo . Serbia needs to improve ties with Kosovo by mid-April to
get a date for talks by the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
