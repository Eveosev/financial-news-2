Any commodities rebound in the
second quarter will be limited by a stronger dollar and
accelerating supply in copper and oil, Barclays Plc said.  Investors should be prepared to sell industrial metals if
there is a “significant” rise in prices, Kevin Norrish, an
analyst at Barclays in  London , said in a report dated today. The
growth outlook is not strong enough to support commodities the
way it has other markets, he said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities is
little changed this year with all but seven of the index
components down for the year. Kansas wheat has fallen 7.8
percent and arabica coffee is down 7.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
