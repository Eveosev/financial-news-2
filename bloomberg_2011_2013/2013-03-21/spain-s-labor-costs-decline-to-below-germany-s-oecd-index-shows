Spanish and Portuguese relative
unit-labor costs have fallen below Germany’s for the first time
since 2005, according to an index compiled by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  The index, which sets a common starting point of 100 for
euro area countries in 2005, shows  Spain ’s relative unit-labor
costs dipping below those of Germany late last year and
Portugal’s slipping under the German level several quarters
earlier, the Paris-based OECD said in a report today.  “Some re-balancing continued among countries in the euro
area,” the OECD said. “The decline in unit-labor costs in
Spain reflected significant wage cuts in combination with rising
productivity.”  The crossover suggests that at least some euro-area
countries are addressing the underlying economic divergence that
helped generate the region’s sovereign debt crisis. Spanish
unit-labor costs have dropped or held steady in every quarter
except one in the past three years, the index shows.  The shift is also being helped by higher wages in  Germany ,
where unit-labor costs rose 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter,
the biggest increase in three years, the report showed. German
unit-labor costs have risen for 10 straight quarters.  The OECD index shows unit-labor costs in  France  and  Italy 
broadly paralleling the German rise over the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
