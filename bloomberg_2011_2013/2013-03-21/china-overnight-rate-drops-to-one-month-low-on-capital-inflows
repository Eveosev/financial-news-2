China ’s overnight money-market rate
fell to a one-month low after data signaled cash in the
financial system is rising.  Foreign direct investment  climbed 6.3 percent from a year
earlier to $8.21 billion in February, the Ministry of Commerce
said on March 19. That’s the first increase in nine months. The
People’s Bank of China sold 48 billion  yuan  ($7.7 billion) of
28-day  repurchase agreements  today that drain capital, keeping
the yield at 2.75 percent, according to a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at the auctions. Policy makers have
refrained from adding funds via reverse-repurchase contracts
since Feb. 7.  “Inflows from trade and capital accounts are the main
reasons for the ample liquidity,” said Becky Liu, a China rates
strategist in  Hong Kong  at Standard Chartered Plc. “The
overnight rate is getting steadier as the PBOC is using open-
market operations, which is a very good tool to manage a steady
liquidity condition.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, to 1.93 percent as of 11:28 a.m. in Shanghai, according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 1.92 percent earlier, the lowest level since
Feb. 20.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, slipped one basis
point to 3.27 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.91 percent government bonds due April
2015 was little changed at 3.09 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
