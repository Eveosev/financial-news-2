The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted for a third week, led by a
fall in issuance from nonfinancial companies as firms chose to
issue corporate bonds at almost the lowest borrowing costs.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $1.6 billion to $1.016 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since the market touched $997.9 billion
for the period ended Nov. 21.  Companies are favoring bonds to obtain longer-term, stable
funding with yields at almost record lows, in preference to
shorter-term financing via shorter-term commercial paper.  “The key driver once again seems to be the terming out of
short-term debt into the corporate-bond market to lock in low
rates for a longer period of time without incurring rollover
risk,”  Howard Simons , strategist at Bianco Research LLC in
 Chicago , wrote in an e-mail. “I would expect similar and larger
contractions to occur the next time there is speculation over an
eventual end to the era of artificially low short-term rates.”  IOUs issued by  nonfinancial companies  declined for a fourth
week, dropping $11.5 billion to $200.8 billion, the least since
the period ended Nov. 21. Corporations sell commercial paper,
typically maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday
activities such as rent and salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
