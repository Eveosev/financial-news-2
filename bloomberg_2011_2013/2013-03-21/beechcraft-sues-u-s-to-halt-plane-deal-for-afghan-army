Beechcraft Corp. sued the U.S.
Defense Department to halt a contract won by competitors to
provide planes to the Afghan military, claiming it was a lower
bidder on the deal.  The suit, filed today in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims,
seeks an order to block the successful bidder for the project,
Sierra Nevada Corp., from working on the contract while
Beechcraft pursues a bid protest with the  Government
Accountability Office . Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based  Embraer
SA (EMBR3)  is a subcontractor on the order.  “Beechcraft is not requesting a determination regarding
the underlying merits of its GAO protest by this court and
continues to pursue its challenges to the Air Force’s award of
the contract before the GAO,” the company said in the
complaint.  Sierra Nevada didn’t immediately respond to a request for 
comment on the suit.  The case is Beechcraft Defense Company LLC v. U.S., 13-
cv-00202, U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
