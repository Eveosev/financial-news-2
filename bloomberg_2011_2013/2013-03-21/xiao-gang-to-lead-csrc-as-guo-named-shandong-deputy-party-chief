Xiao Gang, formerly chairman of
 Bank of China Ltd. , was appointed head of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, while his predecessor  Guo Shuqing  was
named deputy Communist Party secretary of Shandong province.  Xiao’s photo and title of chairman of the securities
regulator were posted on the CSRC’s website today. His
appointment was announced at a CSRC staff meeting on March 17,
according to a person who asked not to be identified because he
wasn’t authorized to speak to the media. Xiao, 54, resigned from
the Bank of China, the nation’s fourth-biggest listed lender,
that same day.  Guo, 56, who had led the CSRC since 2011, was named deputy
party secretary of the eastern Chinese province, according to a
Da Zhong Daily  article  published on the website of the
provincial government yesterday.  The announcements come after the Communist Party’s top two
leaders, Xi Jinping and  Li Keqiang , took their state posts of
president and premier last week, completing the country’s once-
a-decade leadership transition.  Under Guo, the CSRC has expanded foreign investor quotas to
buy stocks, cut trading fees and pushed companies to increase
dividends. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  entered a  bull market  on
Jan. 29 after rallying 20 percent from Dec. 3. The gauge has
dropped 4.5 percent since its Feb. 6 high.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
