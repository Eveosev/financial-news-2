Corrections Corp. of America , the
largest private operator of prisons in the U.S., sold $675
million of senior notes in two parts to fund a tender offer for
outstanding debt.  The company issued $325 million of 4.125 percent securities
due April 2020 that pay 284 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $350 million of 4.625 percent bonds
maturing in May 2023 at a spread of 270, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used to redeem its $465
million of 7.75 percent bonds due June 2017, or to fund payments
linked to its conversion into a real estate investment trust,
Nashville, Tennessee-based CCA said today in a filing.  CCA is also seeking to boost its revolving credit facility
to $900 million, as well as to get consent from  bondholders  to
amend rules governing the debt that “would eliminate
substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain
events of default provisions in the indenture,” according to
the filing.  The 2017 notes, rated Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
traded March 14 at 105.1 cents on the dollar to yield 6.34
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The bonds are
callable in June at 103.88 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
