Greg Dyke, a former television
executive and  Manchester United (MANU)  board member, is to become
chairman of English soccer’s Football Association.  The F.A.’s board approved the nomination of Dyke to replace
David Bernstein on July 13, the ruling body said in a statement.
The decision is subject to approval by an F.A. panel.  Dyke will stand down as non-executive chairman of
Brentford, the third-tier London soccer team he’s supported
since a boy, and also as a director of the German broadcaster
 ProSiebenSat.1 (PSM)  to take the role, the F.A. said.  He has an “outstanding” understanding of soccer and
strong government contacts, Roger Devlin, chairman of the F.A.’s
nominations committee, said in the statement.  Dyke “will lead the F.A. from the front and be respected
by the football community,” Devlin said.  Dyke, 65, quit as a director of Manchester United after two
years in 1999 before becoming director general of the British
Broadcasting Corp. from 2000 to 2004.  In the statement, Dyke said it is “essential” the F.A.
finds a way to ensure English players get a chance to play
professional soccer at an elite level.  Teams in  Europe ’s five richest leagues, including the
Premier League, developed as few as 17 percent of their players
from their youth teams last year, according to the  CIES Football
Observatory  in Neuchatel, Switzerland.  Bernstein is vacating his role under F.A. rules that
require its chairman to leave at age 70.  To contact the reporters on this story:
