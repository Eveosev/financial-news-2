Mexico ’s peso fell amid concern
that Cyprus’s financial turmoil will rekindle  Europe ’s debt
crisis and cut into global economic growth.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.3819 per  U.S. dollar  at
7:27 a.m. in Mexico City. The peso initially rallied, touching
earlier today 12.3226 per dollar, the strongest intraday level
since September 2011. The peso has advanced 3.8 percent this
year, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
after rallying 8.4 percent in 2012.  Cyprus’s President, Nicos Anastasiades, met advisers to
draft a new plan to avoid a financial collapse after lawmakers
rejected the euro area’s proposed levy on  bank deposits . Losses
in the peso were limited as a government report showed
applications for jobless benefits in the U.S., the biggest buyer
of Mexican exports, totaled 336,000 in the week ended March 16,
below the 340,000 mediate estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “Surely it’s the noise from Europe,”  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, said in a
telephone interview. “The jobless claims were favorable in the
U.S.”  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.95 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy
Minister Ildefonso Guajardo are scheduled to speak at the
Bloomberg Mexico Economic Summit starting at 9 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
