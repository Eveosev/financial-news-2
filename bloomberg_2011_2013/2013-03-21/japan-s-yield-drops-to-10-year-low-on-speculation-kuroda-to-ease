Japan’s government bonds rose,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to the lowest since June 2003,

signal his intention to expand monetary easing.  Bond futures touched their highest on record after the
Nikkei newspaper reported that Kuroda will announce a policy
shift at his first press conference, without citing anyone.
Kuroda, who officially started yesterday, has pledged more-
aggressive monetary stimulus to spur growth and end entrenched
deflation in the world’s third-biggest economy.  “There’re few selling catalysts for bonds because of

quantity and quality,” said Daisuke Uno, Tokyo-based chief
strategist at the unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., a unit
of Japan’s second-largest bank by market value.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 1 1/2 basis
