Esso SAF, the French refinery
operator owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , cut its 2012 dividend in
half because of a tax on oil inventories.  Esso will propose a payout of 2 euros a share compared with
4 euros a share for 2011, according to a statement. The dividend
has dropped steadily from 8.5 euros a share in 2009.  France  imposed a one-time 4 percent levy on the value of
fuel inventories held by refiners, distributors and other
businesses last year to raise about 550 million euros ($710
million). The move, part of President Francois Hollande’s bid to
lower the deficit, was criticized by industry lobby Union
Francaise des Industries Petrolieres for hurting the
competitiveness of local refineries.  “The tax is unfair and aberrant,” Francis Duseux, chief
executive officer of  Esso SAF (ES) , said today at a press conference
in Paris. “We would probably have kept the dividend at the same
level as 2011 if it hadn’t been for the tax.”  The tax cost Esso, which operates two refineries in France
as well as a service-station network, 33 million euros last year
while dividend payments for 2012 will amount to 26 million
euros, he said.  The Port-Jerome-Gravenchon refinery halted units with total
capacity of about 70,000 barrels a day, or about a third of the
plant, at the end of February for six or seven weeks of
maintenance, Duseux said. The site had a utilization rate of 74
percent last year, compared with 90 percent at Fos-sur-Mer,
because of maintenance work.  Esso reported a net profit of 63 million euros last year
compared with 46 million euros in 2011, according to the
company. Refining margins averaged 34 euros a metric ton,
ranging from 14 to 63 euros a ton in the period, according to
French environment ministry data.  Esso is seeking to sell its service stations to “more
agile” operators through a type of franchise system, retaining
supply contracts for 10 years, Duseux said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
