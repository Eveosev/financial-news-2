West Corp. (WSTC) , the phone-conferencing
services provider owned by Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, fell in
New York trading after raising $425.5 million in its initial
public offering, pricing the shares below the marketed range.  The stock dropped 5.7 percent to $18.86 by the close today.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company priced 21.3 million shares,
equivalent to a 26 percent stake, at $20 each, according to a
statement yesterday. West earlier offered them for $22 to $25.  The IPO marks a return to the stock market for West, which
counts  AT&T Inc. (T)  as its largest customer. THL and Quadrangle
Group LLC took West private for about $4 billion, including
debt, in 2006. Founded in 1986 and listed on the  Nasdaq  at the
time of the acquisition, West offers conference-call technology,
call-center outsourcing, automated customer-call routing, and
emergency-call services.  At the offering price, West’s market capitalization was
about $1.67 billion, valuing its equity at about 21 percent more
than THL and Quadrangle’s original $725.8 million investment,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Including a $350.6 million
dividend the firms paid themselves in August, THL and Quadrangle
would reap an overall gain of 69 percent.  The IPO will help West reduce debt and open the door for
THL to begin selling the stock and returning cash to investors
who financed the leveraged buyout.  Under Pressure  Private-equity firms, many raising new funds, face
increasing pressure to sell companies bought from 2005 to 2007,
history’s largest buyout boom. THL may start marketing its
proposed $4 billion fund this year, according to people familiar
with the situation.  West planned to sell all of the stock in the offering, with
THL’s stake shrinking to 44 percent after the sale from 58
percent, regulatory filings show. Quadrangle would own a 9.1
percent stake after the IPO, compared with 12 percent before the
offering.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley led the IPO.
West Corp. is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol
WSTC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
