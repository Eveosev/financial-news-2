Indonesia’s two-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield to a 13-month low, as investors favored short-
dated notes on concern a push to reduce the burden of fuel
subsidies on the budget will spur inflation.  The government isn’t ruling out the possibility of raising
subsidized-fuel prices, Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo said
yesterday, adding that it is only considering controlling usage
at this stage. The budget deficit may exceed 2 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, exceeding the 1.65 percent target, he
said on March 19.  The yield on Indonesia’s 11 percent bonds due October 2014
dropped four basis points to 4.27 percent as of 9:23 a.m. in
Jakarta, the lowest level since Feb. 21, 2012, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The spread between the
yields on the two- and 10-year securities widened to 119 basis
points, the most since June.  “So long as inflation expectations keep rising, the gap
will widen as the market shies away from longer-term assets and
takes up shorter ones,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “There is certainly concern
over the fuel subsidy policy and the higher budget deficit.”  Bank Indonesia may need to take a tightening stance to curb
inflation expectations, with or without adjustments to the fuel
subsidy policy, DBS analysts led by David Carbon in Singapore
wrote in a research note released today.  The rupiah traded at 9,728 per dollar, compared with 9,732
yesterday, prices from local banks show. It was at a 0.4 percent
premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which were
steady at 9,765, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,733 per dollar yesterday by the Association of Banks in
Singapore, compared with 9,705 the previous day. Today’s rate
will be released at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 5.72 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
