Lead rose for a second day in
 London  and zinc gained for a third session after manufacturing
expanded at a faster pace in China, the world’s biggest consumer
of industrial metals.  A Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed a preliminary reading of 51.7 in March,
according to a statement today, compared with the 50.4 final
level for February. Readings above 50 indicate growth. Curbs on
China’s real-estate market helped pull the LME Index of metals
to the lowest level since November this week.  “Confidence may return and the lower prices may be seen as
a buying opportunity,” William Adams, an analyst at
Fastmarkets.com in London, said by e-mail. “We also feel that a
stronger recovery in  China  lies ahead.”  Lead for delivery in three months added 0.6 percent to
$2,202 a metric ton by 10:11 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange
and zinc climbed 0.6 percent to $1,943 a ton. Copper advanced
0.2 percent to $7,632 a ton and the metal for delivery in May
rose 0.1 percent to $3.449 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Copper pared gains after  stockpiles  of the metal tracked by
the LME expanded to the highest level in almost a decade and
imports of copper into China reached a 19-month low. Inbound
shipments of refined copper slid to 214,949 tons last month,
Chinese customs figures showed today. Exports of the metal
increased for a sixth month.  LME copper stocks rose for a 26th session to 557,450 tons
on gains in New Orleans and  Malaysia ’s Johor, daily exchange
figures showed. Inventories surged 74 percent this year to the
highest since October 2003.  “The market has bottomed and mostly discounted abundant
warehouse inventories,” William O’Neill, a partner at Logic
Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, said by e-mail. “I
also see Chinese demand as underestimated and have seen recent
evidence of Chinese interest. Funds are still mostly absent.”  Orders to withdraw copper from warehouses, or canceled
warrants, were little changed at 64,625 tons after jumping 77
percent yesterday. Canceled warrants for zinc increased 21
percent to 718,850 tons today.  Aluminum, tin and nickel climbed in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
