Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s
biggest maker of computer networking equipment, fell the most in
almost eight months after  FBR & Co. (FBRC)  lowered its rating on the
stock, citing reduced demand for the company’s components.  The shares slid 3.8 percent to $20.84 at the close in New
York for their biggest drop since July 24. Cisco had gained
10 percent this year through yesterday as the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose 9.3 percent.  Demand for network switches and routers is weakening as
innovations “blur the lines” between those components and
servers,  Scott Thompson , an FBR analyst in New York, said in a
report today. He changed his  rating  on the San Jose, California-
based company’s shares to underperform from market perform and
lowered his price target to $17 from $22.  “Cisco will become increasingly more challenged to offset
weaker-than-expected routing and switching demand as it works to
transition to a more software and service centric business
model,” Thompson said.  Thompson made the same rating change for  Juniper Networks
Inc. (JNPR) , another maker of networking equipment. The shares of the
Sunnyvale, California-based company fell 2.2 percent to $18.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
