The Philippine government’s 2031
bonds halted a six-day advance on speculation the rally that
sent yields to the lowest level since July 2011 was overdone.  The yield on the 8 percent notes dropped 72 basis points,
or 0.72 percentage point, in the last six days and climbed 14
basis points to 3.93 percent as of 4:09 p.m. in  Manila ,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  The Bureau of Internal Revenue reported March 19 that tax
collections were 74.5 billion pesos ($1.8 billion) in February,
3.4 percent short of target. The balance of payments slipped to
a deficit last month for the first time since April, data the
same day showed. Investors betting sovereign notes will rally if
the nation wins investment grade may be disappointed because
they already yield less than better-rated governments, said
Thiam Hee Ng, a senior economist at the Asian Development Bank.  “The yield had fallen quite a bit and that’s why any
negative news may cause a rebound in yields,” said Rees Kam, a
strategist at SJS Markets Ltd., a Hong Kong-based financial
services company that specializes in fixed income. “Taxes fell
short of target.”  Philippine government bonds have returned 12.6 percent this
year, the best performance among 10 Asia debt indexes compiled
by HSBC Holdings Plc. The nation’s 10-year notes yield 3.5
percent, compared with 3.59 percent in  Thailand  and 5.47 percent
in  Indonesia .  The  Philippines  is rated Ba1, or junk, by Moody’s Investors
Service, while Thailand and Indonesia are rated investment grade
by the company.  The peso was little changed at 40.748 per dollar, compared
with 40.738 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It has
appreciated 5.6 percent in the past year, the biggest gain among
emerging-market currencies. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, dropped six basis points to 3.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
