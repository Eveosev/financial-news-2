JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired Felipe
Garcia-Moreno, the former head of  Morgan Stanley’s (MS)  Mexico
office, to oversee investment banking and corporate lending in
the country, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Garcia-Moreno will start on April 1 and be based in Mexico
City, said the person, who asked not to be named because the New
York-based company hasn’t announced the hire publicly.  John Murray, a spokesman for JPMorgan in Mexico, declined
to comment on Garcia-Moreno’s appointment.  Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New
York, declined to comment on Garcia-Moreno’s move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
