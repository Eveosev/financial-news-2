Fewer Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  last week, a signal
the U.S. labor market is maintaining its recent progress.  Applications for  jobless benefits  increased by 2,000 to
336,000 in the week ended March 16, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists projected 340,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The monthly average,
which smoothes the week-to-week volatility, dropped to the
lowest level since February 2008.  Dismissals have waned since the end of 2012 as employers
maintain headcounts to meet a pickup in demand from business
customers and consumers. Today’s figures support the view of
Federal Reserve policy makers that the labor market is beginning
to show signs of improvement.  “Claims are really encouraging,” said  Michelle Girard , a
senior U.S. economist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , who forecast 337,000 initial applications. “We’ve
seen what I would characterize as a meaningful improvement,
which is consistent with and corroborates the other better
employment data.”  Stock-index futures remained little changed after the
figures, with the contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in June falling less than 0.1 percent to 1,548.7 at
8:48 a.m. in  New York .  Economists’ Estimates  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 325,000 to
352,000 in the Bloomberg survey of 47 economists. The prior
week’s applications were revised to a seven-week low of 334,000
after an initially reported 332,000.  A Labor Department official said as today’s data were
released that there was nothing unusual that affected today’s
figures. No states or U.S. territories estimated claims in the
latest week.  The four-week  moving average  of claims, a less-volatile
measure, dropped to a five-year low of 339,750 from 347,250.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
rose by 5,000 to 3.05 million in the week ended March 9. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
136,000 to 1.78 million in the week ended March 2.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
held at 2.4 percent in the week ended March 9. Thirty-three
states and territories reported a decrease in claims, while 20
reported an increase.  Employment Gains  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Payrolls increased by 236,000 workers in February after
growing by 119,000 in January, according to Labor Department
figures released earlier this month. The  jobless rate  dropped
unexpectedly last month to 7.7 percent, the lowest level since
December 2008, from 7.9 percent.  Fed policy makers yesterday said they will continue to buy
securities at a pace of $85 billion a month to spur economic
growth and reduce unemployment.  The Fed “continues to see downside risks to the economic
outlook,” according to the Federal Open Market Committee’s
statement. It also said “labor market conditions have shown
signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate
remains elevated.”  Fed’s Bernanke  When asked yesterday at a press conference following the
announcement whether the progress is close to warranting a
slowing in the pace of asset purchases, Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said policy makers need to see persistent strength in
the labor market.  “One thing we would need to be sure is that this is not a
temporary improvement,” Bernanke said. “An improvement
criterion is not just the improvement we have seen but is it
going to be sustained.”  Among companies reducing staff, BlackRock Inc., the world’s
biggest money manager, said March 19 that it is cutting about
300 jobs now and in coming months. AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K.’s
second-biggest drugmaker, said March 18 it will cut 650
positions in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
