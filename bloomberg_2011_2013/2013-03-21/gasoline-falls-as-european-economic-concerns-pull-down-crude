Gasoline slipped after crude fell
as Europe’s service and manufacturing sectors contracted and
debate over a bailout for Cyprus threatened the euro region’s
economic stability.  Futures retreated as the  European Central Bank  threatened
to cut emergency funds to Cyprus banks and  euro-area services
and manufacturing output  contracted more than economists
estimated in March. In the U.S., first-time jobless claims
increased less than forecast last week and sales of existing
homes climbed in February to a three-year high.  “The jobs numbers were good but the European data is
weighing on the market because it reiterates the fact that the
problems in Europe are larger than Cyprus,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for April delivery fell 2.32 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0931 a gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 4.8 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Crude oil for May delivery on the Nymex declined 60 cents
to $92.90 a barrel while  Brent crude  for May delivery on the
London ICE Futures exchanged retreated 57 cents to $108.15.  A composite index based on a survey of European  purchasing
managers  fell to 46.5 from 47.9 in February, London-based Markit
Economics said today. Economists had forecast a reading of 48.2,
according to the median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Unemployment Benefits  Applications for U.S.  jobless benefits  increased by 2,000
to 336,000 in the week ended March 16, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists projected 340,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The monthly average,
which smoothes the week-to-week volatility, dropped to the
lowest level since February 2008.  Heating oil for April delivery declined 0.7 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $2.8851 a gallon on volume that was 49 percent less
than the 100-day average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to
$3.691 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
