Hog futures dropped for the third
time this week on signs that supplies of animals available to
U.S. slaughtering plants are exceeding demand for pork. Cattle
were little changed.  Wholesale  pork  fell 2.6 percent to a six-month low of 76.41
cents a pound yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. The cost of  hogs  for immediate delivery at processing
plants fell for a seventh straight session yesterday to 71.07
cents a pound, the lowest since Sept. 21, USDA data show.  “There’s just a lot of hogs out there,” Dick Quiter, an
account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “Domestic demand seems to be a little
on the light side.”  Hog futures for June settlement dropped 0.4 percent to
88.15 cents a pound at 9:32 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract is down 3.6 percent this month after a
6.8 percent drop in February.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.21775 a pound on the CME. The price is down 7.9 percent this
year through yesterday.  Beef-export sales totaled 15,333 metric tons (33.8 million
pounds) in the week ended March 14, down 22 percent from the
four-week average, USDA data showed today.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement were little
changed at $1.399 a pound in  Chicago , fluctuating between gains
and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
