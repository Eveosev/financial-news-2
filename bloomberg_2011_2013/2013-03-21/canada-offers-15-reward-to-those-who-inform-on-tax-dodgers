Canada is offering rewards to
people who inform on tax dodgers.  The Canada Revenue Agency will pay 15 percent of any tax
recovered in cases where the amount owing exceeds C$100,000
($97,500), Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today in his 2013
budget. The awards will be paid only on  tax evasion  involving
property located or transferred outside Canada, or transactions
conducted at least partly abroad.  “What we’re after is people hiding their money offshore,”
Flaherty told reporters in Ottawa.  The government said it will raise C$4.4 billion in revenue
over six years by closing tax loopholes and making the tax
system fairer.  Changes include a plan to limit the distribution of
domestic profits to foreign shareholders through tax-deductible
interest payments. The government will also ensure that
derivative transactions can’t be used to convert taxable income
into  capital gains  taxed a lower rate.  Most of the changes will only affect individuals with
annual incomes above C$500,000, David Mason, an Ottawa-based tax
partner at Deloitte  Canada , said in an interview.  “These are the most such measures I’ve seen in one
budget,” said Mason. “They certainly seem to be getting
serious.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
