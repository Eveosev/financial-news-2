Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s sale of its BHF-
Bank unit inched forward after all members of the group seeking
to acquire the business submitted documents for the proposed
deal to Germany’s banking regulator.  Bafin is examining whether one submission is complete, Sven Gebauer, a spokesman for the Bonn-based regulator, said in a
telephone interview today. The authority will have 60 days to
decide if the deal is viable once it notifies the bidders that
the documents are complete, Gebauer said, declining to say when
that will take place and without naming the party.  Deutsche Bank, continental  Europe ’s biggest bank, agreed to
sell the wealth management and investment-banking operation for
384 million euros ($496 million) to a group led by Belgian
financial services company  RHJ International (RHJI)  in September.  Fosun Group, AQTON SE, the investment vehicle of German
entrepreneur Stefan Quandt, entities affiliated with Timothy C. Collins and investment funds managed or sub-advised by  BlackRock
Inc. (BLK)  will inject capital into RHJ’s Kleinwort Benson unit, which
will then acquire BHF-Bank, Brussels-based RHJ International
said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
