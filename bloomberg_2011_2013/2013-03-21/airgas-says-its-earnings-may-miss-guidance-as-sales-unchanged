(Corrects description of period in first paragraph.)  Airgas Inc. (ARG) , the largest U.S.
distributor of packaged gases, said it may miss earnings
guidance for its fiscal fourth-quarter ending March 31 after
“organic” sales growth was flat through February.  Unless the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based company sees a
“strong” finish to the quarter, the disappointing sales
numbers suggest Airgas may miss the low end of its adjusted
earnings guidance of $1.18 to $1.24 a share by about 4 percent,
Executive Chairman  Peter McCausland  said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
