The  European Central Bank  warned
that companies are running out of time to implement payment
structures that are in line with region-wide standards.  “A number of companies have adopted very late internal
deadlines” to migrate toward the Single Euro Payment Area, or
SEPA, the ECB said today in a report. “This is a source of
concern,” it said. “More worryingly, small and medium
enterprises’ and local public administrations’ awareness of SEPA
is still fragmented and the level of preparedness is rather
poor.”  SEPA enables customers to make euro transfers across
borders within  Europe  using a single payment account and a
single set of payment instruments. Thirty-two European countries
are participating in SEPA.  Companies have until Feb. 1 2014 to migrate to SEPA credit
transfers and SEPA direct debits, the ECB said. It urged all
stakeholders to make the transition “at the earliest stage
possible, preferably by the third quarter of 2013 at the
latest,” to avoid disruption in the handling of payment orders.  “Adapting to SEPA involves adjusting a lot of technical
and business procedures over a limited period of time,” ECB
Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said in a statement.
“Projects of this kind should not be left to the last moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
