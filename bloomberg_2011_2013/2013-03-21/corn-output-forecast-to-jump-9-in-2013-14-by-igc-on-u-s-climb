World corn production is forecast
to climb 9 percent in the 2013-14 crop year, with the U.S.
harvest predicted to rise as much as 30 percent this year, the
International Grains Council forecast.  Global corn stocks may jump 19 percent from a 16-year low
expected at the end of the 2012-13 crop year, as output rises
faster than consumption, the London-based council wrote in an e-
mailed report today.  Corn prices in  Chicago  have dropped 14 percent from a
record in August on expectations of increased U.S. production,
while wheat has slumped 23 percent from a July peak.  For corn, “assuming normal weather, production is
projected to rebound sharply in 2013-14,” the IGC wrote. “Led
by sharp increase in the U.S., exporter stocks are expected to
recover to an eight-year high.”  The IGC repeated an outlook for world wheat production to
rise 4 percent. A recovery in global wheat use will leave
“little room” to rebuild stocks, with inventories forecast to
climb by 5 million metric tons in 2013-14, according to the IGC.  World corn production is expected to be 850.4 million tons
in 2012-13, little changed from the forecast a month ago, while
falling from 876.9 million tons a year earlier. Stocks are
predicted to be 114 million tons at the end of the season,
unchanged from last month’s forecast.  The outlook for  Argentina ’s corn crop was cut by 1 million
tons to 26 million tons, while production estimates were raised
for  Turkey ,  Thailand  and  India . The forecast for U.S. shipments
was cut to 22 million tons, 1.5 tons less than predicted in
February, while the outlook for  Brazil ’s shipments was lifted by
1 million tons to 27 million tons.  Wheat Production  World production of wheat may be 655.7 million tons, also
little changed from the council’s previous forecast. The outlook
for Argentina’s crop of the grain was reduced to 10 million tons
from 10.5 million tons.  World wheat carryover stocks are seen at 177 million tons
at the end of 2012-13, compared with a February outlook for
inventories of 176 million tons.  Soybean production in 2012-13 may be 266 million tons, 3
million tons less than forecast in February, the IGC said. The
global rice harvest may amount to 468 million tons, compared
with last month’s prediction of 466 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
