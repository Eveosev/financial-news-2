Nation Media Group Ltd. (NMG) ,  East
Africa ’s biggest news company, rose to the highest level in
almost five years after profit growth in 2012 beat estimates.  The stock surged 5.9 percent to 304 shillings by 1:06 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi, the highest since July 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 3.7 times the average
daily volume of shares were traded.  Nation Media earned 15.9 shillings ($0.19) a share, while
the median estimate was for 13.9 shillings a share, according to
a survey of two analysts by Bloomberg. The company increased its
dividend to 10 shillings a share from 8 shillings a year earlier
and will offer a bonus share of one for every five held,
Chairman Wilfred Kiboro said yesterday.  “The company has been very consistent in its financial
performance,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview. “When
you combine that with the bonus offer it shows you that
management is confident about performance in 2013.”  Profit jumped 25 percent as advertising revenue climbed.
Net income grew to 2.5 billion shillings ($29.2 million) in the
12 months through December, from 2 billion shillings a year
earlier, Chief Executive Officer Linus Gitahi said yesterday.
Sales rose 10 percent to 12.3 billion shillings, he said.  Nation Media has rallied 39 percent this year, compared
with a 21 percent rally for the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
