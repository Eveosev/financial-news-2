Middle distillate  inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
7.9 percent to the lowest level in more than five months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Supplies of gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene dropped by
795,000 barrels to 9.2 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the lowest since the week ended Oct. 3.  Onshore  residual-fuel  stockpiles including  fuel oil  and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen declined by
145,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to 18.5 million, the ministry’s
data showed. The volume fell for a third week to the lowest
since the period ended Jan. 23.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rose for the first time in four weeks. Stockpiles
gained 1.32 million barrels, or 14 percent, to 11.1 million, the
highest level since Jan. 23.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
