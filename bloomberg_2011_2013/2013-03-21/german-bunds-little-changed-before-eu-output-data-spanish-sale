Italian bonds rose, erasing their
decline since euro-area policy makers proposed an unprecedented
levy on Cypriot bank deposits, as investors bet the turmoil in
the region’s third-smallest economy will be contained.  Spanish securities advanced for a second day as the nation
sold 4.5 billion euros ($5.81 billion) at a debt auction,
exceeding its target. German bunds gained, with 10-year yields
falling toward an 11-week low, as the Cypriot central bank
denied a report that Cyprus Popular Bank Plc would be shut and
proceeds from the sale of assets returned to depositors.  “The contagion risks from Cyprus have been deemed less
immediately relevant,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “Spain
and  Italy  have stabilized as people have realized there isn’t
any particular implication for those countries.”  Italian 10-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.59 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
dropping nine basis points yesterday. The rate had climbed 13
basis points on the first two days of this week. The 5.5 percent
bond due in November 2022 rose 0.375, or 3.75 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 107.42.  Spanish 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 4.88
percent after falling as much as 13 basis points, the biggest
decline since March 8.  The Cypriot Cabinet is discussing an investment fund
intended to help raise the 5.8 billion euros needed to activate
emergency loans, Athens News Agency reported. Finance Minister
Michael Sarris said in Moscow that while Russia won’t lend money
to Cyprus, it’s looking at investment in the  energy industry .  Cyprus Bonds  Cyprus’s government bonds rose for a second day, with the
yield on the 4.625 percent security due February 2020 falling 15
basis points to 12.06 percent. The rate is still 339 basis
points higher this week. The bid price was 66.534 while the
offer price was 69.259.  The German 10-year bund yield fell two basis points to 1.37
percent after declining to 1.34 percent on March 19, the lowest
level since Jan. 2.  The ECB said it will cut Cypriot banks off from emergency
funds, known as ELA, after March 25 unless the Mediterranean
nation agrees on a bailout with the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund .  The Central Bank of Cyprus hasn’t been informed of any
decision to close Cyprus Popular Bank, central bank spokesperson
Aliki Stylianou said in a statement to state-run CYBC.  Spanish Auction  Spain  sold a combined 4.51 billion euros of two-, five- and
10-year securities, more than its target of 4 billion euros. The
10-year bonds were auctioned at 4.898 percent, compared with
4.917 percent at the previous sale on March 7. The two-year
yield dropped to 2.275 percent from 2.54 percent on Feb. 21.  “All lines were well received despite the recent turmoil
across the EMU periphery’s debt,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-
income analyst at Newedge Strategy in London, wrote in a note to
clients. “Dealers probably hope that the Cyprus bailout will be
sorted out soon, given that even the ECB has warned the country
that the ELA funding would be suspended early next week, should
an agreement fail to be reached.”  France sold 8 billion euros of notes due 2015 and 2018, as
well as 1.48 billion euros of inflation-linked securities.
Ireland auctioned 500 million euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 0.24 percent.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 0.1 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish bonds returned 3.4 percent, while French
securities fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
