Infraestructura Energetica Nova
SAB, a Mexican unit of U.S. natural-gas utility  Sempra Energy (SRE) ,
priced an initial public offering at the top of its projected
range, two people with knowledge of the transaction said.  Nova sold shares at 34 pesos each in Mexico City, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the transaction terms
have not been publicly disclosed. The company had said in a
 regulatory filing  that it planned to sell the shares in a range
of 30 pesos to 34 pesos.  The company planned to raise as much as 7 billion pesos
($563 million) including the so-called greenshoe option for
underwriters to buy additional shares, according to the
prospectus.  Doug Kline, a San Diego-based spokesman for Sempra Energy,
declined to comment on the share price.  Local units of  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and Credit Suisse Group AG helped manage the sale.  Investor orders for the shares totaled more than 10 times
the amount offered, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
