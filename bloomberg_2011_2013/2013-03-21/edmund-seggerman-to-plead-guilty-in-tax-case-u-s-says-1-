Edmund Seggerman will plead guilty
to hiding assets from tax authorities in a Swiss bank account, a
U.S. prosecutor in  Manhattan  said.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula told a magistrate
judge that Seggerman, who was charged today with conspiracy and
filing false estate tax and income tax returns, will plead
guilty this afternoon and is cooperating with prosecutors.  Seggerman is expected to testify against Michael Little, a
U.K. citizen who is an attorney and financial adviser.
Prosecutors claim Little worked with an unnamed Swiss lawyer to
help U.S. citizens set up and maintain offshore bank accounts in
 Switzerland  and elsewhere to hide assets from the  Internal
Revenue Service .  The government claims Seggermanâ€™s father, a New York
businessman who died in 2001, left a $24 million estate, more
than half of which was held in undeclared foreign accounts. Two
other children, Suzanne Seggerman and Yvonne Seggerman, have
been charged in the case, according to court records.  Edmund Seggerman surrendered to authorities this morning,
Okula said in court.  The case is U.S. v. Seggerman, 12-cr-216, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
