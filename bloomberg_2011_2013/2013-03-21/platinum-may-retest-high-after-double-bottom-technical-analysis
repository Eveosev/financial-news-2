Platinum may rise 4 percent to
challenge this year’s high reached in February after forming a
“double bottom,” according to Hiroyuki Kikukawa of Nihon
Unicom Inc.  The price of the metal for immediate delivery could reach
$1,647 an ounce on a closing basis after hitting the first low
of $1,568.75 on March 4 and the second of $1,557.25 on March 19,
said Kikukawa, the general manager of research at the Tokyo-
based brokerage. Spot platinum rose 0.3 percent to $1,584.50 an
ounce at 1:18 p.m. Tokyo time.  Platinum, used to make autocatalysts and jewelry, has risen
2.9 percent this year, outperforming gold and silver, on
increased demand from the auto industry and amid supply
disruptions at mines. A double bottom is a chart pattern showing
a drop in price, followed by a rebound and then another decline
to near the same level, usually indicating support.  “Technically, platinum still remains bullish,” after
touching an almost seven-month low of $1,385.00 on July 24,
2012, Kikukawa said. The price may reach $1,626 in the short
term, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement from the March 19
low, according to Kikukawa.  Fibonacci studies are based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. In
technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
