The Miami Heat overcame a 27-point
second-half deficit to defeat the  Cleveland  Cavaliers 98-95 and
win their 24th straight game, extending the second-longest
victory streak in National Basketball Association history.  LeBron James had 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter
for the Heat, who had rallied from a 17-point deficit to win
their 23rd straight two nights ago at  Boston . The three-time NBA
Most Valuable Player also had 12 rebounds and 10 assists.  Miami improved its NBA-best record to 53-14. Only the
1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers have a longer streak, with 33
consecutive victories.  Cleveland finished the second quarter with a 23-3 run to
take a 21-point halftime lead, outscoring the Heat 23-10 in that
period.  The Cavaliers led by 27 points with about seven minutes
left in the third period before Shane Battier made a trio of 3-
pointers to pull Miami within nine points entering the fourth
quarter.  James, 28, had eight straight points as Miami opened the
final period with a 9-0 run to tie the game 77-77, and he added
a 3-pointer to give Miami an 80-79 lead. The Heat, who have not
lost since Feb. 3, did not trail again.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
