Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought a
cargo of North Sea Forties crude, bringing its total for the
week to five. Trafigura Beheer BV sold CPC blend.  Nigeria raised its April official selling price for
benchmark Bonny Light and Qua Iboe crudes to the highest in 17
months, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said in an e-mailed
statement.  North Sea  Shell bought Forties lot F0403 from BP Plc for loading
April 4-6, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with
a deal yesterday at a 15 cent discount to the benchmark.  Vitol Group failed to find a buyer for Forties consignment
F0407 loading April 10-12 at 30 cents less than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 10 cents to a discount of 22 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $107.71 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.82 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $107.28, a discount of 43 cents to May.  Four Forties cargoes for loading next month have been
advanced by two to nine days, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified
as the information is confidential.  There are no production issues at the Ekofisk oil field
even as two cargoes have been dropped from the April loading
schedule and seven lots from this month’s program have been
delayed, according to the operator ConocoPhillips.  “There are no issues with the fields,” Stig Kvendseth, a
Stavanger, Norway-based spokesman for ConocoPhillips, said today
by e-mail.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP bought 85,000 metric tons of CPC Blend from Trafigura at
70 cents less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,
 Italy , the Platts survey showed. That compares with a cargo
Trafigura sold on Feb. 7 at a 90 cent discount.  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals grade for a
third day, according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 3 cents to $1.34 a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the smallest differential since Feb. 20.
In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.94 a barrel,
compared with $1.92 in the previous session.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 2 cents to $3.22
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 28.  The selling prices for Bonny Light and Qua Iboe grades were
set at $3 a barrel premium to Dated Brent, according to the
statement. That’s up from $2.20 this month and is the most since
November 2011.  Ghana plans to keep exports of its Jubilee crude in May
unchanged for a third month at three cargoes of 950,000 barrels
each, according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Equatorial Guinea plans to boost exports of its Zafiro
crude to three cargoes of 950,000 barrels each in May, one more
than next month, a separate loading program showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
