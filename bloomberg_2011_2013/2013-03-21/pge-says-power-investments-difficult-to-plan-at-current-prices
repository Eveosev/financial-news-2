Poland’s record-low power prices
are forcing utilities to reconsider their investments in new
capacity, according to Monika Morawiecka, head of strategy at
 PGE SA (PGE) , the country’s largest electricity company.  Power prices plunged 16 percent in 2012, more than any
other EU country, as electricity demand fell for the first time
in three years, according to the nation’s grid operator. The
price of power for 2014 declined 9.3 percent this year and sank
to a record 161.90 zloty a megawatt-hour yesterday.  The average cost of running a coal plant for 7,500 hours a
year is about 200 zloty a megawatt-hour, and about 300 zloty if
the station operates 5,000 hours a year, Morawiecka said today
at a parliamentary hearing on Poland’s power industry. “This is
something we have to face,” she said.  PGE is considering whether to build its 11.6 billion-zloty
($3.6 billion) 1,800-megawatt coal-fired plant in Opole as it
reviews investments in the current market conditions, the
Warsaw-based company said March 14. Falling prices pushed PGE to
write down almost the entire value, or 1.49 billion zloty, of
its 1.5 gigawatt Dolna Odra plant last month.  The utility halted 348 megawatts of natural gas-fired power
capacity in two plants this week, due to high fuel costs and low
electricity prices, PGE’s Morawiecka told reporters after the
hearing.  Cold Reserve  As much as 6,600 megawatts of power capacity in  Poland  will
be cut by 2020, according to grid manager PSE SA. While almost
6,500 megawatts of capacity will be built by that time, the pace
of decommissioning old plants will be faster and the country
faces the risk of a supply deficit in 2014 to 2016, Henryk
Majchrzak, PSE’s chief executive, said at today’s hearing.  To cover the potential power deficit and contain utilities’
costs, the grid manager plans to compensate producers for
keeping older, loss-making units on standby. A tender for the
so-called “cold” reserve is expected to be announced in the
first half of the year, PSE’s Majchrzak said.  “We’re considering two scenarios of about 1,000 megawatts
and 1,400 megawatts of capacity that would otherwise be closed
after 2015,” Majchrzak said.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) , PGE’s biggest competitor, is also
making losses on some of its facilities, Stanislaw Tokarski, the
head of Tauron’s generation unit, said at the hearing.  Tauron would be interested in offering as much as six 120-
megawatt units as “cold” reserve for the grid manager,
Tokarski said.  “We have a surplus of electricity on the market but are
faced with capacity shortfalls in the future,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
