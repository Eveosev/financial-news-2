Japanese  stocks (TPX)  rose in the first day
of 2012 trading, with the  Topix (TPX)  Index posting its biggest gain
in 10 weeks, after reports from the U.S. and Germany added to
signs the global economy is weathering  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics,  gained 1.6 percent.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  jumped 5.6
percent after a report the money-losing chipmaker is in talks
with Toshiba Corp. to integrate operations. Nomura Holdings Inc.

year’s worst performing group. The Nikkei 225 climbed 1.2
percent to 8,560.11. Japanese markets were closed Jan. 2-3 for
the New Year’s holiday.  “The U.S. has been surprising people with some pretty good
numbers and that’s helped to lift the mood, which had gotten too
pessimistic,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $68 billion.
“Today is just one day, but it’s a little New Year’s gift.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  advanced 1.6 percent
yesterday in  New York  to its highest level since Oct. 28 as
manufacturing across the globe recovered in December. Futures on
the gauge were little changed today.  Manufacturing Gains  Factory output in the U.S. grew in December at the fastest
pace in six months, according to the Tempe, Arizona-based
Institute for Supply Management. Separate reports this week also
showed Australian manufacturing expanded for the first time
since June, while similar Chinese and German data beat estimates.  “Concerns about the global economic future are receding,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko

year’s trading on a positive note.”  Sony gained 1.6 percent to 1,404 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)

will increase 6.7 percent this year, led by Chinese demand,
market researcher R.L. Polk & Co. said yesterday.  Investors surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the Topix will

three years lure buyers. Stocks on the gauge trade at an average
of 0.9 times book value, compared with 1.4 on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and 2.1 for the  S&P 500 Index .  Japanese stocks plunged last year amid a surge in the yen,
