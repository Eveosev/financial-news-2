The  Golden State Warriors  are close
to signing free agent guard  Nate Robinson , the San Francisco
Chronicle  reported , citing people familiar with the National
Basketball Association team.  An e-mail sent to Warriors spokesman Raymond Ridder before
business hours wasn’t immediately returned.  Robinson, 5-feet-9 with a 43.5-inch vertical leap that
helped him win three NBA Slam Dunk contests as a member of the
New York Knicks, may be signed in time to play against the  Los
Angeles Lakers  on Jan. 6, the newspaper said.  The  Warriors  need help at point guard, where Stephen Curry
has been plagued by foul trouble, and the team has used second-
year guard Ish Smith and rookie Charles Jenkins to back him up.  Robinson, 27, has averaged 11.3 points and 2.6 assists in
six seasons with the Knicks,  Boston Celtics  and Oklahoma City
Thunder. He didn’t report to camp last month and the Thunder
bought him out of his contract on Dec. 24, the newspaper said.  Golden State has a record of 2-3 this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
