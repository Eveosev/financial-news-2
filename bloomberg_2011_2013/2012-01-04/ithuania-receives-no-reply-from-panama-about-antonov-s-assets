Lithuanian prosecutors haven’t gotten
a reply from Panamanian authorities to their requests to freeze
domestic assets owned by  Vladimir Antonov , a former  Bankas
Snoras AB (SRS1L)  shareholder.  The request for legal assistance was sent on Dec. 13
through Interpol, Ruta Dirsiene, a spokeswoman for the
Prosecutor General’s office in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital,
said today in an e-mailed reply to questions.  The Panamanian banking regulator, the Superintendency,
authorized the sale of Antonov’s 85.2 percent stake in Banco
Trasatlantico SA to minority shareholders, all Panamanian, on
Dec. 14, the regulator said in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg
questions. Banco Trasatlantico “continues to carry out its
operations in a regular and usual manner,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
