TV18 Broadcast Ltd. (TV18)  climbed to the
highest in five weeks in Mumbai trading after announcing
yesterday that billionaire Mukesh Ambani will help it acquire 12
regional television channels.  Shares of  TV18 (TV18)  surged as much as 20 percent to 40.40 rupees,
the highest intraday level since Nov. 30, and traded at 37.45
rupees as of 10:48 a.m. local time.  Network 18 Media &
Investments Ltd. (NETM) , the group’s holding company, rose as much as
19 percent to 55.50 rupees, the highest since Nov. 11.  The two companies owned by Network 18 Group will offer
rights shares to raise as much as 27 billion rupees ($508
million) each to fund the acquisition and reduce debt, TV18 and
Network 18 said in filings to the exchanges yesterday. A trust
set up by Ambani’s  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  will help the
founders including Raghav Bahl pay for their portion of the
proposed rights offer, Reliance said in a statement.  Network 18’s purchase of Eenadu Group’s assets for 21
billion rupees will help Reliance’s subsidiary, Infotel
Broadband Services Ltd., secure content from the company which
runs CNBC-TV18, Colors and Nickelodeon in  India , for high-speed
4G data services it plans to start this year.  The unit of Reliance, India’s biggest company by market
value, is seeking partnerships after spending 128.5 billion
rupees to acquire licenses to provide the mobile services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
