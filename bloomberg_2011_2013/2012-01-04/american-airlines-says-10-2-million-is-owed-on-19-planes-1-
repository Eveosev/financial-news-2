AMR Corp. (AMR) , the owner of  American
Airlines  that filed for bankruptcy last year, said it plans to
keep 19 planes on which $10.2 million is owed for rent or debt
payments under aircraft agreements.  AMR listed the planes and the amounts owed in a filing
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. The filing
listed another 28 planes on which the company said it didn’t owe
any money. AMR has more than 900 planes in its fleet.  Once the world’s largest airline, AMR, based in  Fort Worth ,
Texas, filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 29, listing  debt (AMR)  of almost
$30 billion. The airline last month won court permission to
pursue a deal to buy 32 planes from Boeing Co. through 2012, and
to reject leases on some aircraft as it reorganizes with a more
competitive fleet.  The company “believes that the market values of, and
market leases for, many of the aircraft have changed
substantially since the aircraft were originally leased or
financed,” AMR said in a Dec. 8 filing.  In yesterday’s filing, the company listed the amounts that
it believes must be paid to cure any defaults in the payment of
basic rent or debt service under the aircraft agreements.  For each of the 19 planes listed as requiring cure
payments, the amount was about $500,000.  The airline warned creditors if objections to the amounts
owed aren’t received by deadlines set in the  bankruptcy code ,
they would be barred from making claims in relation to those
amounts.  AMR is now the  third-largest (AMR)  U.S. airline company.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
