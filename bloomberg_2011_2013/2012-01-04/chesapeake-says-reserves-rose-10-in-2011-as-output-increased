Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said proved
reserves rose 10 percent to the equivalent of 18.8 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas in 2011 as production increased.  Average daily output was equivalent to 3.27 billion cubic
feet of gas, 15 percent more than in 2010, Chesapeake, based in
Oklahoma City, said today in a statement.  Chesapeake has been selling stakes in gas and oil projects
to fund expansion and reduce debt. Debt net of cash at year-end
2011 was $10.2 billion, $1.4 billion less than on Sept. 30 and
$2.2 billion less than a year earlier, the company said. Debt
will fall to $9.5 billion by year-end 2012 regardless of the
price of gas, it said.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Chesapeake rose 5.9 percent to $23.60 yesterday in
New York after announcing that  Total SA (FP) , the largest French  oil
company , plans to pay $2.03 billion in cash and drilling costs
for a 25 percent stake of leases in Ohioâ€™s Utica Shale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
