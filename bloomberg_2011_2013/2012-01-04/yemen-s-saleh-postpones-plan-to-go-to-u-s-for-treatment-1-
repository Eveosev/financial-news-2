Yemen’s outgoing president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has postponed his planned visit to the U.S. for
medical treatment, the state-run Saba news agency said.  Members of Saleh’s General People’s Congress party proposed
the delay today because of fears it would lead to instability,
Saba said. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets
Dec. 30 demanding that Saleh and his relatives be prosecuted for
the killings of more than 1,140 people since an uprising against
his government last January.  Saleh said Dec. 24 that he would leave for the U.S. and let
an interim government prepare for an election to replace him.
The president agreed to step down in November after returning
from medical treatment in  Saudi Arabia  for treatment of wounds
he sustained during an assassination attempt in June.  State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Dec. 27 that
Saleh’s request to come to the U.S. was being considered and
would only be granted if the visit is for medical treatment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
