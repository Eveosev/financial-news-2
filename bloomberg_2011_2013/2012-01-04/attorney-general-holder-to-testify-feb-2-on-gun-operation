U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
will testify about a federal gun operation before a House panel
whose chairman accused the  Justice Department  of “shameful”
conduct related to the matter.  Holder will appear Feb. 2 before the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee to discuss the “Fast and Furious”
program, which allowed illegal U.S. gun purchases in an effort
to link the weapons to Mexican drug cartels, the panel said
today.  The chairman of the committee is Representative  Darrell Issa , a California Republican, who has been investigating the
operation. It will be the third time Holder testifies before a
congressional panel about Fast and Furious since November.  Two of about 2,000 guns that the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed to be carried away were
found at the scene of the December 2010 murder of U.S. Border
Patrol agent Brian Terry in  Arizona , according to a
congressional report. ATF is part of the Justice Department.  The ATF program was “reckless” and shouldn’t have gone
forward, Holder said during Dec. 8 testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee. Holder asked the department’s inspector
general to examine the matter.  “The Department of Justice’s conduct in the investigation
of Operation Fast and Furious has been nothing short of
shameful,” Issa said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
