U.S. stocks rose, erasing an early
drop, as improving sales at retailers and carmakers helped
bolster confidence in the economy. Treasury 10-year yields
touched 2 percent for the first time in a week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,277.30 at 4 p.m. in New York after losing 0.7 percent
earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 21.04 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 12,418.42. Ten-year Treasury yields added as
much as six basis points to 2.01 percent before trading at 1.98
percent. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities added 0.5 percent as
natural gas and heating oil rose at least 1.9 percent and crude
jumped to the highest since May. The dollar climbed versus 13 of
16 major peers. Banks led European stocks lower.  The S&P 500 added to yesterday’s 1.6 percent rally as Ford
Motor Co. jumped after December sales beat estimates to help
U.S. carmakers cap their best year since 2008, while the
International Council of Shopping Centers increased its estimate
for last month’s same-store sales. U.S. equities followed
European shares lower earlier as UniCredit SpA’s plan to sell
shares fueled concern European banks need to raise capital to
weather the debt crisis.  “We started the day with a bit of a pullback from
yesterday’s strong rise and then the data that we got this
morning helps the market and firms up the conviction that the
 U.S. economy  is doing well,”  Giri Cherukuri , head trader for
Oakbrook Investments, which manages $2.7 billion in Lisle,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “For the first few
days in 2012 people don’t seem to be worried about the European
threat.”  Consumer Shares Rally  The S&P 500 closed today at the highest level since Oct. 28
and the Dow ended at the highest since July 26.    Companies that rely on discretionary  consumer spending 
climbed 0.7 percent as a group to lead gains among  10 industries (SPXL1) 
as Ford, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. rallied at least 1.4
percent. Ford’s December light-vehicle deliveries rose 10
percent to 209,447, exceeding the average estimate for a 7.7
percent gain. General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC also
reported vehicle sales that beat estimates.  Retail sales at stores open more than a year may have
gained as much as 4.5 percent in December, more than a previous
estimate of as much as 4 percent, the ICSC said in a statement
today. Sales at retail chains last week rose 5.3 percent from a
year earlier, according to the New York-based researcher.  Consumer-discretionary  companies (S5COND) , a group that includes
retailers, clothing makers and hotel and restaurant chains,
climbed 4.4 percent in 2011 for the fourth-best advance among
the 10 main groups in the  S&P 500 , which ended the year almost
unchanged.  Netflix Jumps  Netflix Inc., owner of the streaming and DVD-by-mail
service, jumped 11 percent after reporting online viewing that
surpassed an analyst’s estimate. Financial shares in the S&P 500
pared earlier declines, ending down 0.5 percent.  Natural gas rallied 3.4 percent to lead commodities higher
amid forecasts for colder-than-normal weather in the U.S.
northeast. Crude oil climbed 0.3 percent to $103.22 a barrel as
European Union governments moved closer to halting purchases
from  Iran .  Banks lost 1.6 percent to lead declines in the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP) , which slipped 0.6 percent after reaching a five-month
high yesterday. UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s largest bank, tumbled 14
percent to 5.42 euros, the lowest closing price since 1992, as
the bank said it will sell new shares in a 7.5 billion euro
($9.8 billion) offer to strengthen its capital position.  European Yields  Portugal ’s two-year note yield extended declines after
borrowing costs dropped at a bill sale, dropping 152 basis
points to 14.57 percent. The government sold 1 billion euros of
three-month bills at average yield of 4.346 percent, down from
4.873 percent at a previous auction.  Germany ’s 10-year debt yield rose three basis points to
1.92 percent. The government sold 4.06 billion euros of bonds,
after getting bids for 5.14 billion euros, more than the maximum
sales target of 5 billion euros, at an average yield of 1.93
percent.  The yield on  Spain ’s 10-year bonds rose 15 basis points,
sending the difference in yield with bunds 12 basis points wider
to 3.51 percentage points.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government may apply
for loans from the European Union’s rescue fund and the
 International Monetary Fund  to help restructure the country’s
financial industry, Expansion reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. Spain has no plans to seek
external help to fund its overhaul of the industry, said Carmen
Martinez Castro, the deputy minister for communication.  The euro weakened 0.8 percent against the yen as it
declined against 13 of 16 major peers. The yen strengthened
against 15 of its 16 most-traded peers.  ‘Adjustment Process’  “The euro zone is in a long-term adjustment process,”
 Neil Mellor , a strategist at Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. in
 London , said in a report. “Whether certain member states will
be prepared to stick it out for the long run should they ride
out the liquidity crisis relatively unscathed remains to be
seen.”  Euro-area banks parked 453.2 billion euros with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 446 billion euros the
previous day. That’s the highest since the euro’s introduction
in 1999. Banks are depositing excess cash back with the ECB at
the overnight rate of 0.25 percent, rather than lending it for
more elsewhere.  Hungary’s forint fell to as weak as 321.68 against the
euro, a record, on speculation that a resumption in talks with
the IMF and the European Union on financial assistance will be
delayed. The EU currently has no plans to resume aid talks with
 Hungary , European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said
yesterday. The BUX Index of stocks lost 2.4 percent.  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
listed in  Hong Kong  lost 1.4 percent and the Shanghai Composite
Index fell 1.4 percent, in its first day of trading for the
year. China’s home prices fell for a fourth month in December
and Premier  Wen Jiabao  said business conditions may be
“relatively difficult” this quarter. Benchmark indexes gained
more than 1 percent in Thailand and  Indonesia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
