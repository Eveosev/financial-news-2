Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI)  and three
executives, including Chief Executive Officer Brian Pardo, were
accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of
misleading shareholders.  Pardo, General Counsel Scott Peden and Chief Financial
Officer David Martin failed to disclose a “significant” risk
to the company’s business as it was “systematically and
materially underestimating the life expectancy estimates it used
to price transactions,” the SEC said in a statement.  Pardo and Peden were also accused of  insider trading .  Life Partners makes money from brokering transactions
between investors and owners of life insurance policies who want
to sell their policies for a lump-sum payment, according to the
complaint filed today in federal court in Waco,  Texas , where the
company is based. The company systematically underestimated the
life expectancy of policy holders to inflate its revenue, the
SEC said.  “It is very disappointing that the SEC has chosen to
pursue litigation over issues that we believe have no merit,”
Pardo said in a statement. “We intend to vigorously defend
ourselves against these meritless claims.”  The case is SEC v. Life Partners, 12-2, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Texas (Waco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
