Indian stocks dropped for the first
time this week as some investors avoided taking fresh bets ahead
of the corporate earnings season starting next week.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the nation’s second-biggest motorcycle
maker, and  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest mobile services
company, paced decline among their peers. Infosys Ltd., the
second-biggest software maker, will be the first company on the
benchmark  stock index  to report earnings on Jan. 12 for the
three months ended Dec. 31.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.4 percent
to 15,882.64 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai after moving
between gains and losses at least 18 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY) 
Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. declined 0.3
percent to 4,749.65. Both the gauges yesterday jumped the most
since Dec. 21.  “We don’t expect significant moves before the earnings
season as the extent of damage to profits from slowing domestic
demand and Europe’s crisis is not clear,” K.K. Mital, a fund
manager at Globe Capital Market Ltd., said from  New Delhi .  Earnings forecasts for Sensex companies for the year to
March 2012 have fallen 8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share,
the most since the year ended March 2009, according to about
1,500 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Sensex slumped 25
percent last year on concern a weakening rupee, accelerating
inflation and record interest-rate increases would worsen the
effects of the European crisis on company profitability.  India ’s current-account deficit widened to near a record
last quarter, the central bank said on Dec. 30, as a weakening
rupee made imports more expensive. The measure posted a $16.89
billion gap in the three months ended September. The rupee was
Asia’s worst-performing currency in 2011, lifting import prices
in a country that buys 80 percent of its fuel from abroad.  Weak Rupee  “India has a massive trade imbalance and that really
explains why the rupee has been as weak as it has,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in  New York ,
said on Bloomberg Television. “We would expect the Sensex to be
down significantly in 2012,” he said, without forecasting a
level for the index.  Bajaj Auto, which introduced its first four-wheeler
passenger vehicle yesterday, tumbled 4.6 percent to 1,425.55
rupees, its lowest level since Aug. 8. Hero Motocorp Ltd. slid
2.3 percent to 1,786.45 rupees, extending this week’s fall to
6.2 percent. TVS Motor Co. shed 1.2 percent to 48.2 rupees.  “We have moderated our two-wheeler industry growth
assumption from 12 percent to 7 percent” for the year ending in
March 2013, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Jatin Chawla and
Akshay Saxena wrote in a report today.  Stake Auction  State companies  Hindustan Copper Ltd. (HCP)  and  MMTC Ltd. (MMTC)  jumped
after India’s market regulator yesterday allowed company owners
to auction their stakes to investors instead of selling shares
to the public. Hindustan Copper surged 15 percent to 253.2
rupees, taking its four-day rally to 57 percent. MMTC jumped 18
percent to 729.85 rupees after yesterday’s 19 percent advance.  Bharti dropped 3.4 percent to 346.35 rupees, ending a
three-day 5.2 percent rally.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the
biggest household products maker, retreated 3.1 percent to
395.45 rupees. The stock was the best performer last year on the
Sensex with a 30 percent advance.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  declined 1.2 percent to 716.15
rupees. People with knowledge of the matter said the company and
partner  BP Plc (BP/)  won government approval to spend $1.5 billion to
develop gas discoveries.  Overseas funds sold $512 million from Indian equities last
year, compared with a record inflow of $29.4 billion in 2010, as
Europe’s worsening debt crisis prompted investors to flee from
assets perceived as risky. The EU is the Asian country’s biggest
trading partner.  ‘Cheapest 4 Club’  Last year’s plunge in the Sensex means the gauge trades at
13.8 times estimated earnings, down from 19.4 times at the end
of 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at 9.5 times.  Indian equities have joined the “cheapest 4 club” based
on price-to-book and return-on-equity after China, Korea,  Hong
Kong , Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Sakthi Siva wrote
in a report. They upgraded Indian equities to “neutral” from
“underweight.”  Foreign funds bought a net 3.26 billion rupees of stocks
yesterday, turning net buyers, according to the nation’s market
regulator. They purchased 13.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
10.3 billion rupees, ending three days of withdrawals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
