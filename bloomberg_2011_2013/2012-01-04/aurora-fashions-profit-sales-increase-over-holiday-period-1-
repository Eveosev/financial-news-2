Aurora Fashions , the privately-owned
operator of U.K. fashion chains Coast, Warehouse and Oasis, said
same-store sales surged 13 percent over the crucial Christmas
trading period.  Total sales rose 13.5 percent in the five weeks through
Dec. 31, a spokeswoman for the retailer said in an e-mail. Gross
profit climbed 9.2 percent.  Aurora, whose 766 U.K. outlets compete with  Hennes &
Mauritz AB (HMB)  and billionaire  Philip Green ’s Topshop stores, said
that while shopper numbers were down in the run-up to the peak
period, Christmas trading was “strong.” Chief Executive
Officer Mike Shearwood has added a 90-minute delivery service in
the U.K. to lure fashion-conscious young shoppers.  Next Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest clothing retailer, said
today that November and December trading had been
“disappointing” and warned of slack profit growth next year as
the euro-zone debt crisis weighs on consumer spending.  Aurora has 1,278 outlets in 33 countries including the U.S,
Denmark, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia, with total
sales of more than 500 million pounds ($782 million), according
to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
