Danny Care will be left off  England ’s
squad for the Six Nations tournament following his arrest for
drunk driving, the Rugby Football Union said.  Care, 25, was arrested in the early morning of New Year’s
Eve, his second alcohol-related offense in three weeks. England
interim manager Stuart Lancaster made the decision after meeting
with the Harlequins scrum-half, whose actions he called
“completely unacceptable,”  “The club and England are deeply disappointed with Danny’s
actions and will not tolerate this type of behavior,” the RFU
said in a  statement .  Care said in the statement that he “accepted that I made a
very bad decision” and would not contest the charge when he
appears in court Jan. 16.  “I do understand the need for England players to be role
models in the game and have tried to live up to that at all
times, but have made a couple stupid decisions in the past
weeks,” Care, who will also be fined 10,000 pounds ($16,000) by
his club Harlequins, said. “I can only hope for the chance in
the future to prove those decisions were the exception not the
rule. I am devastated because my actions have let so many people
down.”  Care missed last year’s  World Cup  with a foot injury after
helping England capture its first Six Nations title since 2003.
England will announce the Six Nations squad on Jan. 11, with the
opening match in  Scotland  on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
