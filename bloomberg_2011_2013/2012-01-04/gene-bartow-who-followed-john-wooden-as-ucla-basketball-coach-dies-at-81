Gene Bartow, the basketball coach who
succeeded  John Wooden  at UCLA and later began the athletic
program at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, has died after
being diagnosed with stomach cancer. He was 81.  Bartow, who was president of the company that operated the
 National Basketball Association ’s Memphis Grizzlies and the
FedExForum, died last night at his home in Birmingham,  Alabama ,
the school said in a statement. He had cancer since April 2009.  “Coach Bartow is a beloved figure in college basketball
and in the lives of many players and fans,” UAB Athletic
Director Brian Mackin said in a statement. “He was a great man
and dedicated leader who set a standard of excellence for UAB
athletics.”  Bartow, who was inducted into the National Collegiate
Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, coached for 34 years and won
647 games with six different schools.  He led Central Missouri State from 1961-64, Valparaiso from
1964-70, Memphis State from 1970-74 and  Illinois  from 1974-75
before taking over for Wooden at UCLA. Bartow led the Bruins to
a 52-9 record in two seasons and a berth in the 1976 Final Four.  Wooden, who passed away at the age of 99 in 2010, led the 
Bruins to 10 NCAA titles -- including seven straight from 1964-75.   Bartow began the sports program at UAB in 1977, coaching
the basketball team for 18 seasons and serving as the school’s
athletic director for 24. The Blazers made the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 10 times with Bartow
as coach, reaching the final eight in 1982.  The school’s basketball building was renamed Bartow Arena
in his honor in 1997.  Bartow most recently was the president of Hoops LP and
served as an adviser to the NBA’s Grizzlies.  He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and children, Mark, Beth
and Murray.  Funeral arrangements are pending, the school said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
