(Corrects first paragraph to show Bostock made remarks.)  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Chairman Roy Bostock said
he has no plans to take the company private after hiring  Scott Thompson  to become chief executive officer.  Yahoo’s priority is boosting revenue and returning the
company to the forefront of innovation, Thompson said on a
conference call today after the announcement that he will become
CEO four months after the company fired Carol Bartz.  A strategic review won’t slow down with the hiring of
Thompson, Bostock said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
