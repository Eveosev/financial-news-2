  Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc. (JAZZ) , maker of
the narcolepsy drug Xyrem, rose the most in five weeks after
saying the company would update investors tomorrow on its 2012
financial outlook.  Jazz  gained (JAZZ)  5.7 percent to $40.79 at the close of trading
in  New York , the biggest single-day increase since Nov. 30.
Shares of the  Palo Alto , California-based company have more than
doubled in the past year.  Jazz will discuss Xyrem sales, as well as its integration
of Azur Pharma Ltd., the Dublin-based pain drugmaker acquired in
September, on a conference call scheduled at 4:30 p.m. New York
time tomorrow, the company said today in a statement. The
combined company was expected to have sales of more than $475
million in the first 12 months following the closing of the
deal, Jazz and Azur said at the time.  “There’s been no ability to quantify the acquisition, in
terms of what does it mean for current shareholders,”  Steve Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities in Clark,  New Jersey ,
said in an interview. “Now people want to be able to come in
before the news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
