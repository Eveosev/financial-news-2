Gulf Coast  gasoline rose as  Marathon
Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  shut a platformer and other equipment for
maintenance at the Texas City refinery in Texas.  Marathon planned to close the unit that produces high-
octane blending stock for gasoline and a Udex unit today,
according to a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. The work is scheduled to last three days, the filing
showed.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.32 cent to 5.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:58 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
3.13 cents to $2.7254 a gallon.  The premium at the same hub for 93-octane gasoline rose
1.88 cents to 12.88 cents versus futures.  Marathonâ€™s Texas City refinery can process 81,500 barrels
of crude a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
