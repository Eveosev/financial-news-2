Ford Motor Credit Co. (F1) , the finance
unit of the second-largest U.S. automaker, sold $1 billion of
bonds as the pace of car sales quickens.  Ford Motor Credit issued an additional $300 million of its
3.875 percent notes due in January 2015 and $700 million of its
5 percent debt maturing in May 2018, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company initially
issued $1.25 billion of each maturity in separate sales last
year.  U.S. sales of parent Ford Motor Co.’s namesake brand
exceeded 2 million in 2011 for the first year since 2007 amid
signs that growth in the world’s largest economy is gaining
momentum.  Standard & Poor’s  lifted Ford Motor Co. and Ford Motor
Credit’s  debt grade (F1)  on Oct. 21 to BB+, one step below investment
grade, and Moody’s Investors Service raised its rating to an
equivalent Ba1 on Oct. 27.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG
and Morgan Stanley managed the sale, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be identified.  The 3.875 percent notes traded at 100.1 cents on the dollar
at 8:01 a.m. in New York to yield 3.85 percent, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The 5 percent securities traded at 100.4
cents to yield 4.93 percent, Trace data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
