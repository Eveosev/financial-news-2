Koch Supply & Trading Co. booked a
supertanker to haul a cargo of  fuel oil  to Singapore from
Rotterdam, according to data from shipbroker Poten & Partners
Inc.  Koch hired the Al Riqqa, a very large crude carrier, for
$4.25 million, according to New York-based Poten. The cargo of
275,000 metric tons is scheduled to load today, the shipbrokerâ€™s
data showed. Katie Stavinoha, director of public affairs for
Koch, declined to comment when contacted by phone.  A VLCC can hold about 2 million barrels of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
