Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) , the third-biggest
carmaker in  Indonesia , will spend 60 billion yen ($780 million)
to increase capacity in the Southeast Asian nation, including
setting up another factory to build engines.  The new plant will help triple engine-making capacity in
Indonesia, Suzuki said in an e-mailed statement today. The
investment includes 40 billion yen on the engine plant to open
in 2014 with the rest spent on auto assembly lines, Hideki
Taguchi, a company spokesman, said by telephone. He said the
timeframe for the total investment hasnâ€™t been decided.  Suzuki, which has one plant for automobiles and another for
motorbikes in Indonesia, plans to increase auto output capacity
25 percent to 100,000 units a year and to start producing seven-
seat vehicles in Indonesia from this spring. In September,
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest carmaker in  Asia , said it
planned to spend 26.3 billion yen to build a second factory in
Indonesia.  Suzuki shares gained as much as 3.9 percent, the most
intraday since Sept. 20, in Tokyo trading. They were up 3
percent to 1,639 yen as of 1:15 p.m.  In 2010, Suzuki made 560,000 motorbikes and 75,000 cars in
Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
