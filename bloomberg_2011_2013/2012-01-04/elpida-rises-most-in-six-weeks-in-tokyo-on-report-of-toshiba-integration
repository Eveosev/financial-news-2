Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the Japanese chip
maker being reorganized with government support, jumped the most
in six weeks in Tokyo after DigiTimes reported the company is in
talks with  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  to “integrate” operations.  Elpida, Japan’s biggest maker of dynamic random access
memory chips, jumped as much as 9.5 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since Nov. 25, to 392 yen. It changed hands at 378
yen as of the 11:30 a.m. trading break. Toshiba declined as much
as 1.6 percent to 310 yen.  Japan’s government may push some form of integration
between the companies to maintain competitiveness against the
chip industry in  South Korea , DigiTimes  reported  Jan. 3, citing
industry officials it didn’t identify. Elpida and other makers
of the most-common chip in computers lost a combined $14 billion
in the past three years, in part because prices plunged to a
record low last year.  “We deny such speculations,”  Keisuke Ohmori , a Toshiba
spokesman, said by phone. Tokyo-based Elpida said in an e-mailed
statement to Bloomberg News that the company “doesn’t comment
on rumors or speculation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
