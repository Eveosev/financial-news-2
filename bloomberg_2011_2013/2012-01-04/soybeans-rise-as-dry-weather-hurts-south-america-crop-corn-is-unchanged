Soybeans rose for the third straight
session on speculation that adverse weather in  South America 
will cut production, boosting demand for U.S. supplies. Corn was
unchanged.  Hot, dry weather will continue to stress crops in
Argentina, Paraguay and southern  Brazil  in the next six days
before light rains,  T-Storm Weather  LLC said in a report.
Precipitation will be less than normal and allow for additional
soil-moisture evaporation, the forecaster said.  “Soybean production will be hurt in South America, and the
U.S. is the only source for alternative supplies,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president at the Linn Group in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to
close at $12.30 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the highest settlement for the most-active contract since
Oct. 27.  South American production may fall 7.4 percent to 125.9
million metric tons this year from 135.9 million a year earlier,
Huckabay said.  Corn futures for March delivery settled at $6.585 a bushel.
Yesterday, the price reached $6.6425, the highest since Nov. 9.
The grain jumped 6.3 percent in December as dry conditions
threatened South American crops.  Output in South America may fall 8.8 percent to 76 million
tons from 83.3 million, Huckabay said. Global wheat production
in the year that began June 1 will rise 5.7 percent to a record
689 million tons, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said last
month.  “With rising world supplies of wheat this year, overseas
buyers can substitute cheaper wheat into feed rations to make up
for lost corn production in South America,” he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
