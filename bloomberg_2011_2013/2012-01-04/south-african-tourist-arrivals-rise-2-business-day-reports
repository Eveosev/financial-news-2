The number of foreign tourists
arriving in  South Africa  rose 2 percent in December from the
same month a year earlier, Business Day said, citing figures
released by the Department of Home Affairs.  About 2.5 million foreigners moved through the nationâ€™s
points of entry last month, split almost evenly between arrivals
and departures, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The U.K.,
the U.S. and  Germany  were the three top countries outside of
Africa whose citizens visited South Africa, according to
Business Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
