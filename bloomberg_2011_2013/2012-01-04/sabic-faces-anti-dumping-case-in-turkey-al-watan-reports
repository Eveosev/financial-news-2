Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
worldâ€™s biggest petrochemical maker, faces an anti-dumping case
brought by the Turkish government against its exports of
monoethylene glycol, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed al-Mady
told the newspaper al-Watan.  This is the only anti-dumping case pending at the moment
against the company, known as Sabic, after the European Union
and India dropped claims last month,  al-Watan  said, citing al-
Mady. Sabic will look for further opportunities in India, which
removed an anti-dumping duty on its polypropylene exports, al-
Mady told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
