China’s stocks (IFB1)  fell on the first
trading day of 2012 after Premier Wen Jiabao said business
conditions may be “relatively difficult” this quarter as
inflation stays “elevated” and overseas demand weakens.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (601919) , Asia’s largest shipping line,
plunged 3.9 percent after an index of export orders indicated a
third month of contraction.  Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001)  and
 China  Citic Bank Corp. paced a drop for lenders on speculation a
recent cash crunch will worsen before the Chinese New Year
holidays later this month. China Vanke Co. slid the most in six
weeks after  home prices  declined for a fourth month.  “Investors are concerned about liquidity in the market and
this adds to worries about the economic slowdown after Wen’s
comments,” said Chen Liqiu, a strategist at Jianghai Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “We need reserve-ratio cuts for the liquidity
issue to be eased.”  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 30 points, or 1.4 percent, to
2,169.39 at the close, the biggest loss since Dec. 15. The CSI
300 Index slid 2 percent to 2,298.75. China’s markets were shut
yesterday and Jan. 2 for the holidays, while the MSCI Asia
Pacific ex-Japan index gained 2 percent during that time. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.6 percent yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite tumbled 22 percent last year, the
most since 2008 and extending 2010’s 14 percent plunge, on
concern increases in borrowing costs and Europe’s debt crisis
will derail economic growth. The index’s 33 percent drop since
2009 makes it the worst performer among the world’s 15 biggest
markets. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid 25 percent in 2011.  Shippers Drop  “The Chinese market has been a pretty poor place for quite
a long time now,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management in  New York , said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “That market peaked in 2009. I would say you are
somewhat further through the  bear market  in equities in China
but much, much earlier in the bear market in the local real
estate sector.”  An index of export orders was at 48.6 from 45.6 in
November, still below 50, the dividing line between contraction
and expansion, according to the Jan. 1 manufacturing report.
The purchasing managers’ index was 50.3 in December, from 49 in
November, exceeding all forecasts of 15 economists in a
Bloomberg survey where the median estimate was 49.1.  China Cosco lost 3.9 percent to a record low of 4.50 yuan.
 China Shipping Container Lines Co. (601866) , the country’s second-largest
carrier of sea-cargo boxes, slumped 2.1 percent to 2.38 yuan.  Investors Disappointed  The ruling Communist Party is shifting focus to supporting
growth rather than damping inflation as Europe’s debt crisis
threatens to curb exports.  ‘We see downside pressure on our economy and elevated
inflation at the same time,’’ Premier Wen said during a two-day
trip to  Hunan province , according to a  statement  on the
government’s website yesterday. “We also face problems of
weakening external demand and rising costs for companies.”  Economists at  Barclays Capital  and Bank of America Corp.
say the central bank will cut lenders’ reserve requirements
before a weeklong Chinese New Year holiday starts on Jan. 23,
the second reduction since 2008. The People’s Bank of China
raised  interest rates  three times and reserve ratios six times
last year to cool inflation that accelerated to its fastest pace
in three years in July.  “Investors had been waiting for reserve-ratio cuts during
the holiday but it didn’t happen,” said Zhang Yanbin, an
analyst with Zheshang Securities Co. ’’This was why the rally
didn’t last. Still, stocks may still see a slight rebound in the
near term as we lagged behind other markets in the past two days
and the PMI was good.’’  Boosting Consumption  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s second-biggest
lender, slid 0.9 percent to 4.50 yuan. China Citic, a unit of
the nation’s largest state-owned investment firm, fell 1.2
percent to 3.99 yuan. Shenzhen Development retreated 2.8 percent
to 15.16 yuan.  The People’s Bank of China may suspend its weekly sale of
three-month bills on Thursday as primary dealers have not
submitted their bids for tomorrow’s sale, Market News
International cited unidentified traders as saying today.  Gauges of technology and health-care companies in the CSI
300 fell more than 3 percent on speculation a cash crunch may
curb loans to smaller enterprises. The CSI Smallcap 500 Index
lost 2.3 percent, while the ChiNext index of start-up companies
plunged 3.1 percent.  Appliance Makers  China Vanke led declines for developers, losing 1.9 percent
to 7.33 yuan. Chinese property values dropped 0.25 percent from
November, SouFun Holdings Ltd., the nation’s biggest real-estate
website owner, said today. Prices slid in 60 of 100 cities, and
all of the 10 biggest, including Beijing and Shanghai.  The government may introduce measures to boost consumption,
the  China Daily  reported today, citing Huang Hai, a former
assistant minister of commerce. A national conference will be
held “around” April where government departments including the
commerce ministry, National Development and Reform Commission
and  finance ministry  will discuss “concrete” measures to lift
consumption, the report cited Huang as saying.  GD Midea Holding Co. (000527) , China’s second-biggest publicly
traded appliance maker, climbed 1.3 percent to 12.08 yuan.  Gree
Electric (000651) , the largest maker of home air-conditioners, jumped 1.2
percent to 17.50 yuan, the highest close since Dec. 1.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
