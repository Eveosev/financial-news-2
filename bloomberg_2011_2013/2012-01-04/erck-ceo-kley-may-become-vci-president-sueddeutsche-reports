  Merck KGaA (MRK)  Chief Executive Officer
Karl-Ludwig Kley may become president of  Germany â€™s VCI chemical
association,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing unidentified
people from the industry.  Kley, who has been a vice president of the VCI since
September 2010, has been in that position longer than vice
presidents Kurt Bock of  BASF SE (BAS)  and Marijn Dekkers of  Bayer AG (BAYN) ,
the German newspaper said.  VCI members will vote in the fall this year on who will
succeed current president Klaus Engel, Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
