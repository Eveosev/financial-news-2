HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) , a
Brazilian oil and gas company, headed to its biggest two-day
decline since it first sold shares in October 2010 after failing
to report a commercially viable oil discovery in tests of a well
in the Amazon basin.  HRT  fell (HRTP3)  9.9 percent to 455.02 reais at 1:03 p.m. in Sao
Paulo trading, bringing the two-day decline to 22 percent. The
Bovespa benchmark index  fell (IBOV)  0.3 percent today.  HRT said yesterday in a regulatory filing that its 1-HRT-4-
AM onshore well in  Brazil’s Solimoes basin  may produce as much
as 250,000 cubic meters of natural gas. It didn’t mention oil
discoveries in the statement.  “Productivity levels were weak, in our view, and no oil
production was observed,” Banco Santander analysts Christian Audi and Vicente Falanga Neto wrote in a report to clients dated
today. The news was particularly disappointing given the
negative results on another well in the same area that the
company announced in September, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
