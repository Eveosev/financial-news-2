A record number of Icelandic
corporations were declared bankrupted in the first 11 months of
2011, according to Statistics Iceland.  A total of 1,432 companies were declared bankrupt by
Icelandic courts from January through November last year, a 63
percent increase from the previous year, the Reykjavik-based
office said in a statement on its  website .  Registrations of new limited-liability corporations rose in
the period by 5.7 percent to reach 1,568, compared with 1,483
registrations in the 11 months through November 2010.  “The huge number of company failures indicates that the
economy is still severely impaired after the crisis,” Ingolfur Bender, an economist with Islandsbanki, said in a note to
clients today. “It also bears witness to the extensive
financial restructuring currently under way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
