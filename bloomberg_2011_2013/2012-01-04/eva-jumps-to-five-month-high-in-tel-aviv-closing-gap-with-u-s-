Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
rose to the highest level in more than five months, closing the
gap with  U.S. shares (TEVA)  of the world’s largest generic drugmaker.  The  stock gained (TEVA)  3.1 percent to 165.60 shekels, the
equivalent of $43.10, at 10:35 a.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest
intraday level since July 18. The U.S. shares soared 6.8 percent
to close at $43.10 yesterday.  RBC Capital Markets LLC said today it is “confident”
Teva’s newly appointed chief executive Jeremy Levin will have
the ability to “refocus and revitalize” the Petach Tikva,
Israel-based company.  “We expect that Dr. Levin will focus the company towards
areas of greatest opportunities in the future regardless of
whether these exist in the generics or branded business,” RBC
analysts wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
