Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  sued  Kesa Electricals
Plc (KESA) ’s Comet unit for allegedly selling more than 94,000
counterfeit disks.  Comet made fake versions of Windows Vista and Windows XP
recovery CDs at a factory in Hampshire, England, then sold them
at its retail outlets across the U.K., Microsoft said in a
statement on its  website .  “Comet produced and sold thousands of counterfeit Windows
CDs to unsuspecting customers in the United Kingdom,” said
David Finn, associate general counsel in Microsoft’s anti-piracy
unit, in a statement on its website.  Microsoft has replaced Vista and Windows XP with Windows 7,
the operating system it introduced in October 2009. Together,
the Windows products run more than 90 percent of the world’s PCs
and account for 27 percent of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft’s  revenue (MSFT) , according to Bloomberg data.  Comet said in an e-mailed statement it hadn’t infringed
Microsoft’s copyright and would defend the claim vigorously.
Kesa agreed in November to sell the money-losing Comet unit to
focus on markets such as  France .  The  Business Software Alliance , a lobbying group whose
members include Microsoft, has estimated that piracy of computer
software cost the industry $59 billion in 2010, although the
U.S. Government Accountability Office has said the issue is too
complex to quantify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
