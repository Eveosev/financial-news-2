Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  plans to sell two-year
floating-rate notes and fixed-rate bonds due in June 2019,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The two-year notes may be priced to yield about 105 basis
points more than Euribor and the seven-year bonds may have a
spread of about 195 basis points over swaps, the banker said.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Societe Generale
SA are managing the deal with Nordea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
