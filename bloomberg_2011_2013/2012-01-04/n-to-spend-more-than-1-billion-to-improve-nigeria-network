MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, will spend more than $1 billion this year
to improve its network in  Nigeria  after the nation’s phone
regulator last year demanded better service.  “The investment will relieve congestion and improve the
quality of the network,” Akinwale Goodluck, a spokesman for MTN
Nigeria, said by mobile phone from Lagos today. The funds will
be directed toward second- and third-generation technologies,
MTN’s core network, and power generators to run transmission
stations, he said.  Last year, Nigeria’s National Communications Commission
told mobile-phone companies MTN, Globacom Ltd. and  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI) ’s Nigerian unit to improve mobile network services or they
would be stopped from signing up new customers.  MTN, which operates in 20 other countries in Africa and the
 Middle East , according to the Johannesburg-based company’s
 website , spent $1 billion on its Nigerian network in 2011 and
its investments will help achieve the commission’s goal,
Goodluck said.  MTN Nigeria is the biggest phone operator in Africa’s most
populous country. The company had more than 40 million users on
its mobile network in June 2011,  according to the commission .
Globacom ranked second with more than 19 million and Bharti
Airtel was third with about 16 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
