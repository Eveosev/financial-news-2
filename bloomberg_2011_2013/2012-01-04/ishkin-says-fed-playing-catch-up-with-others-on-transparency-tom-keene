The  Federal Reserve  is catching up
with other central banks with its new transparency policy,
Columbia University economics professor Frederic S. Mishkin said
today in a Bloomberg Radio interview today.  Other central banks are “far more transparent” than the
Fed, Mishkin, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, said on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and
Ken Prewitt.  The decision to reveal forecasts for the federal funds rate
will go into effect at the Fed’s Jan. 25 policy meeting. It’s
another phase of the Fed’s strategy of the “management of
expectations,” Mishkin said. “Interest rates hit a floor --
zero,” he said, “They can’t go any lower.”  Central bank transparency can go too far, and there are
limits to the effectiveness of openness, Mishkin said.
“Providing more information on what happens inside meetings
would be too much information,” he said.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
