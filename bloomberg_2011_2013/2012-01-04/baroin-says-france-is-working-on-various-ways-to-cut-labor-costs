French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said the government hasn’t decided how to cut labor
costs, contradicting other Cabinet members who said some salary
taxes could be shifted to value-added taxes.  “The VAT raise is an option, but we cannot exclude
others,” Baroin said on France Info radio in Paris today.
“There is a French weakness and it’s labor costs. So we must
imagine measures to lower them, that’s the political project.
Raising the net income of workers, that’s the aim.”  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is meeting with labor and
business leaders on Jan. 18 to discuss ways of cutting the cost
of labor by reducing the role of social charges on salaries in
paying for  France ’s welfare state.  To contact the reporters on this story:
