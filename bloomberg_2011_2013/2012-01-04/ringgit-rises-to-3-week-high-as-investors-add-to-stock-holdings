Malaysia’s ringgit advanced to its
strongest level in more than three weeks after global funds
added to holdings of the nation’s shares for a third consecutive
month in December.  International investors bought 800 million ringgit ($255
million) more local stocks than they sold last month, according
to data on the website of the  Kuala Lumpur  stock exchange. The
currency strengthened for a third trading day and the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-
Pacific Index of shares gained after manufacturing in the U.S.
expanded at the fastest pace in six months in December.  “With good manufacturing data in the U.S. and stock gains,
we are seeing a slight risk-on sentiment in the market,” said
Minori Uchida, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “But sentiment surrounding  Europe  hasn’t
improved much, and I don’t think investors want to aggressively
take riskier positions.”  The ringgit advanced 0.2 percent to 3.1335 per dollar as of
4:11 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.1295, the strongest level since Dec. 9.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory  index (NAPMPMI) 
climbed to 53.9 last month from 52.7 in November, data issued by
the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed yesterday. A reading above
50 signals expansion.  The yield on the 3.434 percent debt due August 2014 added
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.03 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
