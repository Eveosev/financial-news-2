Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate (FDFD) , opened at 0.07 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.08 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.073 percent.  The central bank will sell Treasuries maturing from May
2013 to October 2013. The purchases are part of the Fed’s
program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs
further and counter risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to sell $8 billion to $8.75 billion
of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
