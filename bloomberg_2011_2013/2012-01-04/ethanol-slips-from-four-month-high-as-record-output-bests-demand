Ethanol futures slipped from a four-
month high in  Chicago  on speculation that record production is
outpacing demand for the biofuel.  Futures slid after MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed
gasoline demand fell 14 percent to 8.16 million barrels a day in
the week ended Dec. 30, the lowest level in seven years. Ethanol
 production (DOETFETH)  averaged 962,000 barrels a day in the week ended Dec.
23, an all-time high, according to the Energy Department.  “There’s not a huge demand,” said Justin Dirico, senior
ethanol analyst at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “There’s
lack of demand for physical gallons. Unless we get more gasoline
demand, I don’t see this changing until spring.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.228 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have declined 3.7 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.405 a gallon, in the U.S. Gulf at $2.375 and on the West
Coast at $2.405, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.265 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
