Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , owner of the streaming
and DVD-by-mail service, jumped as much as 9.3 percent after
reporting online viewing that surpassed an analyst’s estimate.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, rose 7.1 percent
to $77.34 at 2:15 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading, after reaching $78.97 earlier. The shares dropped 61
percent  last year (NFLX) .  Users of the company’s online movie and TV-streaming
service watched more than 2 billion hours of content in the last
three months of 2011, the company said today in a statement.  The number exceeded the 1.2 billion-hour estimate of
 Richard Greenfield , an analyst with BTIG Research. Netflix Chief
Executive Officer Reed Hastings in December said fourth-quarter
streaming hours would be “well over” 1 billion, according to
Greenfield.  “It now appears our interpretation was far too
conservative,” Greenfield wrote in a blog post.  He estimates Netflix would be the 15th most-watched U.S. TV
network when compared to traditional cable and broadcast
channels.  The $7.99-a-month service is eating into traditional
television-viewing, Greenfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
