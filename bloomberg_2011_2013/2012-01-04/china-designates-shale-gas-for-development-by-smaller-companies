China  approved shale gas as an
“independent mining” resource, adding it to a list of types of
fields that smaller Chinese companies can develop.  The move, reported by Xinhua News Agency on Dec. 31 in a
posting on the website of China’s Ministry of Land and
Resources, extends access beyond China’s largest oil and
natural-gas producers. China’s Ministry of Land and Resources
plans a second round of shale-gas auctions in January, the
ministry said last month.  Shale-gas exploration and production rights have been
awarded to three companies including China Petrochemical Corp.,
also know as Sinopec Group, and China National Petroleum Corp.,
which drilled China’s first horizontal well this year working
with Royal Dutch Shell.  China may hold 1,275 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, or
12 times China’s so-called conventional deposits, according to
estimates by the U.S. Energy Information Agency. China hasn’t
yet begun commercial shale production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
