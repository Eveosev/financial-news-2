A disruption in the supply of Iranian
oil from any new sanctions may trim $160 million from Turkish
refiner  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS)  earnings this
year, Istanbul-based brokerage Ekspres Invest said.  Tupras signed a contract in August with the National
Iranian Oil Co. to purchase 9 million metric tons of crude a
year, and imports under that agreement continue, the company
said today in response to Bloomberg questions.  Turkey ’s government “will be against the sanctions due to
the economic damage they could cause in Turkey,” which imports
around 30 percent of its oil from neighboring Iran, Ekspres said
in a report today. The problem could be exacerbated as a
disruption would increase demand for foreign currency in Turkey,
where the central bank is battling to defend the lira after a
drop of 18 percent last year, the brokerage said.  Oil imports from  Iran  are currently paid in lira, Ekspres
said.  Turkey is likely to get a “waiver” should any new
sanctions pushed for by the U.S. be imposed on Iran, and further
dips in the company’s share price should be seen as
opportunities to buy, Ekspres said.  Tupras shares sank 6.5 percent to 38.70 liras in Istanbul
trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
