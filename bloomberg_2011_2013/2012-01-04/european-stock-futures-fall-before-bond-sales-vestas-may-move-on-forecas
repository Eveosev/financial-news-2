European stocks (SXXP)  retreated from a
five-month high as  UniCredit (UCG)  SpA’s rights offer boosted concern
that banks will need to raise more capital to weather the
region’s debt crisis.  UniCredit,  Italy ’s largest lender, slid the most in more
than two decades after setting a 43 percent price discount for
the rights offer.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, slumped 19 percent after cutting its revenue
and profit forecasts.  Next Plc (NXT)  dropped 3.1 percent as the U.K.’s
second-largest clothing retailer reported sales that missed
analyst estimates.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.6 percent to 249.62 at
the close in  London , snapping a four-day rally. The measure rose
to the highest level since Aug. 3 yesterday after a report
showed that U.S. manufacturing expanded in December at the
fastest pace in six months. The gauge lost 11 percent last year.  “The European debt crisis has never really abated,” said
John Plassard, director at Louis Capital Markets SA in Geneva.
“Even though 2011 ended relatively well, 2012 remains at risk.
States will have to find 800 billion euros in the financial
markets this year, so we should have a lot of market volatility
ahead of us, at least during the first half.”  National benchmark indexes fell in all of  Europe ’s 18
western markets, except Iceland and  Switzerland .  France ’s CAC 40
Index dropped 1.6 percent, the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slipped 0.6
percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index lost 0.9 percent.  Bond Auctions  Germany and  Portugal  sold bonds today, kicking off a
competition for finance that may determine whether euro-area
leaders can preserve the single currency.  Germany got bids for 5.14 billion euros ($6.7 billion) of
10-year bunds at an auction, more than the maximum sales target
of 5 billion euros. The debt agency accepted bids for 4.06
billion euros at an average yield of 1.93 percent. Portugal’s
borrowing costs fell at a sale of 1 billion euros of three-month
bills.  The offers will be followed by auctions from  Greece , Italy
and Spain later in the month as common-currency members commence
sales that may reach 262 billion euros in the first quarter and
865 billion euros in 2012, according to Deutsche Bank AG
forecasts.  Spain  has no plans to seek external help to fund its
overhaul of the financial industry, said Carmen Martinez Castro,
the deputy minister for communication. She denied a report in
Expansion newspaper that the government is considering seeking
loans from the European rescue facility and the  International
Monetary Fund  as part of its plans to make banks clean up their
balance sheets.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
 factory orders (TMNOCHNG)  climbed in November by the most in four months.
Bookings rose 1.8 percent after a revised 0.2 percent drop the
prior month. The median projection of 57 economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for a 2 percent increase.  A gauge of banks was the  worst performer (SXXP)  of the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600.  UniCredit tumbled 14 percent to 5.42 euros, the largest
decline since at least 1988, as the bank said it will sell
shares at 1.943 euros apiece to raise 7.5 billion euros. The
rights offer is a 43 percent discount to yesterday’s closing
price, excluding the value of rights.  Santander Sinks  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  slid 3.9 percent to 5.79 euros as new
stock sold last month to bolster capital at Spain’s biggest
lender started trading in  Madrid . Santander raised 1.94 billion
euros in December by swapping non-listed preferred securities
sold to retail customers in 2009 for newly-issued stock that can
be accounted as core capital.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  and  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) 
retreated 12 percent to 13.2 euro cents and 8.8 percent to 1.22
euros, respectively, in Lisbon.  Euro-area banks parked 453.2 billion euros with the
European Central Bank yesterday, up from 446 billion euros the
previous day. That’s the highest since the euro’s introduction
in 1999.  Vestas sank 19 percent to 56.25 kroner, the lowest price
since 2003, after cutting its earnings forecasts and saying it
will announce a significant change to its corporate structure on
Jan. 12.  Vestas now expects sales of about 6 billion euros for 2011,
down from the 6.4 billion euros it forecast on Oct. 30, which
itself was a reduction from 7 billion euros. Sean McLoughlin, an
analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, cut the stock to “underweight”
from “neutral.”  Retailers Retreat  Next dropped 3.1 percent to 2,656 pence after it reported
sales that missed analyst estimates as growth in online revenue
failed to offset lower store sales during a period that included
the peak Christmas holiday season.  Larger rival  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  sank 2.6 percent to
308.8 pence.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME) , the owner of Homebase
outlets in the U.K., slumped 3.5 percent to 90.95 pence.  Electricite de France SA slid 5.1 percent to 18.24 euros.
The utility will have to invest between 10 billion and 15
billion euros to bring safety standards at its French reactors
into line with recommendations from national nuclear safety
watchdog ASN,  Les Echos  reported, citing unidentified ASN and
EDF officials.  Qiagen NV (QGEN) , the German biotechnology company, increased 3.2
percent to 11.21 euros as Tycho Peterson, an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. raised the stock to “overweight” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
