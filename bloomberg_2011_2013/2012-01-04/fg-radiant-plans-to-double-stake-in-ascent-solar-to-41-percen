Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI)  rose
the most in more than four months after TFG Radiant Group agreed
to double its stake in the U.S. thin-film solar company.  Ascent climbed 33 percent to 56 cents at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since TFG Radiant bought its initial, 20
percent stake in the company Aug. 15. The shares have declined
84 percent in the past year.  TFG Radiant will pay $4 million, or about 50 cents a share,
for Norsk Hydro Produksjon AS’s stake in Ascent, the Thornton,
Colorado-based solar company said today in a statement. The
purchase will boost TFG Radiant’s holdings to 41 percent.  TFG Radiant, a joint venture of the Chinese construction
and real-estate company Radiant Group and the Singapore-based
investment company Tertius Financial Group, bought in August 6.4
million Ascent shares for $1.15 each, or 20 percent of the total
shares outstanding.  It also agreed then to build a solar plant in  China  that
will use Ascent’s process for making thin-film panels using
copper-indium-gallium-diselenide. TFG has exclusive rights to
sell the panels in China, Taiwan,  Hong Kong , Malaysia,
Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
