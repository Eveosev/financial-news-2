French  consumer spending (FRSNMANM)  slid in
November as surging joblessness and concern about the European
debt crisis prompted households to cut back.  Spending fell 0.1 percent from October, when it rose a
revised 0.1 percent, national statistics office Insee said today
in an e-mailed statement. Spending fell 2.1 percent from the
year-earlier period.  Stagnant household demand reflects concern about earning
prospects amid rising joblessness and mounting concern that the
euro area is entering a recession. President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
renewed effort to trim the  budget deficit  at a time when
 Europe ’s debt crisis is hurting confidence may restrain spending
growth in the months ahead, economists have said.  “The French economy is likely to have stalled in the last
quarter of 2011 given the sharp deterioration in confidence
across the board,” according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
