Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, plans to sell $1 billion of dollar bonds due in 2022
as soon as today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The debt may yield 255 basis points, or 2.55 percentage
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, according to
the person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
set.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company is selling dollar bonds
for the first time since September 2010, when it issued $1.75
billion of securities due in 2019 and 2039, Bloomberg data show.
The 2019 bond priced to yield 210 basis points over Treasuries
at the time. Yields on the debt rose seven basis points today to
4.2 percent.  Vale’s offering comes a day after the Brazilian government
sold $750 million more of its 4.875 percent notes due 2021 to
yield 3.449 percent, at a spread of 150 basis points above
Treasuries.  Vale’s sale is being managed by Citigroup Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Banco do Brasil SA and
Bradesco BBI, the company said in a regulatory filing earlier
today.  Link to Company News: VALE3 BZ <Equity> CN   To contact the editors responsible for this story:
