Export-Import Bank of  Korea ,  South
Korea ’s biggest seller of overseas bonds, started marketing this
year’s first dollar security from an Asian borrower.  The state-owned lender began selling notes maturing in five
years, and 10 years and three months to investors today, said
Lee Seung Keon, who leads the debt capital market team at
Export-Import Bank, otherwise known as Kexim. “Each one is
benchmark-sized,” he said in a telephone interview from Seoul,
which typically means at least $500 million.  “The five-year bonds will be priced around 325 basis
points over Treasuries, and the longer dated ones at 315 to 320
basis points” more than  U.S. debt , Lee said.  Kexim announced the sale shortly before the Philippine
government started selling 25-year bonds with a coupon of about
5.25 percent, according to a person who declined to be
identified because the details are private.  The South Korean bank last sold a benchmark dollar bond in
September when it raised $1 billion from a 4.375 percent ten-
year note, Bloomberg data show. The notes were yielding 4.75
percent as of 14.22 p.m. in  Hong Kong , according to prices from
BNP Paribas SA. Kexim has $11.3 billion of debt maturing this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, and Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc are arranging the sale, according to a person familiar with
the transaction who didn’t want to be identified because the
matter is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
