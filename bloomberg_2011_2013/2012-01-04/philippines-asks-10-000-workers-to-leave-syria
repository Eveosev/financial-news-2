Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said only 10 percent of the country’s 10,000
citizens living in  Syria  intend to leave despite mounting
violence because of the lack of job prospects at home.  About 1,000 Filipino workers in Syria have taken up a
government offer to spend $4,000 per person to bring them back,
del Rosario told a briefing today in Manila. He said he talked
with 25 Filipino community leaders during a trip to Damascus
last week and “not a single one of them wanted to be
repatriated. They choose to stay because of the economic
opportunities offered there.”  Arab Spring revolts and heightened security threats in the
 Middle East  may displace more workers and could have a
“significant” dent on money Filipino workers send home, he
said.  Remittances  account for about 10 percent of the
 Philippines ’ $200 billion economy, and those from the Middle
East rose 6.2 percent to $2.6 billion in the first 10 months of
last year, according to central bank data.  About half of the country’s 4 million overseas workers are
in the Middle East, with roughly 1.5 million in  Saudi Arabia ,
Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz said last February. Almost 500
Filipinos have been repatriated from Syria since the start of
the political tension there in March, according to the Foreign
Affairs department.  More than 5,000 people have died in the Syrian uprising,
according to the United Nations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
