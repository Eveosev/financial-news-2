High-grade polysilicon, the main raw
material for solar panels, rose 4.5 percent on the week to
$30.50 a kilo, PV Insights said in a report on its website.  The price of 6-inch multicrystalline solar wafers, produced
by slicing the polysilicon ingots, climbed 0.4 percent to $1.13
U.S. cents apiece while solar cells -- wafers with electrical
contacts attached -- were 1.9 percent lower at 48 cents a watt,
according to the report.  Finished solar panels fell 0.4 percent to 95 U.S. cents a
watt on the week ending today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
