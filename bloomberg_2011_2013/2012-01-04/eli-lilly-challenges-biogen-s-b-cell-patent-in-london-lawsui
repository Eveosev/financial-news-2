Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  sued  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) 
in a  London  court to revoke a European patent on a potential
treatment for immune-system diseases.  Biogen’s patent on the use of a class of medicines known as
BAFF inhibitors to regulate the activity of a type of white
blood cell is “not new” and doesn’t “involve an inventive
step,” Eli Lilly said in court papers filed in London in
November.  Eli Lilly, whose top-selling schizophrenia drug Zyprexa
lost its U.S. patent protection in October, is working to
overcome expiring patents by investing in research. The
Indianapolis-based drugmaker has new treatments for Alzheimer’s,
diabetes and cancer in final-stage trials.  Biogen, the world’s largest maker of medicines for multiple
sclerosis, responded in November saying its BAFF inhibitors
patent is valid. Penny Gilbert, a lawyer for the Weston,
Massachusetts-based company, didn’t respond to a phone call
today requesting comment.  Eli Lilly lost a related patent dispute before the U.K.
Supreme Court in November when the court ruled for Rockville,
Maryland-based  Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  over another potential
treatment for immune diseases. Eli Lilly had argued Human
Genome’s list of uses for the neutrokine alpha protein was too
vague.  Gregory Kueterman, a spokesman for Eli Lilly, declined to
comment on the Biogen litigation because it’s ongoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
