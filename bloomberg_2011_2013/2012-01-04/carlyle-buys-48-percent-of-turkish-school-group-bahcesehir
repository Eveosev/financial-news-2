Carlyle Group , a U.S. private-equity
firm, said it bought 48 percent of Bahcesehir Kolejleri, a
Turkish school operator, expanding its investment in that
country.  Bahcesehir, based in Istanbul, has 65 schools and 12,000
students, Walid Musallam, the buyout firm’s M&A director for
Europe,  Middle East  and Africa, said in an e-mailed statement
today. No price was disclosed.  Turkey’s growing $735 billion economy has attracted
private-equity investment in recent years. Gross domestic
product grew 8.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011, the
world’s fastest behind China, as credit growth spurred consumer
demand. Washington-based Carlyle paid $150 million for a 40
percent stake in Istanbul-based hospital group Medical Park in
2009.  “We want to create a stronger education group through this
first foreign investment in Turkish education,” Enver Yucel,
chairman of Bahcesehir Kolejleri, said in the statement.  Carlyle, which had $148 billion in assets under management
at the end of September through 89 funds that it manages, holds
investments in  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , a Phoenix-based education
company, and HaoYue Education Group of China, according to the
statement.  Moonlight Capital, a BC Partners-led group, bought Migros
Ticaret for $3.25 billion in 2008 in Turkey’s biggest-ever
private-equity investment.  KKR & Co. (KKR) , a U.S. buyout firm, and
Abraaj Capital Ltd, the Middle East’s biggest private-equity
firm, have also invested in Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
