Palm oil  output and exports from
 Indonesia , the largest producer, are expected to rise this year
as more palm trees mature amid strong demand from  India  and
China, a producers group said.  Production may rise 6.4 percent to 25 million metric tons
this year, the Indonesia Palm Oil Association, known as Gapki,
said in a statement today. Exports may increase to 17.5 million
tons to 18 million tons from an estimated 16.5 million tons last
year, the group said.  Increased supplies from the Southeast Asian country may add
to price declines in the commodity which fell about 16 percent
last year in  Kuala Lumpur  after output in Indonesia and Malaysia,
the second biggest producer, expanded and the European
sovereign-debt crisis curbed demand.  “ China  and India will remain the main support for our
export growth along with some new prospective markets such as
the northern African and Middle Eastern countries,” Susanto,
head of marketing at the group, told reporters in Jakarta today.
“New production will be coming in from trees planted in 2008
and 2009, boosting output.”  Export to China rose 21 percent to 2.9 million tons last
year, while shipments to India were relatively unchanged at
about 5.7 million tons, Susanto, who uses only one name, said.  The price of palm oil in Rotterdam may range between $1,000
and $1,200 a metric ton this year, the group’s statement said.
 Palm oil in Rotterdam (PALMROTT)  fell 19 percent last year and closed at
$1,040 a ton on Dec. 30.  Palm oil futures for March delivery fell 0.5 percent to
3,209 ringgit ($1,023) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange at 2:20 p.m. Jakarta time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
