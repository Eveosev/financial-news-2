Maersk (MAERSKB)  Oil, the Nordic region’s
second-largest producer, reported the first discovery in
Angola’s deep-sea pre-salt region.  The Azul-1 well in the Kwanza Basin was drilled to a depth
of 5,334 meters (17,500 feet) and was found to have a potential
capacity of more than 3,000 barrels a day, Copenhagen-based
 Maersk (MAERSKB)  said today in a  statement . Further appraisal work is
needed, said  Lars Nydahl Jorgensen , its head of exploration.  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  were among oil producers awarded
rights last month to explore for oil and gas in Angola’s pre-
salt blocks, which may share the same characteristics as fields
in  Brazil . Drilling pre-salt wells is technically challenging
because the deposits lie below a layer of salt, which is
difficult to penetrate and identify potential  oil fields .  “The real significance of this well is that is shows us
that the pre-salt in this part of the Atlantic” works,
Jorgensen said in a phone interview. “We now have a lot of data
that we didn’t have before.”  The well test that was carried out “enabled the recovery
of two good quality oil samples,” the oil unit of A.P. Moeller-
Maersk A/S, Denmark’s biggest company, said.  Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB and  Angola ’s state-owned
oil company Sonangol EP are Maersk’s partners in the Azul-1
well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
