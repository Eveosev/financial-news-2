Overseas  investors (FIINNET)  bought a net  3.26
billion rupees (FIINNET$)  ($61 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, turning
net buyers, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 13.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
10.3 billion rupees after three days of withdrawals, according
to data from the Securities & Exchange Board of  India . They
bought a net 1.2 billion rupees of bonds, the data  show .  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  India’s $1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest, is
influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged to
a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds (FIINFIIN)  have placed 4.446 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.211 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  Foreign funds invested 421 billion rupees
in bonds last year.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
