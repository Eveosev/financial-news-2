The Australian dollar dropped against
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts as concern that  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis is worsening damped demand for higher-
yielding assets.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell from almost
a two-month high after France’s borrowing costs rose at a bond
sale today. The Aussie dropped for a second day after
 Australia ’s trade surplus unexpectedly narrowed and the nation’s
services industry shrank for a third month.  “There’s been no progress in terms of resolving the
crisis,”  Mitul Kotecha , head of global currency strategy in
 Hong Kong  at Credit Agricole CIB, said of the European turmoil.
“Risk-aversion can still weigh on these currencies,” he said.  The Aussie dropped 1.2 percent to $1.0243 at 10:51 a.m. in
 New York . It touched an all-time high versus Europe’s shared
currency of 80.27 euro cents before trading little changed at
80.03. The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to 78.99 yen.  New Zealand ’s currency slid 1 percent to 78.02 U.S. cents
after reaching 79.08 on Jan. 3, the highest since Nov. 14. The
kiwi declined 0.4 percent to 60.17 yen.  France sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of benchmark
10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29 percent, compared with
3.18 percent at a sale on Dec. 1. The 10-year debt bid-to-cover
ratio, or the number of bids received for each unit of debt
sold, fell to 1.64 from 3.05. In all, France auctioned 7.96
billion euros of debt today, including bonds maturing in 2023,
2035 and 2041.  Trade Data  Australia’s exports exceeded imports by A$1.38 billion
($1.42 billion) in November from a revised A$1.42 billion
 surplus (AUITGSB)  the previous month, the Bureau of Statistics said today.
A surplus of A$1.65 billion was forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  The nation’s performance of services index was 49 in
December, its third month below 50, according to  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia  and the Australian Industry Group. Fifty is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
