U.S. 10-year  yields (USGG10YR)  may struggle to
push below 1.84 percent after they approached the least on
record at the end of last year, Daiwa Asset Management Co. said,
citing trading patterns.  A Fibonacci graph shows that level is a 76.4 percent
retracement of the increase in yields from the record low of
1.67 percent set Sept. 23 to 2.42 percent reached on Oct. 28.
Rates slid below the barrier in December but failed to stay
there.  Ten-year Treasury yields were little changed today at 1.95
percent as of 7:11 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 2 percent security due in November 2021
changed hands at 100 15/32.  “If the 10-year yield goes below 1.84 percent, the trend
is still down,” said Tsutomu Komiya, a bond investor in  Tokyo 
at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$120.7 billion and is a unit of  Japan ’s second-biggest
brokerage.  Demand for safety as European officials try to control
spending and support their economies has sent Treasuries
surging. U.S. government securities due in 10 years and more
rallied 29 percent last year, the most among 144 bond indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies after accounting for currency changes.  Fibonacci  analysis is based on a series of numbers
developed by Leonardo da Pisa, a mathematician in the Middle
Ages known as Fibonacci, who was studying growth rates. Analysts
use the numbers to determine levels where buy and sell orders
may be set.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
