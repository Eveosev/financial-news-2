The French government is ready to
help Photowatt  France , the country’s largest solar-panel
manufacturer, Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet
said in an RMC Radio interview on Jan. 3.  Photowatt, a unit of Canada’s  ATS Automation Tooling
Systems Inc. (ATA) , said in November that it would reduce workdays and
operate at a third of its capacity because of a slump in demand
for its solar modules and systems.  Kosciusko-Morizet said Photowatt is being hurt by lower-
priced competitors and the government “would like to invest”
in the company. She didn’t give details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
