Nexen Inc. (NXY)  and Cenovus Energy Inc.
are among the Canadian oil-sands producers that are funding
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s Northern Gateway pipeline, according to Canadian
regulatory documents filed today.  The documents reveal some of the companies funding the
C$5.5 billion ($5.43 billion) pipeline, which would ship crude
from Alberta’s oil sands to British Columbia.  Total SA (FP)  and
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  have agreed to transport oil on the pipeline,
according to documents filed with Canada’s National Energy
Board.  Ten companies have contributed $10 million each to help
Enbridge finance the regulatory approval process, Enbridge
spokesman Paul Stanway said in October.  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028) , also known as Sinopec, was previously the only
company that had publicly stated its participation.  Stanway didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  The 732-mile (1,177-kilometer) pipeline would carry as much
as 525,000 barrels a day from oil-sands projects to Kitimat,
British Columbia, where crude could be loaded on tankers bound
for  Asia .  The NEB is scheduled to begin hearings on the project Jan.
