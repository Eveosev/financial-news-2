The Czech equity index reversed
earlier gains, led lower by  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  and  Komercni
Banka AS (KOMB) , after the newspaper Expansion reported that  Spain  may
apply for rescue loans to finance restructuring of its banks.  The  PX (PX)  gauge of companies dropped 0.4 percent to 930.2 by
9:55 a.m. in Prague, after increasing as much as 0.5 percent
earlier today. Austriaâ€™s Erste and Komercni, a unit of  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , have a combined 35 percent weighting in the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
