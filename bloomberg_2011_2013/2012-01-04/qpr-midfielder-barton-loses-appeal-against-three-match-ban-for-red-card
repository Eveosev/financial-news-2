Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton will serve a three-match ban after losing an appeal
against a red card he received in a Premier League match against
Norwich two days ago.  “An Independent Regulatory Commission dismissed a claim of
wrongful dismissal,” English soccer’s Football Association  said
in a statement  on its website.  Referee Neil Swarbrick dismissed Barton after indicating he
thought the 29-year-old had headbutted Bradley Johnson during
the first half of Norwich’s 2-1 win at Loftus Road.  Barton will miss QPR’s F.A. Cup third-round match against
MK Dons and Premier League games against Newcastle and Wigan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
