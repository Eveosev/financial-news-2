speculation banks scaled back debt purchases as they hoarded
cash to meet customer withdrawals ahead of the Chinese New Year

said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based
Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The  yield (GGVN3YR)  on the  three-year  (GGVN3YR) note climbed three basis

yields rose for a second day, adding five basis points to 12.58
percent.  The dong traded 21,030 per dollar, unchanged from
