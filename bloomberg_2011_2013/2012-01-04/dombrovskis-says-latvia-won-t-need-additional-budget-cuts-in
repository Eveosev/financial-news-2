Latvia won’t require additional
budget cuts this year, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said in
an interview with  Latvijas Radio 1 .  The budget plan, with a deficit of 2.5 percent of  gross
domestic product (LAGDCYOY) , is based on “realistic forecasts,” he said.  The prime minister’s reaction follows a comment by central
bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics in an interview with Lietiska
Diena today that Latvia may need additional fiscal consolidation
this year of as much as 100 million lati ($185.4 million) to
achieve its deficit target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
