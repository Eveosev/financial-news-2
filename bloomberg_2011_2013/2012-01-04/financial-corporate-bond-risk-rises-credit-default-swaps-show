Spain  led an increase in the cost of
insuring sovereign bonds amid speculation the indebted nation
may seek aid from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  Credit-default swaps on Spain jumped 29 basis points to
434, according to CMA prices at 3:30 p.m. in London. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments rose
seven basis points to 367.5. An increase signals deterioration
in perceptions of  credit quality .  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government is
considering applying for loans from the EU’s rescue fund and the
IMF, Expansion reported, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter. The country’s deputy minister for
communication, Carmen Martinez Castro, said in a telephone
interview that there are no plans to seek external aid.  “There’s stigma attached to having to ask for money,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in  London . “With what we’ve been through in the
last few years, there’s always a worry there’s some bad news is
hiding somewhere, and taking such a step is admitting the
problem won’t be over tomorrow.”  Swaps on Spain are up from 380 basis points so far this
year. They peaked at 493 on Nov. 25. The country’s unemployment
rate is at 23 percent and the new government this week increased
its deficit forecast to 8 percent of gross domestic product from
its 6 percent target.  Contracts on Italian government debt jumped 20 basis points
to 510, CMA prices show. Contracts on Hungary soared 40 basis
points to a record 690 and Austria surged 17 to 212.  Financial Swaps  The cost of insuring against default on financial and
corporate debt also rose, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 12 basis points to 276.5 and
the subordinated index climbed 24 to 512.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 14 basis
points to 752.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was up 4.5 basis points at 173.75.  Swaps on the junior debt of UniCredit Bank AG dropped 35
basis points to 520 after the Italian bank said it will sell new
shares in a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) offer to strengthen
its capital position.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
