The pound rose to the highest in 15
months against the euro as the cost of insuring Spanish bonds
against default climbed on concern the region’s debt crisis is
worsening.  Sterling advanced for the first time in three days against
the single European currency. Credit-default swaps on  Spain 
jumped 20 basis points to 425 as El Pais reported the government
had to help the Valencia region make a 123 million-euro ($160
million) payment to Deutsche Bank AG. Ten-year gilts snapped a
three-day decline as Europe’s economic turmoil underpinned
demand for the safest assets  “The debt crisis is still a key issue that undermined the
euro,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “It’s the euro weakness
rather than sterling strength.”  The pound climbed 0.9 percent to 82.65 pence per euro, the
the strongest since Sept. 13, 2010, before trading at 82.79
pence at 4:07 p.m. London time. Sterling fell 0.3 percent to
$1.5602 and 119.71 yen.  The 10-year  gilt yield (GUKG10)  was little changed at 2.03 percent,
after reaching 2.08 percent, the highest since Dec. 22. The 3.75
percent bond due September 2021 rose 0.01, or 10 pence per
1,000-pound face amount, to 115.02.  Two-year yields climbed three basis points, to 0.39
percent, after falling to an all-time low 0.271 percent on Dec.
30. It rose to 0.41 percent earlier.  Sterling has risen 3.2 percent against a basket of nine
developed-market peers in the past six months, making it the
third-best performer after the Japanese yen and the  U.S. dollar ,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Spanish Bonds  The  yield (GSPG10YR)  on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose 14 basis points,
sending the difference in yield with bunds 12 basis points
wider. Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government may
apply for loans from the European Union’s rescue fund and the
 International Monetary Fund  to help restructure the country’s
financial industry, Expansion reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter.  Spain has no plans to seek external help to fund its
overhaul of the industry, said Carmen Martinez Castro, the
deputy minister for communication.  Sterling stayed higher and 10-year gilts pared declines
after the Debt Management Office sold five-year notes at a lower
yield than in the previous sale in December.  The debt agency sold 3.75 billion pounds of gilts maturing
in 2017 at an average yield of 1.102 percent compared with 1.125
percent in December. The auction attracted bids for 2.02 times
the amount of securities on offer.  The pound also gained against the euro and the Swiss franc
as  Bank of England  data showed foreign investors boosted their
gilt holdings by 16.3 billion pounds in November, the biggest
monthly rise since September 2008. That’s an increase from the
net purchase of 12.5 billion pounds in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
