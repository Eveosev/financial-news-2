Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose the most in more than a week after an
unexpected rise in inflation fueled speculation the central bank
may shorten its cycle of interest-rate cuts.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.09 percent at 9:47
a.m. in  Sao Paulo .  Consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose 0.61 percent last month,
compared with 0.60 percent a month earlier, according to the
Foundation Economics Research Institute. The median estimate of
17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for inflation to slow to
0.47 percent.  “The jump in the index was a surprise, it came well above
expectations of the market,”  Newton Rosa , chief-economist at
SulAmerica Investimentos, said in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo. The index “is helping the jump in the DI.”  The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8329 per dollar after
surging 2.22 percent to 1.8307 yesterday, the biggest jump in
two months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
