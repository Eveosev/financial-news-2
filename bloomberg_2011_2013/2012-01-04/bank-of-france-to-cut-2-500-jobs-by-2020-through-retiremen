The Bank of France said it will cut
2,500 jobs by 2020 by replacing half of those retiring, cutting
the central bank’s staff to 10,500.  Because of an expansion of its workforce in the 1970s, the
bank faces a “demographic shock” with 5,000 people retiring in
the next eight years, a spokeswoman said in a telephone
interview today. A high proportion of the 2,500 people it will
need to recruit will be in management roles, she said. The bank
has already reduced its staff by 2,000 in the past 10 years,
also through non-replacement.  In an interview with Agence France-Presse that was
confirmed by the press office, human resources director,
Frederic Peyret, said the bank is working on a reorganization
plan that will be presented to its worker councils by the middle
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
