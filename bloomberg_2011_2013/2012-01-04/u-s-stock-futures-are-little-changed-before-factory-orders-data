U.S. stocks erased an early loss to
finish little changed, leaving the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
at the highest level since July, as improving sales at retailers
and carmakers helped offset lower-than-forecast factory orders.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  rose 1.5 percent after carmakers reported
December sales that beat analysts’ estimates, capping the
industry’s best year since 2008.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , Lowe’s Cos.
and Starbucks Corp. advanced at least 1.4 percent after the
International Council of Shopping Centers increased its estimate
for December retail-sales growth.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  lost 3.1 percent
after appointing Scott Thompson chief executive officer.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,277.30 at 4 p.m. New York time, after dropping as much as
0.7 percent earlier. The benchmark index is at its highest level
since Oct. 28. The Dow added 21.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to
12,418.42 today.  “We started the day with a bit of a pullback from
yesterday’s strong rise, and then the data that we got this
morning helps the market and firms up the conviction that the
 U.S. economy  is doing well,” Giri Cherukuri, head trader for
Oakbrook Investments, which manages $2.7 billion in Lisle,
Illinois, said in a telephone interview.  The  S&P 500   lost (SPX)  0.04 point to 1,257.60 in 2011, the
smallest annual change since 1947. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities surged 14 percent from last year’s lowest level on Oct.
3 through Dec. 30 as better-than-estimated economic data fueled
optimism the world’s largest economy can shrug off concern over
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Stocks rallied yesterday,
sending the Dow to the highest level since July 26, amid signs
that manufacturing output is increasing from China to Australia
and America.  Factory Goods  U.S. equities fell earlier today as bookings for  factory
goods (TMNOCHNG)  rose 1.8 percent after a revised 0.2 percent drop the
prior month, data from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington . Economists in a Bloomberg survey had estimated a 2
percent increase, according to the median forecast.  Global stocks also declined as UniCredit SpA, Italy’s
largest bank, said it will sell new shares in a 7.5 billion-euro
($9.8 billion) offer to strengthen its capital position. The
rights offer boosted concern that lenders may struggle to raise
more capital to weather the region’s debt crisis. The  European
Central Bank  reported overnight deposits from financial
institutions rose to an all-time high and Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the European Union is facing a
recession of unknown scope.  Retail Sales  Stocks of companies that rely on consumer discretionary
spending had the biggest  gain (S5COND)  among S&P 500 industries, rising
0.7 percent as a group.  Retail sales at stores open more than a year may have
gained as much as 4.5 percent in December, more than previously
estimated, as U.S. shoppers pursued holiday discounts, the
International Council of Shopping Centers said in a statement
today. Same-store sales in December were earlier projected to
have advanced as much as 4 percent, the trade group said.  Home Depot rallied 1.4 percent to $42.74. Lowe’s added 3.7
percent to $26.47, while  Starbucks (SBUX)  advanced 2 percent to $46.17.
Ralph Lauren Corp. gained 4.2 percent to $142.88,  Coach Inc. (COH) 
rose 2.6 percent to $61.59 and  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  increased
2.4 percent to $28.41.  Ford gained 1.5 percent to $11.30. The second-biggest U.S.
automaker said total company sales in December increased 10
percent, the best since 2005, beating analysts’ estimate of 7.7
percent, and sales in the U.S. increased 17 percent in 2011.  Patent Lawsuit  TiVo Inc. (TIVO)  rallied 10 percent to $9.82. The Dallas-based
company settled a patent lawsuit over digital video recorders
with AT&T Inc., which agreed to pay at least $215 million. TiVo,
a pioneer in the market for set-top boxes that can record a TV
program and play it back at the same time, had lost customers to
offerings from TV-service providers including AT&T. TiVo accused
those companies of using its patented time-warp technology.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  advanced 11 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $80.45. The company said users of its online movie and TV-
streaming service watched more than 2 billion hours of content
in the fourth quarter, exceeding the 1.2 billion-hour estimate
of  Richard Greenfield , an analyst with BTIG Research.  Yahoo dropped 3.1 percent to $15.78. The Internet company
appointed Thompson, former president of  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal, as
CEO four months after firing  Carol Bartz  for failing to drive a
turnaround.  Considered Options  Yahoo has considered options including divestitures, and
drew interest from multiple parties, according to a memo to
employees in September. Chairman Roy Bostock said on a
conference call that he has no plans to take Yahoo private. EBay
tumbled 3.8 percent to $30.16.  Shares of financial companies declined 0.5 percent as a
group in the S&P 500, trimming a steeper drop of as much as 1.6
percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  reversed losses, rising 0.2
percent to $5.81 after dropping as much as 3.1 percent earlier.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  gained 0.6 percent to $34.95 after falling
1.2 percent.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK)  tumbled 28 percent to 47 cents. The
imaging company that lost 88 percent of its market value last
year may file for bankruptcy protection this month or early
February if it can’t sell digital patents, the Wall Street
Journal reported today, citing people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
