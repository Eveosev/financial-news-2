More U.S. women are having twins
because of a rise in infertility treatment and aging mothers,
according to the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention .  One in every 30 babies born today is a twin, an increase
from 1 in 53 in 1980, according to the report. The rate doubled 
among women ages 35 to 39 and tripled among those 40 and over.  Mothers in their late thirties, even without fertility
treatments, are likelier to have two babies from the same
pregnancy, and there are more older mothers today. Treatments
such as in vitro fertilization, and other assisted reproductive
technologies, increase the chance of multiple births. More than 
one baby born at once can lead to lower birth weights and health 
complications for the babies and the mother, the report said.  By the early 1980s, twins and other multiples “began to
rise, ultimately leading to what has been called ‘an epidemic of
multiple pregnancies,’” the authors of  the report  wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
