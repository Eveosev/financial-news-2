A European Union court  rejected  a
legal complaint asking it to cancel European Central Bank
decisions to buy euro area government debt and to accept Greek,
Irish and Portuguese debt from banks as collateral.  The EU General Court, the region’s second-highest tribunal,
said on its website that the complaint filed by Stefan Staedter
in Berlin was “manifestly inadmissible” because it was filed
more than two months after the start of the ECB’s bond-buying
program and decisions to accept collateral.  Staedter, a lawyer working for German-based campaign group
Europolis, didn’t immediately respond to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment.  Europolis is headed by academic Markus C. Kerber who last
year asked  Germany ’s constitutional court to block the country’s
participation in the EU bailout of  Portugal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
