CAPM Investment PJSC , a financial
services company based in  Abu Dhabi , may suspend operations if
global market conditions don’t improve in the next three months,
two bankers with knowledge of the situation said.  The company is in the process of halting asset management
services and may suspend the investment banking business, said
one of the bankers, who declined to be identified because the
matter hasn’t been made public.  CAPM, whose subsidiaries include brokerage Asayel Shares &
Bonds Trading LLC and Ithmar Invest PJSC, was set up in
September 2007, according to its website.  Two officials at the company declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
