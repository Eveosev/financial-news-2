The Czech Finance Ministry may
propose unifying the value-added tax at 19 percent in the middle
of this year to boost state budget revenue,  Mlada Fronta Dnes 
reported, citing a ministry document.  Raising the VAT rate to 19 percent in the middle of the
year would increase budget revenue by about 25 billion koruna
($1.3 billion), the newspaper reported. The Czech Republic now
has two VAT brackets, at 14 percent and 20 percent, and the
government plans to unify the tax rate at 17.5 percent next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
