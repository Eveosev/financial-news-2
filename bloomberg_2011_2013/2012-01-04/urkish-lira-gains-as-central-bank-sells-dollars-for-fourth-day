The lira depreciated from a three
week high against the dollar on concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen and amid speculation the central bank reduced
its U.S. currency sales.  The lira weakened 0.5 percent to 1.8828 per dollar at 5:08
p.m. in Istanbul, the second time in three days. Turkey’s
currency closed yesterday at 1.8735, the strongest level since
Dec. 12.  “Overall the market is currently in risk-off mode as bad
news out of the Eurozone are hitting the wires again,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt ,
said in e-mailed comments.  The  European Central Bank  reported overnight deposits from
financial institutions rose to an all-time high and Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the European Union is
facing a recession of unknown scope.  Turkey  sells half of its
exports to Europe.  Turkey’s central bank probably sold between $200 million
and $250 million today including $100 million in its daily
dollar sale auction, Burcin Metin, chief currency trader at ING
Bank AS, said in e-mailed comments. This would be its lowest
dollar sale since Dec. 29 when it began tightening lira
liquidity to support the currency.  The bank has withheld lira funding at the benchmark rate of
5.75 percent since Dec. 28 and lent 3 billion liras in a one-
week repo auction yesterday at an average annual rate of 11.86
percent. The lira lost 18 percent last year as inflation
accelerated to 10.5 percent in December, the fastest pace in
three years.  Yields on the  two-year benchmark note (TRABNBM)  fell 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 11.43, declining from its highest
since July 2009, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond
Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
