Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index
advanced to the highest level in three weeks, led by  Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , after economic reports in the U.S. and
Germany boosted optimism about the global economic recovery.  Abu Dhabi Commercial, the United Arab Emirates third-
biggest lender by assets, rallied the most in a month.  First
Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  gained 0.3 percent after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
said the lender controlled by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family may pay
a higher dividend in 2011 and this year. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  climbed 0.3 percent to 2,416.61, the highest since Dec.
14, at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.1 percent.  “The tailwind is coming from the strong overnight gains in
global markets,” said  Ali Khan , London-based head of  Middle
East  and North Africa equities sales at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. “In the absence of any specific negative news in the
U.A.E., there is little or no reason to be hitting stocks
down.”  Manufacturing across the globe showed improvement in
December, suggesting production is weathering strains from
Europe’s debt crisis. In the U.S., a report yesterday showed
factory output grew last month at the fastest pace in six
months. A separate report showed that manufacturing output in
Germany, Europe’s largest economy, beat economists’ estimates.
The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  increased 1 percent today, while the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  in New York advanced 1.6 percent
yesterday.  Dubai Declines  Abu Dhabi Commercial rose 2.5 percent, the most since Dec.
4, to 2.84 dirhams. First Gulf advanced to as much as 15.65
dirhams before closing at 15.55 dirhams, the highest since Dec.
18.  About 42  million shares (VOLDFM)  traded in Abu Dhabi today, compared
