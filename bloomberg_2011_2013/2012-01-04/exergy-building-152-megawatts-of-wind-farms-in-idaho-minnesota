Exergy Development Group is building
wind parks in  Idaho  and  Minnesota  with total capacity of 152
megawatts, enough for more than 40,000 homes.  About 116 megawatts of turbines will be installed across
Twin Falls, Lincoln and Bingham counties in Idaho, and 36
megawatts will be in Faribault County in Minnesota, Exergy said
today in a statement. Construction began in November and the
projects are scheduled to be completed before the end of the
year, the Boise, Idaho-based developer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
