Hong Kong  stocks (HSI)  fell as Premier Wen
Jiabao said  China  faces “relatively difficult” business
conditions, tempering gains by exporters on better-than-
estimated economic data from the U.S. and  Germany .  Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the Hong Kong developer, retailer and
airline operator, led declines, dropping 14 percent as it spins
off its property unit. Agile Property Holdings Ltd., a developer
of properties in mainland China, fell 6.5 percent. Li & Fung
Ltd., the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., climbed 0.7
percent as U.S. manufacturing increased and German unemployment
unexpectedly fell.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.8 percent to 18,727.31 at the 4
p.m. close. More than two stocks fell for each that rose in the
48-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies’ H shares fell 1.4 percent to 10,094.41.  The Hang Seng Index fell 20 percent in 2011 as China raised
 interest rates  and lenders’ reserve requirements to curb
inflation and slow the advance of property prices.  “Investors are concerned about liquidity in the market and
this adds to worries about the economic slowdown after Wen’s
comments,” said Chen Liqiu, a strategist at Jianghai Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “We need reserve-ratio cuts for the liquidity
issue to be eased.”  Companies in the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , which climbed 2.4 percent
on the first trading day of the new year yesterday, traded at
9.4 times  forecast earnings (HSI) , down from 14.4 times at the end of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index traded at 12.1 times.  Stabilizing Growth  Wen said business conditions may be “relatively
difficult” this quarter and monetary policy will be fine-tuned
as needed. The government seeks to stabilize growth and consumer
prices to “promote social harmony,” he said during a two-day
trip to  Hunan province , according to a statement on the
government’s website yesterday.  China’s money supply has “structural issues” and one
can’t simply say that there is too much or too little lending or
liquidity, Wen said. The government will tighten or loosen
policies according to the needs of different industries, he
said.  Agile Property dropped 6.5 percent to HK$6.57.  Anhui Conch
Cement Co. (914) , China’s biggest maker of the key building material
by sales, fell 4.4 percent to HK$22.60. China Shenhua Energy
Co., a coal producer, slipped 2.3 percent to HK$34.10.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  declined 0.2 percent today. The
index rose 1.6 percent in  New York  yesterday as manufacturing
across the globe showed improvement in December, suggesting
production is weathering strains from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  U.S. Factories  A report showed U.S. factory activity grew at the fastest
pace in six months. Australian manufacturing expanded for the
first time in six months, while similar Chinese and German data
beat economist estimates.  Li & Fung rose 0.7 percent to HK$15.34. China Cosco
Holdings Co., a shipping company, climbed 1.8 percent to
HK$3.99. China Merchants Holdings International Co., an investor
in mainland ports, added 1.7 percent to HK$24.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 percent to 18,771.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  retreated 2 percent to 24.42,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 7 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  Swire Pacific, the biggest commercial landlord in  Hong
Kong ’s Island East district, slid the most since 1997 as the
shares began trading ex-dividend and after UBS AG said the
company may be valued differently by investors after the
proposed spinoff of its property unit. The shares tumbled 14
percent to HK$80.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
