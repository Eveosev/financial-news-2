Scotland  outperformed the rest of the
U.K. housing market in 2011 as financial services and the  energy
industry  helped boost values in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, real-
estate website  Zoopla  said today.  Home values in Scotland gained more than 6.7 percent last
year, the most in the U.K., to an average of 164,844 pounds
($258,000), recovering from a slump that began in 2007.  London 
had the second-biggest jump, gaining 2.3 percent to 416,890
pounds, amid tight supply and high demand, Zoopla said in a
statement. The typical house price in Britain fell about 0.2
percent to 221,331 pounds for the year, according to Zoopla.  “National statistics on the housing market can mask
differing fortunes in different parts of the country,” Nicholas
Leeming, a director at Zoopla, said in the statement.
“Londoners continue to see the market go from strength to
strength with high demand for a limited number of properties.”  Housing demand nationwide weakened as banks curbed mortgage
lending and consumers were squeezed by government spending cuts
and tax increases aimed at narrowing the  budget deficit . Britain
has a 50 percent chance of slipping back into recession in 2012,
the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said in
November.  House prices  in  England  fell 0.75 percent in 2011 to
228,926 pounds, led by a 5.8 percent drop in the northeast. An
average home in the region now costs 156,659 pounds, according
to Zoopla.  “The northeast had a high public service dependency and
that’s taking longer to recover,” Leeming said by telephone.
“There’s no obvious substitute employer in the area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
