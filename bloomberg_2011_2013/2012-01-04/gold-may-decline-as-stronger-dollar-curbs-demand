Gold futures rose to the highest in
two weeks on demand for a haven as the European Union moved
closer to halting oil purchases from  Iran , stepping up the
confrontation over the Islamic republic’s nuclear program.  EU foreign ministers may announce harsher sanctions on
Iran’s energy and banking industries at a meeting on Jan. 30
after Greece ended objections to an oil embargo, EU spokesman
 Michael Mann  said. The move will help in “tightening the noose
around Iran economically,” the U.S. State Department said. In
the fourth quarter, gold fell for the first time since 2008.  “The safe-haven story is back because of the political
developments,” David Meger, the director of metal trading at
Vision Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Also, we are seeing some bargain hunters return at
current levels.”  Gold futures for February delivery gained 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,612.70 at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . After
the close, the price reached $1,619.80 in electronic trading,
the highest for a most-active contract since Dec. 21.  Gold may rally to $2,400 this year, Citigroup Inc. said
today. The record was $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  The correction has “run its course and a rally is now back
on the cards,”  Tom Fitzpatrick , the chief technical analyst at
Citibank in New York, said in a report.  UBS AG said today that its physical gold sales to India,
the world’s top buyer, doubled from yesterday.  “As the new year begins, physical demand is evident,”
 Edel Tully , a UBS analyst, said in a report.  China ’s “gold
appetite” has been elevated since mid-December, she said.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 1.6 percent to
$29.097 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$29.74, the highest since Dec. 21.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery fell 1.5 percent to $653.55 an ounce. Platinum
futures for April delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $1,426.30 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
