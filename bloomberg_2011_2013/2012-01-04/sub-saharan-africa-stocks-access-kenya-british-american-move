publicly traded Internet company, jumped 8.7 percent, the most

full-year profit.  “Earnings for 2011 are expected to be substantially
stronger than 2010 and we are seeing a lot of position taking on
the counter,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today. “Although
it did not have a good first half, the second half is expected
to be good.”  British American Investment Co. (BRIT)  (BRIT KN), a Kenyan
diversified financial services group, slumped 8.1 percent to 5.1
shillings, the most since Sept. 15, on concern its earnings will
suffer from a plunge in the Kenyan stock market last year.  “In 2011 the earnings per share will be down by about 50
percent,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based
Apex  Africa  Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “Everyone in the
market has factored in the risk that these guys have a huge
exposure to the capital markets; that is why the market has
assigned a discount to the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
