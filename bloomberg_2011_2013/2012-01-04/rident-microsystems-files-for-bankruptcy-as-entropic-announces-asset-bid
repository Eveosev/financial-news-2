Trident Microsystems Inc., a provider
of integrated circuit chips and software for computers and
television set-top boxes, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in Delaware, citing an economic slowdown.  In petitions today, the Sunnyvale, California-based company
listed debts and assets of as much as $500 million each. Among
the largest unsecured creditors listed in court papers was  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) , of San Jose, California, owed $4.34 million in
trade debt.  “Trident has experienced continuing operating losses which
have resulted in declining cash over the past year” in the face
of competition from Asia, Stuart M. Brown, a lawyer representing
the company, said in court documents.  In a related announcement,  Entropic Communications Inc. (ENTR) ,
based in  San Diego , said it would bid $55 million to buy some
Trident assets at auction.  “Entropic would plan to hire approximately 385 Trident
employees located primarily in China, India, the United Kingdom,
Taiwan, Korea and the United States,” Entropic said in a
statement today. It said it would “acquire facilities in
Austin, Texas, Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Hyderabad, India,
and would use portions of Trident’s facilities in China, Taiwan
and Korea.”  The case is In re  Trident Microsystems Inc. (TRID) , 12-10069, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
