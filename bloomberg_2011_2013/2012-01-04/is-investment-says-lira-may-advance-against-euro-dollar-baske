Turkey ’s lira may advance 4 percent
against the dollar and euro basket this year as the central
bank’s tight monetary policy makes lira assets more attractive
for the carry trade, Is Investment said.  The Istanbul-based broker reduced its overweight call for
Turkish stocks to hold and is more optimistic for bonds because
Turkey offers highest  interest rates  among emerging markets
after Brazil, the broker said in a written statement distributed
to reporters at a conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
