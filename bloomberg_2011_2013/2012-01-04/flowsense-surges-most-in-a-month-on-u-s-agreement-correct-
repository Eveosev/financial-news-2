Flowsense Medical Ltd. (FLSN)  surged the
most in almost three months after the maker of an automated
urine monitor system signed a memorandum of understanding with a
U.S. distributor for the marketing of its URINFO 2000 system.  The  shares (FLSN)  surged 9.1 percent, the biggest jump since Oct.
5, to 0.084 shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Flowsense  said  it signed the agreement with Doctors Oxygen
Services Inc., a distributor of equipment to hospitals in the
U.S., to market its URINFO 2000 system in some parts of the
country, according to a filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
today. Flowsense said the parties are working toward the
completion of a detailed distribution agreement by Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
