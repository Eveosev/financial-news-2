The  New York Giants ’ 31-14 win over
the Dallas Cowboys Jan. 1 on NBC was the most-watched regular-
season primetime National Football League game in the network’s
six years of broadcasting the sport at night.  New York’s victory, in which the team clinched the National
Football Conference East title to set up a playoff meeting with
the Atlanta Falcons on Jan. 8, was seen by 27.6 million viewers,
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal said in a  statement  citing  Nielsen
Media Research .  The viewership total was 42 percent higher than last year’s
NFC West-deciding game between the St. Louis Rams and Seattle
Seahawks, which drew 19.4 million viewers, NBC said.  The Giants-Cowboys matchup eclipsed a Sept. 9, 2010,
season-opening game between the  New Orleans Saints  and Green Bay
Packers, which drew 27.5 million viewers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
