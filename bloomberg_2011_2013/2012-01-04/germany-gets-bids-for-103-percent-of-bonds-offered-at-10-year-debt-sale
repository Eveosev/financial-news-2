Germany  got bids for 5.14 billion
euros ($6.69 billion) of bunds, exceeding the maximum target at
a 10-year sale for the first time in three auctions, the
Bundesbank said in a statement today.  The debt agency accepted bids for 4.06 billion euros of the
2 percent securities maturing in January 2022, out of a possible
5 billion euros on offer. The average yield was 1.93 percent and
the weighted average price was 100.67 according to the
statement.  On the previous two occasions that Germany auctioned 10-
year debt, the nation failed to receive bids for the maximum
amount on offer. At a sale of the 2022 bonds on Nov. 23,
participants in the auction submitted bids for 64.8 percent of
the target. The securities that day were sold at an average
yield of 1.98 percent. Benchmark 10-year yields reached a record
low 1.636 percent on Sept. 23.  “Today’s auction was not as bad as in late November but it
clearly shows that dealers are very cautious in extending their
long position in the super-rich German 10-year segment,”
Annalisa Piazza, an economist at Newedge Group in  London , wrote
in an e-mailed note. Total bids were “just a touch higher than
the total amount on tap.”  The 10-year bund pared a decline in the secondary market
after the auction, leaving the yield little changed at 1.90
percent at 11:41 a.m. London time. The euro dropped 0.5 percent
to $1.32984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
