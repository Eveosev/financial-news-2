Coffee shipments from Uganda,
 Africa ’s largest exporter of the crop, climbed 1.9 percent in
December after dry weather boosted the harvest and drying of the
crop, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments last month rose to 242,301 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags, from 237,747 bags a year earlier, the agency said
today by e-mail from the capital, Kampala.  The country’s coffee exports from Oct. 1 through September
2012 may rise to 3.3 million bags, from 3.15 million bags in
2010-11, because of a bigger crop, the authority said last month
without providing production forecasts. Exports in 2010-11 were
worth $448.89 million, the authority said.  The December exports brought the shipment in the first
three months of the season to 684,763 bags, 1.1 percent less
than 692,485 bags in the same period last season, according to a
tally of UCDA figures by Bloomberg News.  The country’s replanting program may boost its output to
4.5 million bags by 2015, according to UCDA. The nation consumes
about 3 percent of its annual coffee crop and the rest is
exported, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association.  Uganda  was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
9th overall in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to the
London-based  International Coffee Organization . Robusta beans,
which are used in espressos and instant drinks, account for
about 85 percent of the nation’s annual production, according to
the UCDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
