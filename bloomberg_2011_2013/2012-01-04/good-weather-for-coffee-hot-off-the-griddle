Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. "It was a good year for Brazilian  coffee ," states the 78-year-old coffee brokerage Escritorio Carvalhaes, in its last 2011 weekly report. Arabica beans, the coffee variety common at Starbucks, finished the year expensive -- 42 percent above the 5-year average. High prices were caused in part by heavy rains last spring in  Colombia , influenced by a strong La Nina. Now, coffee addicts are paying the price. Starbucks announced yesterday it would raise  prices  on some drinks across many of its 10,800 U.S. locations. The outlook for 2012? Carvalhaes: Extreme weather and “market fundamentals will maintain prices in 2012."
