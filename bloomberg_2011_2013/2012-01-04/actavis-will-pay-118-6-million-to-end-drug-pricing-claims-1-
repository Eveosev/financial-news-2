Units of  Actavis Group Hf (ACT)  agreed to
pay $118.6 million to resolve claims that they caused the U.S.
and four state governments to overpay for drugs.  The settlement, filed Dec. 29 in federal court in  Boston ,
followed an $84 million accord announced a day earlier over a
lawsuit by the  state of Texas (STOTX1) , bringing the total to $202.6
million. In February, a state court jury in Austin ordered units
of the Iceland-based company to pay $170 million for inflating
billings to the Texas Medicaid program.  In the larger accord, Actavis settled with the U.S.,  New
York , Florida,  South Carolina  and  Iowa . The case was filed by
Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Ven-
A-Care sued under the U.S. False Claims Act, as well as similar
state laws, which let whistle-blowers sue on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery.  Gerard Farrell, a spokesman for Actavis Inc., based in
Morristown,  New Jersey , had no immediate comment.  Ven-A-Care has settled more than 20 lawsuits since 2000
that allowed state and federal governments to collect about $3
billion. Ven-A-Care collected more than $400 million in whistle-
blower fees during that period.  The case is In re Pharmaceutical Average Wholesale Price
Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). The Texas case is State of Texas Ex.
Rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., D-1-GV-08-1566, Texas
District Court, Travis County (Austin).  To contact the reporters on this story:
