The U.S. Commerce Department is
delaying for a month its decision on additional tariffs for
Chinese solar-equipment imports.  The department will make a preliminary determination on
whether to add tariffs Feb. 13, according to a notice in the
Dec. 29 Federal Register. The postponement will allow more time
for analysis, Ben Santarris, a spokesman for  SolarWorld AG (SWV) ’s
U.S. unit, said yesterday.  U.S. solar-equipment manufacturers say they are being
harmed because  China ’s government uses cash grants, discounts on
raw materials, preferential loans and tax incentives, and
manipulates its currency to boost exports of solar cells.
SolarWorld, a maker of solar modules, filed a complaint Oct. 19
with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Commerce
Department, seeking duties to offset the practices.  The trade commission on Dec. 2 said the Chinese subsidies
have harmed equipment makers, ruling on the petition by Bonn-
based SolarWorld seeking antidumping and countervailing duties.
The commission is proceeding with an investigation.  The commission is examining possible economic harm to
SolarWorld from Chinese imports, while the department determines
the penalty for Chinese companies that illegally dump products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
