AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS) , the nation’s
only publicly-traded Internet company, jumped the most in nine
months on speculation it will post a full-year profit.  The stock added 45 cents, or 8.7 percent, to 5.60 shillings
by the close of trading in Nairobi, the biggest jump since April
6, 2011. Shares of the company plunged 62 percent in 2011.  “Earnings for 2011 are expected to be substantially
stronger than 2010 and we are seeing a lot of position taking on
the counter,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today. “Although
it did not have a good first half, the second half is expected
to be good”.  The earnings for the 12 months to Dec. 31 are expected at
133 million shillings ($1.54 million) compared with a loss of 8
million shillings a year earlier, Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., an investment banking company, said Oct. 18.  -- Editors: Ash Kumar, Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
