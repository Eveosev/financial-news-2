Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , a Turkish bank owned by
 Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  and Citigroup Inc., expects credit
growth of between 12 percent and 15 percent in Turkey this year,
Dunya reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
Ziya Akkurt.  The banking business will see no significant profit growth,
Akkurt told the newspaper; the first two months of the year will
be slow, followed by a pickup in economic activity in March, he
was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
