Organizers of the  London Olympics 
said they’ve sold 10,000 tickets too many for the synchronized
swimming competition.  “As a result of finalizing the seating configurations in
our venues and reconciling the millions of Olympic and
Paralympic ticket orders against the seating plans for around
1,000 sporting sessions, we have discovered an error in seats
available in four synchronized swimming sessions,” the London
2012 organizing committee said in an e-mailed statement.  Around 3,000 people who had applied for synchronized
swimming tickets during the second round of the Olympic ticket
sales have been contacted last month by the local organizers.  “We are exchanging their synchronized swimming tickets for
tickets in other sports that they originally applied for,”
Locog said.  The 2012 organizers have been criticized by U.K. consumer
groups including Which? for the way the event’s 8.8 million tickets 
were sold last year. Only 700,000 people were successful in a 
first-round public ballot, with 1.2 million missing out. Another 
sale allowed some of those to subsequently gain tickets.  The London Games start July 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
