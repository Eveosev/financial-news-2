Alkermes Plc (ALKS) , the maker of central
nervous system drugs, said it will move faster than scheduled to
test an experimental treatment for depression after a successful
early-stage trial.  Alkermes, based in Dublin, is seeking a market of people
who don’t respond to typical depression medicines such as  Eli
Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s Prozac, Chief Executive Officer Richard Pops said.
About half of people don’t respond to their first therapy, the
CEO said.  The experimental drug, ALKS 5461, targets opioid receptors
in the brain. It combines buphrenorphine, which stimulates the
receptors and is used to treat heroin addiction, with ALKS 33,
which has the opposite effect, making a non-addictive medicine
that may treat depression, Pops said in a telephone interview.  “We’re very interested in those cases where drugs have
been developed before and we think we can fill a patient need,”
Pops said.  The compound was tested in a study of 32 patients for seven
days and recorded a reduction in depression symptoms, as
measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the company
said in a statement. The results, released today, have led
Alkermes to start the treatment in the second of three phases of
clinical trials usually needed for U.S. regulatory approval. The
company also is developing ALKS 5461 for cocaine addiction.  Alkermes declined less than 1 percent to $17.20 at the
close in  New York . The stock gained 41 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
