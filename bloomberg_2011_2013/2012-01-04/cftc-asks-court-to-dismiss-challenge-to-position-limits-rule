The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a challenge
by two Wall Street groups to its rule that limits commodity
speculation, one of the financial industry’s highest-profile
efforts to weaken last year’s Dodd-Frank law.  The CFTC filed its request today in the U.S. Court of
Appeals in  Washington , arguing the appeals court doesn’t have
jurisdiction to consider the lawsuit. The agency said that the
district court must first consider a challenge to the rule.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. 
and  Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  filed
lawsuits in two federal courts in Washington last month, arguing
that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-Frank when it
decided to impose the restrictions. The associations also said
the CFTC failed to properly weigh the rule’s costs and benefits.  In response to questions from the district court judge, the
groups said last month they didn’t oppose putting the district
court case on hold while the appeals court considers the
challenge.  The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. CFTC, 11-01491, is  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
