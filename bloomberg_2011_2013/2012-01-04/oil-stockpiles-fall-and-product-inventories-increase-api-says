Crude oil inventories declined 4.43
million barrels to 334.5 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories (APISDIST)  rose 5.25 million barrels to
145.4 million, the API’s weekly report showed. The gain was the
largest since July 2008.  Gasoline stockpiles (APISMGAS)  rose 3.38 million
to 219.1 million.  Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma (APISCUSH) , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 200,000
barrels to 29.3 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , a day later than usual
because of the New Year’s Day holiday.  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
1 million barrels last week, according to the median of 13
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably gained 1 million barrels, the survey
showed. Distillates were also expected to grow by 1 million.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 51 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $103.47 a barrel at 4:33 p.m. in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled
at $103.22, traded at $103.51 before the report was released at
4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
