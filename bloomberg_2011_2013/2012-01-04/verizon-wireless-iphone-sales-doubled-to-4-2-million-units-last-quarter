Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
mobile carrier, sold 4.2 million  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones in the
fourth quarter, more than doubling from the third quarter, said
Fran Shammo, finance chief of the company’s parent.  The iPhone sales will narrow gross margins at the wireless
business by 500 to 600 basis points, Shammo, chief financial
officer of  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , said today at a
Citigroup Inc. event in San Francisco. U.S. carriers sell
smartphones such as the iPhone to subscribers at a loss to get
them to sign up for contracts that typically run for two years.  The demand suggests Verizon Wireless is winning an
increasing share of new iPhone users, after gaining rights to
offer the handset to its subscribers last year. In the third
quarter, Verizon added 2 million customers for the device,
trailing the 2.7 million iPhone activations at  AT&T Inc. (T) , which
has offered the handset since 2007.  Even with lower iPhone activations, Verizon Wireless has
outpaced AT&T in total subscriber gains, helped by demand for
handsets that run on Google Inc.’s Android operating system.
Verizon Wireless, jointly owned by New York-based Verizon
Communications and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , added 882,000 contract,
or postpaid, subscribers in the third quarter, compared with
319,000 at Dallas-based AT&T.  Verizon  shares (VZ)  fell 1.3 percent to $39.21 at the close in
New York. The stock advanced 12 percent last year, compared with
a 2.9 percent gain by AT&T. AT&T added 0.2 percent to $30.43
today and Cupertino, California-based Apple rose 0.5 percent to
$413.44.  To contact the reporter on this story:
