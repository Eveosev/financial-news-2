Genesis Energy LP (GEL)  expanded its
position in the  Gulf of Mexico , buying oil-pipeline stakes from
 Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  for $205.9 million today and planning a new
line with  Enterprise Products Partners LP. (EPD)   Genesis, based in Houston, will buy Marathon Oil’s
interests in pipelines connected to terminals in  Louisiana 
including  Poseidon Oil Pipeline (0038755D)  Co., the Odyssey Pipeline and
the Eugene Island Pipeline System, according to a statement
today.  The pipelines will allow Genesis to provide more options to
oil producers and refiners, it said.  Genesis will also build a Gulf of Mexico oil-gathering
pipeline with Enterprise Products Partners to serve the Lucius
development area in the deep-water Gulf, it said in a separate
statement today.  Marathon Oil continues to look for opportunities to improve
its asset base after selling about $3.5 billion of exploration
and production holdings from 2006 to 2010, John Porretto, a
Marathon Oil spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  “We continue the ongoing review of our global portfolio
with a goal of an additional $1.5 billion to $3 billion in
divestitures between mid-2011 and 2014,” Porretto said.  Genesis rose 1.6 percent to $28.32 at the close in  New
York . Marathon Oil climbed 0.2 percent to $31.03.  To contact the reporter on this story:
