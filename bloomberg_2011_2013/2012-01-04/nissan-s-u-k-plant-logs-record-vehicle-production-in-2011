Nissan Motor (7201)  Co. produced a record
number of vehicles at its U.K. plant last year, aided by demand
for the Japanese carmaker’s Qashqai and Juke models.  The factory in Sunderland, northeast England manufactured
480,485 cars in 2011, an increase of 14 percent compared with
2010, the Yokohama-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The plant will start producing  lithium-ion batteries  this
year and begin making Leaf electric vehicles in 2013, Nissan
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
