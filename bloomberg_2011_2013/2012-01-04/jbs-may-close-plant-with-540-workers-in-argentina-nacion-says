Brazilian beef producer JBS SA may
close a meatpacking plant in  Argentina  and relocate or
compensate 540 workers, La Nacion reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  The plant in Venado Tuerto, Rosario province, stopped
slaughtering on Dec. 17 and sent staff on mandatory vacation,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. Most of the beef produced
at the plant is for export, according to La Nacion.  JBS officials in Sao Paulo didnâ€™t immediately return a call
from Bloomberg News seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
