French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
Germany’s  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will discuss European
economic convergence and a new treaty when they meet in Berlin
on Jan. 9, France’s budget minister and government spokeswoman
Valerie Pecresse said today.  Speaking to reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting in
Paris, Pecresse said the government will proceed with its plan
for a tax on financial transactions, in spite of the risk of
foreign competition, and use the money collected for domestic
issues.  The French senate will vote on legislation that makes it a
crime to deny any genocide recognized by French law before the
end of January, Pecresse said. The bill is a “general” one and
isn’t “against Turkey,” she told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
