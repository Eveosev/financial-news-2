India ’s 10-year bond yields were near
the lowest level in more than a week on optimism a central bank
plan to buy government debt will boost demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India said yesterday it will purchase
120 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) of notes due in 2017, 2021,
2022 and 2027 in an open-market auction on Jan. 6. It bought 412
billion rupees of securities since Nov. 24, official data show,
to ease a cash crunch at banks and help a record sovereign
borrowing program succeed. India boosted its annual debt-sales
target by 8.5 percent last week to 5.1 trillion rupees.  “The RBI’s open-market purchases are keeping yields down
this week,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “This is helping ease the
negative sentiment among investors due to the huge government
borrowing program.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 was
8.37 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It fell to 8.36 percent yesterday, the lowest level
since Dec. 22.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose two basis points to 7.70 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
