David Stern , the Florida foreclosure
lawyer who profited off the state’s housing bust before losing
his biggest clients, was sued by a partner company that claims
it was damaged by Stern’s foreclosure practices.  DJSP Enterprises Inc. (DJSP) , which took on the non-legal
foreclosure-processing services of Stern’s law firm and depended
on his referrals, said in a copy of a complaint included in a
regulatory filing dated Jan. 3 that Stern concealed his business
was “systematically engaging in unlawful and fraudulent
conduct” in foreclosures.  Those practices jeopardized Stern’s relationships with his
biggest clients, including banks and government mortgage
companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac , and the viability of his
law firm and DJSP, according to the complaint.  DJSP said the complaint was filed yesterday in Broward
County,  Florida . The filing of the suit couldn’t be immediately
confirmed with the court.  Jeffrey Tew, a lawyer for Stern, said his client would
fight the claims. Stern’s law firm has stopped handling
foreclosure cases, according to Tew.  “We don’t think the allegations are well founded,” he
said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
