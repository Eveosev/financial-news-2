The European Commission will discuss
on Jan. 11 a controversial Hungarian central bank law and the
possible resumption of talks with the Budapest government on
financial aid, news website  Bruxinfo  reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  The commission, the European Unionâ€™s executive arm, will
also debate judicial legislation recently passed by the
Hungarian legislature and the next phase of the  deficit (HUGBCBAL) 
procedure against the country, Bruxinfo said.  Specific measures may be taken next week on the central
bank law and the judicial legislation, both of which have
already been criticized by the commission, and on the deficit
procedure, the website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
