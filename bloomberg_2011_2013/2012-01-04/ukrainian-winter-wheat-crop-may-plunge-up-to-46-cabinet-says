Ukraine’s winter-wheat harvest may
plunge as much as 46 percent this year because of adverse
weather, according to the government.  The crop may come to between 12 million and 16 million
metric tons, “should weather conditions for winter wheat plants
continue to be critical,” the Kiev-based cabinet said in a
statement on its website today. That compares with last year’s
22.4 million tons.  Milling-quality wheat will account for between 6 million
and 8 million tons of the 2012 harvest, the cabinet said,
against 13.5 million tons last year.  Stockpiles will meet domestic needs and leave an exportable
surplus, according to the statement. Carryover grain inventories
probably will be about 9.1 million tons as of July 1, the
cabinet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
