Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. (8601)  rose the most in more than two months on
speculation that a financial-market recovery will help revive
business at Japan’s biggest securities firms.  Nomura climbed 6.9 percent to 249 yen at the close of the
first day of trading this year on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Daiwa jumped 4.6 percent to 251 yen. Both advances were the
biggest since Oct. 27.  Japan’s benchmark Topix index rose 2 percent, also the
steepest gain since Oct. 27, after reports in the U.S. and
Germany added to signs the global economy is weathering  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis. Nomura probably returned to pretax profit
in the three months ended Dec. 31, Kouichi Niwa, an analyst at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in  Tokyo , wrote in a report.  “Return reversal is expected in the market and that’s
supporting the stocks, which fell last year,” said Hideyuki Suzuki, Tokyo-based manager of investment market research at SBI
Securities Co., a unit of financier SBI Holdings Inc.  Nomura tumbled 55 percent in 2011 and smaller rival Daiwa
slid 43 percent as the Tokyo-based firms posted losses from
operations abroad and equity underwriting business shrank
following the country’s record earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
