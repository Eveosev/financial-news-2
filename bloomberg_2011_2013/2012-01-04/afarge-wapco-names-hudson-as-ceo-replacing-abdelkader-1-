Lafarge Cement Wapco Nigeria Plc (WAPCO) , a
unit of Lafarge SA, the world’s largest producer of the building
material, named Joseph Hudson as chief executive officer
following the resignation of Samy Abdelkader.  The company commented in a statement published on the
website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  dated yesterday.  Wapco started output from a new production line at its
factory at Ewekoro in southwestern Nigeria in September. The new
facility would double the company’s output to about 4.5 million
metric tons a year, Abdelkader said on Sept. 21.  With the expansion, the company’s share of the Nigerian
cement market is likely to rise to 19 percent from 14 percent,
Lagos-based BGL Securities said in a Sept. 19 note to clients.
 Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , the country’s biggest producer, has a 57
percent market share, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
