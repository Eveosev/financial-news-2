U.S. stocks were little changed as
consumer, industrial and commodity companies rose, helping the
market reverse an early drop triggered by lower-than-forecast
factory orders and concern  Europe ’s banks need to raise capital.  Ford Motor Co. gained 2.7 percent as carmakers reported
December vehicle sales that beat analysts’ estimates, capping
the U.S. auto industry’s best year since 2008. Home Depot Inc.,
Lowe’s Cos. and Starbucks Corp. advanced at least 1.5 percent
after the International Council of Shopping Centers increased
its estimate for December retail-sales growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped less than 0.1
percent to 1,276.61 at 12:20 p.m. New York time, after tumbling
as much as 0.7 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
increased 5.3 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,402.68.  The  S&P 500  lost 0.04 point to 1,257.60 in 2011, the
smallest annual change since 1947. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities surged 14 percent from last year’s lowest level on Oct.
3 through Dec. 30 as better-than-estimated economic data fueled
optimism the world’s largest economy can shrug off concern over
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Stocks rallied 1.6 percent
yesterday, sending the Dow to the highest level since July, amid
signs that manufacturing output is increasing from China to
Australia and America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
