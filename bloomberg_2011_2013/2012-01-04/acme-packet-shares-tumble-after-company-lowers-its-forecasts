Acme Packet Inc. (APKT) , a seller of
equipment that helps transmit voice and data over Internet
networks, fell the most in more than two months after the
company cut its annual sales and profit estimates.  Acme expects 2011  sales (APKT)  of $308 million to $310 million,
down from an earlier forecast of as much as $320 million,
according to a statement yesterday. Excluding some items, profit
will be $1.03 to $1.05 cents a share, compared with a previous
outlook of up to $1.18.  Acme slid 20 percent to $25.40 at 9:44 a.m., the most since
Oct. 21. The shares fell 42 percent last year.  Service providers in  North America  are keeping a lid on
spending as economic growth remains sluggish. The Bedford,
Massachusetts-based company sells products that help transmit
data over networks while maintaining security. Acme says demand
remains strong from corporate customers, which buy equipment for
their internal systems.  “Our results were impacted by uncertainty in the North
American service provider market,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Ory said in the statement. “Outside of the North American
service provider market, Acme Packet continued to perform very
well -- particularly in our enterprise business as well as in
our  Europe  and Latin America businesses.”  The company will release final 2011 results on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
