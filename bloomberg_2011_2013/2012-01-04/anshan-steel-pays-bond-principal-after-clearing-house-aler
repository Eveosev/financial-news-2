Anshan Iron & Steel Group Co. (347)  has
paid the principal on its 5 billion yuan ($794 million) bond due
today, the nation’s official bond-clearing house said.  Chinabond had said on its website that it was yet to
receive the payment from Anshan Iron & Steel as of this morning,
Sina.com reported, citing a notice posted to the clearing
house’s website. That notice couldn’t be found on Chinabond’s
website after Anshan Iron & Steel’s announcement was posted.  Cao Jincheng, a public relations official for Angang Group,
declined to comment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
