Iraq will increase its daily exports
of Kirkuk crude for January from the Turkish port of Ceyhan on
the Mediterranean by 3.5 percent from last month, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The schedule comprises 18 cargoes totaling 13.88 million
barrels, or 447,742 barrels a day, compared with 432,677 barrels
a day for December, the plan showed. The cargo sizes range from
300,000 barrels to 1.1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
