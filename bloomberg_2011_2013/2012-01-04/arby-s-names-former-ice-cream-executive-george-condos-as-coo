Arby’s Restaurant Group Inc., the
roast-beef sandwich chain spun off from  Wendy’s (WEN)  Co. last year,
named George Condos chief operating officer.  Condos, 56, who has served as chief executive officer of
Friendly Ice Cream Corp. and as senior vice president and brand
officer at Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., began working with the
company in November and started at headquarters yesterday. He
replaced Diana Petrovich-Tao, who left the company.  “There are a number of challenges that the brand currently
has,” Condos said in a telephone interview today. Arby’s is
“really working on the solutions” by simplifying the menu and
improving service speed at its restaurants, he said.  Arby’s has sought to turn around the brand and reverse
slumping revenue, which declined from 2008 to 2010, when it was
owned by Wendy’s. Comparable-restaurant sales rose about 5.5
percent last year, and customer traffic trends also improved,
Condos said. The Atlanta-based restaurant chain has recently
advertised premium beef called “Ultimate Angus” and touted its
menu as “Good Mood Food.”  Roark Capital Group, an Atlanta-based buyout firm, bought
about 82 percent of Arby’s from  Wendy’s (WEN)  in a deal valued at $430
million in July. The sale undid the union created by billionaire
investor  Nelson Peltz  in 2008. Peltz and his Trian Fund
Management LP owned about 24 percent of Dublin, Ohio-based
Wendy’s as of Dec. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There are more than 3,600 Arby’s locations globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
