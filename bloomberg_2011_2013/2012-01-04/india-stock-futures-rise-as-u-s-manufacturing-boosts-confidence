India ’s stock futures rose, signaling
benchmark indexes may extend the biggest gains in two weeks, as
the fastest pace of U.S. manufacturing growth in six months
bolstered confidence in the global economy.  SGX S&P CNX Nifty Index futures (IHA)  for January delivery
advanced 0.1 percent to 4,781.5 at 10:25 a.m. in Singapore. The
futures are derived from the underlying S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index,
which climbed 2.8 percent to 4,765.30 yesterday. The BSE India
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, added 2.7 percent to 15,939.36. Both
gauges jumped the most yesterday since Dec. 21.  A U.S. factory index from the Institute for Supply
Management climbed to 53.9 last month from 52.7 in November,
data from the group showed yesterday. The figures added to
reports showing stronger manufacturing in India, China, the U.K.
and  Australia . India’s manufacturing industry grew the most in
six months, a Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics showed on Jan. 2.  “The Indian economy has tremendous resilience,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of brokerage  India Infoline Ltd. (IIFL) , said in a
Bloomberg UTV interview yesterday. “The stock market runs ahead
of the macro fundamentals.”  HSBC and Markit Economics are due to release their
purchasing managers’ index for the services industries today.
Their purchasing managers gauge for manufacturing rose to 54.2
from 51 in November, according to a Jan. 2 statement.  Gas Discoveries  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  may be active today after people
with knowledge of the matter said the company and partner BP Plc
won government approval to spend $1.5 billion to develop gas
discoveries. Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corp., India’s second-
biggest state refiner, may move as the company is offering to
sell 11,000 metric tons of naphtha for loading in January,
according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News.  The Sensex slumped 25 percent in 2011, the most since 2008,
on concern a slumping rupee and record interest-rate increases
will worsen the effects of  Europe ’s debt crisis on earnings. The
gauge trades at 13.9 times estimated earnings, down from 19.4
times at the end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
valued at 9.6 times.  India’s stock market had joined the “cheapest 4 club”
based on price-to-book and return-on-equity after  China , Korea,
 Hong Kong , Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Sakthi Siva
wrote in a report from the brokerage today. The analysts were
reviewing their “underweight” rating on Indian equities, they
said in the report.  Overseas investors sold $512 million from equities in 2011,
on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe’s debt crisis may
erode company profits, data from the  Securities & Exchange Board
of India  show. That compares with a record inflow of $29.4
billion in 2010. Foreign funds sold a net  391 million rupees (FIINNET$) 
($7.4 million) of Indian stocks on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
