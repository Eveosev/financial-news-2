Manhattan apartment sales fell 12
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier as  Europe ’s
debt crisis and sluggish U.S. job growth dimmed buyer appetites.  Purchases of condominiums and co-ops declined to 2,011 from
2,295 in the fourth quarter of 2010, New York appraiser  Miller
Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate 
said in a joint report today. The median price of units that
changed hands in the final three months of 2011 climbed 1.2
percent from a year earlier, to $855,000.  “Consumers paused to see how things play out with all the
information that’s coming at them right now,”  Jonathan Miller ,
president of Miller Samuel, said in an interview. “Europe, the
impasse in  Washington  over economic policy, the stagnant nature
of the economy -- there’s a lot of conflicting economic news,
and if you’re on the fence, maybe you wait a little bit.”  Financial firms globally disclosed plans in 2011 to
eliminate more than 200,000 jobs as they grapple with market
turmoil, fallout from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and
concerns that U.S. economic growth will slow. Morgan Stanley
told regulators last week that it may dismiss 580 employees in
 New York City  as the bank cuts 1,600 jobs.  New York City’s unemployment rate was 8.9 percent in
November, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous month and
higher than the national average of 8.6 percent, the state
Department of Labor said Dec. 15.  StreetEasy Report  “Job security is No. 1,” said Sofia Song, vice president
of research at  StreetEasy.com , a property-listings and data
website that also issued a report on Manhattan apartment sales
today.  Purchases of condos and co-ops in the borough fell 19
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to 2,403,
according to  StreetEasy . The median price dropped 9.1 percent to
$750,000.  “It’s just really reflective of the economic climate,”
Song said in an interview. “The economy is really volatile and
people were just paralyzed to enter the market.”  Three other reports also showed declines in sales volume
and median price for the three months ended Dec. 31.  Brown Harris Stevens  and  Halstead Property LLC  said
completed condo and co-op purchases fell 13 percent from a year
earlier. The median price slipped 6.5 percent to $785,000,
according to the brokerage firms.  2010 Rush  In the fourth quarter of 2010, sellers were in a rush to
complete deals amid concern that capital-gains taxes for top
earners would rise on Jan. 1, according to Hall Willkie,
president of Brown Harris Stevens.  It “was our greatest year in history” in 2010, Willkie
said in an interview. The risk of a tax increase “was very much
a factor that did not exist in 2011,” he said.  Corcoran Group  said sales tumbled 12 percent from the
fourth quarter of 2010, and the median price dropped 5 percent
to $795,000.  Purchases of luxury apartments, defined as the top 10
percent of all sales by price, declined 13 percent to 201 deals,
according to  Miller Samuel  and Prudential. The median price of
those transactions dropped 4.6 percent to $4.15 million.  On the Upper East Side, the median price of existing co-ops
climbed 4 percent from a year earlier to $840,000, according to
Corcoran. Condo prices in the neighborhood were little changed
at $940,000. On the Upper West Side, the median price of co-op
resales fell 1 percent to $825,000, while existing condo prices
dropped 5 percent to $1.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
