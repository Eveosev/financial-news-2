Joe Torre resigned as  Major League
Baseball ’s Executive Vice President for Baseball Operations to
join a group seeking to buy the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  Torre, who was the Dodgers manager from 2008-2010 after
leading the New York Yankees from 1996-2007, has aligned with
 Los Angeles  real estate developer Rick Caruso.  “I have great confidence in Rick Caruso’s unique
qualifications and his ability to lead a successful bid for the
Los Angeles Dodgers,” Torre said in a statement. “In Rick I
found a partner who understands consumers and fully appreciates
that the Dodgers are a treasured LA institution.”  Caruso, 52, has thrived in retail. The Grove, his town
square-like shopping center in Los Angeles, attracts 17 million
shoppers a year and had few vacancies through the recession, he
said in a 2010 interview.  He is developing a $550 million shopping and dining complex
on the  Las Vegas Strip  for Caesars Entertainment Inc. between
the Flamingo and Imperial Palace hotel casinos.  “Rick is very hands on, very creative and he runs the
premier shopping center in one of the largest markets in
America,” said Mickey Drexler, chief executive at J Crew Group
Inc., which has a store at The Grove. “I think he’d make
visiting Dodger Stadium a compelling experience.”  The Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June, and
clashed with Baseball over whether it should be allowed to sell
its future television rights. In November, MLB and the team
struck a deal in which owner  Frank McCourt  would sell the team
and Baseball would let the Dodgers try to sell the television
rights early.  Forbes Valuation  The club, in the nation’s second-biggest television market,
is valued at $800 million by Forbes magazine, third-highest in
the sport after the  New York Yankees  and  Boston Red Sox . The
record price for a baseball franchise is $845 million paid for
the  Chicago Cubs  in 2009.  “Joe has a proven track record of fielding winning teams
and I am looking forward to our group benefiting from his unique
experience,” Caruso said in a statement.  Other bidders include billionaire hedge-fund manager Steve
Cohen of SAC Capital Advisors LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ; Mark
Walter, chief executive of Guggenheim Partners LLC in  New York
City , who has former Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson, a
basketball Hall of Famer, among his partners; and Dallas
Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban .  The deadline for opening bids was delayed 10 days to Jan.
23, partly because of “substantial potential bidder interest,”
Lyndsey Estin, a spokeswoman for the team, said in an e-mail.  Dodgers Debt  The Dodgers owe about $754 million, according to bankruptcy
court records filed last month. That includes $110 million the
team borrowed from MLB to operate in bankruptcy and $409.9
million in long-term debt owed by LA HoldCo LLC. LA HoldCo lost
$35.9 million for the six months ending Nov. 30 on revenue of
$149.8 million, according to court records.  Torre, 71, would bring his experience as a player, manager
and MLB executive to the group.  With the Yankees, Torre won World Series titles in 1996,
1998, 1999 and 2000. A former player and manager with the  New
York Mets , Torre left the Yankees after rejecting a one-year, $5
million contract offer, which he called insulting.  Playing Career  Torre played parts of 18 major-league seasons for the
Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves,  St. Louis Cardinals  and New York Mets.
A catcher, first baseman and third baseman, he was a career .297
hitter, with 252 home runs and 1,185 runs batted in, and was
named the National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1971, when
he batted .363 and drove in 137 runs for the Cardinals.  He began his managerial career as player/manager for the
Mets in 1977. He also had stints with the Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals before becoming manager of the Yankees in 1996. The
team never failed to reach the playoffs with Torre at the helm.
He also took the Dodgers to the postseason in 2008 and 2009.  Torre has a 2,326-1,997 career record as a manager,
trailing  Connie Mack  (3,731 wins), John McGraw (2,763), Tony La Russa (2,638) and Bobby Cox (2,504) in career wins.  Torre took the executive vice president job with MLB in
February, where he oversaw on-field operations, on-field
discipline and umpiring.  The baseball operations functions will now be led on an
interim basis by senior vice presidents Joe Garagiola Jr., Kim Ng and Peter Woodfork. Torre appointed Garagiola, Ng and
Woodfork to their positions in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
