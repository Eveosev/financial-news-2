Hungary  won’t default and the country
will continue to fully service its debt, Janos Lazar, head of
the ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group, told news website
 fn24.hu .  Lazar added that assuming Hungary might default was
“absurd,” the news site reported.  The European Union and the  International Monetary Fund 
suspended aid talks with Hungary last month, citing legislation
that may curb the independence of the central bank. The EU has
no plans at the moment to resume talks, European Commission
spokesman Olivier Bailly said yesterday.  Lazar also told the news service he was confident Hungary
will reach an agreement with the EU on all disputed issues, even
if “some blows may be exchanged in the meanwhile.”  The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban will reach
the half way of its four-year mandate in July and a cabinet
reshuffle may take place, Lazar told fn24.hu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
