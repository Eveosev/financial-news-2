Bravo Brio Restaurant Group Inc. (BBRG) , a
90-store Italian eatery chain, said it hasn’t discussed a
potential acquisition with  Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) , owner of
Olive Garden and Red Lobster.  “There has been no dialogue with Darden about an
acquisition,” Ashley Swenson, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail today. Bravo Brio is “very confident that we can
continue to grow as a public company,” she said.  Stephen Anderson, an analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in New
York, last week said that Columbus, Ohio-based Bravo Brio may be
a “good strategic opportunity for an acquisition” and named
Darden as a possible suitor.  Bravo Brio  rose (BBRG)  0.6 percent to $16.65 at 1:34 p.m. in  New
York . The shares declined 11 percent last year. Darden advanced
0.3 percent to $44.76 and fell 1.9 percent last year.  Rich Jeffers, a spokesman for Orlando, Florida-based
Darden, declined to comment in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
