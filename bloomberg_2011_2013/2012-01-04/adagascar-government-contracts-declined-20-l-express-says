Madagascar’s government contracts
declined 20 percent from a year earlier in 2011 to 356.5 billion
ariary ($160 million),  l’Express de Madagascar  reported on its
website today, citing data from the procurement authority.  The drop is attributed to austerity measures by the
government and lack of budgetary assistance, the Antananarivo-
based newspaper said, citing unidentified economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
