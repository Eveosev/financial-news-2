Egypt  plans to sell 12 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2 billion) in treasury bills and bonds in the
next week after revising its budget deficit target for the third
time since the fiscal year started July 1.  The North African country will offer 11 billion pounds in
three-, six-, nine- and 12-month notes and 1 billion pounds in
seven-year bonds, according to the debt-issuance calendar on the
 Finance Ministry ’s  website . The yield on  one-year securities (EGTBY12) 
rose at the last 10 auctions to a record 15.399 percent at the
last sale on Dec. 29.  Egypt’s local borrowing costs soared and its dollar bonds
have slumped as the country’s interim governments failed to set
clear economic policies following the ouster of former President
 Hosni Mubarak  almost a year ago. Finance Minister Mumtaz el-
Saeed said yesterday the government is sticking to the 8.6
percent budget deficit target it set in June, down from the 10
percent goal announced by the  Minister of Planning, Fayza
Aboulnaga, on Dec. 15.  Minister of Trade and Industry Mahmoud Eissa told  Germany ’s
Handelsblatt Egypt is considering asking for aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  as “an option,” and will shortly
begin a series of “road shows” abroad to attract foreign
investment. His comments came after Aboulnaga said this week the
government has asked the IMF to postpone “by a few weeks”
talks on a $3.2 billion loan originally planned for this week.
Egypt had turned down a similar loan package from the agency
last June.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 rose for a fourth day, gaining two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.05 percent at 1:02 p.m. in Cairo.
The rate was at 8.07 basis points on Dec. 23, the highest since
the notes were issued.  The pound (EGP)  was little changed at 6.0329 a
dollar.  The cost of protecting Egyptian government debt against
default for five years fell two basis points to 640, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles data from
the privately negotiated market.  Egypt’s credit default swaps rate is the highest in the
 Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
