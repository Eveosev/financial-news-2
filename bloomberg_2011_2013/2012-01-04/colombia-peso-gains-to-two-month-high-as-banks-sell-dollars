Colombia ’s peso rose to a two-month
high as local banks reduced dollar holdings and on speculation
increased foreign investment into the South American country
will boost gains in the currency.  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 1,899.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:47 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,906.97 yesterday. Earlier it touched
1,898.90, its strongest level since Nov. 3. The peso has jumped
2.1 percent so far this year.  At the end of 2011, banks in Colombia increased the amount
of dollars they hold after the central bank’s daily dollar
purchases in 2010 depleted cash holdings of the U.S. currency,
pushing the peso to plunge to a seven-month low.  “With the start of the new year banks noticed they are
holding more dollars than they need,” said Juan Nicolas Garcia,
a currency trader at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Colombia unit. Foreign
direct investment “remains very strong, and so the peso will
continue with its strengthening trend.”  Foreign direct investment probably rose to a record $13
billion in 2011, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said last month.  While 1,900 is a “difficult level to break,” the peso
will likely strengthen to 1,880 this month, Garcia said.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.56 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.114
centavo to 119.235 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
