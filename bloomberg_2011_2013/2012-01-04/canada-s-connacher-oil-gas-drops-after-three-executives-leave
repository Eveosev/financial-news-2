Connacher Oil & Gas Ltd. (CLL)  fell 24
percent after three top executives stepped down amid pressure to
sell the oil and gas producer.  Connacher declined as much as 21 Canadian cents to 68
cents, the most since Dec. 13. The shares were down 17 percent
at 11:34 a.m. in Toronto.  The company’s President and Chief Operating Officer Peter Sametz, Chief Financial Officer Richard Kines and Vice President
of Corporate Development Grant Ukrainetz have left the Calgary-
based company, according to a statement. Connacher also said it
will suspend its effort to find a joint venture partner for its
Great Divide oil sands project.  Connacher has received calls from shareholders Audley
Capital Advisors LLP and West Face Capital Inc. to put itself up
for sale or review strategic alternatives after its  stock (CLL)  lost
more than three-quarters of its value over the past five years.
The company rejected an “unsolicited, non-binding and
conditional” offer last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
