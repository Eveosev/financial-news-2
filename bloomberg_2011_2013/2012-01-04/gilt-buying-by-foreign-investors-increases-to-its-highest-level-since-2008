Overseas investors boosted their U.K.
government bond holdings by the most in more than three years in
November as they sought refuge from the euro area’s sovereign
debt crisis.  Net purchases climbed to 16.3 billion pounds ($25.5
billion), the biggest monthly increase in holdings since
September 2008, according to Bank of England figures published
today. That compares with net buying of 12.5 billion pounds the
previous month, the data showed.  Gilts returned 17 percent last year, including reinvested
interest, the most among 26 government markets tracked by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies, as Prime Minister  David Cameron  cut  government
spending  and the Bank of England resumed its debt-buying
program. Investec Asset Management Ltd. is among investors
predicting more outperformance by U.K. government bonds.  “The debt problem in the euro area and other drivers for
safe-asset demand haven’t gone away,” said  John Wraith , a
fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
London. “We are confident these factors will re-emerge and that
will support demand for gilts and other top quality government
bonds.”  Gilts beat German debt, considered the euro area’s safest
securities, by more than 7 percentage points last year, the most
since 1998, the Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes show. U.S. Treasuries
made about 10 percent.  Non-Resident Holdings  Non-resident investors bought more AAA rated  gilts (GUKG10)  than
they sold for a third consecutive month, the  Bank of England 
data showed.  Foreign investors held 323.45 billion pounds of gilts as of
June 30 last year, according to data from the Debt Management
Office, which sells gilts on behalf of the British government.
That’s around 30 percent of total gilts outstanding.  The yield on the  10-year gilt (GUKG10)  rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.05 percent as of 4:38 p.m. London
time. It reached a record low 1.93 percent on Dec. 30. The two-
year note yield increased four basis points to 0.40 percent,
after falling to an all-time low of 0.271 percent on Dec. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
