Serena Williams  withdrew from the
Brisbane International tennis tournament, a tuneup for this
month’s Australian Open, with an ankle injury.  Williams, who was playing in her first competition since
losing the U.S. Open final in September, twisted her ankle in
a 6-2, 6-4 win over  Serbia ’s Bojana Jovanovski.  An MRI scan showed she had “a left ankle sprain that I
probably shouldn’t play on,” Williams said in a statement e-
mailed today by tournament organizers.  The Australian Open, where Williams has won five of her 13
Grand Slam singles titles, starts Jan. 16 in  Melbourne . Williams
missed the 2011 edition while she was recovering from two
operations on her feet after she said she walked through glass.
She received treatment for blood clots in her lungs in February
and didn’t return to the women’s tour until the grass-court
season in June.  “I’m still hopeful of playing the Australian Open,”
Williams said. “I’m going to take a couple of days off - not
too many - and see how I feel.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
