British American Investment Co. (BRIT) , a
diversified financial services group, fell the most in more than
three months on concern its earnings will suffer from a plunge
in the Kenyan stock market last year.  Shares in the company, which was listed on Sept. 9, 2011,
slumped as much as 9.9 percent to 5 shillings and closed down
8.1 percent, the most since Sept. 15, at 5.1 shillings as of 3
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The maximum daily limit on a
stock’s move is 10 percent.  “In 2011 the earnings per share will be down by about 50
percent,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based
Apex  Africa  Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “Everyone in the
market has factored in the risk that these guys have a huge
exposure to the  capital markets ; that is why the market has
assigned a discount to the stock.”  The Kenyan stock market, the second-worst performer in
Africa after Egypt, plunged  30 percent (NSEASI)  in 2011 as drought drove
inflation, hurting  consumer spending  and corporate profits in
east Africa’s biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
