A  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
flight to Shanghai landed in Canada and then returned to New
York’s Newark airport because of a toilet fault.  The plane spent a couple of hours on the ground before
turning back, said Naoko Munakata, a Tokyo-based employee at
Hill & Knowlton, the PR agency that represents United in Japan.
The service will take off again from Newark at 5:30 a.m. today,
she said by e-mail.  The flight left Newark at 11:06 a.m. yesterday before
diverting to Goose Bay Airport, according to information on
United’s Website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
