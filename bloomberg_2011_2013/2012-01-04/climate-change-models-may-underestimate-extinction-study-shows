Climate change  projections may
“grossly” underestimate the extinction of animal and plant
varieties because the models don’t account for species movement
and competition, U.S. researchers said.  Animals and plants that can adjust to climate change have a
competitive advantage, while animals with small geographic
ranges and specific habitat requirements are likely to go
extinct under climate change, according to a study led by Mark
Urban, an assistant professor at the University of  Connecticut .  Species are already moving in response to climate change,
with some animals and plants migrating to higher altitudes, the
university wrote in an  online statement . Urban, with University
of  Washington ’s Josh Tewksbury and Kimberly Sheldon, created a
mathematical model to include varying rates of species migration
and different rates of inter-species competition.  “In real life, animals move around, they compete, they
parasitize each other and eat each other,” Urban was cited as
saying in the statement. “The majority of our predictions don’t
include these important interactions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
