Loan prices of  Yell Group Plc (YELL) , the
publisher of the U.K.’s yellow pages, and  Seat Pagine Gialle
SpA (PG) ,  Italy ’s biggest phone-directory publisher, fell today after
downgrades to the companies’ credit ratings.  Yell’s senior term loan tranches A and B fell 1 percentage
point to a mid price of 46.5 percent and 46 percent of face
value respectively, according to data from Mizuho Financial
Group UFJ Ltd., after Moody’s Investors Service cut the
company’s rating one level to Caa1 from B3 citing an “increased
likelihood of covenant breach within the next 12 months.”  Shares in the Reading, U.K.-based company have dropped 52
percent this year after its full-year revenue fell 12.4 percent
to 1.88 billion pounds ($3.1 billion), as its printed directory
business declines as customers switch to digital media.  Moody’s also downgraded Seat Pagine’s corporate family
rating two levels to Caa3 from Caa1, citing the May 10
appointment of financial advisors to help it stabilize its debt.
The Turin-based company’s loans fell 75 basis points to 92.25
percent of face value, according to Mizuho prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
