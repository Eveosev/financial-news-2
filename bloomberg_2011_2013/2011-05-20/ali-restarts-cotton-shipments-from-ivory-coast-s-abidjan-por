Mali , Africa’s second-biggest cotton
exporter, resumed shipments of the fiber from neighboring  Ivory
Coast  after a civil war halted most operations at that country’s
two main ports.  The land-locked West African nation sent 20,000 metric tons
of cotton by road to the port of Abidjan, the commercial
capital, said Moumouni Guindo, the managing director of Malian
warehouses in Ivory Coast, by phone yesterday.  Mali was forced to redirect its cotton shipments to ports
in Ghana and Togo as a four-month political crisis following a
disputed November presidential election triggered a trade
blockade of Ivory Coast’s ports at Abidjan and San Pedro.  Production during the 2011-12 harvest is projected at
125,190 tons, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
July-delivery cotton rose 0.1 percent to $1.5585 per pound by
12:36 p.m. in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
