Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
third day after data showing the U.S. labor market is improving
boosted confidence in the global economic recovery and increased
demand for emerging-market assets. Benchmark bonds rose.  The currency completed its second weekly gain after initial
jobless claims in the world’s largest economy fell to the lowest

yesterday. Offshore funds increased holdings of Indonesian
government debt by 1.8 percent to 225.42 trillion rupiah ($26.4
billion) this month through May 18.  “Data from the U.S. last night improved sentiment about
the global economic recovery,” said Joanna Tan, a Singapore-

the rupiah is strengthening, in line with the regional trend.”  The rupiah advanced 0.2 percent to 8,536 per dollar as of
4:14 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

currency has strengthened 0.2 percent this week.  There were 409,000 jobless claims in the U.S. in the week
ended May 14, compared with 434,000 in the previous week. That
was less than the 420,000 median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year  government bonds  gained. The yield on the 8.25
percent note slipped six basis points to 7.38 percent, according
to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The
