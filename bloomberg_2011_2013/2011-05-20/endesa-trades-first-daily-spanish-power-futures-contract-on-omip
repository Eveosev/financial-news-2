Endesa SA (ELE)  was the first company to
trade a daily power futures contract on Omip, the Lisbon-based
derivatives exchange of the Iberian electricity market, which
began to offer the contract together with weekend power today.  Endesaâ€™s Generacion unit and Energya VM traded 25 megawatts
of Spanish power in a futures contract based on delivery on May
23 at a price of 51 euros ($72.67) a megawatt-hour, Omip said
today in an e-mailed statement. Omip offers both daily baseload
and daily peakload contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
