Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the mining
company controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, hired banks to
manage a $1.5 billion bond to refinance loans used to pay for
its proposed purchase of oil explorer  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)   Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  are
managing the bond, which will be marketed to investors in
meetings beginning May 23, the London-based company said today
in a statement. The bond will replace a short-term bridge loan.  Vedanta is seeking to take over Cairn  India  to gain access
to the nation’s largest onshore oilfield. The London-based
company is still waiting for Indian regulators to approve the
acquisition of its 58.5 percent stake in  Cairn India .  Vedanta plans to raise $6 billion to fund the bid, with
$3.5 billion from bank loans, $1.5 billion from a bond sale
and $1 billion from equities, Chief Financial Officer Din Dayal Jalan said May 5.  The bonds are expected to be rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors
Service upon completion of the purchase and BB by Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
