Sasini Ltd. (STCL) ’s half-year earnings will
be boosted by lower financing costs after it paid off a 600
million-shilling ($7 million) bond with a cheaper  bank loan ,
 Business Daily  reported today.  The company, which grows tea and coffee, obtained the loan
in February to pay off the five-year redeemable bond issued in
2007 that was set to mature next year, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Samuel Odalo, Sasini’s group financial
officer. The company will release results on May 27, it
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
