Corn rose in  Chicago , heading for the
biggest weekly gain in more than seven months, on speculation
declines in the past two weeks may have increased demand from
importers. Wheat and soybeans climbed.  Export sales of corn from the U.S., the world’s largest
producer and shipper, more than doubled to 1.15 million metric
tons in the week to May 12 from the previous week, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Wet weather that’s
delaying corn seeding in the U.S. also may be boosting prices.  “It was the strongest weekly sales result since late March
and signals that significant pent-up demand was uncovered as
corn prices slumped in early May,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said in a report
e-mailed today.  Corn for July delivery gained 8.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $7.565 a bushel by 11:15 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Prices are up 11 percent this week, on course
for the biggest advance since the week ended Oct. 8. The grain
slid 9.8 percent in the two weeks ended May 13 and more than
doubled in the past year.  About 63 percent of U.S. corn was planted as of May 15,
down from 87 percent a year earlier and a five-year average of
75 percent, the USDA said this week. The crop was 21 percent
emerged from the ground, compared with 53 percent a year ago and
39 percent on average for the past five years, it said in a May
16 report.  Wheat Advances  Wheat for July delivery climbed 2.5 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $8.145 a bushel. The grain is up 12 percent this week, on
course for the largest climb since the week ended Dec. 3, and
surged 73 percent in the past year.  Prices jumped this week on concern worsening crop
conditions in  Europe , which accounts for about a fifth of global
output, and the U.S. may slash world supply. Forecasters
predicted May 18 the crop in  France , the largest European Union
wheat grower, will drop 12 percent on dry weather as second-
ranking  Germany ’s harvest slides 7.2 percent.  As of May 15, U.S. winter wheat was in the worst condition
since 1996, with 44 percent of fields rated poor or very poor by
the USDA. The  National Weather Service  estimates rainfall in the
past two months was less than half of normal in much of Texas,
Oklahoma and  Kansas .  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 1.75 euros, or 0.7 percent, to 242.25 euros ($345.73)
a ton.  Soybeans for July delivery increased 6.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.8575 a bushel in Chicago, taking the weekly gain
to 4.2 percent. The oilseed climbed 47 percent in the past year,
partly on rising demand from  China , the world’s largest
importer.  U.S. exporters sold 110,000 tons of soybeans to China for
delivery in the 2011-12 season that starts Sept. 1, the USDA
said yesterday. Before that transaction, export sales of
soybeans advanced to 166,232 tons in the week to May 12 from
62,245 tons a week earlier, it said separately.  To contact the reporters on this story:
