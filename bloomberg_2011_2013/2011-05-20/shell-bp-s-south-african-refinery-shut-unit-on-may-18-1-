Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Sapref refinery in South Africa, the country’s biggest, said it
halted a unit on May 18 which remains shut for inspection.  “The rest of the refinery is operating as normal,”
Durban-based Sapref said today in an e-mailed response to a
query. It may restart the so-called CD2 unit “within a short
duration,” Sapref said, without being more specific.  The refinery has a capacity to process about 180,000
barrels a day, making it the largest crude plant in Southern
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It accounts for
35 percent of the country’s refining capacity.  Sapref declined to comment on any effect on output,
referring queries to its shareholders.  Shell wasn’t aware of any issues at the refinery when
Bloomberg News spoke to Kim Blomley, a London-based spokesman,
this morning. BP didn’t return a call to its office in  London 
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
