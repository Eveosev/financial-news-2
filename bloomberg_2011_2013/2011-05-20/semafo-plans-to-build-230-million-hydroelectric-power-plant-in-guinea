Semafo Inc. (SMF) , a Canadian gold producer
that mines in West Africa, plans to build a hydroelectric power
plant in Guinea, said Mody Oury Barry, head of the project.  The $230 million, 130-megawatt plant will be constructed on
the Cogon river, which is in the bauxite-rich region of Boke,
Barry said in an interview in Conakry, the capital, yesterday.  “Guinea has hydroelectric potential which is not
exploited,” he said. “If the country wants to develop this
potential, it has to be supported by the private sector.”  The energy project will be separate from Semafo’s Kiniero
gold mine, which is located about 650 kilometers (404 miles)
east of Conakry. The electricity will be used by the Compagnie
des Bauxites de Guinee, a miner of the ore used in aluminum
jointly owned by the  Guinea  government and Halco Mining, as well
as a partner in the project, Barry said. Power will also be
supplied to local villages and other miners in the area.  The  World Bank ’s lending arm, the  International Finance
Corp.  and Electricite de Guinee, the state-owned utility, will
also fund the power plant, he said.  Production will start at the end of 2012, with completion
three years later, he said.  Saint-Laurent, Quebec-based Semafo also mines for gold in
 Burkina Faso  and Niger. Its shares closed 1.6 percent higher at
C$7.73 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
