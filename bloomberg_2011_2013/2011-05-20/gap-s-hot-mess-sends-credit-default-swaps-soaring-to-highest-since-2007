Credit-default swaps on  Gap Inc. (GPS) 
jumped to the highest level since July 2007 after the largest
U.S. apparel chain cut its full-year profit forecast.  The cost to insure against a default on the San Francisco-
based retailer’s debt rose 8.1 basis points to 192.5 basis
points, according to CMA, the data provider owned by CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market. The swaps have gained 31 basis points since 11:30 a.m.
yesterday, before Gap announced earnings.  The company, which issued bonds last month for the first
time since June 2002, yesterday lowered its 2011 profit forecast
to as much as $1.50 a share, 22 percent below its previous
prediction. The lower forecast has “serious implications” for
free  cash flow , a measure of performance watched by bond buyers,
according to Carol Levenson, a Chicago-based analyst for Gimme
Credit LLC.  “It’s a hot mess and underscores our ‘deteriorating’
credit score and belief that bonds will underperform,” Levenson
wrote in a note.  Gap’s $1.25 billion of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021
fell 0.1 cent to 98.4 cents on the dollar at 12:35 p.m. to yield
6.17 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt,
which was sold to finance stock buybacks, is down from 100.5
cents on May 17. The chain’s stock sank 17 percent to $19.30 as
of 12:51 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its
worst slide in at least nine years.  Louise Callagy, a Gap spokeswoman, didn’t return a phone
message and an e-mail seeking comment.  More Leverage  “Our confidence has grown that we need not be as
conservative as we were,” Sabrina Simmons, Gap’s chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview last month on
the day of the bond sale. “We don’t need any more cash to
invest in our business. This is an opportunity to bring some
leverage onto our balance sheet.”  Default swaps on Gap rose to the highest level since July
30, 2007, when it cost 195 basis points to insure the retailer’s
debt, or $195,000 annually on a $10 million contract. Moody’s
Investors Service rates Gap Baa3, one step above junk, while
 Standard & Poor’s  grades the company a notch lower at BB+.  The cost of protecting U.S. investment-grade company bonds
from default climbed after two days of declines as the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index halted a two-day advance and erased what
would have been its first weekly gain of the month.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 1.1 basis points to a
mid-price of 89.7 basis points as of 12:59 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Swaps Rise  Default swaps rose as the  S&P 500  fell 0.4 percent to
1,338.14. The index closed last week at 1,337.77. The credit
swaps index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, has gained from 87.8
basis points on April 29.  The price of Markit’s CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, declined 0.2
percentage point to 102.4 percent of face value.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
