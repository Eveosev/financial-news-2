Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day against the dollar as the central bank sought to
remove supply for the eighth trading session.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.5 percent to 85.69 per dollar and was trading 0.3
percent stronger at 85.88 by 3:57 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.
The shilling has depreciated 0.1 percent this week, a third of
declines, taking its drop this year to 6 percent. It’s the
second-worst performer among African currencies against the
dollar this year after  Sudan ’s pound, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya has sold 7.2 billion shillings
($84 million) of  repurchase agreements  since May 11, including
625 million shillings today at 5.73 percent, it said in an e-
mailed statement. It had offered 1.5 billion shillings to
traders. In a repurchase agreement, an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  “The shilling has gained against the dollar as the central
bank seeks to limit supply by mopping up excess liquidity
created by its recent actions of building its reserves,” Steve
Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  Since May 10, the central bank has bought 28 million euros
($40 million) “for reserve build-up and to cover government
external payments amounting to $9.1 million made in the week,”
the Nairobi-based central bank said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
