OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel
shareholders voted in favor of Boris Dubrovsky as chief
executive officer at an annual meeting today in Magnitogorsk,
the Urals region.  Billionaire Victor Rashnikov, 63, Magnitogorskâ€™s biggest
shareholder was re-elected chairman of the board and remains
head of MMK Management Co., which previously performed the
function of CEO at the steelmaker, the company said in a
statement.  Dubrovsky, 53, was formerly the deputy head of
Uralvagonzavod, a producer of tanks and railcars. Before 2008,
he was an executive at Magnitogorsk.  Rashnikov said he will remain in charge of strategic
development and investments, while Dubrovsky will be in charge
of operational issues, Interfax reported from Magnitogorsk.
Speculation about a possible sale of Magnitogorsk is baseless,
the news service said, citing Rashnikov.  Dubrovsky will in essence serve as chief operational
officer, with Rashnikov continuing to decide on strategy and
financial issues, Dmitry Smolin, a metals analyst of UralSib
Financial Corp. said by phone today.  Shareholders also approved a 2010 dividend of 33 kopeks a
share, with a total payout of 3.7 billion rubles ($132 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
