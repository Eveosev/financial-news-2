Carbon permits dropped for the third
consecutive week as the European Union prepared early sales of
allowances for the next phase of the market which starts in
2013, giving confidence that supply was on the way.  Carbon permits for December dropped 1.9 percent this week
to 16.41 euros ($23.25) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange at 5 p.m. local time. That’s the lowest since March 11.  The bloc, preparing to start sales for the phase that runs
through 2020, wants to raise money for emission-cutting projects
and meet demand from utilities, which sell electricity two-or-
three years ahead.  A plan by regulators to allow sales of 2013 allowances
before the completion of a EU registry for tracking transactions
means new supply will probably arrive in a “fairly timely
manner,”  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst with  Barclays Capital  in
 London , said today by phone.  The premium of 2013 carbon permits over 2012 narrowed to
its lowest level in almost two months, shrinking 3.3 percent to
1.18 euros a ton on ICE.  Traders decided that 2013 and 2014 carbon allowances were
too expensive to hold based on the cost of money, Sikorski said.
Prior to this week’s decline in the premium, they could have
bought 2012 “and hung onto it and made money on the cost of
carry,” he said. The volume of December 2013 futures jumped to
a record 6.4 million tons on ICE yesterday.  2011 Volume  The EU may sell as few as 5 percent of its “early” phase-
three supply of carbon permits by the end of this year, Deutsche
Bank AG said. It may sell 20 million tons of allowances out of a
total of about 400 million tons expected through 2012, analysts
at the bank including  Mark Lewis  and Isabelle Curien in Paris,
said today in an e-mailed research note.  The second phase of the market runs for the five years
through 2012. The program began in 2005.  “The apparent risk of a volatile transition between phases
is now less,” said Matthew Cowie, an analyst for Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in London. “The market previously was concerned
the lack of a registry may have held back supply” for phase
three, he said today in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
