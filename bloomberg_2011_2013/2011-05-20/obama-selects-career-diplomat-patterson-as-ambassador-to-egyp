President  Barack Obama  said he will
nominate Anne W. Patterson, a career diplomat, to be the U.S.
ambassador to Egypt.  Patterson served as ambassador to Pakistan from July 2007
to October 2010, a White House statement said. She would replace
Margaret Scobey, who’s held the position in Egypt since March
2008. Scobey was picked for the post by President George W. Bush.  Obama yesterday proposed aid for Egypt, including $1
billion in loan guarantees through the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., to help stabilize the nation’s economy after
the rebellion that led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.  Patterson’s nomination requires confirmation by the  U.S.
Senate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
