European stocks retreated as shares
of carmakers declined and Greek 10-year bond yields rose to a
record.  Automakers performed the worst of 19 industries in the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Mitchells & Butlers Plc, the
owner of Harvester and Toby Carvery pubs and restaurants, sank
5.5 percent after posting reduced fiscal first-half profit. BP
Plc advanced 2.5 percent after the  oil company  reached a
settlement with a unit of Mitsui & Co., one of its partners on
the Macondo well.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.2 percent to 279.36 at 4:10 p.m. in
 London , heading for a weekly decline of 0.4 percent. The gauge
advanced 0.7 percent yesterday as companies from Glencore
International Plc to LinkedIn Corp. held initial public
offerings. The measure has fallen 4 percent since this yearâ€™s
high on Feb. 17.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
