Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and  Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY) ’s apixaban blood thinner won European Union approval to
prevent deadly clots after surgeries to replace hips or knees.  It’s the first approval for the drug, to be sold under the
name Eliquis, the companies said today in a statement. The
medicine may reach annual sales of $2.63 billion by 2015 if
broader indications are approved, according to the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  About 40 percent to 60 percent of people undergoing hip or
knee surgery are at risk of developing  blood clots , known as
venous thromboembolic events, if not treated preventively, the
New York-based companies said. The treatment is being studied in
60,000 patients to prevent and treat clots and strokes in a
variety of health disorders.  “The approval of Eliquis gives European orthopedic
surgeons a new option,” said Michael Rud Lassen, the lead
investigator for a late-stage trial of the drug. Apixaban “is
more effective than the current standard of care.”  There are about a half-dozen pills now in development to
replace the blood-thinners warfarin and aspirin as the standard
treatments to prevent blood clots in patients with the erratic
 heart rate  known as atrial fibrillation. Competing drugs include
Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa and  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Bayer
AG (BAYN) ’s Xarelto.  Boehringer’s drug was approved in the U.S. in October for
patients with an irregular heartbeat. Both drugs already are
sold in Europe to prevent clots after hip and knee surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
