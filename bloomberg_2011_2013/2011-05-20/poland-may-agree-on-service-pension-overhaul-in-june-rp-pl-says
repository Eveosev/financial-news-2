Poland may conclude talks on curbing
pension privileges for military personnel, police and
firefighters next month, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita said on
its rp.pl website, without saying where it got the information.  The government wants to toughen eligibility requirements
for service pensions, raising the minimum number of years worked
to 25 from 15 and the minimum age to 55 from 35, the newspaper
reported. The next round of talks on overhauling the system,
which now costs Poland 12 billion zloty ($4.4 billion) a year,
will start on June 8, rp.pl said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
