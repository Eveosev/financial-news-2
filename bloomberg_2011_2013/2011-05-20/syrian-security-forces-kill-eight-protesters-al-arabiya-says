Syrian security forces fired on anti-
government protesters, killing eight people in cities including
Homs, Daraa and al-Sanamin,  Al Arabiya  television said, citing
witnesses.  Forces used tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Daraa,
the television channel reported.  Crowds also took to the streets today in Al Ruston and
Talbiseh near Homs, as well as in Amouda, where the Kurdish
minority is demanding greater freedom, Arabiya said. The
government sent tanks to the city of Idlib to control the
protests.  The suppression of pro-democracy protests in Syria began in
mid-March after popular revolts ousted longtime leaders in Egypt
and  Tunisia . The uprising drew initial pledges of reform from
President Bashar al-Assad, who lifted an emergency law in place
since 1963 and named a new government. He hasnâ€™t repeated the
assurances in recent weeks as security forces stepped up their
assaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
