German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said that he holds French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  in high esteem, the first public hint of German support
for her possible appointment as the International Monetary Fund
leader.  Lagarde “is an internationally recognized personality and
is highly regarded also in Germany,” Westerwelle said in an
interview during a trip to Switzerland yesterday. “It’s
understandable that we Europeans have an interest in maintaining
the European influence at the IMF.”  Lagarde has emerged as the leading contender to replace
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn  as the IMF’s managing director. The
Frenchman resigned as head of the Washington-based fund this
week after his arrest in New York on sexual-assault charges.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday that
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is a reason to put another
European in charge. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, asked
today if Germany backed Lagarde for the post, said that “we’re
in favor of a European candidate, and therefore we’ll work
toward a European candidate.”  Westerwelle declined to endorse Lagarde outright. While
impressed with her qualifications, “we won’t take part in
speculation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
