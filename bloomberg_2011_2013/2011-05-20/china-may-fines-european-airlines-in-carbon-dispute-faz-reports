China  may impose penalties on
European airlines if the European Union carries out its plan to
impose carbon trading on carriers, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, citing comments by a Chinese official to
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s chief executive officer that were
confirmed by an unidentified spokesman for the German airline.  Li Jiaxiang, who heads China’s aviation regulator and is
also the nation’s deputy transport minister, told Lufthansa CEO
Christoph Franz about the plan in Beijing, the newspaper said.
China fears that its state-owned airlines may struggle to
compete on European routes if the EU’s carbon-trading plan
pushes up costs, the FAZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
