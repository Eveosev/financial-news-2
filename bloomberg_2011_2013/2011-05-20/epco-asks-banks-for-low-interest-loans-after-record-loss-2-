Tokyo Electric  Power Co., operator of
the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant, said it will seek
low-interest loans from Japanese private and state-run banks
after posting a record 1.25 trillion yen ($15 billion) loss.  “We would like banks to continue offering low  interest
rates  as much as possible,” outgoing President Masataka Shimizu
said at a briefing on the company’s earnings in  Tokyo  today.  Japan ’s government this month outlined a plan to shield
Tokyo Electric from bankruptcy as it faces a compensation bill
for the worst nuclear disaster in 25 years. A group of banks led
by  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  provided about 2
trillion yen of emergency loans to the utility after the temblor.  Banks have resisted government calls for lenders to
consider writing off loans already owed by the utility, whose
shares have plunged 83 percent since the March 11 disaster.  Bank
of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said today that it should be
up to banks and Tokyo Electric to decide any loan write-offs.  Tepco, as the company is known, said today that it bears
responsibility for compensation following the nuclear accident
that was triggered by a March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  “Accordingly, significant deterioration of Tepco’s
financial position raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern,” the utility wrote in its earnings
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
