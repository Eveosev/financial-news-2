Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has started a
fluid catalytic cracker at its St. Charles refinery in Norco,
Louisiana, after planned work, Bill Day, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Valero shut the 100,000-barrel-a-day millisecond catalytic
cracker in February to convert it to a traditional fluid
catalytic cracker.  “This will make the unit more reliable,” Day said in an
interview.  The refinery, 25 miles west of  New Orleans , can process
250,000 barrels of crude oil daily, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
