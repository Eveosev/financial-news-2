Fifty-one percent of new refinery
projects, representing 2.594 million barrels a day of capacity,
in  OAPEC  countries have been delayed because of declining
margins, according to the industry group.  Twenty-six percent, or 1.315 million barrels a day, of
scheduled new capacity has been canceled, Imad Makki, senior
refining expert at the  Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries , said today at the Global Refining Summit in
Rotterdam. Only 23 percent, or 1.2 million barrels a day is
under construction, he said.  The figures, compiled by OAPEC’s research department, are
as of January this year, Makki said.  Delays are also being caused by lower demand during the
economic slowdown and fluctuating material costs, he said.  In  Saudi Arabia , the Yanbu and Jubail refinery projects are
under construction, he said. The plants each have a planned
processing capacity of 400,000 barrels a day.  OAPEC’s 11 members comprise Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait,
 Libya , Syria,  United Arab Emirates , Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and Tunisia, according to the group’s website. Seven of
them also belong to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
