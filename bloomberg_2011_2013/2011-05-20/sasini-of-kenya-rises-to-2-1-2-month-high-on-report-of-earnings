Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
producer, climbed to a 2 1/2-month high after  Business Daily 
reported the company’s half-year earnings will be boosted by
lower financing costs.  The stock gained 0.55 shilling, or 5.3 percent, to 10.90
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
highest level since March 1.  Sasini obtained a cheaper bank loan in February to pay off
a 600 million-shilling ($7 million) redeemable bond issued in
2007 that was set to mature next year, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Samuel Odalo, Sasini’s group financial
officer. The company’s first half ended March 31 and it will
report earnings on May 27, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
