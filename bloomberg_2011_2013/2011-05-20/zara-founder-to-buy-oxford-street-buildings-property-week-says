Amancio Ortega, Spain’s richest man,
is in talks to buy Jubilee House on London’s Oxford Street from
Cosgrave Property Group for about 165 million pounds ($268
million),  Property Week  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Ortega, the founder of the  Inditex SA (ITX)  clothing empire that
includes the Zara chain, has already purchased 215-219 Oxford
Street, a building next to Jubilee House, from Cosgrave for 55.1
million pounds, Property Week said. The tenants include Zara,
River Island, New Look, Christie’s International Plc and Hays
Plc, Property Week said.  Cushman & Wakefield  is advising Ortega on the transactions
and  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)  is acting for Cosgrave,
according to Property Week.  A spokeswoman for Cushman & Wakefield declined to comment
on the report. Spokesmen for CB Richard Ellis, Pontegadea
Inmobiliaria, the real estate investment unit of Ortega, and
Cosgrave, weren’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
