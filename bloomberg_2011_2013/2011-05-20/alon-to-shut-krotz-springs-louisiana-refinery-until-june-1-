Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  will shut its
refinery near Krotz Springs, Louisiana, until June because of
supply disruptions caused by rising water levels.  Alon plans to conduct maintenance during the shutdown that
was originally scheduled for the third quarter, the company said
in a statement. That will minimize the effect on annual crude
runs, Alon said.  Crude deliveries and refinery operations are expected to
resume in June, the company said. Alon said it has built an
additional levee to fully protect the refinery during flooding
after the Morganza spillway was opened May 14 to divert water
into the Atchafalaya River from the swollen Mississippi River.  The plant, located along the Atchafalaya about 60 miles
south of its confluence with the  Mississippi , is within a zone
that officials ordered evacuated May 15. St. Landry Parish
officials had granted the refinery permission to remain open.  Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned May 11 that the
Krotz Springs refinery would be shut if the Morganza spillway
were opened to redirect water away from Baton Rouge and  New
Orleans . The company said May 16 that levees should protect the
plant from rising waters.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut May 13 a pipeline that supplies the
plant with crude oil, to reduce the risk of damage from the
flooding.  The refinery can process 83,000 barrels of crude oil daily,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
