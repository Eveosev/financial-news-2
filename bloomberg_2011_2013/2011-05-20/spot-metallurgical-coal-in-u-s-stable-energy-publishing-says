Metallurgical coal prices were steady
this week on the U.S. spot market on signs that producers
wouldn’t sell below current prices, according to Energy
Publishing Inc.  Low-volatility coking coal was stable at $315 a ton in the
week ended today, the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider
reported. The price is $15 a ton less than the April-May June
benchmark, the report said. High-volatility coal fell $1.67, or
0.6 percent, to $268.33.  “U.S. premium low-vol producers had already pegged the
market at $315 and now indicate that they will not sell coal for
less, whether on a spot or three-month basis,” Energy
Publishing said. Asian sources expected to see prices dip below
$300, the report said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
