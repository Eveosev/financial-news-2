Ethical Coffee Co. will begin selling
its coffee capsules, designed to work in Nespresso machines, in
 Switzerland  this fall, L’Agefi reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Gaillard.  The company expects to sell about 500 million coffee
capsules a year in Switzerland, home of Nespresso’s parent
 Nestle SA (NESN) , according to the report. Overall, Ethical Coffee aims
for sales of 750 million capsules this year, including 400
million in  France , Gaillard said in an interview in today’s
 newspaper . He declined to comment on whether the product would
be sold by supermarket chain Coop in Switzerland.  Nestle’s Nespresso unit has sued rivals including Ethical
Coffee that sell pre-filled capsules compatible with its
machines last year. Ethical Coffee yesterday said it asked
France’s competition authority to look into its claims Nestle
and Nespresso put up barriers to competition, according to a
separate report in L’Agefi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
