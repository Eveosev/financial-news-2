South African bonds headed for the
biggest weekly rally since October after a less-than-estimated
pick-up in South African inflation damped bets interest rates
will rise. The rand is poised for the first weekly gain in three
against the dollar.  The 13.5 percent government bond due 2015 slid less than
0.1 percent to 121.42 rand, yielding 7.57 percent at 6:02 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The note is headed for a 0.5 percent advance
this week, the most since the five days through Oct. 29. The
rand declined 0.4 percent, to 6.9056 per dllar, leaving it 1.6
percent stronger for the week.  Consumer inflation was 4.2 percent in April, less than the
4.4 percent median estimate by economists, according to figures
from the statistics office on May 17 and a Bloomberg survey.
Retail sales growth slowed for the third consecutive month, a
separate, May 17 report showed, fueling bets the central bank
will keep its benchmark rate on hold. Foreign investors have
been net buyers of 19.4 billion rand ($2.8 billion) of South
African bonds this year, according to data from JSE Ltd., which
manages the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  “Inflows into the  bond market  have certainly improved in
recent weeks with foreigners still finding value in the local
bond market,” Tradition Analytics researchers led by Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “Foreigners
are at this point less convinced about an early rate hike.”  Debt Sale  Inflation will breach the upper range of the 3 percent to 6
percent target range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3
percent in the first quarter of 2012, the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said on May 12 after holding its
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent, a 30-year low. The MPC
will be “vigilant” in monitoring inflation, Governor Gill Marcus said.  The Pretoria-based central bank auctioned 600 million rand
of inflation-linked debt, called linkers, maturing in 2022, 2028
and 2033 this week today.  The  Reserve Bank  allocated 160 million rand of 2.75 percent
linkers maturing in 2022 at an average yield of 2.53 percent,
matching the rate at last week’s auction, the lowest since a
Nov. 24 auction of similar-maturity debt. Investors bid for 11.3
times the amount allocated. It allocated 240 million rand of
3.45 percent bonds due 2033 at an average yield of 2.55 percent,
matching the rate at last week’s auction, the lowest since
November.  The central bank sold 200 million rand of 2.6 percent bonds
due 2028 at an average yield of 2.58 percent, 1 basis point
lower than last week’s auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
