Copersucar SA,  Brazil ’s biggest sugar
exporter, filed to sell shares in an initial public offering as
it speeds up a 1.5 billion-real ($920 million) investment plan.  The company hired Banco Itau BBA SA as the lead coordinator
and said Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group AG
and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  would also help arrange the sale,
according to a statement posted today on the Brazilian
securities regulator’s  website . The number of shares or value of
the transaction wasn’t disclosed.  Copersucar’s 48 shareholders crush about 115 million metric
tons of sugar cane to turn it into sugar and ethanol. The
company owns a terminal at the Port of Santos, Brazil’s largest,
to export the sweetener and the biofuel. This year, Copersucar
plans to trade 8.1 million tons of sugar.  Companies have raised $2.71 billion in IPOs in Brazil so far
this year, down 29 percent from the $3.81 billion raised in the
same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
