Slovenia ’s  central bank  said
rejection of the government’s pension overhaul in a June
referendum would “deepen the imbalances in public finances”
and may drive up borrowing costs.  “A possible rejection would increase the deficit in public
finances and push the country’s debt even higher,” Banka
Slovenije, based in the capital Ljubljana, said in an e-mailed
statement today. A rejection would also “likely cut the
country’s credit rating, which would make borrowing for the
government, banks and companies more expensive.”  If voters rebuff the revamp, the budget gap would remain at
5.5 percent of gross domestic product and Slovenia wouldn’t be
filling its debt-reduction obligations, the central bank said.  Slovenia, with one of the fastest-aging populations in
 Europe , needs to overhaul its pension system to cut public
spending and meet the target of a 3 percent budget deficit by
2013, in line with the rules of the European stability program.
The nation spends 1.3 billion euros ($1.9 billion) a year on
pension payments, an amount that is “not sustainable,”
according to Finance Minister  Franc Krizanic .  Lawmakers adopted the measure in December and trade unions
managed to put the proposal up for a public vote in June by
collecting the required 40,000 signatures.  A rejection of the pension change may prompt credit-ratings
companies such as  Standard & Poor’s  to lower the score of
Slovenia, which has the best rating in east Europe. S&P rates
Slovenia at AA, the third-highest investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
