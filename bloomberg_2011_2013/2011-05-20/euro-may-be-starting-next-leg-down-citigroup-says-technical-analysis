The euro may tumble as much as
6 percent versus the dollar if the currencies mimic a series of
moves in November as concern builds that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis is worsening, according to Citigroup Inc.  Europe’s shared currency fell from $1.4283 on Nov. 4 to
$1.3446 on Nov. 16, rallied over the next four trading days to
touch $1.3786, and then dropped again in an “aggressive move
lower,” Citigroup analysts  Tom Fitzpatrick , Shyam Devani and
Alex Good wrote today in a report. It weakened today after
rising for four days following an eight-day slide from $1.4940
on May 4, they wrote. The European currency may drop to about
$1.35 if the previous move is replicated, they wrote.  “We think there is a strong chance that the bounce in euro-
dollar has run its course and the next leg down is starting,”
the analysts wrote.  The euro declined 0.8 percent today to $1.4194, from
$1.4309 yesterday. It earlier touched $1.4346, the highest level
since May 11, after appreciating from $1.4048 on May 16.  Investors should buy options on the euro weakening to $1.41
against the greenback that expire on June 3, Citigroup said.  Yields on Spanish, Portuguese and Greek government bonds
have climbed amid concern that  Greece  and other nations may have
to restructure their debt and that austerity measures may slow
economic growth.   Spain ’s 10-year government bond yields rose to
5.49 percent today, the highest since April 28, while the
Portuguese 10-year yield reached 9.39 percent, a one-week high.
Greek 10-year debt yielded a record 16.59 percent.  “The developments that are taking place in European
interest-rate markets are suggesting a little bit of concern
that we think will be reflected in the euro coming under
pressure,” New York-based Fitzpatrick said in a telephone
interview. “In the near term, the next month or so, we think
there’s a real danger that the dollar is a bit of a beneficiary
from concerns we think may be focused on  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
