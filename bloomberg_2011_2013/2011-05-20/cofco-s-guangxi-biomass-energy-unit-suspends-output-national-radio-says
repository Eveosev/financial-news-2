Guangxi COFCO Biomass Energy Co., a
unit of COFCO Ltd., suspended production on March 21 because the
company has difficulty selling bio-ethanol produced from
cassava, the China National Radio reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  The National Development and Reform Commission sent a team
to investigate the problem, the radio said. The report didn’t
say whether the production has resumed yet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
