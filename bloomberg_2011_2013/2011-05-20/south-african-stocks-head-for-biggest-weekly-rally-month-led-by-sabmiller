South African stocks advanced and
were poised for the biggest weekly gain in a month, led by
 SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-largest brewer by volume,
which reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index climbed 1.1 percent to
32,260.17 by 10:26 a.m. in Johannesburg, taking its increase
this week to 1 percent, the best weekly rally since the period
through April 22. SABMiller jumped as much as 2.4 percent to
259.70 rand, the highest level since January 1995. The brewer
reported a 15 percent increase in earnings before interest,
taxes and amortization to $5.04 billion yesterday, beating an
analysts’ estimate of $4.87 billion.  “The good run today is really on the back of the results
yesterday,” Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus Securities
Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. “The market likes what
its hearing there. And that’s in a market that’s doing very well
generally,” said Heyneke. “It’s a very well geographically
diversified company that is also seen as a good, defensive
share.”  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , the biggest investor in South African
mining, snapped two days of losses, rallying 1.5 percent to
336.54 rand as copper, lead, nickel and zinc climbed on the
London Metals Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
