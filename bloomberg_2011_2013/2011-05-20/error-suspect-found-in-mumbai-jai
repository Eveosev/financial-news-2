A terrorism suspect  India  had
demanded its rival Pakistan hand over during security talks two
months ago has been in a Mumbai jail for over a year, the second
man on a most-wanted list already arrested in the city.  A “lapse” by police meant they failed to notify Interpol
that Feroz Abdul Rashid Khan, accused of involvement in bomb
blasts in India’s financial capital in 1993, had already been
taken into custody, the  Central Bureau of Investigation  said in
a statement  yesterday .  The CBI said it has suspended five people over the incident
and is conducting a “thorough review” of those remaining on
the list of India’s 50 most sought fugitives.  Another man named, Wazhul Kamar Khan, was arrested by
Indian police last year over alleged links to bombings in
India’s financial capital in 2003, the Hindustan Times reported
today. He was released on bail, it said.  Indian Home Secretary Gopal K. Pillai handed over the 50
names to his Pakistani counterpart in March during the most
prominent security cooperation between the two countries since
the Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed 166 people in November
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
