Malawi’s government will not devalue
the local currency, the kwacha, because it would fuel inflation
and wouldn’t solve the country’s foreign exchange shortage, the
Nation cited Finance Minister Ken Kandodo as saying.  The country needs a combination of measures to tackle the
foreign exchange shortage, Kandodo told a conference in the
capital, Lilongwe, according to the Blantyre-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
