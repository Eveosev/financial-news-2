Luca Bertalot, head of the European
Covered Bond Council, comments on a planned quality label for
the loan-backed debt.  Bertalot, based in Brussels, spoke in telephone interview.  On recognition from regulators:  “One of the main purposes of the labelling exercise is to
get better recognition from regulators and authorities of the
value of the covered bonds.”  On covered bonds as collateral for central bank loans:  “Better terms for covered bonds in the ECB’s collateral
framework are part of the regulatory recognition, but that is a
work in progress and the ECB is not pre-committed to anything.”  On Basel III treatment of covered bonds as regulatory capital:  “A haircut of 15 percent for covered bonds is an arbitrary
number that is much higher than equivalent haircuts used in
central bank repo operations or market practice.”  “We would like to discuss with European authorities the
right proportion of covered bonds banks should include in their
liquidity buffers.”  On characteristics of the quality label:  “We are very keen to maintain the current nature of
covered bonds so the definition of covered bonds will be based
on national legislation and supervision, and on the fact that
mortgages and public sector loans are the right collateral.  To contact the reporters on this story:
