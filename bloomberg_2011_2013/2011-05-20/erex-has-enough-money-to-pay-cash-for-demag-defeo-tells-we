Terex Corp. (TEX)  Chief Executive Officer
 Ron DeFeo  said the company has enough money to finance its bid
for Germany’s  Demag Cranes AG (D9C)  in cash,  Welt reported , citing an
interview with the executive.  Terex, which has bid 41.75 euros a share for Demag, would
work with the cranemaker’s current management if they agree,
DeFeo said, according to the German newspaper. The CEO expects
Terex, based in Westport, Connecticut, will probably hire rather
than fire workers after the takeover as the business has “high
growth potential.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
