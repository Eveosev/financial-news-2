The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1 basis point to
106.5 basis points as of 10:43 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole CIB. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  increased half a basis
point to 106 basis points as of 8:43 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit
Agricole prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1 basis point to 123
as of 9:49 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
