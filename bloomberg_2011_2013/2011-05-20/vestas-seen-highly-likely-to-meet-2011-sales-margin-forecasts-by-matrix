Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s
largest wind-turbine maker, is “highly likely” to meet its
2011 forecasts for revenue and margins, analysts at Matrix
Investment Management Ltd. said.  Randers, Denmark-based Vestas has already secured enough
orders for delivery and commissioning in 2011 to meet 95 percent
of its target of 6,000 megawatts of shipments that underpin its
financial forecasts, analysts Tom Plinston and  Michael McNamara 
said today in a note to investors.  “This suggests that Vestas is highly likely to achieve its
2011 revenue and margin guidance of 7 billion euros ($10
billion) and 7 percent, respectively,” the analysts said.
“This sets a floor under Vestas’s share price.”  Vestas lost 44 percent of its market value last year after
twice lowering its sales forecast. Its shares are down 5.9
percent this year and yesterday closed at 165.70 kroner ($31.66)
in Copenhagen. Matrix has a “buy” rating on the shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
