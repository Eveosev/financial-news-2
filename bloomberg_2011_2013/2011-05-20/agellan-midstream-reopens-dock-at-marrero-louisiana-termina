Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  will
resume operations today at a dock at its heavy fuel oil terminal
in Marrero, Louisiana, Bruce Heine, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Magellan reopened two other docks at the Marrero terminal
on May 17. The company halted barge and vessel operations at
Marrero and at Gibson, Louisiana, May 13 because of flooding
concerns.  Magellan has about 2.8 million barrels of storage at the
Marrero terminal, which is along the  Mississippi River . Gibson,
in southeast Louisiana along the Atchafalaya River, is capable
of storing about 50,000 barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
