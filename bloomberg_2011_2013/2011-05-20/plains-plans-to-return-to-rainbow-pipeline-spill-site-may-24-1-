Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)  said
it expects to return to the site of a rupture on its Rainbow
crude-oil pipeline in Alberta May 24 if the threat of wildfires
has diminished.  Workers were evacuated from the site May 15 after forest
fires threatened the area. Company officials were allowed to
return yesterday and crews will resume work once government
regulators grant approval, Plains said in an e-mail. The spilled
oil at the site remains contained, the Houston-based company
said.  The Rainbow line, which is operated by affiliate Plains
Midstream  Canada , carries oil from the Northwest Territories and
northern Alberta. The northern tier of the 772-kilometer (480-
mile) line was shut after a leak April 29. The company
voluntarily shut the southern tier of the line because of the
fire threat.  Plains can restart the southern portion when the threat of
the fire passes, said Kim Blanchette, a spokeswoman for
 Alberta ’s  Energy Resources Conservation Board . The northern tier
can’t be restarted until the company completes inspections
required by the board, she said.  Oil and oil-sands output has been stopped or slowed as a
result of the pipeline closure. Cenovus Energy Inc. shut 22,000
barrels a day of heavy oil output at its Pelican Lake project
yesterday after tanks at the site were filled. Penn West
Petroleum Ltd. and Canadian Natural Resources said they would
have to shut as much as 40,000 barrels a day each when tanks
filled at their projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
