Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein
froze payment of 235 million kroner ($42 million) in European
Economic Area grants to  Greece  because the government didn’t
meet the obligations linked to the funds.  “Greece had committed to paying 50 percent of each
project. This was not followed up,” Norwegian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement posted on its website yesterday. “It’s also
unclear whether the money already transferred to the Greek
authorities was forwarded to the appropriate recipients.”  About 13 million kroner of the committed funds for the
period of 2004 to 2009 had been paid out, the ministry said.  Greece’s debt will balloon to 157.7 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011 as the economy slumps for the third
year, the European Commission forecast last week, fueling doubts
whether the country will generate enough growth to pay its
bills.  The government has implemented austerity measures including
wage and pension cuts and higher sales taxes in exchange for a
110 billion-euro bailout from the EU and International Monetary
Fund that was agreed on last May.  To contact the reporters for this story:
