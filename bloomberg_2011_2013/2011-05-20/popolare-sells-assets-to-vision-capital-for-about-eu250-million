Banco Popolare SC (BP)  agreed to sell
assets including glass and plastic-packaging manufacturer
Bormioli Rocco to private-equity fund Vision Capital for about
250 million euros ($354 million).  Popolare,  Italy ’s fourth-biggest bank, agreed to sell its
95 percent stake in Bormioli for about 238 million euros and a
portfolio of investments held by unit Efibanca for 10.5 million
euros, according to a statement today. The lender’s Core Tier 1
ratio, a measure of financial strength, will rise 2 basis points
after the sale.  Chief Executive Officer Pier Francesco Saviotti is cutting
costs and selling non-strategic assets to recover from losses
linked to the company’s Italease unit. The lender, which aims to
present a new business plan by June, sold 2 billion euros in new
shares through a rights offer earlier this year ahead of a
second round of stress tests.  The Verona-based lender will post a capital gain of about 5
million euros from the sale of its Bormioli stake, a spokesman,
who declined to be identified citing company policy, said by
phone.  The shares fell as  much as 2.1 percent and traded at 1.89
euros, down 2 percent, at 4:18 p.m. in Milan, giving the company
a market value of 3.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
