Tata Power Co.,  India ’s largest non-
state generator of wind power, and  Australia ’s  Origin Energy
Ltd. (ORG)  have begun exploration in  Indonesia  aimed at producing
power from underground heat.  “Initial exploration has begun,” Sowmyan Ramakrishnan,
executive director of finance, told reporters in Mumbai late
yesterday. “It will take up to 18 months to complete.”  Tata Power, Origin and PT Supraco Indonesia in Sept. 2010
won the Sorik Marapi concession in northern Sumatra, which may
yield as much as 300 megawatts of geothermal generating
capacity. If exploration is successful, the group plans to begin
construction in late 2012.  Tata Power plans to add 200 megawatts of renewable energy
capacity in the fiscal year ending March 2012 along with 2,600
megawatts of thermal capacity, Ramakrishnan said.  The Mumbai-based company has lined up financing for all
planned projects for this fiscal year, saidS. Padmanabhan,
executive director of operations.  Tata Power’s current generation capacity is 3,127
megawatts, including 273 megawatts of wind, according to an e-
mailed statement yesterday. The company completed its first 3-
megawatt grid-connected solar plant in March and expects to
finish a 25-megawatt project in Gujarat by the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
