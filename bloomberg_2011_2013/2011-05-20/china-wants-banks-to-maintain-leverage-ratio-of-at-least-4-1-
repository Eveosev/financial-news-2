China’s banking regulator said the
country’s banks should maintain their  leverage ratio  at no lower
than 4 percent to curb credit risk.  Systemically important banks should comply by the end of
2013 and other banks by the end of 2016, the China Banking
Regulatory Commission said in a  statement  on its website today.  The leverage ratio measures core capital as a percentage of
total assets both on and off lenders’ balance sheets, according
to the draft management rules posted on the website. The CBRC
said it is seeking public opinion on the new regulations.  -- Michael Wei . Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
