Hungary may stop paying pensioners
below the age of 57 who are able to work and refuse a job offer,
 Magyar Nemzet  reported today, citing a government draft
document.  Retirees may get their pensions halved if they refuse a
first offer of work and canceled completely after a second
offer, the newspaper said, citing the document produced in
preparation for an overhaul of welfare payments to cut the
 budget deficit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
