Oil companies  in Kenya back a
proposal to have Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd. stop processing
their crude shipments, said David Ohana, managing director of
KenolKobil Ltd.  “We are very much for that as an industry,” Ohana, who
spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Petroleum Institute of
East Africa, said at a conference today in Nairobi, the capital.
“As KPRL keep bringing crude to Kenya, we are losing each and
every day.”  KPRL, which is jointly owned by the Kenyan government and
Essar Energy Overseas Ltd., has proposed “remodeling” the
facility into a trade or merchant refinery, Ohana said. Kenyan
law currently requires fuel marketers to have some of their
imported products refined by KPRL, Ohana said.  KPRL Chief Executive Officer Bimal Mukherjee said in an
interview that changing the refinery into a merchant or trade
facility would result in the company importing its own crude,
refining it and then selling the product on to marketers.  Inefficiencies at KPRL add between 5 shillings and 10
shillings per liter to the cost of production and that is passed
on to consumers, Jimmy Mugerwa, chairman of Shell  Kenya , said at
the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
