The peso strengthened for a third day
after the central bank reported its second consecutive monthly
balance of payments surplus, signaling strong remittance inflows.  The nation had an excess of $1.08 billion in April data
showed yesterday, taking the surplus in the first four months of
the year to $4.6 billion and putting the central bank on track
to meet its $6.7 billion projection for 2011. The external
payments surplus provides support to the peso, helping
“mitigate imported inflationary pressures,” Governor Amando Tetangco said in a mobile-phone message yesterday.  “The balance of payments surplus is positive for the peso,
fundamentally and sentiment-wise,” said Radhika Rao, an
economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 43.123 per dollar as
of 11:35 a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It was
little changed for the week.  Government spending  in April was still “below” program,
Budget Undersecretary Laura Pascua said in a mobile-phone
message today, citing preliminary data.  “The market may rejoice for a while on a surplus, but if
it’s driven by under-spending, it’s going to be negative for
growth,” Rao said.  The yield on the 6.25 percent January 2014 peso bond fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.98 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate gained eight
basis points from the end of last week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
