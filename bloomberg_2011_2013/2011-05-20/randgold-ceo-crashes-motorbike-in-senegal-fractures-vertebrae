Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Bristow  is in hospital in South Africa
after fracturing two vertebrae in a motorbike crash in  Senegal .  “It’s nothing life threatening, just very sore, and I’ll
be back on my feet in a week or two,” Bristow, 52, said by
phone from hospital. “I’ll definitely be back on my bike. It
will mend itself as long as I don’t do anything reckless.”  Bristow, who in 2009 rode a bike from  Cape Town  to Cairo
with his two sons, was near Randgold’s Massawa gold project in
Senegal on May 16 when he came off the motorcycle. He was taken
to hospital in Dakar before being flown to  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
