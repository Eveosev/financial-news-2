Natural gas futures advanced the most
in three weeks as data showed the number of U.S. gas drilling
rigs fell for a second consecutive week.  Gas gained 3.3 percent after Houston-based Baker Hughes
Inc. said the rig total declined 8 to 866 this week, the lowest
level since the week ended Jan. 29, 2010. Prices also rose after
gas settled near a six-week low yesterday, spurring buying from
traders betting that the market had hit a bottom for now.  “It’s the second drop in a row and it is what the bulls
are looking for,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta. “It seems prices are at the bottom
of the range.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 13.6 cents to settle at
$4.23 per million British thermal units on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest percentage gain since April 28.
The futures fell 0.4 percent this week.  “The market seems to be thinking that we might have done
enough this week with selling off,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “We’re kind of
getting a dead cat bounce.”  Gas stockpiles gained 92 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 13 to 1.919 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said yesterday. The five-year average change for the week is an
increase of 91 billion cubic feet, department data show.
Inventories rose 78 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  Storage levels were down 11 percent from a year earlier,
narrowing from 12 percent in the previous week, department data
showed. Stockpiles were 1.8 percent below the five-year average
last week compared with 2 percent the previous week.  Temperatures may be normal or above-normal across most of
the continental U.S. from May 25 through May 29, according to
WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts . Warmer-than-normal weather
is likely along the Eastern Seaboard.  Texas Weather  The high in  Dallas  on May 28 may be 92 degrees Fahrenheit
(28 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in Chicago may be
64, 12 below normal.  Cooling demand in the south-central U.S. may be 12 percent
below normal from May 26 through May 30,  David Salmon , a
meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , said
in a note to clients today.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Pipeline Shipments  Natural gas shipments to U.S. power plants were set to
increase for a fifth day as hotter-than-normal weather in the
South boosts demand for gas-fired electricity.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation gained 3.6 percent to 13.5 million dekatherms (13.1
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 13 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 3:46 p.m. in New York.  Gas deliveries to Florida  power plants  advanced 6.1 percent
to 2.72 million dekatherms.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
235,934 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 306,000. Volume was 315,365 yesterday. Open interest was
947,797 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
