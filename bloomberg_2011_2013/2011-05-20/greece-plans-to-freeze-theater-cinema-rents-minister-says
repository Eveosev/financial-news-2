Greece  plans to freeze rents for
theaters and cinemas and cut them for state-owned hotels to
provide relief as the economic crisis curtails profits, Economy
and Competitiveness Minister Michalis Chrisochoides said.  “The crisis and recession are trying on the real
economy,” Chrisochoides said at a presentation in  Athens 
yesterday, according to an e-mailed transcript of his remarks.
“We are implementing policies that can give immediate practical
solutions to small and medium-sized businesses.”  The government plans to extend leases by 12 years, cut
rents paid by 204 hotels by as much as 20 percent and freeze
rents for 500 theaters and cinemas for five years, he said.  Greek businesses have come under pressure as a result of
austerity measures imposed by Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
in exchange for a European Union led 110 billion-euro ($157.5
billion) bailout. The economy, which contracted 4.5 percent last
year, may shrink 3.5 percent in 2011, according to European
Commission estimates released on May 13.  About 70 percent of Greek businesses occupy rented space,
the cost of which amounts to 20 percent to 30 percent of
operating expenses, Chrisochoides said. Legislation being
drafted may be expanded to include all leases from the state, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
