Two days of wage talks between
Botswana’s government and striking state employees broke down
without an accord, the government said.  The state submitted its offer of a 3 percent wage increase
as of September, while unions demanded 12 percent backdated to
April 1 and the reinstatement of all fired workers, according to
the statement. Teachers, medical personnel and other state
workers have been on strike since April 18.  “There was no agreement on the two positions, and parties
agreed to engage as and when opportunities arise,” the
government said.  President Ian Khama said yesterday that the government
could not afford the workers’ demands as the fiscal deficit was
forecast at 7 billion pulas ($1.1 billion) in the current fiscal
year.  “I will not, during my term as President, do anything that
will jeopardize the economy,” Khama said in a speech on state
television.  The strike has reduced government orders for goods and
services, delayed business licenses and permits and damped
demand, the Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry and
Manpower said in an e-mailed statement today. Some businesses
may soon be forced to close, the confederation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
