Grain traders in  Russia , which barred
cereal exports last year, are preparing to make foreign
deliveries on prospects for an improved harvest this year,
agricultural researcher SovEcon said.  Traders intensified buying of wheat, mostly the fourth-
grade milling variety, about a month ago and stored the grain in
silos of their own or located in ports, Managing Director Andrey Sizov Jr. said by phone today from Moscow, where  SovEcon  is
based. The purchases stabilized average grain prices at between
5,100 rubles ($182) and 5,300 rubles a metric ton, he said.  “Yes, traders took such a position” on speculation the
export ban will expire on time, said Vladimir Petrichenko,
Moscow-based researcher OOO ProZerno’s director. Outbound
shipments may reach 20 million tons in the 2011-12 season, he
said.  The ban, which took effect Aug. 15 and is scheduled to run
through July 1, was imposed as Russia’s worst drought in at
least 50 years seared fields. The national grain crop fell 37
percent to 60.9 million tons last year. Agriculture Minister
 Yelena Skrynnik  said April 28 the government would discuss the
ban after spring sowing.  “We consider grain exports will be resumed,” Sizov said.
“It can be temporary, or there can be export quotas
established.”  ‘Comfortable’ Reserves  Russian grain reserves of 14 million tons, half of them
held in a state-run intervention fund, are “comfortable,”
auguring in favor of restarting exports this year, Sizov said.  The “chances Russia opens exports continued to strengthen
this week,” Dmitry Rylko, general director of the  Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies  in Moscow, said by phone. “This
relates to new estimates of carry-over stocks, harvest prospects
and grain prices’ dynamics in Russia.”  Russia may export at least 10 million tons of grains,
including 9.8 million tons of wheat, in the 2011-12 season,
according to Ikar, as Rylko’s institute is known. ProZerno’s
Petrichenko predicted deliveries of at least 17 million tons.  ProZerno raised its estimate for this year’s grain harvest
this week to between 89.7 million and 90 million tons from 89.7
million tons projected on May 11, Petrichenko said. He cited
success by farmers in overcoming sowing delays to exceed last
year’s planting pace by 2.25 million hectares (5.6 million
acres) as of May 17.  Increased Sowing  “The picture is even more optimistic than I thought,”
Petrichenko said. Russian farmers planted spring grains on 16.4
million hectares as of May 18, up 14 percent from a year
earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said that day.  Carry-over stocks are estimated at between 15 million and
15.5 million tons, while the winter-crop loss rate may be below
average at 7.2 percent, according to Petrichenko.  Ikar left its January estimate for a total grain harvest of
84 million tons unchanged, Rylko said. That includes 54 million
tons of wheat, 1.3 million tons of legumes and 1 million tons of
rice, he said.  SovEcon projects a grain crop of between 78 million and 83
million tons, Sizov said. The estimate includes between 49
million and 51 million tons of wheat, between 14 million and
14.5 million tons of barley, and between 4.8 million and 5.3
million tons of corn, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
