The dollar and the yen weakened
against their higher-yielding counterparts as stock markets
advanced, sapping demand for safer assets amid speculation the
global economic recovery will be sustained.  The U.S. currency declined the most against the  New Zealand
dollar  and the Norwegian krone among its 16 major peers. The
krone climbed against the euro as Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said it may appreciate further as growth accelerates.  “The weaker dollar is another symbol of this improvement
in risk appetite,” said London-based Kathleen Brooks, research
director at Forex.com, a unit of online currency trading company
Gain Capital Holding Inc. “Stocks are doing quite well and
that’s feeding into”  currency markets , she said.  The dollar weakened 0.6 percent to 79.58 cents versus the
New Zealand dollar, as of 10:47 a.m. in  London , pushing its
depreciation this week to 1.1 percent. The U.S. currency was 0.4
percent weaker at 5.4861 Norwegian kroner. The euro traded at
$1.4305 from $1.4309 yesterday in  New York , 1.4 percent stronger
since May 13. The yen was little changed at 81.56 per dollar.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.5 percent, climbing
for a third day, while U.S. equity futures were little changed.  The yen has lost 5.4 percent this year in the biggest drop
among the 10 developed-nation exchange rates tracked under
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar has
fallen 4.8 percent, while the euro has risen 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
