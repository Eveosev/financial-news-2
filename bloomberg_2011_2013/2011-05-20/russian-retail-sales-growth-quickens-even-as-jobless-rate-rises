Russian retail sales grew faster than
economists expected in April, threatening to stoke inflation as
the central bank seeks to contain rising prices.  Sales rose 5.6 percent in May from the same month last
year, the Federal Statistics Service said in an e-mailed
statement today. That beat the 5.1 percent average estimate of
13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Russian  consumer spending  accelerated even as disposable
incomes fell 6.5 percent on the year, the biggest decline since
August 2009, and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly rose to 7.2
percent from 7.1 percent, the data show. Analysts had forecast
the jobless number to fall to 6.7 percent.  The central bank raised  interest rates  for the second time
this year last month to cap an inflation rate that has held
above the bank’s target of 6 percent to 7 percent since October.
Bank Rossii raised its refinancing rate t0 8.25 percent from 8
percent on April 29, surprising the 15 of 20 economists who
expected no change. The bank’s next meets on rates next week.  The slowest-growing economy among the so-called BRIC
nations,  Russia  is relying on oil at $100 a barrel to bolster
its recovery even as the government seeks to reduce its reliance
on energy exports. The economy will expand 4.5 percent next
year, compared with 9.1 percent for China and 7.8 percent for
India, the  International Monetary Fund  forecast this month.  Industrial investment advanced 2.2 percent and real wages
rose 2.7 percent, the Federal Statistics Service said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
