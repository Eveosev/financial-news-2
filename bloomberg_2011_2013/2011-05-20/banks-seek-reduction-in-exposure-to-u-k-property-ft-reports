Banks are trying to reduce their 224
billion-pound ($363.6 billion) exposure to U.K. commercial
property, with about 50 percent of loans due to mature in 2013
and 20 percent still in breach or default following the crash in
prices, the Financial Times reported, citing a report by De
Montfort University in Leicester.  45.9 billion pounds of debt is due to mature this year,
with 37.3 billion pounds of loans -- revised up to 45 billion
pounds by De Montfort to include groups that didnâ€™t report
figures in full -- already reported as being in breach of
financial covenants or in default, the FT said, citing the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
