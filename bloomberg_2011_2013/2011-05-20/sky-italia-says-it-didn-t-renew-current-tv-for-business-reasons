Sky Italia  Srl, the Italian
satellite-television unit of  News Corp. (NWSA) , said it didn’t renew a
broadcasting contract with Current TV for business reasons.  Sky rejected comments by former U.S. Vice President Al
Gore, chairman and co-founder of  Current TV , who told the
Financial Times that the channel was dropped because of its
political coverage in the U.S.  “When the contract with Current reached its natural
expiration, Sky Italia proposed a renewal with an offer in line
with the market, within the current business environment and
considering the performance of Current,” Sky Italia said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Sky Italia said Current TV’s prime-time audience fell 40
percent from 2010 to 2011. Its average daily audience this year
is 2,952, down 20 percent from last year’s average. Current TV
disputed the figures in an e-mailed statement.  Sky Italia competes with  Mediaset SpA (MS) , the broadcaster
controlled by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
