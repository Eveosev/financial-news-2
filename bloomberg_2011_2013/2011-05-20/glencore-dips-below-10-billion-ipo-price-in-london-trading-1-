Glencore International Plc, the
commodities trader that sold $10 billion in an initial public
offering yesterday, closed below the offer price on its second
day of so-called conditional trading in London.  Glencore declined 1.1 percent to 524 pence, giving the
company a market value of 36.1 billion pounds ($58.6 billion).
It earlier fell as much 2.1 percent. The Baar, Switzerland-based
commodities trader sold 1.14 billion shares at 530 pence each in
its offering in London and  Hong Kong .  The sale price was at the midpoint of an offer range of 480
pence to 580 pence announced on May 4. The IPO attracted 12
cornerstone investors, including  Abu Dhabi â€™s Aabar Investments
PJSC and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , who committed a combined $3.1 billion
that they are locked into for six months, the prospectus shows.  Glencore, which trades materials including coal, oil and
metals, sold $7.9 billion of new stock, while current holders
sold another $2.1 billion of shares for tax purposes and to
repay loans, it said yesterday. The IPO includes an optional
overallotment, known as the greenshoe, of 10 percent of the
offer, which may boost proceeds to as much as $11 billion.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley
managed the IPO as global coordinators, along with Bank of
America Corp. and BNP Paribas SA as joint bookrunners. Barclays
Plc, Societe Generale SA and UBS AG were co-bookrunners.  Glencore is scheduled to be admitted to the  London Stock
Exchange  on May 24. All trades before that date are conditional
on the stock being admitted to the exchange and trades can only
settle once this has occurred, according to the LSE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
