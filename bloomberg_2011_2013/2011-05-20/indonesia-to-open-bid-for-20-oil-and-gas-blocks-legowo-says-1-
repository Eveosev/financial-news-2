Indonesia will open bidding for 20
oil and gas blocks in what will be the first round of offers
this year, said  Evita Legowo , director general of oil and gas at
the nation’s energy and mineral resources ministry.  The government will invite bids from investors to explore
and develop projects which include two offshore blocks on the
 Timor Sea , Semai IV in Papua and Northeast Madura block off Java
island, Legowo said at a conference in Jakarta today.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest crude producer, is
trying to lure investment in the energy sectors to help stem a
decline in output at aging oil and gas fields, which led to the
country withdrawing from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in 2008.  Indonesia awarded exploration rights for three oil and gas
blocks including to Eni  Indonesia  Ltd. for Arguni I block and
Total E&P Activities Petrolieres for Southwest Bird’s Head block,
Legowo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
