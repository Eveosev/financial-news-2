President William C. Dudley said the increase in the price of
gasoline, while vexing, isn’t having a major impact on overall
inflation.  “The rise in gasoline prices is really troubling to
everyone,” Dudley said today in response to audience questions
after a speech in Fishkill, New York. “So far, the pass through
of higher energy prices seems to be very modest. That is
consistent” with the historic trend.  “We will do whatever we need to do to keep inflation in
check over the medium to long term,” Dudley said. “It is
important we don’t overreact” to the temporary increase in food
and energy prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
