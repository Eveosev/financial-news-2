Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ’s
reported reshuffle of management and reorganization of its units
following a computer systems glitch is “desirable,” said
Japan’s Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi.  The group will appoint Yasuhiro Sato, who heads Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd., as president to replace Takashi Tsukamoto,
local media reported this week. The bank also aims to merge its
corporate and retail banking units by 2013 as Satoru Nishibori,
president of the retail unit, steps down, the reports said.  “Generally speaking, it’s desirable for companies to boost
efficiency and do their best to have appropriate management and
positions for employees,” Jimi told reporters today when asked
about the reports on Mizuho. He declined to comment on his
agency’s inspection of Mizuho that began after the retail
banking unit’s computer system malfunctioned in March.  The Nikkei newspaper reported on May 19 that the Financial
Services Agency will issue a business improvement order to
Mizuho next week. System glitches since March 15 at Mizuho Bank
Ltd. delayed transactions worth more than $10 billion, including
salary payments, curtailing access to funds in the wake of a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11.  Mizuho,  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market value, said
this week it “isn’t specifically considering” a group
restructuring. Masako Shiono, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based
bank, declined to comment on the personnel changes at the time.  Mizuho shares rose 1 yen to 130 as of 10:06 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
