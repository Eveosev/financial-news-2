Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  has restarted its
Norman Wells pipeline that connects oilfields in the Northwest
Territories with the North American pipeline grid.  The line, which was shut after a May 10 leak near Wrigley,
Northwest Territories, won’t resume full operation until the
connecting Rainbow pipeline is restarted,  Gina Jordan , a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The leak was contained within
the pipeline’s right of way and about 25 people are at the site
working on cleanup and remediation.  The line carries crude from an  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  processing
facility in Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, to the Plains
All American Pipeline LP’s Rainbow conduit in Zama, Alberta. Oil
is chilled before being put into the 12-inch, 39,400-barrel-a-
day Enbridge line to protect the Arctic permafrost.  The Rainbow line has been shut since April 29 after it
ruptured and spilled 28,000 barrels of oil in northern  Alberta .
Workers repairing and cleaning up the spill were evacuated from
the site May 15 by wildfires burning in the area.  Enbridge said the cause of the leak at Wrigley is unknown
and is under investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
