The  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) ’s
Brazil unit aims to increase its staff by more than 20 percent
this year to expand operations in the South American country.  BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM SA, which
administrates funds that have other managers, expects a
Presidential decree to be issued by the end of the first half
authorizing the firm to operate as a commercial bank, President
Zeca Oliveira said yesterday in an interview in Sao Paulo.  “We are predicting hiring 80 to 100 people for that”,
Oliveira said.  BNY’s Brazilian operation currently has 450 employees and
manages 97.2 billion reais, according to the country’s capital
markets association. The unit aims, by becoming a bank, to offer
corporate services including guarantees of deposits, interest on
debt and project finance, Oliveira said. Further possible
products include acting as custodian for private equity funds
abroad, he said.  The new staff will work on interfacing with the central
bank, compliance and internal audit, Oliveira said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
