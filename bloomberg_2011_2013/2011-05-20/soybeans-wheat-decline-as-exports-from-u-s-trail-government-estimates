Soybeans and wheat fell in Chicago
after government figures showed U.S. exports of the crops
trailed official estimates. Corn was little changed.  Soybean exports  from Sept. 1 through May 12 totaled 36.6
million metric tons, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in
a report yesterday. Exporters need to ship 5.55 million tons in
15 weeks, or an average of 369,000 tons a week, through the end
of the marketing year on Aug. 31 to meet the official goal.
Exporters sold 166,100 tons last week, according to the USDA.  “Fundamentally, the soybean market remains quiet, with
Thursday’s weekly export sales and shipment numbers coming in
well below what was needed to stay on pace with USDA’s demand
projection,” Darin Newsom, senior analyst at Telvent DTN in
Omaha,  Nebraska , said in a report today.  Soybeans for July delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.75 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reducing the weekly gain to 3.4 percent. The oilseed
climbed 46 percent in the past year, partly on rising demand
from  China , the biggest global importer.  Wheat shippers have sent 31.4 million tons of the grain
overseas,  USDA data show . Exporters, expected by the government
to ship 34.7 million tons by the end of May, would need to ship
3.3 million tons, or 1.1 million tons a week, to reach that
goal.  “Total export demand for wheat continues to run behind
USDA projections,” Newsom said.  Wheat for July delivery dropped 10 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $8.02 a bushel. That left prices up 10 percent this week, on
course for the biggest climb since the week ended Dec. 3.
Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 1.50 euros, or 0.6 percent, to 242.50 euros ($345.51)
a ton.  Corn for July delivery gained 0.75 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$7.49 a bushel in  Chicago . Prices are up 9.8 percent this week,
on course for the biggest advance since the week ended Oct. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
