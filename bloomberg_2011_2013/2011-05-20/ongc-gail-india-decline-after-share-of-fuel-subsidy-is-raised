Oil & Natural Gas Corp.,  India ’s
biggest energy exploration company, and  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  declined
in Mumbai trading after the government increased the burden of
fuel subsidy payable by the state-run companies to refiners.  ONGC fell 1.7 percent to 272.90 rupees at 2:02 p.m. local
time. GAIL India, the country’s biggest natural gas distributor,
dropped 0.5 percent to 426.10 rupees.  Oil India Ltd. (OINL) , the
second-biggest state-owned explorer, lost 2.3 percent to 1,300
rupees. The benchmark Sensitive Index gained 1.2 percent.  The share of fuel subsidy for explorers was increased to
38.8 percent, Oil India director of finance T.K. Ananth Kumar
said by telephone today, without giving details. The share was
earlier 33 percent, the  Press Trust of India  reported.  India’s state refiners sell diesel, cooking gas and
kerosene at prices set by the government to curb inflation. The
refiners are partly compensated by getting discounts on supplies
from explorers and cash from the government.  Exploration companies have been ordered to pay 302.9
billion rupees ($6.7 billion) of the total subsidy burden of 780
billion rupees for the year ended March 31, ONGC Chairman A.K.
Hazarika told reporters in  New Delhi  today. ONGC will pay 248.9
billion rupees, he said.  ONGC paid 127.57 billion rupees as subsidy in the first
three quarters of the previous financial year, Hazarika said.  The explorer is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings
on May 30. A proposed sale of ONGC shares will start on July 5,
Press Trust of India reported on May 5.  The profitability of state-owned Indian Oil Corp., the
nation’s biggest refiner, will increase by 23 billion rupees in
the last financial year following the increase in the subsidy
bill for exploration companies, Finance Director P.K. Goyal said
in an interview on Bloomberg UTV.  To contact the reporters on this story:
