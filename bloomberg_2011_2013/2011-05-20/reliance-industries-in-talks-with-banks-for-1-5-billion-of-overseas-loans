Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ,  India ’s
largest company by market value, is in talks with banks to
arrange as much as $1.5 billion in dollar-denominated loans,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , plans to
borrow $1.1 billion in five-year loans to replace debt maturing
in about two years that has higher interest costs, the people
said, not wishing to be identified because the terms aren’t set.
The company may obtain another $400 million of new loans, the
people said.  Reliance, India’s fourth-most indebted company, is looking
to borrow at about 165 basis points more than the six-month
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the people said. The
company has not appointed the lead arrangers and banks wanting
to participate in the debt syndicate need to apply by May end,
the people said.  Manoj Warrier, a Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance,
declined to comment. The company’s shares rose 0.8 percent to
923.2 rupees in Mumbai yesterday. They have declined 12 percent
this year.  “The company has a lot of projects lined up, such as a
petrochemicals plant at Jamnagar and the money could be used for
that,” said Jagdish Meghnani, a Mumbai-based oil and gas
analyst at Alchemy Share & Stock Brokers.  Ambani, 54, is the world’s ninth-richest man with an
estimated wealth of $27 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Reliance has $14.2 billion of debt outstanding maturing through
2097, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mumbai-based Reliance sold $1 billion of 10-year 4.5
percent dollar-denominated notes and $500 million of 30-year
6.25 percent bonds in October, Bloomberg data show.  Investment Plans  The company plans to invest as much as $30 billion over the
next five years in its businesses, the  Press Trust of India  said
Feb 16, citing a presentation made by the company at an investor
conference hosted by Bank of America Corp.  Reliance missed analysts’ earnings estimates for the fifth
time in six quarters on April 21 after natural gas production
from the nation’s biggest deposit declined.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 rose 14
percent to 53.8 billion rupees ($1.2 billion), or 16.40 rupees a
share, from 47.1 billion rupees, or 14.40 rupees, a year
earlier. The average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was 54.3 billion rupees.  Output of gas from the KG-D6 field declined because of
falling pressure and eroded earnings from refining, which was
boosted by a 20 percent surge in average crude prices in the
quarter from a year earlier.
