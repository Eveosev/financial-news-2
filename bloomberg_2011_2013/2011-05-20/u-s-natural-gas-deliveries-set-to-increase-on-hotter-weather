Natural gas shipments to U.S. power
plants were set to increase for a fifth day as hotter-than-
normal weather boosts demand for gas-fired electricity.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation gained 3.6 percent to 13.5 million dekatherms (13.1
billion cubic feet) from yesterdayâ€™s 13 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 4 p.m. in  New York .  Gas deliveries to Florida power plants advanced 6.1 percent
to 2.72 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 declined 6.96 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
$4.0638 per million British thermal units on the
 Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, dropped 4.75
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.0513. The hub is the benchmark for
gas futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The weather will be hotter than normal through May 24 in
the U.S. East and South, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in Jacksonville, Florida, tomorrow may
be 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The city had a high of 84 degrees yesterday.  U.S. nuclear-power production fell for the first time in
four days. Power generation nationwide decreased by 425
megawatts from yesterday to 78,641 megawatts, or 77 percent of
capacity, according to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission report
today and data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
