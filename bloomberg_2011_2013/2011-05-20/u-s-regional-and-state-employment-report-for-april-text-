The following is the text of the U.S.
state employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Regional and state unemployment rates were generally little
changed or slightly lower in April. Thirty-nine states recorded
unemployment rate decreases, three states and the  District of
Columbia  registered rate increases, and eight states had no rate
change, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.
Forty-six states and the District of Columbia posted
unemployment rate decreases from a year earlier, three states
reported increases, and one state had no change. The national
jobless rate edged up by 0.2 percentage point between March and
April to 9.0 percent, but was 0.8 point lower than a year
earlier.  In April nonfarm payroll employment increased in 42 states
and the District of Columbia and decreased in 8 states. The
largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in New
York (+45,700), followed by  Texas  (+32,900),  Pennsylvania 
(+23,700),  Massachusetts  (+19,500), and  Florida  (+14,900).
 Nebraska  experienced the largest over-the-month percentage
increase in employment (+0.9 percent), followed by Kansas and
 Oklahoma  (+0.8 percent each) and  Louisiana  and New Hampshire
(+0.7 percent each). The largest over-the-month decrease in
employment occurred in  Michigan  (-10,200), followed by Minnesota
(-5,200),  South Carolina  (-3,800),  Indiana  (-2,500), and Vermont
(-2,200). Vermont experienced the largest over-the-month
percentage decline in employment (-0.7 percent), followed by
Michigan (-0.3 percent), and Idaho, Minnesota, and South
Carolina (-0.2 percent each). Over the year, nonfarm employment
increased in 46 states and the District of Columbia and
decreased in 4 states. The largest over-the-year percentage
increase occurred in  North Dakota  (+3.9 percent), followed by
Alaska and Texas (+2.5 percent each) and Nebraska (+1.9 percent).
The four states reporting over-the-year percentage declines in
employment were  New Jersey  (-0.2 percent), and  Nevada , New
Mexico, and South Dakota (less than -0.1 percent each).  Changes to Current Employment Statistics Data  With the release of preliminary April 2011 data, state and
area nonfarm employment estimates incorporate net business
birth/death adjustment factors estimated on a quarterly basis,
replacing the previous practice of estimating the factors
annually. This allows the state and area      nonfarm employment
estimates to incorporate information from the Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages into the net birth/death adjustment
factors as soon as it becomes available and thereby improve the
factors.  Regional Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  The West reported the highest regional unemployment rate in
April, 10.4 percent, while the Northeast and Midwest recorded
the lowest rates, 8.0 and 8.1 percent, respectively. Over the
month, all four regions experienced statistically significant
jobless rate declines, the largest of which was recorded in the
West (-0.3 percentage point). All four regions also registered
significant rate decreases from a year earlier: the Midwest (-
1.6 percentage points), Northeast (-0.8 point), West (-0.7
point), and South (-0.6 point).  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued
to report the highest jobless rate, 11.1 percent in April. The
West North Central again registered the lowest rate, 6.8 percent.
Three divisions experienced statistically significant
unemployment rate changes from a month earlier, all of which
were decreases: the Mountain (-0.4 percentage point) and Pacific
and South Atlantic (-0.2 point each). No division had a
statistically significant over-the-month rate increase. Over the
year, six divisions posted significant rate decreases, the
largest of which was in the East North Central (-2.1 percentage
points). No division experienced an unemployment rate increase
from a year earlier.  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to register the highest unemployment rate
among the states, 12.5 percent in April.  California  recorded the
next highest rate, 11.9 percent. North Dakota reported the
lowest jobless rate, 3.3 percent, followed by Nebraska, 4.2
percent, and  New Hampshire  and South Dakota, 4.9 percent each.
In total 24 states posted jobless rates significantly lower than
the U.S. figure of 9.0 percent, 7 states recorded measurably
higher rates, and 19 states and the District of Columbia had
rates that were not appreciably different from that of the
nation.  Nevada experienced the largest over-the-month unemployment
rate decrease in April (-0.7 percentage point), followed by New
Mexico and Oklahoma (-0.5 point each). Fifteen other states also
posted statistically significant rate declines from March. The
remaining 32 states and the District of Columbia registered
jobless rates that were not measurably different from those of a
month earlier, though some had changes that were at least as
large numerically as the significant changes.  Michigan recorded the largest jobless rate decrease from
April 2010 (-2.9 percentage points). Three other states had rate
decreases of more than 2.0 percentage points: Nevada (-2.4
points), Indiana (-2.3 points), and  Illinois  (-2.1 points).
Sixteen additional states had smaller but also statistically
significant decreases over the year. The remaining 30 states and
the District of Columbia registered unemployment rates that were
not appreciably different from those of a year earlier.  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Over the month, 19 states recorded statistically
significant changes in employment. The largest over-the-month
statistically significant job gains occurred in  New York 
(+45,700), Texas (+32,900), Pennsylvania (+23,700), and
Massachusetts (+19,500). Two states experienced statistically
significant over-the-month declines in employment: Michigan (-
10,200) and Vermont (-2,200).  Over the year, 23 states experienced statistically
significant changes in employment, all of which were increases.
The largest increase occurred in Texas (+254,400), followed by
California (+144,200), Pennsylvania (+80,000), Ohio (+67,000),
and Illinois (+66,600).  The Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment news
