The U.K. said it is reviewing its
relations with Malawi, including the Department for
International Aid’s support program for the southern African
nation.  “New aid commitments are on hold while this review takes
place,” DFID said in e-mailed statement today from Lilongwe,
the capital. DFID spokesman Rob Kelly refused to comment further
in an e-mailed note.  Malawi expelled the British High Commissioner from the
country last month after he described President Bingu wa
Mutharika as combative and autocratic in a leaked memo. U.K.
Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said the decision was
“unacceptable and unwarranted” and expelled Malawi’s chief
diplomat in retaliation.  Calls to Malawi’s foreign ministry offices weren’t answered
when Bloomberg sought comment today, though Finance Minister Ken Kandodo said in a telephone interview that Malawi would “have
to make spending cuts that don’t affect economic growth.”  Kandodo refused to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
