Sub-Saharan Africa stocks may gain
more than equities of  South Africa , which has more moderate
economic growth, according to  Old Mutual Global Index Trackers ,
an asset-management affiliate of Old Mutual Plc.  South Africa’s growth potential is limited by its 25
percent unemployment rate, said Tendai Musikavanhu, Chief
Executive Officer of  Old Mutual Global Index Trackers .  South Africa’s high jobless rate “naturally dilutes any
growth you can get,” Boston-based Musikavanhu, a South African
who manages $6 billion of assets, said in a phone interview
yesterday. “That’s the South Africa story, moderate growth when
it should be explosive. It’s stable, it’s predictable and it’s
sophisticated on a relative basis.”  Economic growth of an annualized 4.4 percent in the fourth
quarter wasn’t sufficient to create jobs for school-leavers
seeking employment for the first time. The jobless rate rose to
25 percent in the first quarter from 24 percent at that end of
2010.  The S&P Pan-Africa ex-South Africa Capped 20% Net TR Index
has risen 16 percent since January 2009 and trades at 10.2 times
the average earnings of its 172 member companies, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  MSCI South Africa (MXZA)  Index has
advanced 40 percent in the same period and trades at a price-to-
earnings ratio of 16.5 times.  Infrastructure Boom  The  International Monetary Fund  estimates sub-Saharan
Africa’s economy will expand 5.5 percent this year and 5.9
percent in 2012, and that seven of the world’s 10 fastest-
growing economies in the next five years will come from the
region. South Africa’s central bank cut its 2011 economic growth
forecast to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent and left its estimate
for 2012 at 3.9 percent, Governor Gill Marcus said May 12.  Africa is benefiting from “a huge infrastructural boom,”
Musikavanhu said. “You’ve got the uprooting of corruption, the
whole commodity boom. The financial sector boom is quite
interesting.”  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index fell 0.4 percent to
31,794.13 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index gained 0.3 percent to 25,790.64
by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according to a statement on the
bourse’s website.  Kenya ’s All-Share Index fell 0.5 percent to
75.39 at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest level since
April 29.  More Than  India   The number of families in the entire continent of Africa
with incomes of more than $20,000 a year exceeds India’s,
according to a report by McKinsey & Co. published a year ago.
McKinsey said sub-Saharan Africa had a population of 1 billion
in 2009. India has 1.2 billion people, Bloomberg data show.  Africa’s gross domestic product excluding the effects of
inflation expanded by 4.9 percent a year from 2000 through 2008,
more than twice the pace of the 1980s and 1990s, McKinsey said.
Sales of state assets contributed to a boom in foreign direct
investment in  Africa  to $62 billion in 2008 from $9 billion in
2000, McKinsey said.  Nigeria sold more than 116 state-owned businesses to
investors between 1999 and 2006, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
