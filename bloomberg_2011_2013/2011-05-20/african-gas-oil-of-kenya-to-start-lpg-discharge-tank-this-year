African Gas & Oil Co., a Kenyan-based
fuel importer, plans to start operating a 14,000 metric-ton
liquefied petroleum gas discharge tank in the port city of
Mombasa by year-end, Managing Director Ezra Pakter said.  The container will be attached to a 5,000-meter (16,405-
feet), 12-inch pipeline linked to a distribution centre, and
then transported on trucks or by railway, Pakter said in an
interview in Nairobi,  Kenya ’s capital, today. The second stage
of the company’s $125 million plan is to build 16 storage
facilities with the capacity to hold 28,000 tons of LPG, he said.  African Gas & Oil Co. sold 103,889 metric tons of LPG in
Kenya last year, in addition to 5,010 tons to surrounding
countries, an increase of 12.2 percent from the previous year,
Pakter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
