Lonmin Plc (LMI)  said it obtained a court
interdict to compel all striking workers at its Karee operation
in South Africa to resume duty.  “Failure to comply with this interdict may result in 
disciplinary action being taken,” Lonmin said in an e-mailed
statement today. Karee contributes about 30 percent of Lonmin’s
underground output, the company said.  Members of the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike
during the night shift of May 17 to force the chairman of the
labor union’s Karee office to stand down, NUM spokesman  Lesiba
Seshoka  said earlier today, adding that workers will resume
duties by May 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
