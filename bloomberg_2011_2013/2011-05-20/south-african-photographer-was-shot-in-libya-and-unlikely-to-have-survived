South African photographer, Anton
Hammerl, was shot by forces of Libyan leader,  Muammar Qaddafi ,
in a remote desert region of that country on April 5 and
sustained injuries that would have made it impossible for him to
survive without medical attention, his family said.  Libyan forces had informed the family since Hammerl went
missing in the country that they had captured him, the family
said in a posting on the Free Photographer Anton Hammerl page on
Facebook.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
