Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  said the equivalent
of about 17,000 barrels a day of oil production has been
affected by the closure of a pipeline due to fires in northern
Alberta.  Supplies of oil and liquids are being trucked to facilities
in Saskatchewan and British Columbia,  Graham White , a spokesman
for the Calgary-based company, said in a statement. Husky is
transporting about 4,500 barrels a day to its refinery in
Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, and 2,000 barrels a day to
processing facilities in Taylor, British Columbia.  Oil companies have been forced to shut or curtail
production in the Slave Lake area of northern Alberta since
wildfires forced the closure of Plains All American Pipeline
LP’s Rainbow pipeline May 15. There are 59 wildfires burning in
 Alberta  as of today, of which 14 are out of control, the
province’s Sustainable Resources Department said.  Husky said its facilities aren’t threatened by the fires
and it expects to maintain its production guidance for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
