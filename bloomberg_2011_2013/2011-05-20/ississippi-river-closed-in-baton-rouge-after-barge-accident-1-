A portion of the  Mississippi River 
near  Baton Rouge ,  Louisiana , was closed to marine traffic today
after a barge accident, the U.S. Coast Guard said in a release.  A vessel was pushing 20 barges of grain under the
southbound lanes of the U.S. 190 bridge at about 1:30 p.m. local
time when one collided with a moored barge, Coast Guard Senior
Chief Michael O’Berry said in a telephone interview. Three of
the grain-carrying barges sank and a fourth broke free and was
corralled on the river, he said.  The bridge was closed but reopened within minutes after
being cleared by inspectors, O’Berry said. There have been no
reports of injuries or pollution and the river remains closed to
traffic in the area, he said.  High water levels have hampered navigation along the river.
The Coast Guard closed the river May 14 after four barges broke
away from moorings and struck the same bridge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
