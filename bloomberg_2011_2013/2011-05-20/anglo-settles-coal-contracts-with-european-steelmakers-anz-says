Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a diversified
mining and natural resources company, agreed to a 4.5 percent
cut in contract prices for hard coking coal with European steel
mills, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  European steelmakers will pay $315 a metric ton for three-
month contracts starting July 1, Mark Pervan, head of commodity
research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Melbourne,
said in an e-mailed note today, without stating where he got the
information. Japanese mills are “holding out” for lower prices,
Pervan said.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  of Japan agreed to pay Rio Tinto Group a
record $330 a ton for three-month contracts starting April 1
after heavy rain and flooding in  Australia  shut mines and curbed
output from the world’s biggest exporter of the fuel. The talks
ended before a magnitude-9 quake hit the country on March 11,
halting some steel output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
