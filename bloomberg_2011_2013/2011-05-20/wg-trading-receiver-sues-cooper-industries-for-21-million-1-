The receiver in charge of liquidating
WG Trading Co., the company allegedly used in a  Ponzi scheme  by
former managers  Paul Greenwood  and Steven Walsh, sued to recover
$21 million in profit from a Cooper Industries Inc. trust.  Robb Evans & Associates, the receiver, claimed in a
complaint filed in  Manhattan  federal court today that the Cooper
Industries Inc. Master Trust for Defined Benefit Plans paid
$140.1 million into WG Trading and received a total of $161.9 in
return.  Greenwood and Walsh were indicted in July 2009 on charges
that they conspired to defraud investors of $554 million. The
U.S. said the scheme stretched from 1996 until the men were
arrested in February 2009. Greenwood pleaded guilty to six
charges, including conspiracy and securities fraud. Walsh has
pleaded not guilty.  The receiver is trying to recover the excess payments for
the benefit of WG Trading creditors.  Jeff Krakoff, a spokesman for Houston-based Cooper
Industries, didnâ€™t immediately return a voice-mail message
seeking comment on the suit.  The case is Robb Evans & Associates v. State Street Bank &
Trust Co., 11-CV-3478, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
