European  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly improved in May after the euro-region economy
gathered strength and companies stepped up hiring.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
rose to minus 9.7 from minus 11.6 in April, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today. That’s
the highest since November. Economists forecast a drop to minus
12, the median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Euro-region growth accelerated more than economists
forecast in the first quarter as companies boosted spending to
meet rising export demand. Unemployment held at 9.9 percent in
March, the lowest in more than a year.  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA,
the French maker of Birkin handbags, on May 11 reported first-
quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
