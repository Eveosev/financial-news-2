Lithuaniaâ€™s unemployment rate rose in
the first quarter as more young people were out of work, a
labor-force survey showed.  The rate increased to 17.2 percent from 17.1 percent in the
previous three months, the Vilnius-based  statistics office  said
in an e-mailed statement today. The rate was 18.1 percent in the
first quarter of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
