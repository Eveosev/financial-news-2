The forint depreciated the most
against the Swiss franc in two months after Hungarian lenders
and the government agreed to fix exchange rates on foreign
currency-denominated household mortgage loans.  The Hungarian currency weakened 2.1 percent to 216.154 per
franc by 4:04 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest intraday decline
since March 15. The forint slumped 0.8 percent against the euro
to 269.05.  Lenders will fix the  exchange rate  at 180 forint per Swiss
franc for either 3 years or 3 1/2 years, Janos Muller, the chief
adviser of the countryâ€™s Banking Association, said by phone
today. The rate for euro- and yen-denominated mortgages will
also be fixed, he said, without giving a rate. A final decision
will be made by May 24.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
