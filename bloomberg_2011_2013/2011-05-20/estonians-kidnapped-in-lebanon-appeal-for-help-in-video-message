Estonian citizens kidnapped in
Lebanon in March appealed for help in a video message received
by the country’s Foreign Ministry yesterday.  "This is really hard for us," said one of the seven
Estonians in the  video  broadcast over the Internet, adding it
was recorded on May 16. "We are very tired and in great danger."
He asked relatives and other people who know the kidnapped to
push the Estonian government to help free them.  The Estonians, travelling in eastern Lebanon on bicycles,
were kidnapped on March 23, according to a Foreign Ministry
statement the next day. No information has been released on who
took them captive. They appealed for help to the authorities in
Lebanon,  Saudi Arabia , Jordan and  France  in a video broadcast by
Al Arabiya television and LBC TV on April 20.  The message didn’t include any conditions for the release
of the captives, nor any demands, similarly to the previous
video. The Estonian government will continue efforts to free the
kidnapped in cooperation with Lebanese authorities and other
partners, the ministry said in an e-mail today.  The kidnapping was carried out by armed assailants in two
vans and a dark-colored Mercedes without license plates who
ambushed the group, Lebanon’s official National News Agency said
in March. Their bicycles were found in the industrial zone of
the eastern city of Zahleh, the Lebanese military said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
