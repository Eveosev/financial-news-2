What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of
Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that
recent price gains may slow demand, while rain in the next week
may improve growth prospects for dry crops in Europe, said  Jason Britt , the president of brokerage Central States Commodities
Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri.  -- Corn futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel lower on the
CBOT on concern that price gains this week may slow purchases by
investors and processors, Britt said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that consumption of U.S. supplies will
ease, Britt said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
steady to 0.5 cent a pound higher, while soybean-meal futures
may open down $1.50 to $2 per 2,000 pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
