Cyprus’s cabinet approved a joint
venture with Qatar for the construction of a hotel, shopping,
office and apartment complex in the capital Nicosia, government

direct contribution by Qatar and also a contribution through the
sale of properties,” Stefanou told reporters, according to an
e-mailed transcript of his statement today.  The Cyprus government will contribute the land for the
venture, the spokesman said, without specifying its value.  Cyprus and Qatar started negotiating over the emirate’s
contribution after signing an initial agreement on April 21,

hotel with of 200 to 220 rooms, was estimated at more than $150
