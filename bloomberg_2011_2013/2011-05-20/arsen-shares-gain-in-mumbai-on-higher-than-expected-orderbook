Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) ,  India ’s largest
engineering company, had the biggest two-day gain in three
months in Mumbai after its orderbook increased more than some
analysts expected and quarterly profit reached a record.  Larsen rose 3.6 percent to 1,652.25 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close of trading in the city. The stock gained 9.6 percent in
the past two days, the biggest jump since the same period ended
Feb. 14. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock
Exchange gained 1 percent today.  The builder’s orderbook rose to 1.3 trillion rupees ($29
billion) in the year ended in March, while fourth-quarter profit
reached a record 16.9 billion rupees, Mumbai-based Larsen said
yesterday. The company expects orders to increase as much as 20
percent this year, Chairman A. M. Naik said, as economic growth
in India spurs spending on roads, bridges and power plants.  “Order inflows came in significantly higher than our
expectations,” Suhas Harinarayanan, an analyst at Religare
Capital Markets Ltd. wrote in a note to clients yesterday. He
raised the rating on Larsen to “buy” from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
