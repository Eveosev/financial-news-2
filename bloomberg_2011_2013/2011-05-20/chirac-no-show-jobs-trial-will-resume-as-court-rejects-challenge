Former French President  Jacques Chirac ’s no-show jobs trial can resume after  France ’s highest
appeals court said charges against his co-defendants don’t
warrant a constitutional review.  Chirac’s former chief of staff, from his time as mayor of
Paris, had argued it was unconstitutional that freezing the
statute of limitations for Chirac, while he served as president,
meant those limits were frozen for his co-defendants as well.  “These questions were not of a serious nature” as the
statute of limitations in question “wasn’t based on any
fundamental principle, nor on any constitutional-level rule,”
and weren’t novel enough to warrant a Constitutional Council
review, the Cour de Cassation said today of its decision.  Hearings were suspended on the second day of Chirac’s trial
in March to await the ruling on the challenge by one of his nine
co-defendants. The case, the result of two probes being merged
together, concerns claims city funds were used to pay Chirac
loyalists to do work for his political party. The case was put
on hold after he became president in 1995, because French law
blocks investigation of a serving head of state for crimes other
than treason.  The criminal court will reconvene in June to discuss timing
for resumption of the trial. The challenge wouldn’t affect the
case against the 78-year-old Chirac, Judge  Dominique Pauthe  said
in announcing the suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
