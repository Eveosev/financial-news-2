Peru ’s miners will begin a national
strike on May 30 to pressure Congress to pass legislation on
workers’ benefits, a union leader said.  Miners want lawmakers to boost pensions and their share of
profits to 10 percent from 8 percent, said  Luis Castillo ,
general secretary of the Federation of Mining and Steel Workers.
The group represents 28,000 workers and 70 unions.  “Most unions have already voted in favor of the strike,”
Castillo said today in a telephone interview. “This decision is
irreversible unless Congress makes a clear stand on this once
and for all.”  Miners in Peru, the world’s third-largest copper and zinc
producer, have held three national strikes in the past three
years to seek a bigger share of record earnings after both
copper and gold rose to records. Copper has almost doubled in
the past two years, while gold reached a record $1,577.40 an
ounce on May 2.  Congresswoman Cecilia Chacon, head of the congressional
Energy & Mines Committee, didn’t immediately return a telephone
call and an e-mail to her office seeking comment.  Copper futures for July delivery rose 2.1 percent to
$4.1360 a pound at 12:13 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange ’s Comex division, while gold fell 0.2 percent to
$1,492.40 an ounce. Zinc for delivery in three months increased
$30, or 1.4 percent, to $2,165 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
