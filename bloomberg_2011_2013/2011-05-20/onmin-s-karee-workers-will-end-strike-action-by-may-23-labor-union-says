Striking workers at  Lonmin Plc (LON) ’s 
Karee operation in  South Africa  should be back at work by May 23
after the  National Union of Mineworkers  resolves an internal
dispute that has curbed platinum output, the labor union said.  Members of the NUM are boycotting work in an effort to
force the chairman of its Karee office to stand down, spokesman
 Lesiba Seshoka  said by mobile phone today. The official’s term
has come to an end and workers want new elections, he said.  “It’s not an organized strike to protest” about
grievances at the mine, Seshoka said. “There have been some
differences among the branch leadership. We have sent our
regional leadership there to talk to them.”  Production at Karee, which contributes about 30 percent of
Lonmin’s underground output, has been disrupted by the strike
since the night shift of May 17, the company said in an e-mailed
statement earlier today. Karee, part of Lonmin’s  Marikana 
operation, produced about 4.1 million metric tons of ore last
year, according to its website.  Shares in Lonmin, the world’s third-largest platinum
producer, were up 0.4 percent at 1,544 pence as of 12:35 p.m. in
 London , giving the company a value of 3.13 billion pounds ($5.1
billion). Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Impala Platinum Ltd.
are the largest producers of the metal, used in jewelry and in
devices to reduce vehicle emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
