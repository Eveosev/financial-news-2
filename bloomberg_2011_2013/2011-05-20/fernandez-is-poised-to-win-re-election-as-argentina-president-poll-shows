Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  could win re-election in a first-round
vote, according to a May poll which shows her with more than
twice as much support as her nearest opponent.  Fernandez, who hasn’t said whether she’ll be a candidate in
the Oct. 23 election, has 48 percent support among voters
compared with 19 percent for lawmaker Ricardo Alfonsin,
according to a poll by CEOP Opinion Publica. Alfonsin is the son
of former President Raul Alfonsin, who helped lead  Argentina  out
of a military dictatorship in 1983.  South America’s second-biggest economy has expanded by an
average of 5.6 percent per year since Fernandez, 58, took office
in December 2007, below the 8.8 percent per year pace from 2003-
2007, when her late husband,  Nestor Kirchner , ran the country.
The economy grew 9.2 percent in 2010, the most in  Latin America 
alongside Peru.  The  unemployment rate  fell in the first quarter to 7.4
percent from 8.3 percent in the same period last year, the
national statistics institute reported today.  “Because of the economy, people are happy and satisfied
and employment has risen,” said Roberto Bacman, head of the
Buenos Aires-based pollster. “Argentina didn’t suffer because
of the international global crisis and has a forecast of
growth.”  Under Argentine law, a candidate can win the election and
avoid a runoff by garnering 40 percent of the vote and a 10
percentage point lead over the nearest competitor.  Of those surveyed, 63.4 percent said they have a positive
image of Fernandez, up from 49.9 percent a year earlier,
according to CEOP. Political parties will hold mandatory primary
elections on Aug. 14.  The poll of 1,000 people was taken May 8-11 survey of 1,000
people and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
