paid more in passenger vehicle insurance premiums and for
air transportation.  Food prices rose 3.3% in the 12 months to April,
identical to the increase in March. Consumers paid more
for meat (+5.5%), bakery products (+6.7%) and dairy

ending in March. Prices for food purchased from
restaurants rose 2.8%.  Shelter costs rose 2.3% in the 12 months to April. In
addition to higher prices for electricity and  fuel oil ,

and  New Brunswick  following provincial budget measures.  Clothing and footwear prices fell 1.1%, following a

clothing and men's clothing. Prices for footwear also
fell.  The provinces: Gasoline a major factor in every province  Consumer prices increased in every province in the 12
months to April. Large increases in gasoline prices were
observed in every province, ranging from 19.5% in Prince
 Edward Island  to 30.1% in Ontario.  For the fourth consecutive month, Nova Scotia recorded
the largest year-over-year increase in consumer prices.  In Ontario, consumer prices went up 3.6% in the 12
months to April, matching the rise in March. In addition

27.2% more for gasoline. Prices for fuel oil and meat also
rose.  Prices in British Columbia went up 2.7% in the 12
months to April, following a 3.1% increase in March.
Gasoline prices increased 19.8%. Consumers in the province
also paid more for food purchased from restaurants, but
less for natural gas.  In  Alberta , prices advanced 3.0% following a 2.0%
increase in March. The faster increase in April was
primarily the result of a 59.6% gain in electricity
prices. The large year-over-year increase in electricity
costs in the province is partly explained by the fact that
electricity prices in April 2010 were among the lowest
recorded since 2005. As well, the recent closing of two
power generation plants resulted in a significant
reduction of electricity supply. Alberta consumers also
paid more for gasoline (+24.0%).  The Bank of Canada's core index  The Bank of Canada's core index advanced 1.6% in the 12
months to April, following a 1.7% rise in March.  The seasonally adjusted monthly core index increased
0.2% in April, after rising 0.5% in March.  Note to readers  On June 29, 2011, with the release of the May Consumer
Price Index (CPI), the basket of goods and services used
in the calculation of the CPI will be updated. For more
information, refer to "Consumer Price Index: A preview of
the upcoming basket update," which was published in The
Daily of May 4, 2011.  The special aggregate energy includes: electricity,
natural gas, fuel oil and other fuels, gasoline, and fuel,
parts and supplies for recreational vehicles.  The Bank of Canada's core index excludes eight of the
CPI's most volatile components (fruit, fruit preparations
and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage
interest cost; natural gas; heating oil and other fuels;
gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products
and smokers' supplies) as well as the effects of changes
in indirect taxes on the remaining components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
