Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, has shifted as much as 2 megawatts of annual
production to the south Asian nation from its  Repower Systems AG (RPW) 
unit in higher-cost Germany in a bid to improve profit margins.  Hamburg-based Repower has begun filling orders at Suzlon’s
new plant in the southern Indian city of Mangalore, Suzlon
Chairman Tulsi Tanti told analysts in a conference call this
week. The equipment includes turbine blades and nacelles, which
house the generators and gearboxes, Suzlon Chief Financial
Officer Robin Banerjee said in a telephone interview on May 14.  Repower declined to comment in response to e-mailed
questions. The company plans to increasingly shift output from
Europe to lower-cost centers in  Asia , including its supply of
gearboxes, aiming for a “double-digit” cost advantage, Repower
Chief Executive Officer Andreas Nauen said on Feb 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
