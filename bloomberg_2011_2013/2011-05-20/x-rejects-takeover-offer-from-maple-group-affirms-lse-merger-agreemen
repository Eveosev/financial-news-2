TMX Group Inc. (X)  said the proposal by
Maple Group Acquisition Corp. isn’t superior to its merger
agreement with  London Stock Exchange Group Plc. (LSE)   The Maple offer changes control of TMX, has a “significant
increase in leverage” and lacks information about ways to
expand, TMX said in a statement.  TMX said the merger with the London Stock Exchange is still
in the best interests of the company and shareholders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
