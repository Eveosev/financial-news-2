The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
rise 12 percent to 1,490 by the end of 2011 after “sharp
pullbacks” as corporate profits and a weak dollar outweigh the
credit-crisis “hangover,” Dahlman Rose & Co. said.  Companies in the  S&P 500  will earn $99 a share for 2011,
according to Brian Rauscher, the New York-based chief portfolio
strategist at Dahlman Rose, in initiating his price and earnings
estimates for the benchmark gauge. The average of 13 analyst
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg is for the S&P 500 to end the
year at 1,404, with per-share profit of $95.61.  “We expect the U.S. equity markets to chop higher for the
remainder of 2011,” Rauscher said in a note dated May 18. “The
tepid fundamental backdrop and continued hangover from the
credit crisis will likely be trumped by the continuation of
supportive liquidity and financial conditions, a weak  U.S.
dollar  and further gains in U.S. corporate profits.”  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 1,335.77 as of 11:40 a.m.
in  New York . The gauge has advanced 6.2 percent this year as the
 Federal Reserve  purchased assets to boost the economy and
corporate earnings have beaten estimates. An index measuring the
U.S. dollar against six other currencies has retreated 4.4
percent so far in 2011 amid concern that stimulus measures are
weakening the currency.  Rauscher initiated energy, materials, consumer-staples and
health-care industry groups at “overweight” in the note. He
rated industrials, telecommunications and utilities companies
“neutral,” and recommended underweighting consumer-
discretionary, technology and financial shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
