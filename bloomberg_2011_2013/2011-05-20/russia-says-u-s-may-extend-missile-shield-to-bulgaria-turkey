Russia  is concerned the U.S. may
expand its planned missile shield in Poland and Romania to other
eastern European countries and Turkey, a senior military
official said.  “Russia is deeply concerned that after Poland and Romania,
elements of U.S. missile defense will emerge in the  Czech
Republic , Turkey, Bulgaria and some other NATO members,” the
deputy chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, told
foreign diplomats today in Moscow. “In the future, it may
create risks for Russian strategic nuclear forces.”  A U.S.  factsheet  on its proposed missile shield, published
May 3, mentions only Romania and Poland as sites where hardware
would be based. The U.S. embassy in Moscow declined to comment.  Russian leaders complain the shield, which the U.S. says is
needed to guard against threats from countries such as  Iran ,
will blunt their nuclear deterrent. They have warned of a new
arms race within the next decade unless the U.S. and its allies
agree to cooperate with Russia on missile defense.  Russia may quit a nuclear arms treaty with the U.S. if it
doesn’t get legally enforceable guarantees it won’t be targeted
by the shield, President  Dmitry Medvedev  said May 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
