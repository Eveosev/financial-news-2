The  Boston Bruins  defeated the Tampa
Bay Lightning 2-0 and lead their National Hockey League playoff
series by two games to one.  David Krejci scored one minute, nine seconds into the game
and Andrew Ference got the second goal midway through the third
period at St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida, last night.  The Lightning are seeking to reach the Stanley Cup finals
for the first time since 2004, when they won the NHL title for
the only time in the franchiseâ€™s 18 seasons. The Bruins have
lost five times in the championship series, most recently in
1990, since they won the latest of their five Stanley Cup titles
in 1972.  The teams reconvene in Tampa for Game 4 tomorrow before
returning to Boston for a fifth game on May 23.  The winner of the best-of-seven-game Eastern Conference
finals will play the  San Jose Sharks  or  Vancouver Canucks  in the
Stanley Cup finals. That series resumes tonight in San Jose with
the Canucks leading 2-0.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
