Japanese stocks fell for a second day,
led by  utility companies  as uncertainty about the outlook for
Japan’s energy industry increased ahead of Tokyo Electric Power
Co. announcing its full-year profit plunged.  Kansai Electric Power Co. slumped 4.9 percent, leading
declines on the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s
largest energy exploration company, retreated 4 percent after
 oil prices  dropped yesterday.  Taiheiyo Cement Corp. (5233) , a cement
maker, declined 1.9 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its
rating on the company.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent to 9,607.08 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix index dropped 0.5
percent to 827.77 with about three stocks retreating for every
two that rose. For the week, the Nikkei has decreased 0.4
percent, while the Topix is down 1.5 percent.  “There are too many unclear negative factors,” including
the government’s scheme for compensation for the nuclear issues
and overhaul of the nation’s energy industry, said  Tsutomu Yamada , a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“People are selling utility shares on speculation and rumors.”  The Topix has lost 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies. Shares in the gauge traded at 0.94
times estimated book value.  The utility known as Tepco reported after the close that it
had a full-year net loss of 1.25 trillion yen ($15 billion), the
biggest loss by a Japanese company in eight years, following the
Fukushima nuclear accident. President Masataka Shimizu will
resign, the company said in a statement today.  Previous Massive Losses  Tepco’s loss eclipsed the 812 billion yen deficit reported
by  Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (9432)  in the year ended March
2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. (8411) ’s 2.38 trillion yen loss the following year holds the
record.  Utilities were the heaviest drag on the Topix index among
the 33 industry groups ahead of Tepco’s earnings announcement
after the Yomiuri newspaper reported the company may report a
record 1.5 trillion yen loss. Kansai Electric sank 4.9 percent
to 1,331 yen, and Chubu Electric Power Co. lost 4.7 percent to
1,222 yen, the lowest levels since 1985. Tepco gained 2.5
percent to 367 yen after plunging as much as 8.9 percent.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said on May 18 that Japan will
debate an overhaul of the nation’s energy industry, where
companies currently hold regional monopolies and are in charge
of both power generation and distribution networks.  BOJ Decision  The Bank of  Japan ’s policy board unanimously voted to
maintain monetary policy even after a report yesterday showed
the country slipped into a recession following a record
earthquake. The Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his eight
colleagues decided to maintain a 30-trillion yen credit program
and a 10-trillion yen asset-purchase fund that represent the
bank’s main policy tools. Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura
dropped his call made last month to expand asset purchases to
provide more stimulus. The key overnight rate was kept at zero
to 0.1 percent.  “It was disappointing there was nothing new from the
BOJ,” said Masayoshi Yano, a senior market analyst at Tokyo-
based Meiwa Securities Co. “I thought the BOJ would make some
decisions after the worse-than-expected GDP figures.”  Inpex lost 4 percent to 532,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the second-biggest oil driller, sank 2.4
percent to 3,625 yen.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest
commodities trader, dropped 1.3 percent to 2,032 yen.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled 1.7 percent to $98.44 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
declined 1.7 percent yesterday.  Cement makers retreated following downgrades by Credit
Suisse Group. Taiheiyo Cement fell 1.9 percent to 152 yen.
Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co. declined 2.3 percent to 216 yen.  -- Editors:  John McCluskey .  To contact the reporters on this story:
