DCP Midstream LLC shut a pipeline
feeding its natural gas processing plant at Goldsmith,  Texas ,
after a 15-foot section of the line went “missing,” according
to a  notice  filed with state environmental regulators.  The 8-inch wide pipeline, which delivers 7 million to 8
million cubic feet of gas daily, will likely be shut in for 48
hours before repairs begin, Roz Elliot, a spokeswoman for DCP,
said in an interview. She declined to elaborate on the notice.  The missing section caused a leak in Winkler County, Texas,
at about 8:30 a.m. local time that was blocked in by a field
operator, DCP said in its notice. The company is investigating
the incident.  DCP Midstream is a joint venture of  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and
Spectra Energy Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
