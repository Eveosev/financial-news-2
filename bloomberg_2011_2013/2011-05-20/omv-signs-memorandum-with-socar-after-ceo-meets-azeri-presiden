OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, signed a memorandum of understanding with the State Oil
Co. of Azerbaijan this week when Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss met Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  in Baku.  The memorandum focused on “enhanced cooperation” between
OMV and the State Oil Co., also known as Socar, OMV said in an
e-mailed statement today, adding that the talks with Aliyev
centered on OMV’s “potential investment plans in the country.”  In the meeting, which took place on May 18, Socar President
Rovnag Abdullayev and Roiss discussed the “ prospects for
cooperation in the extraction, transportation and marketing of
oil and gas,” Socar said in a separate  statement .  OMV is in negotiations with the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz
venture in  Azerbaijan  on long-term natural gas supply for
transport from the  Caspian region  via  Turkey  to Europe. OMV is
part of the 7.9 billion-euro ($11.3 billion) Nabucco pipeline
project, which aims to deliver gas to Europe bypassing  Russia .
The plan is supported by the U.S. and European Union.  “Azerbaijan is one of the key countries to deliver natural
gas to cover the growing demand in Europe,” Roiss said in the
statement. “As part of the Nabucco consortium, OMV is looking
forward to concluding first supply contracts and increase its
gas business in this country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
