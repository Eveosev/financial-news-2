Oil rose for the second time this
week, following heating oil, after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported that fuel consumption increased in April as
economic growth bolstered demand for diesel by truckers.  Oil gained 1.1 percent as the API reported total deliveries
of petroleum products, a measure of demand, climbed 5.2 percent
last month from a year earlier. Heating oil, a distillate fuel
like diesel and jet fuel, jumped 0.8 percent on the Nymex.
Refineries such as Valero Energy Corp.’s St. Charles refinery in
Norco,  Louisiana , are restarting after planned work.  “You’re going to have to see some strength in the crude
market because you’re starting to see more refineries come back
online,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and
research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “Demand will
probably be a little stronger than we expect.”  Crude oil for June delivery gained $1.05 to settle at
$99.49 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices fell
16 cents this week and have risen 46 percent in the past year.
The June contract expired at the close of Nymex floor trading.
July crude gained $1.17, or 1.2 percent, to $100.10 a barrel.  Brent crude  for July settlement rose 97 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $112.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange.  Fuel consumption increased to 19.9 million barrels a day
last month from a year earlier, the industry-funded API reported
today. The American Automobile Association said yesterday that
U.S. air travel will jump to the highest level since 2005 over
this month’s U.S. Memorial Day weekend, as road travel declines.  Holiday Travel  Memorial Day, which falls on May 30 this year, is the
beginning of the peak U.S. gasoline-consuming period, known as
summer driving season. It extends until Labor Day, which falls
on Sept. 5.  The number of air travelers during the holiday will jump 12
percent to 2.93 million, while trips by auto will fall by
100,000 to 30.9 million, according to a forecast by the AAA, the
biggest U.S. motoring organization. About 88 percent of
travelers will drive to their destination.  Heating oil for June delivery climbed 2.36 cents to settle
at $2.9183 a gallon on the Nymex. Gasoline for June delivery
rose 0.98 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.9358 a gallon.  U.S. refinery utilization advanced 1.5 percentage points in
the week ended May 13 to 83.2 percent, the highest level since
May 1, the Energy Department reported this week. Refinery
operations dropped to 79.4 percent in the week ended Feb. 18,
the lowest level in a year.  Valero said today it has started a 100,000-barrel-a-day
fluid catalytic cracker at its St. Charles refinery which shut
in February for work. BP Plc’s  Texas  City, Texas, refinery
returned to normal operations this week after a  power failure 
April 25. PBF Energy Co. LLC plans to start units at its
Delaware City, Delaware, plant, people with knowledge of the
operations said yesterday.  Al-Qaeda Network  Oil also rose after the U.S. Homeland Security Department
said the al-Qaeda terrorist network is interested in targeting
the country’s oil and gas infrastructure, though there is no
“specific or imminent” threat, said Matt Chandler, a
department spokesman.  Oil tumbled as much as 2.5 percent in earlier trading as
the German Bundesbank said growth in Europe’s largest economy
will probably slow, and the euro’s weakness against the dollar
curbed the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  Euro Drops  Oil’s decline tracked a drop in the euro that began around
9:30 a.m. in  New York . Crude tumbled more than $2 a barrel to an
intraday low of $95.99 a barrel during the next half hour.  The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.4216 at 2:49 p.m. in New
York.  “The market is taking its cues from the dollar,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It doesn’t seem to be able to
hold onto gains above $100.”  The euro dropped after the Bundesbank statement prompted
traders to reduce bets the  European Central Bank  will increase
 interest rates . It extended losses after  Fitch Ratings  said it
would consider an extension of the maturities of existing Greek
government bonds to be a “default event.”  Crude oil may rise next week amid higher fuel demand in the
U.S., a Bloomberg News survey showed. Eighteen of 43 analysts,
or 42 percent, forecast oil will increase through May 27.
Fifteen respondents, or 35 percent, predicted prices will
decline and 10 projected little change.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 586,029
contracts as of 2:50 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 618,965
contracts yesterday, 13 percent below the average of the past
three months and the lowest level since May 4. Open interest was
1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
