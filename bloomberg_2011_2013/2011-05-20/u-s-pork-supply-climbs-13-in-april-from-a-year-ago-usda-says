Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose
13 percent at the end of April from a year earlier, the
government said, as adverse weather and high prices reduced
demand.  Warehouses held 545.8 million pounds of pork on April
30, up from  483.71 million  a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Inventories fell 5 percent from the end of March.  Parts of the Midwest, including Illinois and  Missouri ,
received more than double the normal amount of rainfall in
the past 60 days, according to National Weather Service
 data . Wet weather curbs meat demand as fewer people grill
outdoors. Before today, wholesale-pork prices were up 11
percent in the past year, reaching 98.31 cents a pound on
May 16, the highest since at least October 1997, according
to the USDA.  “Greatly elevated pork prices and wet, chilly weather
over large parts of the Midwest may have limited pork usage
and forced product into freezers,”  Dan Vaught , the owner
of Vaught Futures Insights, said in an e-mailed note before
the report.  Hog futures for July settlement rose 0.05 cent to
91.625 cents a pound at 12:53 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained 10
percent in the past year.  As of April 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, rose 7.1 percent from a
year earlier to 53.2 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham rose 0.3 percent from a
year ago to 76.7 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of April were 18
percent larger than a year earlier at 744.3 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 20 percent to 442.8
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
