U.S. fuel demand rose in April as
economic growth bolstered consumption of diesel by truckers,
according to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed 5.2 percent to 19.9 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report.  “Product demand is growing, led by distillate,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the Washington-based API, said in a
telephone interview. “Trucking tonnage is clearly up and that’s
led to a big increase in diesel demand. Growth varies by sector,
because this is an uneven recovery.”  Total demand for distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 15 percent to 4.27 million barrels
a day. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 26 percent to average 3.42 million barrels a
day, the report showed. Heating-oil use surged 96 percent to
741,000 barrels a day.  Gasoline pump prices were up 6.6 percent in April from the
prior month, the report showed. Demand for the motor fuel
declined 2.2 percent to 8.91 million barrels a day from the same
month last year.  “Higher gasoline prices are damping demand,” Felmy said.
“This is just a price reaction.”  Jet-fuel use climbed 1.9 percent to an average 1.42 million
barrels a day last month compared with the same period in 2010.  U.S. crude-oil production slipped 0.5 percent to an average
5.47 million barrels a day. Output in the lower 48 states
dropped 0.6 percent to 4.83 million barrels a day. Alaskan
production increased 0.2 percent to 641,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
