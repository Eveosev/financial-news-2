South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably lower its forecast for
this seasonâ€™s harvest of the grain, a survey showed.  The Crop Estimates Committee may say farmers will reap 10.85
million metric tons of corn, down from 10.88 million last month,
according to the median estimate of 13 traders surveyed by
Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 10.6 million tons to 10.9
million tons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
