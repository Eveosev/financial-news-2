Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
will meet his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama on the sidelines of
the Group of Eight summit in France next week, a Kremlin
official said.  The official, who declined to be identified because he’s
not authorized to speak to the media, didn’t give further
details on the meeting.  Medvedev on May 18 warned that Russia may quit a nuclear-
arms treaty with the U.S. if the two sides can’t reach an
agreement on missile defense, provoking a return to Cold War
distrust. Russia wants guarantees that the proposed U.S.-led
missile shield in  Europe  won’t target it, Medvedev said.  The Russian government isn’t satisfied with U.S. assurances
that the shield will only guard against attacks by so-called
rogue states and wants the  U.S. Senate  to ratify a treaty
guaranteeing the system won’t be aimed at Russia’s nuclear
arsenal,  Dmitry Rogozin , the country’s envoy to NATO, said in a
May 6 interview.  President  Barack Obama  has sought to "reset" U.S.-Russian
relations, which sank to a post-Cold War low after the ex-Soviet
power’s war with Georgia in August 2008. Russia seeks to
capitalize on improved ties to attract foreign investment and
promote its bid to join the World Trade Organization.  Russia and the U.S. in February put into force the new
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each side’s
strategic warheads to 1,550, from the 2,200 allowed previously,
and sets a maximum of 800 land-, air- and sea-based launchers.
Either side has the right to withdraw from the treaty if
strategic parity is violated, Medvedev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
