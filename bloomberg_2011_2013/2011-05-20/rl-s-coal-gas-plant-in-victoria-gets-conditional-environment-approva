HRL Ltd. , a privately held Australian
electricity generator, got conditional approval to develop a
plant in Victoria state that will be powered by gas from brown
coal, the Environment Protection Authority said.  The  Environment Protection Authority , or EPA, approved
construction of a 300-megawatt plant by Duel Gas Pty, a
subsidiary of HRL, the department said in a statement today. The
company submitted a proposal for a 600-megawatt project, it
said. One megawatt can power about 1,000 Australian homes.  “The demonstration project is best practice for this type
of brown coal technology and will produce electricity with a
around a 30 percent improvement on current greenhouse gas
emissions from coal-fired power stations,” EPA Chief Executive
Officer John Merritt said in the statement.  The approval is reliant on the company submitting details
on how it will meet conditions prior to construction of the
plant, including additional measures to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions, the EPA said. An expansion of the power-station will
be reviewed once Duel Gas demonstrates successful operation of
the initial plant, the EPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
