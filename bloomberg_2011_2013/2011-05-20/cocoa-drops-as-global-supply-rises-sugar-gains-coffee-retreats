Cocoa fell to a four-month low in  New
York  amid signs that global supplies are rising. Sugar climbed,
while coffee dropped.  In the year started Oct. 1, cocoa demand will trail
production by 102,000 metric tons, Kona Haque, a London-based
analyst for Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. This year’s harvest in Ghana, the world’s biggest
producer after  Ivory Coast , will reach a record 930,000 tons,
according to the nation’s cocoa board.  “The supply situation looks comfortable,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago.
“We should see cocoa continue to trade weak.”  Cocoa for July delivery fell $68, or 2.3 percent, to $2,911
a ton at 10:47 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier,
the price touched $2,910, the lowest since Jan. 11. Before
today, the commodity retreated 0.8 percent this week.  In  London , cocoa futures for July delivery dropped 44
pounds, or 2.4 percent, to 1,821 pounds ($2,947) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for July added 0.14 cent, or 0.6 percent,
to 21.96 cents a pound in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery declined 2.05
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.6165 a pound.  In London, refined sugar and robusta coffee were little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
