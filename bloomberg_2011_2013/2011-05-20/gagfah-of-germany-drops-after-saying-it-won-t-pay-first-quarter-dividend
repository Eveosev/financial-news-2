Gagfah SA (GFJ) ,  Germany ’s largest publicly
traded property company, dropped to the lowest in eight months
in Frankfurt trading after saying it won’t pay a dividend for
the first quarter.  The shares fell as much as 9.9 percent to 5.63 euros, the
lowest since Sept. 24, 2010. The Essen-based company will
“retain additional flexibility” by declining to pay a
dividend, according to a statement after the market closed
yesterday.  Gagfah also reported that net income rose to 24 million
euros from 11.5 million euros a year earlier as the residential
landlord made more profit from property sales. Funds from
operations increased to 24 cents a share from 21 cents.  The shares were down 8.3 percent at 5.73 euros at 9:32
a.m., the biggest drop since March 23. They’ve gained 5 percent
in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
