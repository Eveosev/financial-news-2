Peru’s sol fell the most in more than
a week as traders bet a weekend presidential poll will show
congresswoman Keiko Fujimori and ex-army officer Ollanta Humala
are tied for support before a June 5 runoff vote.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7580 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.7542 yesterday. For the week, the sol rose
0.1 percent.  Fujimori, who favors policies designed to spur foreign
investment, has risen in polls and had a narrow lead over Humala
in a May 15 poll by Ipsos Apoyo, a Lima-based research company.
Her 2.2 percentage point lead was within with the poll’s margin
of error. Humala, who won last month’s first-round ballot, has
pledged to revise contracts with foreign investors and trading
partners if he’s elected.  Ipsos Apoyo is scheduled to publish a poll on May 22 and it
will probably show the candidates remain deadlocked, said Pedro Tuesta, a Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc.  “It’s an open race and no one really wants to go longer in
the sol,” Tuesta said. “Investors would like to see a clear
lead from somebody to help them decide what to do, but the
country’s too divided for that.” A long position is a bet an
asset will appreciate in value.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the foreign
exchange market today or issue certificates of deposit payable
in dollars.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.74
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
