Thailand ’s baht headed for a weekly
decline on concern  Greece ’s lingering debt crisis will spur
global funds to reduce holdings of riskier emerging-market
assets.  Overseas investors sold $111 million more Thai shares than
they bought this week through yesterday, taking net sales for
the month to $212 million and contributing to the currency’s 1.4
percent drop in May. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional
shares was poised for a third weekly slide as European finance
ministers met this week to discuss further support for a 110
billion euro ($157 billion) bailout plan for Greece.  “The decline in the baht was a general reaction to risk
appetite and concerns in the  euro zone ,” said Emmanuel Ng, a
currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
 Singapore . “By and large, the Asian growth story remains
intact.”  The baht declined 0.2 percent from a week ago and was
little changed from yesterday at 30.29 per dollar as of 9 a.m.
in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 was
little changed at 3.40 percent. The one-year interest-rate swap,
the fixed cost needed to receive a floating payment, was
unchanged at 3.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
