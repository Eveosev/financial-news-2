South Korea , Asia’s third-biggest
buyer of base metals, bought 2,000 metric tons of copper
cathodes at a lower premium than its purchase in January,
according to a state-run stockpiling agency.  The Public Procurement Service, which stockpiles strategic
commodities, bought the grade-A copper from LS-Nikko Copper Inc.
at $88 a ton more than the London Metal Exchange official cash
settlement price on a cost, insurance and freight basis, a
 notice  on the agency’s website showed today. The LME-registered
cathode is due for shipment by July 15.  The price compares with the $90-a-ton premium over the same
benchmark price that the agency paid BHP Billiton Marketing AG
for 2,000 tons of Chilean copper in a Jan. 25 tender.  Copper for three-month delivery in  London  rose 0.3 percent
to $8,962 per ton at 2:18 p.m. in  Seoul . The metal, used in
cables, wires and pipes, has fallen 6.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
