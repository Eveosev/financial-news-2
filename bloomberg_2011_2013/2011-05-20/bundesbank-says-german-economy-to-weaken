The German Bundesbank said  Europe ’s
largest economy will probably lose some growth momentum over the
coming months after an “explosive” start to the year.  “Growth is likely to ease somewhat in the foreseeable
future,” the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank said in its monthly
bulletin published today. The economy’s 1.5 percent growth rate
in the first quarter from the previous three months
“considerably overstates the underlying economic momentum.
Output growth was clearly lifted during the reporting period by
backloading and catching-up effects.”  Germany ’s economy is powering the euro region’s expansion
after expanding a record 3.6 percent in 2010. Companies are
stepping up spending and hiring to meet booming export orders,
while unemployment at a 19-year-low is encouraging  consumer
spending . The Bundesbank said today the “upturn could support
economic activity for some time.”  Still, the central bank called faster inflation among risks
to economic growth, saying monetary policy is still “extremely
expansionary.” The “price climate has deteriorated
significantly,” according to the report.  “The stabilizing effects emanating from domestic demand
can only take full effect in a tension-free environment,” the
Bundesbank said. “Potential risks in this respect accompany the
current scenario in that the economy is traversing the corridor
of normal utilization at what appears to be a virtually
undiminished pace of expansion,” with both business
expectations and  consumer confidence  having “reached highs
exceptionally early on in this cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
