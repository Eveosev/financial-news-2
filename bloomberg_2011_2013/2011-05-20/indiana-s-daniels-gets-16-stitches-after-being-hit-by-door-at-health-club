Governor Mitch Daniels of  Indiana ,
who is considering a Republican presidential bid, received 16
stitches to his forehead today following an accident at a
fitness center in Indianapolis, his office said in a statement.  The accident happened at the  National Institute for Fitness
and Sport  as he was concluding a workout, his office said.  “He was standing near a door,” the statement said. “The
door suddenly swung open and struck the governor in the
forehead. The governor’s security detail transported him to
Methodist Hospital. He was treated and released and is
recovering at home.”  Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for Daniels, said in an e-
mail that the governor hadn’t lost his sense of humor or
frugality as a result of the accident and “told the doctor who
stitched him up that he wanted to make sure he didn’t charge by
the stitch.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
