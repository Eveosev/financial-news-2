Most European stocks gained, sending
the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index higher for a third straight
day, as investors speculated that the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain its stimulus. U.S. index futures and Asian shares were
little changed.  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
power producer, rose 1 percent after reporting increased full-
year earnings. Mitchells & Butlers Plc, the owner of Harvester
and Toby Carvery pubs and restaurants, slid 2.9 percent after
posting fiscal first-half operating profit.  The Stoxx 600 Europe Index increased 0.1 percent to 280.33
at 8:04 a.m. in  London  as five stocks rose for every two that
fell. The gauge advanced 0.7 percent yesterday as companies from
Glencore International Plc to LinkedIn Corp. held initial public
offerings. Even so, the gauge has fallen 3.7 percent since this
year’s high on Feb. 17. The measure has dropped 0.1 percent so
far this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
