Colombia ’s peso headed to a third
weekly drop, its longest losing streak since February, amid
dollar purchases by the central bank and the Treasury and
reduced demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso has fallen 0.7 percent this week to 1,820.80 per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:58 a.m. New York time. It’s down 0.3 percent
today from 1,816.09 yesterday. The peso has plunged 3 percent in
May, the worst performance among six Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Besides the external noise, we now have both the central
bank intervening as well as the government,” said  Camilo Perez ,
head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the country’s second-biggest
bank.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in April that
the government would create an overseas fund with as much as
$1.2 billion from dollars bought in the local  spot market 
through the end of 2011, and forgo repatriating funds from
abroad for the rest of the year. That comes on top of the
central bank’s plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until
at least June 17.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, today to 8.19
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s
price fell 0.132 centavo to 114.252 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
