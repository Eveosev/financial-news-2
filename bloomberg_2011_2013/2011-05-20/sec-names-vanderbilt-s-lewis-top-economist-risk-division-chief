The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has named Craig M. Lewis, a Vanderbilt University
professor who has studied market volatility and herd behavior by
equity analysts, to be its chief economist and director of a
unit responsible for spotting threats to the financial system.  Lewis, who is currently a visiting scholar at the SEC, will
assume the new role next month, the agency said today in an e-
mail statement. He will replace Henry Hu, the founding director
of the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation, who
stepped down after just over a year in the post.  “His two tours as a visiting academic fellow at the SEC
give him important insights into the agency’s inner workings and
uniquely position him to fulfill my vision of the Division,” SEC
Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in the statement  RiskFin, the SEC’s first new division in 37 years, was
created by Schapiro in 2009 to act as the agency’s “think tank.”
The unit includes the former Office of Economic Analysis, which
has been without a chief economist since March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
