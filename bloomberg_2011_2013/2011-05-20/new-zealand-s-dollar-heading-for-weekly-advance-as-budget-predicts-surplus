The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars gained for the first week this month versus their U.S.
counterpart as an improving economic outlook for the two South
Pacific nations increased demand.  The Aussie reached a one-week high versus the greenback
today as traders bet the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will raise
 interest rates  by 30 basis points over the next 12 months. New
Zealand’s dollar gained for a fourth day on speculation overseas
investors will buy the nation’s bonds after the government said
this week the budget will return to surplus in four years.  “With the RBA saying they’re going to hike in the next few
months, that’s going to lend some support for the Aussie,” said
Khoon Goh, head of market economics and strategy at ANZ National
Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “Demand for New Zealand government
bonds is going to be very strong as a result of this budget.”  Australia ’s dollar traded at $1.0675 at 12:52 p.m. in  New
York , compared with from $1.0670 yesterday. It gained 1 percent
this week. The Aussie touched $1.0703, the highest level since
May 13. The currency rose 0.1 percent for the day and 2 percent
for the week to 87.15 yen.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.8
percent to 79.75 U.S. cents, from 79.09 cents, bringing gains
this week to 1.3 percent. The kiwi climbed 0.9 percent for the
day and 2.3 percent for the week to 65.09 yen.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan .  New Zealand’s government yesterday projected an operating
surplus of NZ$1.3 billion ($1.03 billion) in the year ending
June 2015. Finance Minister Bill English said the government
would save NZ$5.2 billion over four years to spend on health,
education and rebuilding from two earthquakes in Christchurch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
