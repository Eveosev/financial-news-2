Brazil ’s Presidency said it doesn’t
believe opposition lawmakers will succeed in approving a
congressional probe to investigate Chief of Staff  Antonio
Palocci , a government official close to President Dilma Rousseff
said.  The opposition’s proposal for a probe, after Folha de S.
Paulo reported Palocci made 20 million reais ($12.3 million)
last year working as consultant to business while also managing
Rousseff’s election campaign, shouldn’t be enacted and lacks a
proper focus, said the official, who declined to be named
because he is not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.  The Presidency sees no reason for Palocci to quit his
position and that explanations provided by him clarified the
situation, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
