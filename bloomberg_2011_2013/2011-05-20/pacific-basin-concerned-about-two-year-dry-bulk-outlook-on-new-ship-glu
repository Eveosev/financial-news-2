Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. (2343) , Hong
Kong’s largest operator of dry-bulk vessels, said it was
“concerned” about the outlook for rates through 2013 as a glut
of new ships enter service.  “We are concerned about the two years ahead of us,” Chief
Executive Officer Klaus Nyborg said at a shipping conference in
Imabari, Japan today. The company is “fairly confident” about
the market after that, he said.  The Baltic Dry Index, the benchmark for commodity-shipping
rates, has plunged 65 percent in the past year as shipping
lines’ fleet expansion surpasses demand for iron ore and coal
shipments in  China . The global dry-bulk fleet will grow 55
percent from 2010 to 2013, outpacing a 28 percent increase in
demand,  Barclays Capital  said in a report this month.  “The next 12 to 24 months will be challenging,” Frank G.
Jensen, chief executive officer of Clipper Group, said at the
conference. “There are too many new-builds coming out.”  Clipper’s dry-bulk business manages more than 100 ships,
according to its  website . Hong Kong-based Pacific Basin had a
dry-bulk fleet of 123 owned and chartered vessels as of April
15, with another 23 on order.  The Baltic Dry Index gained 1.5 percent today to 1,349
points, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. Gains were
led by daily rates to hire capesize vessels, typically carriers
of iron ore and the biggest ships tracked by the gauge. They
rose 3.6 percent to $7,754.  Rents for panamaxes, competitors to capesizes for coal and
 iron-ore  cargoes while also carrying grains, rose 3.2 percent to
$13,364 a day. Supramaxes were little changed at $14,770, as
were handysizes at $11,662.  China Ships  The global backlog of on-order commodity-carrying ships
stands at 41 percent the size of the in-service fleet, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, the backlog for
 container ships  is about 25 percent.  “We cannot be optimistic,” Cesare d’Amico, chief
executive officer of d’Amico Societa di Navigazione SpA, which
has a fleet of 90 ships, said at the conference. “For the next
two years, it will be difficult.”  The Bloomberg Dry Ship Index, which tracks 12 dry-bulk
shipping lines worldwide, has fallen 14 percent this year.
Pacific Basin has fallen 9 percent this year in  Hong Kong , while
the benchmark Hang Seng Index is little changed.  The backlog and plunging rates have caused lines to slow
the pace of new orders. In the first quarter, global orders
plunged 73 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion,
according to shipbroker Clarkson Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
