European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said the ECB’s refinancing operations
treat all 17 nations in the euro area equally.  “We are not financing any national economy,” Mersch said
at a conference today in Luxembourg. “We are financing the
whole euro zone on the basis of a framework that is equal for
all the countries.”  Mersch, who heads Luxembourg’s central bank, said the ECB
policy framework limits risks.  “This framework also has a risk management and the risk
management is translated into collateral policy,” he said.
“This is not necessarily the same as regulatory supervision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
