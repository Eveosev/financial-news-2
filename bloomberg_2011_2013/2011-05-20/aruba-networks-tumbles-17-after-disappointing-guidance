Aruba Networks Inc. (ARUN) , a maker of
components for mobile devices, fell as much as 17 percent in
Nasdaq trading after analysts expressed concern over the
company’s gross margins and its fourth-quarter revenue forecast.  The company fell $5.24 to $27.45 at 2:38 p.m., after
earlier falling the most in two and a half years. Before today,
the Sunnyvale, California-based company’s shares were up 57
percent this year.  “Strong top-line results are not enough to mask
disappointing gross margins and guidance,” Tim Long, an analyst
with BMO Capital Markets, said in a note today. “We believe
revenue growth is set to decelerate.” Long expects the stock to
“underperform” the market.  Revenue in the fourth quarter will be $107 million to $109
million, the company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts on
average projected $105.8 million in a Bloomberg survey.
Excluding some items, the company said earnings will range from
16 cents to 17 cents a share, compared with average estimates of
16 cents.  A higher mix of international revenue will tighten margins,
something that is “likely to persist,” especially as Dell Inc.
makes margin expansion more difficult, according to Rohit Chopra, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. who rates the
shares “neutral.”  “Fourth-quarter guidance may not be good enough given past
beats and raises, as it was generally in line with our
expectations and appears conservative given the magnitude of the
third quarter outperformance,” Chopra said in a note.  Revenue for the third quarter increased 53 percent to
$105.8 million, the company said yesterday. Net income excluding
some items was $18.8 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with
$8.5 million, or 8 cents a share a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
