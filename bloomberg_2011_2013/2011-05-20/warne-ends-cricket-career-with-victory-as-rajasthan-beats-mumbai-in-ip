Shane Warne ended his cricket career
with a victory as the Rajasthan Royals beat the Mumbai Indians
by 10 wickets in the Indian Premier League.  Warne, the second-highest wicket-taker in Test history,
took 1-30 as the Indians reached 133-5 in their 20 overs in
Mumbai. Openers Shane Watson and Rahul Dravid then teamed for an
unbeaten 134 in just 13.1 overs to give Rajasthan a season-
ending win.  “I’d just like to say a big thank you for my teammates who
played fantastic today,” Warne, who announced his retirement on
May 6, said in a postgame interview. “They’re a great group of
guys.”  Watson finished with 89 runs from 47 balls and Dravid
scored had 43 from 32 balls. Rohit Sharma top-scored for Mumbai
with 58 before being dismissed by Warne.  “It was great to send off Warnie,” Dravid said. “He’s
been a legend in the game. It was brilliant to put in a good
performance for him.”  Warne, 41, has spent four seasons playing Twenty20, the
newest and shortest form of the game, after retiring from
international and first-class cricket. He took a then-record 708
Test wickets for  Australia  from 1992 to 2007. The mark was
broken the year he retired by  Sri Lanka ’s  Muttiah Muralitharan ,
who has 800 Test wickets.  Leg-spinner Warne was named one of the five “Cricketers of
the 20th Century” by the Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack. He
retired from Test cricket in 2007 after Australia won the Ashes
with a 5-0 whitewash of  England . He continued to play and was
captain of English county team Hampshire until he quit in 2008.  Warne joined Rajasthan when the IPL began in 2008 and
helped the team to the league title in his first season. The
Royals missed the playoffs this season, bringing a close to
Warne’s career today.  “When I retired in January ‘07 I thought that was it,”
Warne said. “I’ve had four years of IPL and it’s been great. It
was a pleasure and an honor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
