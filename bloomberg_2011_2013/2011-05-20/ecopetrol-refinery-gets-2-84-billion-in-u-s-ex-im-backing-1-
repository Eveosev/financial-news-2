Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ’s refinery unit won
approval for $2.84 billion in loans and guarantees from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank to spend on U.S. goods and services, the
second-largest loan for the government-backed lender.  Ecopetrol’s Refineria de Cartagena will use the funds to
buy equipment and services from 150 U.S. companies for a $5.18
billion expansion, the bank said today in a statement. The deal,
pending approval since an April 7 announcement, will help create
or support more than 15,000 U.S. jobs in the next four years,
the lender said.  Ecopetrol,  Colombia ’s largest oil company, based in Bogota,
is expanding its refinery on the nation’s Caribbean coast as it
increases production. Chicago Bridge & Iron N.V. and Foster
Wheeler AG are among companies selling to Ecopetrol, the bank
said.  The Export-Import Bank provides financing, including direct
loans, guarantees and payment insurance, to help support the
sale of U.S. products. Chairman Fred Hochberg on May 17 asked
Congress for a 40 percent increase in the loan limit to $140
billion for fiscal year 2015 as borrowing by companies closes in
on the current maximum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
