Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  contract
workers are on strike at a refinery in Cubatao,  Brazil , since
yesterday in a protest over pay, a labor union official said.  About 2,000 contractors in charge at maintenance at the
Presidente Bernardes refinery in Sao Paulo state are on strike
for an “indefinite time,” Geraldino Cruz Nascimento, the
president of the workers’ union, said today by telephone.  “Petrobras is making a lot of money from the pre-salt,”
Cruz said from Cubatao, referring to extensive oil reserves the
Rio de Janeiro-based company has located underneath a layer of
salt beneath the ocean floor. “We want our share of it.”  The union is asking for a 12 percent wage increase and a
bonus, he said. A spokesman for Petrobras, who can’t be named
under company policy, said the strike isn’t affecting production
at the refinery, which can process 170,000 barrels a day of oil
into diesel, aviation fuel and other products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
