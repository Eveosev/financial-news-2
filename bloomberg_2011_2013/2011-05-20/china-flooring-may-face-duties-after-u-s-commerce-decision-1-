The U.S. Commerce Department
proposed dumping duties of as much as 58.84 percent on wood
flooring imports from  China .  Seventy-four Chinese exporters qualified for a 3.31 percent
duty should the U.S. International Trade Commission rule that
the imports hurt or threaten harm to U.S. producers, the
Commerce Department said in a statement today.  Zhejiang Yuhua Timber Co. would pay no tariffs, Zhejiang
Layo Wood Industry Co. would pay 3.98 percent and Samling Group
would pay 2.63 percent, according to the Commerce Department
statement. All other Chinese producers would pay 58.84 percent,
according to the statement.  The value of U.S. imports of the flooring climbed 64
percent to $120 million in 2009 from 2007, according to the
statement. The petition was brought by U.S. producers including
Anderson Hardwood Floors and Shaw Industries Group Inc., which
was acquired by   Warren Buffett â€™s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  a
decade ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
