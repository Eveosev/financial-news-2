SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-
largest brewer by volume, jumped to the highest level since at
least 1995 in Johannesburg trading after reporting a 15 percent
increase in earnings yesterday.  The stock advanced 5.26 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 258.85
rand by 10:09 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Full-year earnings before interest, taxes and amortization
climbed 15 percent to $5.04 billion, the company reported in a
regulatory filing yesterday. Analysts polled by Bloomberg
estimated earnings of $4.87 billion.  “The good run today is really on the back of the results
yesterday,” said  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus
Securities Ltd., by telephone today from Johannesburg. “The
market likes what its hearing there. And that’s in a market
that’s doing very well generally. It’s a very well
geographically diversified company that is also seen as a good,
defensive share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
