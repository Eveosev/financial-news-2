Russia called for peacekeepers to be
deployed in  Libya  and condemned NATO strikes for violating the
United Nations Security Council resolution that authorized
military action in the North African state.  “We are increasingly concerned about the unfolding
situation in Libya, the continued bloodshed as well as the
actions of the coalition, which don’t respect UN Security
Council resolution No. 1973,” Alexander Lukashevich, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman, told reporters today in Moscow.  Russia will make the “maximum” political and diplomatic
efforts to resolve the crisis by “activating the peacekeeping
potential of the UN and African Union,” Lukashevich said.  Russia has been a vocal critic of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization-led air campaign that helped the rebels regain the
initiative against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s forces. It
accused the U.S. and its allies of violating the Security
Council  vote  in March that allowed them to enforce a no-fly zone
to protect civilians. Russia abstained from the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
