Attacks on pipelines in Yemen and
evacuation of foreign workers because of unrest have reduced the
country’s oil production by about 70 percent, according to the
Centre for Global Energy Studies.  “At the height of the disruption, almost 190,000 barrels a
day of Yemen’s oil production was shut in,” the London-based
research institute said in a research note.  OMV AG (OMV) , central Europe’s largest oil company, said on May
11 that an oil pipeline that exploded in March can’t be repaired
because of instability in the Middle Eastern country, which
borders  Saudi Arabia  and Oman. The link connects the Marib
fields to the Ras Isa export terminal.  OMV, based in Vienna, halted crude oil production in the
country after the pipeline was damaged. Output from the Masila
fields operated by  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  was also briefly halted by a
strike, which also affected output at  DNO International ASA (DNO) 
fields, according to the note.  The restoration of Nexen and DNO’s production should reduce
the amount shut in to about 100,000 barrels a day, or 37
percent, but much of the lost production is high-quality light,
sweet crude, which is in short supply following the loss of
Libyan output, CGES said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
