The U.K. is in breach of European
Union anti-discrimination rules when it prevents multinational
companies based in Britain from taking advantage of low tax
rates in other EU countries, the Financial Times reported,
citing a May 19 Commission ruling.  The breach dates from the U.K.’s reform of its tax rules
after a 2006 court case involving Cadbury Schweppes and
“despite the 2006 court’s ruling in the Cadbury Schweppes case,
the U.K. is still not complying with EU law on freedom of
establishment and free movement of capital,” the Commission
said, according to the FT. The U.K. has two months in which to
reply, after which the issue may be referred to the EU’s Court
of Justice, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
