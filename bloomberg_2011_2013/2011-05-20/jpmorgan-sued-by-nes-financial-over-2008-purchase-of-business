JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was sued by NES
Financial Corp. for allegedly defrauding it in the purchase of a
tax-related business, leaving NES with billions of dollars in
potential liability.  NES Financial, in a complaint filed in federal court in
 Manhattan  yesterday, claimed that JPMorgan improperly hid a
“lengthy history of legal violations” when it sold its Section
1031 tax-deferred exchange business to NES in 2008.  “While NESF thought it was purchasing a business that
would solidify its reputation for quality and trustworthiness,
it received a business that saddled it with potentially massive
liability,” the company claimed in its complaint.  As a result, NES Financial said, it is unable to raise
capital from outside investors and its value dropped to
$7 million from about $41 million before the sale.  NES Financial helps its clients avoid U.S. taxes by
facilitating so-called 1031 exchanges, according to its  website .
 Section 1031  of the U.S.  Tax Code  permits the owners of certain
types of property used for business or investment to exchange
them “for property of like kind,” without recognizing a loss
or gain for tax purposes.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the suit.  The case is NES Financial Corp. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA,
11-cv-3437, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
