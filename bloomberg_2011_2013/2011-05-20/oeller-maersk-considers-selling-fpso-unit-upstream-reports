A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S is
considering selling its floating production, storage and
offloading business,  Upstream  reported, citing unidentified
people in the industry.  The Danish company has been “discreetly tapping” the
market for some months about a sale, the Oslo-based newspaper
said, citing one person as saying.  BW Offshore Ltd. (BWO)  is said to be one of the most obvious
interested candidates, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
