Following are comments from  Alaska
Air Group Inc. (ALK) ’s  Chief Financial Officer Brandon Pedersen on
jet fuel hedging. The comments are from a presentation
yesterday, according to a transcript.  “You can see by the chart here that 50% of our current
year consumption is hedged at $86 a barrel, we have about $11 of
premium associated with those options. So we’re in the money at
$97 a barrel.”  “We also do some closed-end hedging on the crack spread
using swaps and this year, looking at second quarter, we are 50%
hedged at $0.59 on the crack, which is running about $0.75.”  Crude for June delivery declined $1.47 cents to $96.97 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 9.47 a.m. local
time today. Crack spreads are the difference between crude and
oil products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
