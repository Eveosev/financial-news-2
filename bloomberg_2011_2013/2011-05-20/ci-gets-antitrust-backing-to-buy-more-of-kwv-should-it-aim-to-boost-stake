Hosken Consolidated Investments Ltd. (HCI) 
said it sought approval from  South Africa ’s antitrust
authorities to buy the rest of  KWV Holdings Ltd.  to avoid
stumbling blocks should it decide to make a bid.  “We’re not making an offer in the short term,” Hosken
Finance Director Kevin Govender in an interview today from  Cape
Town . “We applied to the  Competition Commission  to check if
there’s anything that may preclude us from buying all of the
company should we increase our shareholding above the 34.9
percent we currently own.”  HCI, which has interests spanning television, transport,
mining and textiles, is still evaluating the business of South
Africa’s second-largest wine and spirits company after acquiring
the stake three months ago, he said. It approached the
commission to see if there would be regulatory hurdles should it
breach the 35 percent shareholding limit that triggers a
mandatory buy-out offer in terms of South African company law.  “We’re one regulatory step away should we need to make an
offer,” he said.  Hosken bought the KWV stake from Zeder Investments Ltd. in
February after food producer Pioneer Foods Group Ltd.’s failed
takeover bid for the spirits company. Hosken paid 11.80 rand
($1.71) a share, lower than Pioneer’s 12 rand-a-share offer that
was opposed by some of KWV’s other investors.  Zeder Investments is also Pioneer’s largest shareholder
through its 41.3 percent holding in  Kaap Agri Ltd. , which in
turn owns 27.60 percent in Pioneer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
