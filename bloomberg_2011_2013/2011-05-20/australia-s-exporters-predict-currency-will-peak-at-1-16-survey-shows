Australia ’s small exporters predict
the currency will peak at $1.16 by September, 25 cents above the
level that most believe makes them uncompetitive,  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia  said, citing a survey.  Forty-eight percent of exporters plan to hedge their
currency exposure over the next three months, according to the
survey of 600 businesses with sales of A$5 million ($5.3
million) to A$500 million a year. Importers are less optimistic
about the so-called Aussie, predicting it will top out at $1.14
by year-end, the poll taken for Commonwealth Bank’s currency
barometer found.  “The Aussie Dollar Barometer reveals that small and medium
sized enterprises expect the Australian dollar to remain well
above parity with the  U.S. dollar  this year and into 2012,”
 Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth
Bank, Australia’s largest lender, wrote in a report. “SMEs also
expect the Australian dollar to reach new post-float records.”  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0668 as of 10:01 a.m. in
Sydney, having strengthened 31 percent over the past year. The
currency climbed to $1.1012 on May 2, the highest since it was
freely floated in 1983.  The rise in the Aussie is prompting 80 percent of exporters
to consider changing their selling prices, Capurso wrote.  Australia’s currency will trade at $1.06 in the second
quarter before weakening to $1.03 by Dec. 31 and $1.01 by the
end of 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey of 36 analysts.  Commonwealth Bank’s currency barometer is updated every
three months based on a survey by market research firm East &
Partners. The current survey was conducted from 2 May to 6 May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
