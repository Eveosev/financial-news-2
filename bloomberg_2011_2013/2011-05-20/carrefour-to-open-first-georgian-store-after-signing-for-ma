Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-
largest retailer, will open its first store in Georgia after
signing an agreement with a real-estate developer to expand in
the eastern European country.  The outlet will be in the Uptown Tbilisi mall, which is
located in the Georgian capital and must be completed by the end
of the year, according to an e-mailed statement today from
Rakeen, a developer owned by the Gulf emirate of Ras al-Khaimah.
Carrefour’s press office declined to comment in an e-mail.  The retailer, which is based in the Paris suburb of
Boulogne-Billancourt, has stores in 34 countries, including
Romania and Bulgaria in eastern  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
