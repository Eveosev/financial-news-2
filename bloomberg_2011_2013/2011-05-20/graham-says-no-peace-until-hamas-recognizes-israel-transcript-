Republican  Senator Lindsey Graham , a
South Carolina Republican, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that there can be no peace agreement in the Middle East
-- and should be no further U.S. aid to Palestinians -- until
all Palestinian leaders recognize Israel as a legitimate Jewish
state.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Senator, thank you for being with us.  Let me start off on the  budget deficit . How do you rate the
prospects of any kind of significant down payment on  deficit
reduction  involving entitlements and revenues as part of a debt
ceiling extension?  SENATOR  LINDSEY GRAHAM : Very good, or we won’t have one. I
don’t think any Republican is going to vote to raise the debt
ceiling unless we have some significant reforms addressing why
we’re in debt. And why are we in debt? We’re spending too much,
and the domestic discretionary, even the  defense budget  - you
can look at that if you’d like, and I think we could - but
entitlements. I don’t think any Republican can go home and
survive, quite frankly. The mandate of 2010 was about Washington
spending.  HUNT: If Democrats take entitlements, will Republicans
accept some revenue increases that are not rate increases?  GRAHAM: I don’t think - the way you get more revenue is to
flatten the  tax code  and do away with the deductions. We have 25
percent of GDP spending on the government, highest ever.  HUNT: So something that’s base-broadening and rate-
lowering?  GRAHAM: Exactly. I think that would make some sense. This
is a Ronald Reagan-Tip O’Neill moment. Mr. President, if you’re
listening out there, there are a group of Republicans who would
gladly walk the plank with you and hold hands when it comes to
means testing and age adjustment.  HUNT: And agree to put at least consideration of revenues
on the table?  GRAHAM: Well, I think when it comes to the revenue part,
you’re going to have to lower rates and do away with the
deductions.  HUNT: OK. All right. Are you going to vote for  Paul Ryan ’s
budget with the Medicare changes?  GRAHAM: Sure.  HUNT: You are?  GRAHAM: Not because I think it’s the perfect plan. Just
because I want to reward people who try to do hard things. I’m
going to vote for Paul’s plan, because it does get us into
balance. It is addressing entitlements. And there’s probably a
different way to do Medicare. But to my Democratic colleagues,
if you don’t like Paul’s plan, produce your own.  HUNT: So this is the start, and then, you know, see -  GRAHAM: How long has it been since a Democratic Senate
produced a budget?  HUNT: Yeah. No, you’re right.  Let me just make sure I’m right, though, on the revenue
part. What you’re saying is, if it’s going to be revenues, it’s
got to be - it can be additional revenues, but it’s got to be
lower rates and base-broadening?  GRAHAM: The way you get additional revenue is that you do
away with the deductions; $1.2 trillion is given out every year
in deductions. Take away most deductions so that people actually
can pay taxes at a lower rate. Grow the economy. Revenue coming
into  Washington  from an increased economic growth is the way to
go.  HUNT: But it wouldn’t be a net revenue gainer in the first
year or so? Is that what you’re saying? Because that’s the -
that’s the real distinction here.  GRAHAM: So what I’m saying is, if you flatten the tax code,
you do away with all the deductions but charitable giving and
some home interest -  HUNT: Right.  GRAHAM: - you can lower rates and, over time, you’re going
to increase revenue. What do you do with the additional money? I
think you need to pay down the debt, is what you do with the
additional money.  HUNT: Let’s go to foreign policy.  GRAHAM: OK.  HUNT: You were very critical of the president talking about
returning to the 1967 borders in the -  GRAHAM: A lot of the speech I liked, by the way.  HUNT: Yeah, but you were critical of that, and you said
there ought to be one condition. It ought to be the Palestinians
ought to recognize the right of  Israel  to exist. Isn’t that as
one-sided as the other?  GRAHAM: No, not really. I mean, here’s the point. American
presidents need to understand that when you publicly criticize
Israel for their flaws - and they have flaws -  HUNT: Right.  GRAHAM: - you’re not going to win support in the Arab or
Palestinian world. You just make it harder to get an agreement.  So when you showcase settlements, when you talk about ‘67
borders, I think the prime minister of Israel was pretty firm
today. We’re not going to give up half our territory. That’s
indefensible.  And here’s what I’m saying. What’s the big elephant in the
room? The question for me, can Hamas and the  Palestinian
Authority  form a new government that would lead to peace? How do
you have a peace agreement where part of the coalition
government on the Palestinian side has in their charter the
destruction of Israel?  We provide hundreds of millions of dollars a year in aid to
the Palestinian people. Here’s what I’m saying as an American
politician. How do I go home to  South Carolina  and say, “That’s
a wise investment,” until I know and can tell the people in
South Carolina the Palestinian -  HUNT: That they’re going -  GRAHAM: Well, here’s what I’m asking the Palestinian
government. Acknowledge that the Jewish state has a right to
exist. Start with that concept. Then we’ll continue the aid.  HUNT: Senator, could it be that the lines are so drawn
right now, the emotions so high, that at this particular stage,
it’s pointless for the U.S. to try to revive the  peace process ,
unfortunately?  GRAHAM: Yeah, I think the only way you can - what is the
goal of Hamas? Is it to join with the Palestinian Authority to
destroy Israel or to get an independent Palestinian state? Every
Israeli politician from the left to the right to the middle has
acknowledged the Palestinian people deserve an independent
Palestinian state. There’s a group in Palestine that will not
acknowledge the Jewish people have a right to -  HUNT: So as long as that exists, there’s no point in trying
to revive the peace process?  GRAHAM: As long as that exists, you’ll never have a peace
agreement. And why should we give money to people who have as
their goal to destroy our best partner in the Mideast?  HUNT: OK. Let me turn to  Pakistan .  GRAHAM: OK.  HUNT: You said this week, you can’t trust them and you
can’t abandon them.  GRAHAM: - abandon them, absolutely.  HUNT: American taxpayers, though, are fed up, as you know,
with them.  GRAHAM: I mean, I understand, absolutely.  HUNT: How - how can you specifically condition aid to
Pakistan? What conditions would you -  GRAHAM: Well, I think, why would you not want to cut aid,
right? You can’t trust them. So why would you give money to
people you can’t trust? Well, they do help in this regard. Most
of our bullets and beans go through Pakistan to get to
 Afghanistan . They’re providing access logistically to American
troops in Afghanistan. They have helped in the overall war on
terror. They’ve helped us catch some terrorists.  So what I would do is I’d look at our aid package, and I’d
make sure that the people who receive aid have bought into the
idea that the Taliban and al-Qaeda is not the way to go. We can
have benchmarks and measurements.  The one thing we’ve never gotten for our money when it
comes to Pakistan is measurable progress toward systems that
will - we can leave in peace with.  HUNT: And you can write that in the law? You can condition
that?  GRAHAM: We did that with  Iraq  and - here’s what we need to
do in Afghanistan. We’re going to continue to support the Afghan
government. We need benchmarks and measurements to see if
they’re moving forward. Are their security forces getting better
or worse? We need to measure what our money buys us. And when it
comes to Pakistan, we need to measure, are we empowering the
right people or the wrong people?  HUNT: Right. Well, you said on Afghanistan recently, we
ought to pour it on now. We’ve got momentum.  GRAHAM: Yeah, we should. Absolutely.  HUNT: It is a - is it a mistake, then, for Obama to start
to withdraw troops this summer?  GRAHAM: No.  HUNT: And should he - it’s not?  GRAHAM: No, I think -  HUNT: It’s still OK to withdraw troops?  GRAHAM: Yeah, no, I think the president, to his credit, has
come up with a good plan, and that is to withdraw some in July
of this year, because we are making progress. But 2014 is the
transition date to when the Afghans are going to take over based
on conditions.  What I’d like to see the president do is solidify our
relationship with Afghanistan. Let the Pakistani government know
the Taliban will never come back.  HUNT: Right.  GRAHAM: So not only are we going to stay to transition in
2014, what if we announced this year a joint basing agreement
with the Afghans, where we have bases past 2014 that - with
American airpower and special forces units that would give the
edge to the American security forces in perpetuity? I want the
Pakistanis and the Iranians to know and the whole region to
know, we’re not going to abandon Afghanistan.  HUNT: Immigration. Any chance that you’ll get another
Republican to support you? Can you get anything done this year
on immigration?  GRAHAM: Not until we do the border.  HUNT: Right.  GRAHAM: Here’s the problem -  HUNT: So no big immigration deal?  GRAHAM: Here’s the Republican exposure on immigration. Once
we get a border security bill that’s meaningful, like the Kyl-
McCain plan, once we get that border security, if we’re not
willing to address the other parts, including the 10 million to
12 million, then the burden is - then we have a political
problem. We’ve got to prove to the country that we want to
secure the border, but we’re also willing to deal with the other
problems with immigration.  HUNT: Final political question. I know you’re neutral in
the presidential contest so far. You aren’t making any
endorsements. Would you like to see Indiana Governor Mitch
Daniels get in the race?  GRAHAM: Yes.  HUNT: You would?  GRAHAM: Yeah, I think he’d be an incredibly good candidate.  HUNT: How about Sarah Palin? Would you like to see her run?  GRAHAM: Sure.  HUNT: You would?  GRAHAM: You know, when I go to Best Buy, I want 15 TVs to
shop from.  HUNT: So you want them all in right now?  GRAHAM: The more choices for the consumers, the better.  HUNT: OK. Lindsey Graham, thank you so much for being with
us.  GRAHAM: Thank you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
