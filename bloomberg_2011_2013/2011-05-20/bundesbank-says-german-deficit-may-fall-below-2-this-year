Tax revenue growth and spending cuts
will probably help German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government
push down the  budget deficit , setting an example for fiscal
discipline in  Europe , the Bundesbank said.  Germany ’s budget shortfall could drop below 2 percent of
gross domestic product this year, the Frankfurt-based central
bank said in its monthly report published today.  “This notably mirrors a clear structural improvement,
although the ongoing cyclical recovery is also making an
important contribution,” the Bundesbank said.  The German government may be able to cut its spending gap
to some 30 billion euros ($43 billion) from the 48 billion euros
in the budget, the Bundesbank said. New tax forecasts that show
revenue soaring over earlier estimates through 2014 may further
help to push down the federal deficit beyond 2011, it said.  “A federal deficit of 30 billion euros seems achievable”
this year, the Bundesbank said. “In subsequent years, this
improved situation will be perpetuated,” boosting the chances
of the government adhering to its target of balancing the
federal budget by 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
