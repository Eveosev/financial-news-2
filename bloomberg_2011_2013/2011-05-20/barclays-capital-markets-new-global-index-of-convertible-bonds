Barclays Capital , the investment
banking arm of the U.K.’s third-largest lender by assets, is
marketing a global benchmark index of convertible bonds.  The new gauge tracks the total return of convertible bonds
worldwide, with sub indexes measuring profile, industry,
currency, country and rating, the London-based bank said in a
statement. The new benchmark adds to existing indexes for bonds
in the U.S.,  Europe , Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific
regions, Barclays said.  The index can be used for “for performance targets and for
informational measures of market returns and risk
characteristics,” Luke Olsen, the London-based head of
convertibles research for EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
