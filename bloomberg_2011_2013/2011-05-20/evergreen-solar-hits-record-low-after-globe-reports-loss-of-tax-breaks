Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR) , a maker of
solar photovoltaic cells and panels, reached a record low after
the Boston Globe reported that it would lose state tax benefits
in  Massachusetts .  Evergreen fell 10 cents, or 10 percent, to 90 cents in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the lowest since its initial public
offering in November 2000. The Marlboro, Massachusetts-based
company’s shares have lost 74 percent of their value this year.  The state’s Economic Assistance Coordinating Council voted
yesterday to end a 20-year property tax break initially
estimated as worth as much as $15 million, to eliminate $7.5
million in other state tax credits and to send the company a
retroactive property tax bill for $1.5 million, the Globe
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
