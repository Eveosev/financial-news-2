The cost to protect debt issued by
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  climbed to the highest level in almost
five months.  Credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman Sachs
increased 6.7 basis points to 141.9 basis points, according to
data provider CMA. The contracts have risen 30.6 basis points
since a U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations’s
report last month said the firm misled clients about its bets on
mortgage-related investments. The panel’s findings were referred
to the  Department of Justice  and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The contracts, which are are at the highest since Dec. 1.,
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
