Tourism Group  AG started construction on a 40 million-euro ($57
million) project to build a hotel with an adjacent office
building in Belgrade.  In partnership with M.O.F. BETA Immobilien AG real estate
fund, FMTG plans to complete the 24,000-square-meter complex by
June 2012, including the four-star, 171-room hotel, said Chief
Executive Officer Otmar Michaeler.  “We mostly count on business travellers from the
increasing presence of international companies, but also on
leisure guests,” Michaeler said in Belgrade today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
