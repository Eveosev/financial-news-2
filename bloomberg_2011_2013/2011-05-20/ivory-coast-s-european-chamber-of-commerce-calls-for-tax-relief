Ivory Coast ’s European Chamber of
Commerce called on the government for tax relief and financial
compensation for European companies affected by the five-month
political crisis that followed disputed elections in November.  “We’re engaged in talks with the government for the
implementation of tax attendant measures,” Maximilien Lemaire,
president of the chamber, said in an interview yesterday. About
a third of the group’s 80 members suffered theft or damage
during the political turmoil, he said.  The commercial capital, Abidjan, saw a month of fighting
between the rival forces of President-elect  Alassane Ouattara 
and former President  Laurent Gbagbo , with many shops and
businesses ransacked. The fighting largely came to an end on
April 11, when Ouattara’s forces captured Gbagbo.  “We need to pay particular attention to social cohesion
and reconciliation, because our employees have to learn again
how to work together,” Lemaire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
