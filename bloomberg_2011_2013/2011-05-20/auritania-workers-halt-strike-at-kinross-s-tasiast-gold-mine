Workers at  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ’s
Tasiast mine in Mauritania ended a one-day strike after Bouh
Ould Boubleide, a spokesman for the group, said they received a
9 percent increase in basic pay.  Yesterday’s protest at the mine, 330 kilometers (205 miles)
northwest of the capital, Nouakchott, also earned a pledge to
improve the health insurance of the miners, Boubleide said in a
phone interview today.  Production was unaffected, the Toronto-based company said
in an e-mailed statement.  “Constructive dialogue with the union is continuing with
the aim of improving working conditions to Kinross standards and
to negotiating a collective agreement,” the company said.  Kinross is targeting 1.5 million ounces of production at
Tasiast by 2015, Chief Executive Officer Burt Tye said May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
