Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said today that
he supports France’s  Christine Lagarde  to be the new head of the
International Monetary Fund.  “I favor a managing director coming from the euro area
because we are at the epicenter of a crisis so a good knowledge
of euro specifics is to be with the one who will become the
managing director,” Juncker told reporters at an event in
Stuttgart, Germany. “I am supporting Christine Lagarde.”  Lagarde is currently the finance minister of France, while
Juncker is Luxembourg’s prime minister.  Regarding the Greek economic situation, Juncker said:
“Greece needs to come back on track as far as the budgetary
targets for 2011 are concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
