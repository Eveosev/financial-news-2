Canadian natural gas for June
delivery rose for the first day in five as traders sought
bargains and covered bets on earlier declines.  Gas at Canada’s benchmark AECO C hub in  Alberta  had slipped
6.2 percent since May 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The prospect that prices may have hit bottom probably
has some traders covering short positions, or bets on price
declines, said  Martin King , senior commodities analyst at
FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary.  “They couldn’t push it any further to the downside”
without hitting technical resistance, King said. “It’s been
moving back and forth in a range.”  Alberta gas for June delivery rose 9 cents, or 2.6 percent,
to C$3.56 per gigajoule ($3.48 per million British thermal
units) as of 2:30 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a
Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to
users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada
Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 13.6 cents, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $4.23 per
million Btu.  Spot Prices Fall  Gas for prompt delivery tumbled as cool weather forecast
for the U.S. Midwest pares air-conditioner use. Chicago will
have a high of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 Celsius), about 15
degrees colder than normal, according to  State College ,
Pennsylvania-based forecaster AccuWeather Inc.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 11.73 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $4.1042 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas slipped 14.46 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $3.8253
per million Btu, according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where
Canadian gas is traded for California markets, gas was down
15.51 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $3.9416.  Alberta System  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.2 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in New York, 51 million above its target
level. Some Alberta producers have been forced to shut gas wells
because of forest fires in the northern portion of the province.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.74 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.59 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 506 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.48 billion cubic feet today, about 75 percent of its
capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
