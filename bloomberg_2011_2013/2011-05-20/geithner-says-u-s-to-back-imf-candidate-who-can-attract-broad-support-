Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the U.S. will support a successor to  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  at the International Monetary Fund who can
“command broad support.”  “We are consulting broadly with the fund’s shareholders
from emerging markets, as well as advanced economies,” Geithner
said in a statement today. “We are prepared to support a
candidate with the requisite, deep experience and leadership
qualities, and who can command broad support among the fund’s
membership. It is important that this be an open process and one
that moves quickly to select new leadership for the IMF.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
