Coal consumption in the U.S. fell 2.7
percent in the week ended yesterday from the previous seven-day
period, led by a decline in the East, according to Genscape Inc.  Eastern power-plant use dropped 3.4 percent while demand in
the West rose 1.2 percent, the data provider said. Overall coal
demand was down 9.7 percent from a year earlier.  Genscape says it monitors coal use in real time at U.S.
power producers with a device that’s installed at the plants.
The company uses different models to reach its consumption
figures, making it possible for regional data to conflict with
national totals.  The U.S., which holds the world’s largest reserves of coal,
relies on the fuel for about 47 percent of its power generation,
compared with about 23 percent for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
