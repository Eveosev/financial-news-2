China ’s high savings rate may lead to
high investment growth and cause overheating, overcapacity or
asset bubbles,  Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the
People’s Bank of China, said at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai
today.  Inflation remains “high” and the Asian nation needs to
strike a balance between economic growth and consumer prices,
Zhou said. China needs to implement prudent macro policies as
soon as possible and must remain alert about the high savings
rate, he said.  The convertibility of the yuan should be a gradual, orderly
mid-to-long-term process, Zhou said. China is “cautiously”
promoting cross-border use of the yuan in financial transactions
in addition to trade and investment, he said. China wants cross-
border yuan to “mainly” support the real economy, he said.  China’s systemically important banks need adequate capital,
Zhou said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
