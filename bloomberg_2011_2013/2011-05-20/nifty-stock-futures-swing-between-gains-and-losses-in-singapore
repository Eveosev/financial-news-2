Indian shares advanced for a second
day, paring a weekly decline, as a drop in commodities prices
and better corporate earnings spurred investor confidence.  Tata Power Co., the biggest electricity generator outside
state control, advanced after boosting annual profit.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nationâ€™s largest engineering company, extended
gains as Religare Capital Markets Ltd. advised investors to buy
the shares after it reported record profit yesterday. New York
oil futures and the London Metal Exchange Index of six
industrial metal prices both sank 1.7 percent yesterday.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
180, or 1 percent, to 18,321.40, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge declined 1.1
percent this week. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange added 1 percent to 5,484.35 and its May futures settled
at 5,479. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.9 percent to 2,259.81.  To contact the reporter on this story:
