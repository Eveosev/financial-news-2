Zimbabwe raised this season’s tobacco
crop estimate by 33 percent, the  Zimbabwe Independent  reported,
citing documents from the Ministry of Finance and the Tobacco
Marketing and Industry Board, which regulates the industry.  The southern African nation may produce 200 million
kilograms (440 million pounds) of the leaf, up from a previous
forecast of 150 million kilograms and ahead of last season’s
123.5 million kilograms, the Harare-based newspaper said.  A 200 million-kilogram tobacco harvest would be the biggest
since President  Robert Mugabe ’ssupporters seized most large-
scale farms in the country more than 10 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
