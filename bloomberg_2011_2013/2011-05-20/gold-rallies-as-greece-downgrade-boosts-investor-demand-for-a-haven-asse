Gold futures rose the most this month
after  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating, boosting the
appeal of the precious metal as a haven asset.  The euro tumbled as much as 1.2 percent against the dollar
after Fitch said a “soft” restructuring of Greece’s debt by
European Union policy makers would be considered a default.
Europe’s financial crisis, accelerating inflation and fighting
in Libya have helped extend gold’s rally into an 11th year, with
prices reaching a record $1,577.40 an ounce on May 2.  “Gold is screaming higher,” said  Matthew Zeman , a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “People are
buying gold as a hedge against the uncertainty in Europe.
There’s a lot of focus again on the euro zone debt crisis.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $16.50, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $1,508.90 at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain since April 29. The price, up 1 percent this
week, has climbed 6.2 percent this year.  “There’s a gravitation toward investments that are
paperless,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Europe’s debt problems are
back under the microscope.”  Gold also gained on signs that demand is increasing in
 China , where inflation is accelerating.  Consumer Prices  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier, topping the 2011 government target of 4 percent
for a fourth straight month. Since mid-October, the central bank
has raised interest rates four times to rein in lending.  “When you hear that a large population source like China
wants to own gold, that bodes well for the metal,” Klopfenstein
said.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 15.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $35.087 an ounce. The price, up 0.2 percent this
week, has climbed 13 percent this year. The metal has tumbled 30
percent from a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $7.35, or 1
percent, to $735.50 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, climbed 4.1 percent this week. The metal
has dropped 8.4 percent in 2011.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose 40 cents to
$1,769.40 an ounce. The price, little changed this week, has
dropped 0.5 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
