China ’s overnight money-market rate
headed for a second weekly advance as banks hoard cash after an
increase in the reserve-requirement ratio took effect this week.  The one-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, had the biggest weekly jump in almost four
months after policy makers lifted the amount of funds lenders
must set aside by 50 basis points from May 18. The People’s Bank
of China will raise the ratio three more times before year-end,
according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  “The high one-day repo reflects liquidity conditions,”
said Chong. “The impact of the reserve-ratio hike is still
lingering.”  The one-day repurchase rate rose 191 basis points this week
to 4 percent as of 11:26 a.m. in  Shanghai , the most since the
period ended Jan. 28, according to the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The seven-day repo increased 42 basis points in the five
days to 4.04 percent, a weighted average compiled by the funding
center showed. It reached 5 percent on May 16, the highest level
since Feb. 23, and climbed 41 basis points today.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point this week to 3.51 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained three basis points today.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 was unchanged today and from a week ago at 3.65 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
