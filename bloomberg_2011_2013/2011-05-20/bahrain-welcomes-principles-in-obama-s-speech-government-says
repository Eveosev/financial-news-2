Bahrain welcomes the “visions and
principles” expressed in U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s speech
yesterday on U.S. policy in the Middle East, the Bahraini
government said in an e-mailed statement.  The principles agree with the “democratic strategy”
adopted by Bahrain under King Hamad bin Isa  Al Khalifa , the
statement said, adding that the government welcomed Obama’s
remarks on Palestine and “hoped that the United States would
take speedy steps to reach practical actions that would reflect
positively on the peace process in the Middle East.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
