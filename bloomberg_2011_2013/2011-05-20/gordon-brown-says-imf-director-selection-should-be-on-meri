The best person for the job should
appointed as managing director of the International Monetary
Fund,  Gordon Brown , the former U.K. prime minister, said.  “I am not interested in who has the job,” he said today
in Johannesburg at a Global Fund for Education press conference,
when asked whether the post should be held by a European or
someone from an emerging-market economy. “It should be on
merit.”  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a 62-year-old French national,
yesterday resigned from the position after being charged with
sexually assaulting a hotel maid in  New York . He is now awaiting
trial.  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in an
interview May 17 that Brown hasn’t asked the British government
to back him as the next IMF head, sidestepping questions on
whether he would support such a bid.  The Financial Times reported the same day that Brown, 60,
who served as chancellor for 10 years and premier for three, had
told friends he had international backing for his candidacy.  As IMF head, Brown, an advocate of fiscal stimulus, would
clash with Osborne over the chancellor’s plans to squeeze public
spending as the economy emerges from recession.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ,, who succeeded Brown last
year, said last month Brown might not be the “most
appropriate” person to head the IMF because the job needs
someone who “understands the danger of excessive debt.”  Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg told Sky News
television two days ago that Brown is “not the right man” to
replace Strauss-Kahn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
