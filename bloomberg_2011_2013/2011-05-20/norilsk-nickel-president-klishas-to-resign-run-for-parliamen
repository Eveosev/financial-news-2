Andrei Klishas, OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel’s president, plans to resign from  Russia ’s biggest mining
company to start a career as a lawmaker in Russia’s lower house
of parliament.  Klishas said by phone that he may run in the Krasnoyarsk
region, where Norilsk produces most of its nickel, as a member
of the United Russia party. He was confirming an earlier report
in the Vedomosti newspaper.  Klishas, 38, was appointed to the post by Norilsk’s Chief
Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky last year to help end a
shareholder conflict between billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s
Interros Holding Co. and Oleg Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal.
Prior to joining Norilsk, Klishas was an executive at Interros.  “I have done what I was supposed to at Norilsk,” Klishas
said. Rusal, which owns 25 percent of Norilsk, and Interros,
which has management control of the world’s biggest nickel
producer, have been embroiled in a feud over running the company
that dates back to 2008.  Vedomosti said today that Klishas may use his status as a
lawmaker to fight Rusal by seeking to ban tolling, whereby
materials are processed by a Russian plant for a fee and the
finished product is exported and sold by a foreign-registered
company.  “I don’t have a goal of fighting with Rusal,” Klishas
told Bloomberg. He said he plans to propose corporate governance
procedures as the law should serve to “increase the value of
Russian industry and its competitiveness”.  The State Duma elections are scheduled for December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
