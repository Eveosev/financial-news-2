Most Asian stocks fell, with the
regional benchmark index set for a third straight weekly drop,
as raw material producers declined on lower metal and oil prices
utilities tumbled as Tokyo Electric Power Co. reported Japan’s
biggest corporate loss in eight years.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s No. 1 carmaker, and
 Brambles Ltd. (BXB) , the world’s largest supplier of wooden pallets,
advanced at least 1.4 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, fell 1.7 percent in Sydney as oil and
metal futures dropped. Kansai Electric Power Co. slumped 4.9
percent, leading declines in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, after
Tokyo Electric, owner of the nuclear reactor crippled by the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami, posted a record loss.  “The market may have become oversold amid selling in the
past three weeks,” said  Shane Oliver , head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $98
billion in Sydney. “The soft patch of economic data from the
U.S., along with tightening concerns in  China , the recession in
 Japan  and  Europe ’s debt crisis will leave a volatile environment
for the market in the next few months.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.1 percent to 134.82 as
of 7:27 p.m. in Tokyo, after swinging between gains and losses
at least 10 times. About five stocks fell for every four that
rose. The gauge is heading for its third weekly drop, the
longest streak of weekly declines since November.  The regional benchmark index last week recorded its second
straight weekly drop amid concern that China’s anti-inflation
policies may slow global economic growth and as the U.S. Federal
Reserve prepares to end a $600 billion asset-purchase program
known as quantitative easing.  Bank of Japan  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closed 0.1 percent lower.
The Bank of Japan’s policy board unanimously voted to maintain
monetary policy even after a report yesterday showed the country
slipped into a recession following a record earthquake in March.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index lost 0.6 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
advanced 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent even as
developers dropped after Chief Executive Donald Tsang yesterday
said the city’s property market is becoming unaffordable,
sparking concern the government will take more steps to curb
home prices.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.2 percent to
1,343.60 yesterday after a government report showing a bigger-
than-forecast drop in jobless claims last week bolstered
optimism about the economic recovery.  Japan Utilities  A gauge of utility companies was the biggest drag on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index as Japanese electricity producers
declined before Tepco, as the owner of the nuclear reactor
crippled by the March earthquake is known, reported record
losses. After the market close, Tepco posted a full-year net
loss of 1.25 trillion yen ($15 billion), the biggest loss by a
Japanese company in eight years. President Masataka Shimizu will
resign, the company said in a statement today.  Kansai Electric sank 4.9 percent to 1,331 yen, and Chubu
Electric Power Co. lost 4.7 percent to 1,222 yen, the lowest
levels since 1985. Tepco gained 2.5 percent to 367 yen paring its
plunge this week to 19 percent.   “There are too many unclear negative factors,” including
the government’s scheme for compensation for the nuclear issues
and overhaul of the nation’s energy industry, said  Tsutomu
Yamada , a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities Co. in  Tokyo .  Tepco’s loss eclipsed the 812 billion yen deficit reported
by Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. in the year ended March
2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mizuho Financial
Group Inc.’s 2.38 trillion yen loss the following year holds the
record.  Best Performers  HTC increased 0.4 percent to NT$1,205 in Taipei. Hyundai
Motor, which gets about 13 percent of its sales from North
America, advanced 3.2 percent to 241,000 won in Seoul. Brambles
added 1.4 percent to A$7.37 in Sydney.  Giant Manufacturing Co., a Taiwanese bicycle maker that
receives 39 percent of sales from the Americas, climbed 6.7
percent to NT$105 in Taipei, the best performer on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. UBS AG raised its rating on the stock to “buy”
from “neutral,” saying a recent selloff was “overdone.”  Hana Financial Group Inc., South Korea’s fourth-largest
bank, jumped 4.2 percent to 38,300 won in Seoul. The company
agreed with  Lone Star Funds  to extend the May 24 deadline for
Hana’s 4.7 trillion won ($4.3 billion) purchase of a controlling
stake in Korea Exchange Bank, Chairman Kim Seung Yu said.  Manufacturing growth in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly eased in May to the slowest pace in seven months, a
sign the  U.S. economy  may get less of a boost from the industry
that led it out of its last recession. Another report showed
sales of existing homes unexpectedly declined in April,
indicating the industry is struggling to gain traction as the
economy expands.  ‘Investors Are Wary’  “Expectations for the U.S. economic outlook are slightly
decreasing and there’s a mood investors are wary of buying
stocks,” said Norikazu Kitta, a strategist at Tokyo-based Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “However, the stable yen and gains in
U.S. stocks are positive for the market.”  Among stocks that fell, BHP dropped 1.7 percent to A$44.05.
 Rio Tinto Ltd. (RIO) , the world’s second-largest mining company by
sales, slipped 1.1 percent to A$80.20. Aluminum Corp. of China
Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 producer of the lightweight metal, lost
0.6 percent to HK$6.91 in Hong Kong. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
biggest energy explorer, declined 4 percent to 532,000 yen.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled 1.7 percent to $98.44 a
barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
declined 1.7 percent yesterday.  In Hong Kong,  Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101)  decreased 2.1
percent to HK$32.15, while  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the
world’s biggest developer, slid 0.5 percent to HK$120.60. Kerry
Properties Ltd., a Hong Kong-based builder controlled by the
family of Malaysian billionaire  Robert Kuok , decreased 0.8
percent to HK$38.65.  The city’s property market is showing “red lights” for
affordability, Tsang said at the Legislative Council yesterday.
The government in November increased property transaction taxes
and pledged to boost land supply amid public protests that
housing prices are becoming unaffordable.  Japanese exporters gained after the yen depreciated. The
yen fell to as low as 117.24 against the euro, compared with
116.48 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Against
the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to as low as 82.23 from
81.68. A lower yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Hitachi Ltd., an electronics and power-equipment maker that
derives 40 percent of its revenue abroad, advanced 0.4 percent
to 462 yen.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the world’s second-largest maker of
flash memory chips, increased 0.9 percent to 435 yen. TDK Corp.,
an electronics manufacturer that derives more than 80 percent of
its revenue abroad, climbed 2.3 percent to 4,315 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.8 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
