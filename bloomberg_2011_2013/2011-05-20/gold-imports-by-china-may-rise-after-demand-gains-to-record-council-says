Gold imports by  China  may increase
after investment demand more than doubled in the first quarter,
with the country overtaking India to become the largest market
for gold coins and bars, the World Gold Council said.  China produced 340 metric tons of gold last year and
consumption was about 700 tons, leaving a gap of 350 tons to 360
tons, Albert Cheng, Far East managing director at the council,
said yesterday. “With increasing demand in China we will have
to rely on imports to fill the gap between demand and supply.”
China is the world’s largest gold producer and second-largest in
overall consumption.  China’s investment demand jumped 123 percent to 90.9 tons
in the first three months, compared with an 8 percent rise to
85.6 tons for  India , the council said. Bullion jumped to a
record $1,577.57 an ounce this month as investors sought a store
of value amid rising inflation and concerns about the strength
of the global recovery.  “Gold has taken on a new role in China amid concern about
inflation,” Song Qing, a director at Lion Fund Management Co.,
said by phone from Shanghai. “It is increasingly being seen as
an asset allocation choice. Just imagine the total wealth in
China and even a small percentage of that choosing to buy gold.
This demand is going to be enormous.”  China imported more than 300 tons last year, People’s Bank
of China Vice Governor  Yi Gang  said on Feb. 26 in Beijing. The
government does not publish official statistics on gold imports.  The country’s total gold demand in the first quarter jumped
47 percent from a year ago to 233.8 tons, the council said. That
still lags behind Indian consumption of 291.8 tons, according to
the council.  Inflation Fear  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier, exceeding the government’s 2011 target of 4
percent for the fourth month. The People’s Bank of China has
since mid-October raised  interest rates  four times and boosted
banks’ reserve requirement ratio eight times to a record 21
percent to rein in lending and prevent inflows of capital from
overseas flooding the financial system.  “The headline number is above 5 percent, yet some Chinese
consumers feel much higher inflation in their day-to-day life,”
Lion Fund’s Song said. “Inflation, coupled with concern about
uncertainties in the global recovery, is fueling demand.”  The culture’s deep-rooted preference for the precious
metal, the impending inflationary fears in emerging markets, and
limited domestic investment channels will all drive further
growth in the Chinese gold demand, the council said in a report.
Demand for gold jewelry gained 21 percent in the first quarter
from a year ago to a record 142.9 tons.  Investment Demand  Investment demand has grown by an average 14 percent a year
since deregulation of the market in 2001, “a trend that has
continued with the strong growth momentum witnessed in the first
quarter,” it said.  Jewelry demand has more than doubled in the last seven
years to 451.8 tons in 2010, from 224.1 tons in 2004. India and
China combined to contribute 63 percent of the total gold
jewelry demand in the world in the first quarter, it said.  The metal increased 5.8 percent this year after a 30
percent rally in 2010, keeping it on course for an 11th straight
annual advance. Immediate-delivery bullion gained 0.6 percent to
$1,502.75 an ounce at 5:13 p.m. in  Shanghai .  --Rong Feiwen. With assistance from Dieter Depypere in Beijing.
