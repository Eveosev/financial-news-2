Two of the three Browns Ferry
reactors in  Alabama , sidelined after storms and tornadoes April
27 killed hundreds across the South, will be started by the
 Tennessee Valley Authority  in the next several days, a company
spokesman said.  Repairs to the 500-kilovolt and 161-kilovolt transmission
lines that send electricity to about 150 towns across 80,000
square miles in seven states, including Memphis and Knoxville,
Tennessee, have progressed enough to allow Unit 1 to begin
powering up today, Ray Golden said in a telephone interview.  “We’re only ready at this point to start up one,” Golden
said. “The second one will follow behind that, a few days
behind it.”  The 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 is operating at less than
3 percent of capacity and will connect to the grid when it
reaches about 15 percent, Golden said. The third unit will
follow the others into service when repairs are more complete,
he said. He couldn’t say exactly when.  About 12 of 108 transmission lines used by the plant are
still down, he said.  There was no storm damage to the reactors, located 84 miles
(135 kilometers) north of Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the
 Tennessee  line, he said. The plant was taken out of service
because the grid couldn’t distribute the electricity it was
producing.  Browns Ferry has a combined capacity of 3,284 megawatts,
enough to power 2.6 million average U.S. homes, according to
U.S. Energy Department statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
