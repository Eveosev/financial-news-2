Georgian lawmakers voted today to
recognize the 19th-century killing and deportation of North
Caucasus natives by Tsarist  Russia  as genocide, becoming the
first country to do so, parliament member Giorgi Gabashvili
said.  Georgia says Circassians, the indigenous peoples of the
Northwest Caucasus, were murdered and exiled as Russian forces
took over the region in the Caucasus War between 1817 and 1864.
While Russia hasn’t apologized for what happened, former
president Boris Yelstin called the events tragic in 1994.  Georgia’s parliament unanimously approved the “historic”
decision at a vote attended by members of the Circassia
community in Tbilisi, Gabashvili told reporters. While the move
may anger Russia, it should accept the decision “in a civilized
manner,” he added.  Relations between the two counties are strained after
Russia won a five-day war with its southern neighbour over the
separatist region of South Ossetia in August 2008. While Russia
recognizes the region as an independent state and has agreed to
defend its borders,  Georgia  still claims sovereignty over it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
