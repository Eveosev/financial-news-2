India ’s 10-year bonds completed a
sixth weekly decline on speculation the central bank will raise
benchmark  interest rates  further to curb inflation.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lifted the repurchase rate by 0.5
percentage point to 7.25 percent on May 3, the ninth increase
since the start of last year and the most by any monetary
authority in  Asia . Inflation may stay around 9 percent until
September because of higher fuel prices, the central bank said
in a statement after the latest policy decision.  “There could be at least a 25 basis-point increase in
interest rates in June,” said A.Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-based
deputy general manager in charge of fixed-income at Bank of
Maharashtra. “This may slow down inflation further.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 climbed
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, this week to 8.35
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the highest level for a 10-year
benchmark bond since October 2008, Bloomberg data show.  The commerce ministry said May 16 that the inflation rate
was 8.66 percent in April, compared with the 8.50 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The South Asian nation
raised domestic gasoline prices by the most in almost three
years last weekend after an almost 10 percent advance in the
cost of oil this year.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, gained four basis points this week to 8.1150 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
