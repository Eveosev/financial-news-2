Canadian mills processed 8 percent
less canola and 5.5 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended May
18, compared with a week earlier, an industry group said.  Mills crushed 106,848 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 27,796 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
