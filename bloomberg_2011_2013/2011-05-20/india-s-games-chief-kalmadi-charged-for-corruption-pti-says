Indian investigators charged  Suresh Kalmadi , the chief organizer of last year’s Delhi Commonwealth
Games, for irregularities in awarding the event’s results system
to a Swiss company, the Press Trust of India reported.  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  charged eight others,
including the organizing committee’s former secretary general,
Lalit Bhanot, and sought their prosecution for criminal
conspiracy and forging documents, the  news agency  said.  Two companies, Swiss Timing-Omega and AKR Construction Ltd.,
were also charged. Swiss Timing, a unit of the Swatch Group, in
December said it had not influenced the award of the contract
for the Oct. 3-14 Games. All deny wrongdoing.  Investigators say the deal was overpriced and caused a loss
to the exchequer of 900 million rupees ($20 million), according
to the bureau’s chargesheet. Kalmadi, who was arrested on April
25, is in jail awaiting trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
