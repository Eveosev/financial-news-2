The cost of insuring government and
corporate debt was little changed in  Europe , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 2 basis points to 186. Contracts on  Greece 
rose 3 basis points to 1,325, Ireland fell 2 to 625 and Portugal
declined 1 to 624, while Italy decreased 1.5 to 152.5 and  Spain 
was unchanged at 247.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 1 basis point to 358 and
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings held at 98.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 1 basis points to 142.5 and the
subordinated index was 3 higher at 242.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
