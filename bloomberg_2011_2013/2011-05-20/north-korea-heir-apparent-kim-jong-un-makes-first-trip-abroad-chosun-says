North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il 
visited China today, the  Chosun Ilbo  reported after saying
earlier that it was his son and heir-apparent, Kim Jong Un, on
the trip.  The younger Kim, vice chairman of the Workers Party of
Korea’s Central Military Commission, was not among the North
Korean delegation led by Kim Jong Il, the Korean-language
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified official in the
office of South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak .  Sohn Jie Ae, a spokeswoman at Lee’s office declined to
comment, as did Cho Byung Jae, a spokesman at South Korea’s
foreign ministry and Lee Jong Joo, a spokeswoman at the
Unification Ministry in Seoul.  Kim Jong Il last visited China in August, a month before
his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, was appointed to the second
highest military post within the party, in a move paving the way
for him to become the totalitarian state’s next leader.  China 
has had an open invitation to the junior Kim, thought to be in
his late 20’s, since his appointment, South Korean officials
have said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
