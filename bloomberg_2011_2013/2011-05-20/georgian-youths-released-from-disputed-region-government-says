Georgia  said four youths detained
by Russian forces on the border of the separatist South
Ossetia region were released today, a spokesman for Georgia’s
Interior Ministry said by phone today in Tbilisi.  Russian soldiers held the detainees for about a day
before returning them early this morning in a good condition,
Zurab Gvenetadze. They were arrested while collecting edible
plants on May 18.  In a separate incident on the same day, two Georgian
civilians were shot and wounded nearby and are recovering in a
Georgian hospital, according to the ministry.  South Ossetia said a group of Georgian citizens crossed
the border illegally and were detained, the New York-based
Georgian Daily website reported May 18, citing a statement
from the region’s security service. Unidentified people then
fired on South Ossetian border guards in an effort to free
those detained, the website said, adding that fire was
returned. Georgia denied shots were fired into South Ossetia.  Russia  defeated Georgia in a five-day war over the
separatist region in August 2008. While Russia recognizes the
South Ossetia as an independent state and has agreed to defend
its borders, Georgia still claims sovereignty over the
territory.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili condemned the
incident yesterday and called on Russia to open talks in a bid
to stop what he describes as a Russian military buildup in the
region. The Russian government has repeatedly called on
Saakashvili to sign a no-force agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
