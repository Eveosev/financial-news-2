President  Barack Obama  urged
congressional leaders to adopt a resolution supporting U.S.
military actions against Libya.  In a letter to leaders of the House and Senate, Obama said
a pending resolution “would confirm that the Congress supports
the U.S. mission in Libya and that both branches are united in
their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan
people for political reform and self-government.”  Obama ordered military actions against Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime in March. Since then the mission’s lead has been
transferred to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
U.S. role is “more limited,” Obama said in the letter released
by the administration.  An expression of support by Congress, he said, “would
underline the U.S. commitment” to aid rebels in Libya and
reinforce the “a unity of purpose” between the executive the
legislative branches of Congress.  The resolution is sponsored by Democratic Senators  John Kerry  of Massachusetts, Carl Levin of Michigan and Dianne Feinstein of California, Republican Senators  John McCain  of
Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and independent  Joe Lieberman  of Connecticut.  Obama has come under criticism from some lawmakers who say
he didn’t consult with Congress before taking military action.
His rationale for intervening in Libya also has been questioned
within Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
