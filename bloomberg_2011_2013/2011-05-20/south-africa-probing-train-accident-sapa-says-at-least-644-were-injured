South Africa ’s Railway Safety
Regulator said it is investigating a train collision in which
more than 700 people were injured in Soweto.  At least 70 of the passengers were seriously hurt in the
accident, the Johannesburg-based regulator’s spokeswoman,
Lavinia Engelbrecht, said in an e-mailed statement. No-one died
in the crash in which a Metrorail train smashed into a
stationary Soweto Business Express train just before 6 p.m. in
Johannesburg yesterday, she said.  The probe could take anything from three weeks up to a few
months to complete, she said.  “Unless the quality of our trains and rail safety systems
are immediately improved there are going to be more and worse
accidents,” the United Transport & Allied Trade Union said.
“Government has been hearing these warnings from its own rail
executives and from labor for more than a decade” yet invested
in freight rail instead of safety equipment and commuter
services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
