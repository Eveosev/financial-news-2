The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

Colcap Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,710.5.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  , Colombia’s biggest lender, rose
1.7 percent to 29,180 pesos. Leasing Bancolombia SA, the
company’s leasing arm, plans to sell as much as 500 billion
pesos ($275 million) of bonds in the local market on May 25. The
Medellin-based financial company will initially offer 350
billion pesos of securities, Serfinco SA brokerage, which is
helping manage the sale, said in a report today.  Leasing Bancolombia will offer 5-year and 10.5-year fixed-
rate bonds, 10-year inflation-linked securities, 2-year debt
tied to the DTF interbank rate and 1.5-year and 3-year bonds
linked to the IBR interbank rate, Serfinco wrote, citing
“preliminary” plans.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in  South America , gained 0.7
percent to 2,130 pesos. The  American Petroleum Institute 
reported that fuel consumption increased in April as economic
growth bolstered demand for diesel by truckers.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s largest textile maker,
rose 6 percent to 53 pesos, its highest close since 2007, after
the company said in a regulatory filing late yesterday it paid
off most of its debts. Fabricato, which is preparing to emerge
from bankruptcy, has surged 97 percent this year, the biggest
gain among companies on Colombia’s Colcap Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
