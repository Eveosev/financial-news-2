More than two thirds of banks reduced
their U.K. commercial property loans last year, and the amount
of outstanding real-estate debt has fallen 10 percent in the
past 12 months, according to a study by De Montfort University,
Leicester, the Financial Times reported.  Half of the outstanding 224 billion pounds ($364 billion)
of loans will mature in 2013 and a fifth are still in breach or
default after the real-estate slump, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
