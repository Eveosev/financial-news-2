The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:35 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.5 percent to 14,046.47, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,698.96.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest oil company,
fell 0.9 percent to 3,930 pesos as oil dropped. Crude headed for
its second weekly decline this month, as the German Bundesbank
said growth in  Europe ’s largest economy will probably slow and
the euro weakened against the dollar.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, dropped 1.1
percent to 47,660 pesos, its lowest in eight months.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s largest textile maker,
rose the most in a month, adding 6 percent to 53 pesos, after
Chief Executive Officer Oscar Ivan Zuluaga resigned yesterday.
The Medellin-based company also said in a regulatory filing late
yesterday that it has paid off most of its debts under
bankruptcy protection and still owes 19 billion pesos ($10.5
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
