Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Neal Wolin said that the panel that reviews potential national-
security implications in proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S.
companies doesn’t discriminate by country or industry.  China  has
urged the U.S. to allow more Chinese investment.  Wolin made the following remarks in the text of a speech
delivered today in  Singapore  that was distributed by e-mail by
the Treasury Department. CFIUS is the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the U.S., which is headed by the Treasury
secretary.  “Unless a transaction presents a threat to the U.S.
national security, we not only permit it, we welcome it.  “The vast majority of foreign investments do not raise
national security concerns. And the vast majority of notified
transactions are cleared by CFIUS without any mitigation or
conditions. From 2008-2010, only 16 cases out of 313 covered
transactions -- or 5 percent -- resulted in the use of
mitigation measures.  “CFIUS does not discriminate among the countries of
companies seeking to invest in the  United States , nor among the
sectors in which they’d like to invest.  “CFIUS applies the same rules to each transaction it
reviews, without regard to the investor’s country of origin. And
CFIUS does not maintain a ‘sector list’ or apply differential
treatment to investments in some sectors, despite some outside
views that certain sectors may be ‘sensitive.’ The United States
welcomes investment in our entire economy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
