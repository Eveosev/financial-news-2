Cotton futures fell for the second
straight day amid signs that global demand is shrinking.  Orange
juice  dropped.  The Confederation of the Indian Textile Industry said this
week that it plans to cut production by a third because of a
“huge decline” in demand. India is the world’s second-biggest
cotton producer. Prices have plunged 29 percent since touching a
record in March as consumption eased in China, the world’s
biggest user.  “Sinking demand is a problem, as shown by India cutting
production,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana. “The cotton market won’t support higher
prices.”  Cotton for July delivery dropped 0.04 cent to settle at
$1.5561 a pound at 2:38 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Last month, the fiber tumbled 21 percent as demand eased in
 China  following a rally to a record $2.197 on March 7.  The price still gained 7.2 percent this week, the most
since early March. Futures rose as adverse weather threatened
crops in China, the leading grower, and the U.S., the top
exporter.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery dropped 3.2 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $1.8175 a pound. The price is down 0.6
percent this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
