Burundian inflation accelerated to
8.4 percent in April as food and fuel prices increased, said
Antoine Gahiru, an information officer at the Burundian
Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies.  The inflation rate climbed from 5.7 percent in March,
Gahiru said yesterday in a phone interview from Bujumbura, the
capital. The increase “is explained by the rise in prices of
products such as gasoline and the prices of and drink,” he said.  Global food prices rose to near a record in April as grain
costs advanced, according to the Food and Agricultural
Organization. Burundi’s government raised gasoline prices by 4
percent this month, the fourth increase this year, citing higher
costs of crude on international markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
