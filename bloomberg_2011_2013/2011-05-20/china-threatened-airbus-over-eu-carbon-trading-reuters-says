China  threatened retaliation against
Airbus SAS because the European Union is including international
aviation in its carbon market,  Reuters reported,  citing three
sources that it didn’t identify.  The EU will require all airlines flying to  Europe  to be
included in the emissions trading system starting Jan. 1, 2012.
China’s aviation authority opposes the measure, saying it will
cost Chinese airlines 800 million yuan ($123 million) in the
first year and more than triple that by 2020, according to the
report. There will be direct consequences for Airbus and
European carriers, one of the people was cited as saying,
without giving any details.  A compromise could involve using provisions in the carbon
market’s rules to exempt flights from any country that can show
it is taking equivalent steps to cut emissions from aviation,
Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
