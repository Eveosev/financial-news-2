Egyptian security forces raided the
offices of non-governmental organizations as part of an
investigation into 17 groups for alleged illegal foreign funding
“and associated crimes,” the state-run Middle East News Agency
said.  The places targeted include the Cairo office of the
Washington-based National Democratic Institute. “They are
clearing out all of our documents and computers,” Lila Jaafar,
a program director for the organization, said by telephone
during the raid.  Egypt ’s military rulers, who took over from former
President  Hosni Mubarak  after he stepped down in February, have
been accused of using excessive force against protesters during
recent demonstrations, a charge they deny. The army, which has
accused “foreign hands” of fomenting unrest in the country,
has come under renewed pressure from protesters to hand over
power to civilians.  “This is a campaign that has been in the making for a
while,” Gamal Eid, a human rights lawyer, said by telephone.
“The campaign will escalate to silence all the voices that have
criticized violations by the military.”  A Cairo court today acquitted five police officers of
charges of killing protesters during the anti-Mubarak revolt
that started in January, Mena reported, in a move likely to
anger protesters who have been demanding punishment for those
behind the killings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
