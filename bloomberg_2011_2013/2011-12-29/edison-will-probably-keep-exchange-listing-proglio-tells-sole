Edison SpA (EDN)  will probably keep its
stock exchange listing after  Electricite de France SA (EDF)  boosted
its stake in Italyâ€™s second-largest utility, Chief Executive
Officer Henri Proglio told  Il Sole 24 Ore  in an interview.  The agreement to raise its stake to 80.7 percent announced
this week was much better for EDF than previous proposals,
Italian newspaper cited the CEO as saying. Proglio said he was
confident that market regulator Consob will approve the 84 euro-
cent per-share purchase price, Il Sole reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
