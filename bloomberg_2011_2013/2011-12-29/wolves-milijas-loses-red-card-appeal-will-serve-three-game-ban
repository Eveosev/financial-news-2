Wolverhampton midfielder Nenad
Milijas lost his appeal of the red card he received against
Arsenal and will serve a three-match suspension.  Milijas was dismissed by referee Stuart Atwell for a
challenge against Mikel Arteta in Wolves’ 1-1 tie at the
Emirates Stadium two days ago.  The Football Association’s disciplinary committee dismissed
the appeal today and Milijas’s automatic ban will begin with the
game at Bolton in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
