Nigeria ’s naira weakened against the
dollar on a shortage of U.S. currency after the central bank
closed its twice-weekly foreign-currency auctions for the year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.3
percent to 163.45 per dollar as of 12:25 p.m. in Lagos,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is shortage of dollars relative to demand as there
is no official foreign-currency auction this week,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment
Ltd. said by phone today. “Pressure is however eased on the
naira from intermittent dollar sales by the  oil companies .”  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band at the auctions to 155 naira per dollar from
150 naira as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased
pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of
foreign income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Nigeria closed its foreign-currency auctions for the year
on Dec. 21 and will reopen in January, Muhammed Abdullahi, a
spokesman for the central bank in Abuja, said on Dec. 21.  Ghana’s cedi was weakest for about two weeks as it declined
0.3 percent to 1.6425 per dollar as of 12:25 p.m. in Accra, the
nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
