The Canadian dollar rose to the
highest level since January against the euro on speculation the
 European Central Bank  will need to increase cash injections
after  Italy  failed to sell the maximum amount at debt auctions.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie, rose against a majority
of its most-traded peers including the U.S. dollar on optimism
the American economy is gaining momentum, spurring demand for
currencies linked to growth. Stocks advanced as a report showed
U.S. jobless claims dropped to a three-year low in the past
month.  “Euro-zone issues still being unresolved have driven the
ECB to start lowering rates,” said  Steve Butler , director of
foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s
Scotia Capital unit. “Better data out of the U.S. is starting
to bring some optimism back into the  U.S. economy . That is
certainly good news for us here in Canada.”  The loonie gained 0.3 percent to C$1.3221 against the euro
at 5 p.m. Toronto time, after touching C$1.3173, the most since
Jan. 18. It rose 0.4 percent C$1.0199 per  U.S. dollar . One
Canadian dollar buys 98.05 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 1.1 percent.
Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, gained 0.2
percent to $99.79 a barrel in  New York .  The loonie rose against the 17-nation currency, which
dropped to the weakest in 15 months versus the dollar, as Italy
sold 7.02 billion euros ($9.06 billion) of debt due from 2014 to
2022, less than its original target of as much as 8.5 billion
euros.  ‘Holiday-Thinned Markets’  The ECB said yesterday its balance sheet climbed to a
record after it increased lending to banks in the region last
week. The yen strengthened against most of its major
counterparts as speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen
spurred demand for safer assets.  Scotia Capital predicted the Canadian dollar will trade at
C$1.02 versus the greenback by the end of the first quarter, and
trade at C$1.3150 against the euro.  “We are in one of the least liquid times of the year with
month-, quarter- and year-end all upon us, and holiday-thinned
markets contributing to whippier than normal pricing
movements,” Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based director of foreign
exchange at Bank of Montreal, wrote in a note to clients today.  “A bullish outside reversal” yesterday has technical
indicators moving higher from oversold levels and shifts the
focus back to the “topside” for the U.S. dollar versus the
Canadian at C$1.0423 to C$1.0441, Perrier wrote.  Government Bonds  Canadian government bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year
yielding 1.94 percent, down one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point. The nation’s 10-year securities yield four basis points
more than their equivalent-maturity U.S. peers.  Canada ’s government bonds have returned 9.6 percent this
year, the most since 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data.  Canada’s dollar is little changed this week against the
greenback, trailing the yen and Taiwanese dollar among the 16
most-traded currencies. The loonie is poised to lose 0.3 percent
this month and 2.3 percent for the year. It’s up 2.8 percent
this quarter.  Fewer Americans filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  over the past month than at any time in the past three
years, a sign the U.S. labor market is on the mend heading into
the new year.  The four-week moving average for claims, a less volatile
measure than the weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week,
the lowest level since June 2008, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . Applications rose for the first time
in a month in the week ended Dec. 24, climbing by a more-than-
forecast 15,000 to 381,000.  “Year-end flow certainly looks like more U.S. dollar
buying,” said  Scotia Capital ’s Butler. He predicted the
Canadian dollar may weaken to C$1.04. “I expect the euro to
find some stability, but I think it can probably head down to
$1.20. It’s come a long way and we’re sure to have a few nasty
bounces before we get there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
