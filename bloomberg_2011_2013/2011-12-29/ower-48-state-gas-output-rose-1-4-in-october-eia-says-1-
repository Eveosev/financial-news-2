U.S. natural gas production in the
lower 48 states rose 1.4 percent in October because of increased
offshore output, the Energy Department reported.  Output in the lower 48 states climbed to 71.28 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 70.32 billion in September, the
departmentâ€™s Energy Information Administration said today in the
monthly EIA-914 report, released at noon in  Washington .  Total U.S. production rose 1.3 percent to 80.1 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 79.05 billion.  Texas production increased 0.5 percent to 22.14 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 22.02 billion, the government
said in the report. Production from  Louisiana , which includes
the Haynesville Shale, fell 0.7 percent to 8.8 billion, and
Wyoming output gained 2.9 percent to 6.7 billion.  Output from the Gulf of Mexico gained 9 percent to 4.49
billion cubic feet a day as wells came back online after
shutting for Tropical Storm Lee, the government said.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 9.4 cents, or 3
percent, to $3.027 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since Sept. 11,
2009. Prices have declined 31 percent this year.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
