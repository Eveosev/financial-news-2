The local council of the Hungarian
city of Hodmezovasarhely has asked  Erste Group Bank (EBS)  AG’s
Hungarian unit to share foreign-currency losses on the
municipality’s Swiss-franc denominated bonds, state news service
 MTI  said, citing a letter the city sent to the bank.  The municipality issued bonds worth 69.4 million Swiss
francs ($74 million) in 2006 at an exchange rate of 173.4 forint
per franc while the current rate is above 251 forint, MTI said,
citing the letter signed by Mayor Janos Lazar, who is also the
ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group leader.  The municipality is servicing its debt, however, it doesn’t
acknowledge the entire amount of the outstanding debt, the
letter said, according to MTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
