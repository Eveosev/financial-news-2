Serbia agreed on new natural gas
purchasing prices with  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , cutting the cost
for consumers in Serbia by 12 percent, the nation’s gas monopoly
Srbijagas said.  The Balkan nation will be paying $478 instead of $545 per
1,000 cubic meters of natural gas in the first quarter of 2012,
Srbijagas said, adding that the annex will serve to bridge the
period until the two sides sign a new long-term contract.  Dusan Bajatovic, the general manager of state-run
Srbijagas, said on Dec. 27 the new long-term pact will be signed
in March and that Serbia plans to gradually expand imports to 5
billion cubic meters a year from 2 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
