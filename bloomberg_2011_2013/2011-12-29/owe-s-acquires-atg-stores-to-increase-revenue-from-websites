Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the world’s second-
largest home improvement chain, bought ATG Stores to accelerate
online sales of lighting, tools and furnishings.  ATG will operate as a Lowe’s unit and will remain based in
Kirkland, Washington, Lowe’s said today in a statement.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Lowe’s will add ATG’s more than 500 websites as Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Niblock  spends a record amount on
technology in the fiscal year through January. The company,
based in Mooresville, North Carolina, is doubling the number of
lowes.com items to 260,000 and equipping employees with iPhones
after trailing larger Home Depot Inc. in same-store sales.  ATG sells more than 3.5 million items online after starting
its first website, LightingUniverse.com, in 1999, according to
the statement. Karen Cobb, a Lowe’s spokeswoman, said the
company won’t disclose ATG’s revenue.  Lowe’s rose 2.5 percent to $25.68 at the close in  New York .
The  shares (LOW)  have gained 2.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
