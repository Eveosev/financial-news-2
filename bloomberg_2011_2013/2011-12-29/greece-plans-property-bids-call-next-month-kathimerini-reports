Greece ’s Asset Development Fund
plans to call for expressions of interest in January for four
real-estate concessions or sales,  Kathimerini  said, without
citing anyone.  Lamda Development SA (LAMDA)  is interested in buying the
International Broadcast Center, which was built for the 2004
Athens  Olympic Games  and houses Lamda’s Golden Hall commercial
center, the Athens-based newspaper reported. Plans for the
Asteras hotel units in Vouliagmeni, south of Athens, are being
coordinated with  National Bank of Greece (ETE)  SA, the biggest
shareholder, Kathimerini said.  The fund will seek investors interested in tourism and
recreation-center development for a property on the island of
Rhodes and second one on Corfu, both of which have golf courses,
the newspaper said. No revenue targets have been set, according
to Kathimerini.  To contact the reporter on this story:
