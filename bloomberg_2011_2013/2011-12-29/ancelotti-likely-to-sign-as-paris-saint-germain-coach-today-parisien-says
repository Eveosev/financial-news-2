Italian soccer coach  Carlo Ancelotti 
arrived in Paris yesterday and is likely to sign on as Paris
Saint-Germain’s new coach today, Le Parisien reported, without
citing anyone.  Ancelotti, who won national championships coaching Italy’s
AC Milan and England’s Chelsea FC, will make as much as 7
million euros ($9 million) a year, making him the best paid
coach in France, the newspaper said.  Ancelotti will replace Antoine Kombouare, who was fired
last week even though PSG are in first place in the French
league. The Qatari Investment Authority bought control of PSG
this year with plans to build it into one of  Europe ’s top teams.
Former England international  David Beckham  is also in talks to
join PSG, which last won the French championship in 1994.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
