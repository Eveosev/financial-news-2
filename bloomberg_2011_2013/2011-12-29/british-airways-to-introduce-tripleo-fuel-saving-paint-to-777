British Airways (IAG)  plans to introduce
fuel-saving paint to a Boeing Co. 777-200 after successful
trials on an Airbus SAS A318 serving  New York  and  London .  The coating, made by TripleO, reduces debris build up and
improves aerodynamics, the London-based airline said in an e-
mailed statement. British Airways aims to save more than 100,000
pounds ($150,000) during the testing period, the airline said.  Rising fuel prices have driven airlines to seek new ways of
cutting weight and improving efficiency to allow the planes to
fly with less fuel. In November, for example, Israelâ€™s El Al
signed a contract with privately-held WheelTug, based in
Gibraltar, to use electric motors to move aircraft on the
ground.  To contact the reporter on this story:
