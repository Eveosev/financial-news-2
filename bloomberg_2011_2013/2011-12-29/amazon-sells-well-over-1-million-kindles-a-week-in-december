Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest
Internet retailer, said it sold “well over” 1 million Kindles
a week in December, with record demand led by its Kindle Fire
tablet.  The top three sellers on Amazon’s website were the Kindle
Fire and two electronic readers, the Kindle Touch and Kindle,
Seattle-based Amazon said today in a statement. Gifting of
Kindle books rose 175 percent from a year earlier in the period
from Nov. 25 to Christmas Day, Amazon said without providing
sales data.  The company introduced the Kindle Fire, which has a 7-inch
display and sells for less than half the price of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
least-expensive iPad, on Sept. 28 in a bid to erode Apple’s
dominance. Amazon is releasing a Fire update to improve
performance, make touch navigation easier and let users choose
what items are displayed, after some users complained.  Amazon fell 3.2 percent to $168.35 at 9:38 a.m. New York
time. The shares declined 3.4 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
