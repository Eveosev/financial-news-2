Corn growers in Argentina, the
world’s second-biggest shipper  of the grain, say crops in the
major producing areas of  Buenos Aires  and  Santa Fe  are enduring
dryness and it’s “too soon” to talk of potential losses.  “We are still optimistic,” Martin Fraguio, executive
director of the Maizar corn association, said today in a
telephone interview from the group’s headquarters in Buenos
Aires. “Crops in Buenos Aires and Santa Fe are at the
vegetative stage and can endure a lack of humidity.”  Corn crops in the two provinces, which account for about
half of the country’s output, are to enter the critical stage of
flowering in mid-January, he said.  “If fields don’t get rains during flowering, then I would
be utterly worried,” he said.  Argentina, the world’s second-largest exporter after the
U.S., harvested 21.6 million metric tons of corn this year,
Fraguio said. The South American country is likely to harvest
more of the cereal next year due to an increase in area and
yields, he said, declining to give an estimate.  The corn harvest in  Argentina  runs from February through
July. Crops have been facing lack of rains since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
