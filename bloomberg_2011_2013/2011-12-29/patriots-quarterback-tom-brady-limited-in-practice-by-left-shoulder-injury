New England quarterback  Tom Brady 
was restricted to what the Patriots said was “limited
participation” in practice yesterday because of an injury to
his left, non-throwing shoulder.  Brady stretched with the team and threw a few passes during
the portion of the workout open to reporters as the Patriots
prepared for their National Football League regular-season
finale Jan. 1 at home against the Buffalo Bills.  Brady, who was this week selected as the American Football
Conference’s starter for the Pro Bowl, missed practice two days
ago because of what the team said was a non-injury reason.  Brady, 34, landed hard on his left shoulder when he was
tackled late in the Patriots’ 27-24 win last weekend against the
 Miami Dolphins . He didn’t mention any shoulder issues during his
regular midweek news conference two days ago.  The Patriots (12-3), who already have clinched the AFC East
division title and a first-round postseason bye, can clinch
home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs with a win or
tie against the Bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
