The U.S. Interior Department
approved plans for an LS Power Group solar project and a
Columbia Energy Partners LLC proposal to build a transmission
line connecting a wind-power project in  Oregon .  The department granted right of way for 19 acres of public
land sought by closely held LS Powerâ€™s Centinela solar project
near El Centro, California, according to a statement today. The
project will produce as much as 275 megawatts.  Columbia Energy Partners, a Vancouver, Washington-based
developer, plans to build a 44-mile (71-kilometer) transmission
line to deliver 104 megawatts of electricity from a proposed
wind farm near Diamond, Oregon.  The Interior Department oversees about one in every five
acres of land in the U.S., according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
