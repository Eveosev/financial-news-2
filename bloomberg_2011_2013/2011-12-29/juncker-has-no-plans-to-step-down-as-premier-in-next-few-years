Luxembourg’s prime minister, Jean- Claude Juncker, said he has no plans to step down from his post
in “the next few years.”  Juncker, whose chairmanship of the group of euro-area
finance ministers ends in mid-2012, said he won’t seek to remain
in charge of the group when the job becomes full-time.  “That would mean I’d have to step down” as prime minister
“and that’s not in my plans for the next few years,” Juncker
said in an interview with the Luxemburger Wort newspaper that
will be published tomorrow. “The decision about how this
position would work will be taken in May or June.”  Juncker said  Europe  faces a “great catastrophe” without
budget consolidation and a reduction of public debt in the
region. “We’re facing a crisis unprecedented in its shape and
ferocity,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
