Ethanol futures snapped the longest
winning streak in a year after a report showed record U.S.
production and on speculation favorable weather in  South America 
will reduce manufacturing costs.  Prices sank the most in more than two weeks on a forecast
for rain in South America that may revive dry crops and reduce
the need for supplies from the U.S.  The Energy Department said  production (DOETFETH)  of ethanol, made from
corn in the U.S., increased 2 percent to 962,000 barrels a day
in the week ended Dec. 23, the highest level since the
government began issuing the report in June 2010.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 2.9 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $2.202 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the steepest decline since Dec. 14. The drop ended the
longest streak of gains since Dec. 29, 2010. Prices have fallen
7.4 percent this year and are headed for the first yearly drop
since 2008.  Corn for March delivery declined 4.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $6.38 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
