A computer glitch slowed trading
“momentarily” on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange today, bourse
spokesman Satoshi Mimura said.  A blockage in some networking cables has been solved and
the problem didn’t affect transactions, Mimura said by phone.
Mimura declined to say how long the problem lasted.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.7 percent to 8,364.03
as of 1:31 p.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index slid 0.3
percent to 719.13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
