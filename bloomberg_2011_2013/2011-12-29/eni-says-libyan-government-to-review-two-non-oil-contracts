Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s biggest oil
company, said the new Libyan government will review two “social
initiative” contracts signed in 2006 and 2010.  The two agreements are so-called sustainability contracts,
an Eni spokeswoman said today by telephone, declining to be
identified, citing company policy. Eni was responding to Ansa
and Radiocor newswire reports that the Libyan government said it
would review contracts signed with the Rome-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
