China Mengniu slid 7.4 percent after hackers broke into its

the market has priced that in. The ECB isn’t taking drastic
action, but it’s better than doing nothing.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  lost 1.3 percent yesterday

to ease concern about the financial system as we pass Christmas
and enter the next year, but they failed to make concrete
progress,” said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at
Mizuho Securities Co. “It’s highly uncertain how the euro will
move beyond year-end, and some people may try to get ahead of
the curve and sell the currency.”  China Mengniu Dairy Co., which this week said excessive

broke into its website. The shares lost 7.4 percent to HK$18.52,

percent to A$1.065 after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said rare-earth
prices may fall. The Chinese government said this week it will

year. That, coupled with planned increases in production by
Lynas and a U.S-based miner, will “will put additional downward
pressure” on prices, JPMorgan said.  Olympus rose 5.4 percent to 1,005 yen. The stock has fallen
about 60 percent since Oct. 13 amid a $1.7 billion accounting
scandal.  The  Asia  Pacific gauge has lost about $1.79 trillion this
year amid concern Europe’s three-year-old debt crisis will drag
the global economy into recession. Stocks on Asia’s benchmark
