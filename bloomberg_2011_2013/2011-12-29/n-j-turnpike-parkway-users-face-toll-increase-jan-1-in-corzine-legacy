Toll increases of as much as 53
percent, a boost set when  Jon Corzine  was governor, will start
Jan. 1 on the Garden State Parkway and the  New Jersey  Turnpike,
two of the busiest roads in the U.S.  The rate for passenger vehicles traveling the Turnpike’s
length during peak traffic hours will be as much as $13.85 in
cash, up from $9.05 currently. The maximum charge for tractor-
trailer rigs with six or more axles also will rise 53 percent,
to $56.85.  The rates were approved in 2008 under Corzine, a Democrat.
Republican Governor  Chris Christie , who defeated Corzine in
2009, said the tolls are impossible to roll back because the
state sold bonds based on the anticipated revenue.  “This is the last, I hope, one of the last vestiges of Jon
Corzine’s fiscal management of the state of  New Jersey (STONJ1) ,”
Christie, 49, told WOR-AM radio’s John Gambling today.  Last year, more than 235 million vehicles used the
Turnpike, part of Interstate 95 running 148 miles (238
kilometers) from the  Delaware River  to  New York . Off-peak rates
for cars traveling the length of the road will rise to $10.40,
according to the  New Jersey Turnpike  Authority’s website.  Tolls for cars on the 173-mile Parkway, the gateway to
Atlantic Ocean beach resorts and a feeder to secondary highways,
will rise as much as 50 percent. The road from  Cape May  to
Montvale, New Jersey, on the New York state line west of the
 Hudson River , carried more than 433 million vehicles in 2010.
The turnpike  authority (26526MF) , which operates the highways, describes
both as among the busiest in the U.S.  MF Global CEO  Corzine, 64, became chairman and chief executive officer of
 MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)  a few months after leaving office. The
brokerage became the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy Oct. 31
after a wrong-way trade on European sovereign debt. Corzine,
testifying before Congress earlier this month, said he didn’t
know what became of about $1.2 billion in client funds.  Commuters, including those who ride rails and buses, also
will face a different sort of cost increase beginning Jan. 1,
unless Congress renews an income-tax credit for commuting costs
of as much as $230 a month. The maximum amount is scheduled to
drop to $125 a month because of expiring federal legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
