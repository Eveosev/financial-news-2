Singapore ’s  fuel oil  stockpiles
shrank to the lowest level in more than two months, data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  residues (SPIVRESD) , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 12 percent to 17 million barrels in the week to Dec. 28,
 International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said
in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies are at the lowest since
Oct. 12.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates (SPIVMDIS)  such as gasoil and
kerosene, rose 14 percent to 9.3 million barrels.  Light
distillates (SPIVLDIS) , a category that includes naphtha, reformate and
gasoline, fell 7.7 percent to 10.1 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
