Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 89 percent
in the week ended yesterday to the least in more than a year as
activity slowed in the year-end holiday period.  Outbound shipments amounted to 17,460 metric tons from Dec.
22 to Dec. 28, against 160,573 tons in the prior week, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Cargoes, which
included 15,410 tons of wheat, were the lowest since at least
August 2010.  Morocco was the biggest destination with 12,495 tons of
wheat, compared with 145,938 tons the previous week.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
