European government bonds with the
exception of German securities are today’s “toxic debt” as the
region struggles to contain fiscal turmoil, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s  Tony Crescenzi .  The European Central Bank isn’t likely to follow the
example of the  Federal Reserve  in purchasing government bonds to
keep interest rates low, said Crescenzi, executive vice
president at Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, in an
interview today on Bloomberg Radio with Sara Eisen. The euro is
likely to remain weaker, according to Crescenzi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
