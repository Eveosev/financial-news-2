Canadian  natural gas  fell, bringing
its annual decline to 30 percent, amid a continuing glut of the
fuel caused by new supplies from shale gas formation and mild
U.S. weather.  Alberta  gas dropped a second day after the Energy
Department said U.S.  stockpiles (DOENUSCH)  of the fuel declined 81 billion
cubic feet to 3.548 trillion in the week ended Dec. 23. The
five-year average withdrawal is 122 billion. Demand for heat
across the U.S. will trail normal by 14 percent through Jan. 6,
according to Weather Derivatives of Belton,  Missouri .  “We’re waiting for something to re-enter the market and
balance things out on the demand side,” said Eric Bickel, a
natural gas analyst with Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
 Kentucky . “Until we see some snow and cold, we’ll be in a low-
price environment.”  Alberta gas for January delivery fell 2.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to C$2.57 a gigajoule ($2.40 per million British
thermal units) at 11:20 a.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for February delivery declined 0.2 cent to $3.025 per
million Btu at 11:23 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
brining its decline to 31 percent so far this year. The futures
traded below $3 per million Btu earlier today for the first time
in more than two years.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 94 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.82 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, at 11 a.m. in  New York . The fuel is
transferred to TransCanada’s main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.06 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 822 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.83 billion cubic feet today, about 69 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.81
billion cubic feet at 10:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
