Wigan striker Conor Sammon won his
appeal of a red card, while Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder
Nenad Milijas will serve a suspension after losing his.  Sammon was dismissed after catching  Michael Carrick  in the
face with his hand during a loss to Manchester United three days
ago, though television replays showed the contact appeared to be
accidental. The Football Association rescinded the card, saving
Sammon from an automatic three-game ban.  “I am delighted to have Conor available for the next three
matches,” Wigan manager  Roberto Martinez  said on the club’s
 website . “It would have been really unfair for him to share the
frustrating feeling that he had on Monday for another three
games after doing nothing wrong.”  Milijas will have to serve a suspension after his appeal
against the red card he received at Arsenal was dismissed by
English soccer’s F.A.  The Serbian was red-carded by referee Stuart Attwell for a
challenge against  Mikel Arteta  in Wolves’ 1-1 tie at the
Emirates Stadium two days ago. His ban begins with a game at
Bolton in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
