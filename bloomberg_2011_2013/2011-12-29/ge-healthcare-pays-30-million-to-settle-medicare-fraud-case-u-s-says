General Electric Co. (GE) ’s health-care
unit will pay more than $30 million to settle claims that a
company it bought in 2004 provided false information to Medicare
to pad billings for a drug used to diagnose heart disease, the
U.S. Justice Department said.  The fraud settlement announced yesterday involving the drug
Myoview sold by Amersham Health Inc. resolves claims filed under
the  False Claims Act . The law allows whistle-blowers to pursue
fraud claims on behalf of the federal government and then share
in any recovery.  “It’s important for drug manufacturers to provide accurate
pricing information to Medicare so that taxpayers aren’t
overcharged for medicines purchased with their dollars,”
Assistant Attorney General  Tony West , who heads the department’s
civil division, said in a statement.  The  Justice Department  has recovered more than $8.7 billion
under the False Claims Act since January 2009, the largest-ever
three-year total, West said at a Dec. 19 briefing for reporters.  James Wagel, the whistle-blower in the suit against GE
Healthcare Inc., will receive $5.1 million from the government’s
recovery.  “GE Healthcare is pleased to have reached a resolution in
this long-standing case,” said Aleisia Gibson, a company
spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
