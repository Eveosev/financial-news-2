Balda AG (BAF) ’s management board agreed
to convene an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Feb. 8 after
Octavian Advisors LP requested it through one of its units with
the aim of substituting the supervisory board members, the board
said in a statement today.  The supervisory board “has always acted and will always
act solely in the interest of the company,” the panel said in
the statement. Conversely, it said that “candidates proposed by
Octavian would lead to severe conflicts of interests and would
strongly deteriorate the Company´s corporate governance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
