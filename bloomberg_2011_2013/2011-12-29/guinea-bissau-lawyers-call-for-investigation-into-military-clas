(Corrects title of UN official in third paragraph.)  Guinea-Bissau’s general prosecutor,
Edmundo Mendes, ordered an investigation into military clashes
in the West African nation on Dec. 26 amid conflicting reports
about a possible coup attempt.  The country’s lawyers’ union backed the call for an
inquiry, according to Domingos Quade, president of the group.
Both Mendes and Quade commented in e-mailed statements.  An army headquarters was attacked this week in an attempt
to seize weapons, according to the United Nations  News Centre ,
which cited Vladimir Monteiro, a spokesman for the UN’s
peacebuilding mission in Guinea-Bissau. Army Chief Antonio Injai
told reporters at a press conference that the fighting was an
attempted coup.  The fighting was condemned by the Economic Community of
West African States yesterday. The clashes “are not unconnected
with agitation for pay rises and rivalry within the military
hierarchy,” said Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan , who is
also chairman of the regional body.  The attacks took place while President Malam Bacai Sanha
was in Paris receiving medical treatment, according to Ecowas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
