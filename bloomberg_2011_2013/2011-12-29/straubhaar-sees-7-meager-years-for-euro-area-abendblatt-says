Thomas Straubhaar , the president of
Germany’s HWWI economic institute, expects seven “meager”
economic years for the euro area because of the region’s debt
crisis,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported, citing the economist.  Countries such as Greece and Portugal must modernize their
economies and social systems through “very severe” measures,
Straubhaar said, according to the Hamburg-based newspaper. It
would be “economic suicide” for Greece to leave the euro
currency,  Hamburger Abendblatt  cited him as saying.  Germany’s economy is likely to grow 0.5 percent next year,
Straubhaar said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
