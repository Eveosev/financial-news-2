European (SXXP)  stocks advanced for the
fourth time in five days as business activity in the U.S.
expanded more than forecast.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  led a gauge of chemical companies higher. Fiat SpA
retreated 1.9 percent after Banca IMI SpA cut its recommendation
on the shares. Mining companies followed a drop in copper.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  gained 0.9 percent to 242.46 at
the close in  London . The gauge has  rallied 13 percent (SXXP)  from this
year’s low on Sept. 22 amid better-than-estimated U.S. economic
data and optimism that policy makers will contain the euro-area
debt crisis.  “Generally news from the U.S. has been better than
expected,” although projections had been muted, said Didier Abbato, a vice president and senior trading adviser at Saxo Bank
in Copenhagen. “In absolute terms, U.S. figures are not great.
They’re just slightly better than expectations.”  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
business barometer decreased to 62.5 this month from 62.6 in
November. Readings above 50 signal growth. Economists forecast
the gauge would fall to 61, according to the median of 49
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  A U.S. Labor Department report showed that first
applications for  unemployment benefits   increased (USURTOT)  to 381,000 last
week, after falling to the lowest since April 2008 in the
previous period. The median forecast of 32 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News had called for 375,000 claims.  The four-week moving average for claims, a less volatile
measure than weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week, the
lowest level since June 2008.  Italian Auction  In  Europe , Italy missed its fundraising target at the
auction of debt maturing between 2014 and 2022, while its
borrowing costs eased.  “The yield on Italian 10-year bonds auctioned coming at
just under 7 percent shouldn’t be classified as a success,”
said  Manish Singh , the London-based head of investment at
Crossbridge Capital, which has more than $2 billion under
management. “Lingering doubts and the expected slowdown in
euro-zone growth in 2012 means investors remain on the edge.”  The Treasury in  Rome  sold 6 percent bonds due in 2014 to
yield 5.62 percent, down from 7.89 percent at the previous sale
on Nov. 29 and priced its 5 percent 2022 bond to yield 6.98
percent, compared with 7.56 percent on Nov. 29. The Treasury
also sold bonds due in 2021 and a floating-rate security due
2018.  Italy ’s bond sale followed yesterday’s auction of bills,
where yields fell.  Italy Credit Risk  “Although distorted by thin holiday trading, today’s sale
is a more accurate gauge of underlying confidence in Italian
debt,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign
Strategy in London, wrote in an e-mail. “Buying 10-year Italian
bonds is a leap of faith which investors are prepared to take
only at very high  interest rates . There are simply too many
risks and uncertainties surrounding Italy.”  The nation expects to raise almost 450 billion euros from
debt sales next year, enough to cover 202 billion euros of
maturing bonds and finance a 23.6 billion-euro deficit, Maria Cannata, director of public debt, said in a Dec. 24 interview
with newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.  The Stoxx 600 has retreated 12 percent in 2011 as the debt
crisis spread across the major economies of the euro area.  Low Volumes  Post-Christmas trading has been low, with  average daily
volume (SXXPVOLC)  in the Stoxx 600 this week dipping to 33 percent of this
year’s average.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 16 of the 18 Western
 European (SXXP)  markets today.  Germany ’s DAX rose 1.3 percent, while
 France ’s CAC 40 added 1.8 percent. The Swiss Market Index was
little changed.  Bayer AG, Germany’s largest drugmaker, increased 2.9
percent to 48.73 euros after filing a supplemental new drug
application together with Johnson & Johnson for the Xarelto
blood thinner drug to treat Acute Coronary Syndrome.  Yara International ASA, the biggest publicly traded
nitrogen-fertilizer maker, rose 1.9 percent to 236.30 kroner and
Syngenta AG, the world’s largest producer of crop-protection
chemicals, gained 1.1 percent to 274.30 francs. Chemical
companies were the  third-best performers (SXXP)  as a group among the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  PNE Wind AG (PNE3) , the German wind company, jumped 7.9 percent to
1.89 euros after it sold its shares in a planned North Sea
offshore project to a fund managed by Ventizz Capital Partners
AG.  Fiat, Raiffeisen Bank  Fiat retreated 0.9 percent to 3.49 euros after Monica Bosio, a Banca IMI analyst, cut the stock to “hold” from
“add.”  Mining shares dropped as copper declined for a second day
on the London Metal Exchange.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  slid 3.2 percent
to 598 pence.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  paced decliners in a  gauge
of European banks (SX7P) , slumping 1.4 percent to 20.07 euros.  Banca
Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna Scrl (BPE)  lost 2.6 percent to 5.57
euros.  Lagardere SCA (MMB) , a French publisher, advanced 2.5 percent to
20.24 euros. Qatar Holding LLC raised its stake in Lagardere to
10.07 percent, according to a filing at the markets regulator,
AMF. The AMF said that Qatar Holding has 13.21 million shares of
Lagardere, representing 7.87 percent of  voting rights .  To contact the reporters on this story:
