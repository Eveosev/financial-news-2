Malaysia’s ringgit dropped to a one-
week low before data that economists predict will show growth in
Singapore, the nation’s second-largest export market, slowed in
the fourth quarter.  Gross domestic product rose 4 percent after increasing 6.1
percent in the three months through September, Singapore’s
government will say on Jan. 3, according to the median forecast
of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP) 
of shares fell for a third consecutive day following a report
that showed the  European Central Bank ’s balance sheet surged to
a record after it lent financial institutions more money last
week to keep credit flowing.  “The ECB news spooked the market,” said Syhiful Zamri
Abdul Azid, director of investment, research and advisory at
Kenanga Investors Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “That’s why emerging-
market assets such as the ringgit are under pressure.”  The ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.1790 per dollar as of
5:27 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, taking its drop for the year to 3.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
touched 3.1820, the weakest level since Dec. 21.  “There is going to be a risk” to Malaysia’s economic
growth if  Europe ’s credit crisis worsens, central bank Governor
Zeti Akhtar Aziz said on Nov. 15.  Five-year  government bonds  rose. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 decreased one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.22 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia. The rate has dropped 31 basis points since it was
listed on March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
