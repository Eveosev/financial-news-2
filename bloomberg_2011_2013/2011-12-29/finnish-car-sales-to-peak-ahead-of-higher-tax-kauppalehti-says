As much as 40 percent of next yearâ€™s
new car sales in  Finland  may take place in the first three
months, newspaper  Kauppalehti  reported today, citing Pekka
Helander, Chairman of the Central Organisation for Motor Trades
and Repairs.  Sales will increase as the government is raising the level
of the emissions-based tax on cars in April, Helsinki-based
Kauppalehti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
