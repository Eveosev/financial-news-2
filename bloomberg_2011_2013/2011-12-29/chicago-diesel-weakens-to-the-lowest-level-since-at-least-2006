Diesel in the Chicago area slid to
the weakest level versus futures since at least 2006 as higher
refinery production increased stockpiles.  Distillate inventories (DOESDIS2)  in the U.S. Midwest have risen five
of the past six weeks, gaining 22 percent to 28.8 million
barrels, according to Energy Department data.  Refiners increased  output (DOETDIP2)  of diesel and heating oil in the
region to a record high to capture higher margins, reaching 1.16
million barrels a day in the week ended Dec. 2, according to
department data.  January-delivery heating oil, traded as diesel surrogate,
settled at a $22.89-a-barrel premium to crude oil on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange .  “With the huge refinery margins, refiners have been
optimizing diesel production all year,” Lewis Adam, president
of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri , said in an interview.  Chicago ultra-low-sulfur diesel’s (CHCGUTLS)  discount to futures
widened 3 cents to 24 cents a gallon, the biggest gap since at
least July 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 1.02 cents to $2.681 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Midcontinent (GRP3UTLS)  weakened 0.25 cent to a
6-cent discount to futures, and in the  Gulf Coast (DIESGULP) , diesel was
unchanged at an 0.88-cent premium.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor (DIESNULP)  lost 0.75 cent
to a 3.25-cent premium.  U.S. distillate stockpiles rose 1.21 million  barrels (DOESDIG5)  to
140.4 million in the week ended Dec. 23, the department reported
today.  Demand (DOEDDIST)  fell 14 percent to 3.8 million barrels a day, the
lowest level in four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
