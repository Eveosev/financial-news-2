Statoil ASA (STL)  bought seismic data from
a survey around the Lofoten, Vesteraalen and Senja area by the
 Norway ’s Petroleum Directorate,  Stavanger Aftenbladet  reported,
citing Gro Haatvedt, a Statoil senior vice president.  Although the area hasn’t been opened up for oil and gas
exploration and production, it’s important to identify potential
resources along the coast, Haatvedt told the newspaper. The
company needs access to new areas, the newspaper cited the
executive as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
