Argentina ’s fuel production may drop
to 29.6 million cubic meters this year from 30.8 million in
2010, the lowest level in at least 10 years, La Nacion  reported ,
citing industry estimates.  Argentina produced 23.4 million cubic meters of fuel in the
first nine months this year, 3.9 percent less than the same
period a year ago, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing
data from Argentina’s Petroleum and Gas Institute.  Production has declined every year since 2007, when the
government set a price cap on oil exports, the newspaper said.  Energy companies used 83.5 percent of their refineries’
installed capacity this year through November, 4.4 percentage
points less than in 2010, La Nacion reported, citing estimates
from  Buenos Aires  consulting company abeceb.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
