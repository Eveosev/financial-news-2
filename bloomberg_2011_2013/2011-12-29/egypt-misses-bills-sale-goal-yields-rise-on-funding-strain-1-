Egypt  raised almost three quarters
of the 6.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion) it sought at a
treasury bills sale today and yields rose as banks faced funding
constraints due to increased state borrowing.  The government sold 2.757 billion pounds in  six-month notes (EGTBY6) 
at an average yield of 14.751 percent, six basis points higher
than the last sale, according to Central Bank of Egypt data on
Bloomberg. It raised 2.044 billion pounds from an offering of
 one-year securities (EGTBY12)  at an average yield of 15.399 percent
compared with 15.292 percent in the previous auction of similar
maturity notes.  Egypt has relied more on local banks to fund its  budget
deficit  as foreign investors withdrew in the aftermath the
ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. This reduced
banks’ cash levels and prompted them to demand higher yields. In
March, the central bank started a repurchase facility to ease
funding pressure, allowing banks holding state securities to
sell them back to the regulator for a week to access funds at
9.25 percent, a rate it raised to 9.75 percent last month.  “The central bank has so far succeeded in managing short-
term liquidity needs for the local banks through the repo
facility,” Mohamed Kotb, Cairo-based asset management director
at Naeem Financial Investments, said by phone. “The big jump in
yields earlier this quarter has calmed down as the Ganzouri
government clearly has a green light to borrow from abroad to
ease pressure off of local banks.”  Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri’s government will meet
with a delegation from the  International Monetary Fund  next week
to negotiate a $3.2 billion loan, Minister of Planning Fayza
Aboulnaga said this week. Banks have drawn about 138 billion
pounds through repurchase contracts this quarter, including a
record 22 billion pounds at this week’s sale. The compares with
67 billion pounds in the previous three months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The average yield on one-year bills has climbed 152 basis
points since September, bringing their advance since the start
of political unrest in January to 496 basis points. Egypt’s
five-year credit default risk soared 390 basis points this year
to 632 on Dec. 28, according CMA prices, making it the riskiest
in the  Middle East . Owned by CME Group Inc., CMA compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 fell less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 7.99 percent at 2:29 p.m. in Cairo.  The pound (EGP)  gained
0.1 percent to 6.0273 against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
