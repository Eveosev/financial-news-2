German stocks (DAX)  rose for the fourth
time in five days after Italy’s borrowing costs fell at a debt
auction and U.S. business activity expanded more than forecast.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  rose 2.9 percent.  PNE Wind AG (PNE3)  climbed 7.9 percent
after selling its Gode II offshore wind farm.  The DAX Index increased 1.3 percent to 5,848.78 at the
close in  Frankfurt . The gauge has still lost 15 percent this
year amid concern the growing debt crisis in the euro area will
damp the global economy. The broader HDAX Index added 1.3
percent today.  Italy’s borrowing costs fell as it sold 7 billion euros ($9
billion) of bonds in the final debt sale of the year.  The government sold 2.5 billion euros of bonds due in 2014,
less than the 3 billion euro maximum target, to yield 5.62
percent, down from 7.89 percent at the previous sale on Nov. 29.
The Treasury priced 2.5 billion euros of its 5 percent 2022 bond
to yield 6.98 percent, compared with 7.56 percent on Nov. 29.
 Italy  also sold about 2 billion euros of bonds due 2021 and a
floating-rate security due 2018.  The sale came one day after Italy auctioned 9 billion euros
in treasury bills for 3.251 percent, about half the rate from
the previous auction.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
business barometer decreased to 62.5 this month from 62.6 in
November. Readings above 50 signal growth. Economists forecast
the gauge would fall to 61, according to the median of 49
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Unemployment  A U.S. Labor Department report showed that first
applications for  unemployment benefits  increased to 381,000 last
week, after falling to the lowest since April 2008 in the
previous period. The median forecast of 32 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News had called for 375,000 claims.  The four-week moving average for claims, a less volatile
measure than weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week, the
lowest level since June 2008.  Shares fell yesterday as the  European Central Bank ’s
balance sheet soared to a record after it lent financial
institutions more money last week in an attempt to keep credit
flowing to the economy during the debt crisis.  Bayer rose 2.9 percent to 48.73 euros after it applied to
