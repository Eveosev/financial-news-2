OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Statoil
ASA (STL)  delayed a decision on whether to invest in the Shtokman
natural-gas project off Russian Arctic shores until the end of
March as the partners seek exemptions from extraction taxes.  “Some additional time is required to achieve the necessary
conditions to take the final investment decision,” according to
a statement from the companies’ Shtokman Development AG venture
e-mailed after they held a board meeting in Moscow today.  Total is seeking exemptions from Russian gas taxes with the
support of French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon . Russia raised
the mineral extraction tax for gas producers by 61 percent this
year and plans to more than double the rate next year. The
Russian Finance Ministry has agreed to consider tax holidays for
the  gas field  when the partners submit a development plan.  The companies planned to decide on whether to invest this
year, and begin producing gas for shipment by pipeline in 2016
and liquefied natural gas the following year.  “Considering the technological and economic stakes in
Shtokman -- a project which ties us together for many years --
it is logical and responsible for the partners to give
themselves a few additional weeks to decide on a major
investment with the necessary guarantees,” Charles-Etienne
Lebatard, a spokesman for Total, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
