Iran  is showing “irrational
behavior” with its threat to shut the  Strait of Hormuz , said
U.S. State Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland .  “We’ve seen quite a bit of irrational behavior from Iran
recently,” Nuland said, when asked about Iran’s threats to
close the strait, the route for tankers carrying oil from the
 Persian Gulf . “One can only guess the sanctions are beginning
to pinch,” she said at a briefing in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
