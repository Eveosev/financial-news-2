The Bank of  Spain  said available
data suggest the euro area’s fourth-biggest economy  contracted (SPNAGDPQ) 
in the final months of the year, a day before Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  is set to unveil his first budget measures.  The central bank said in its December monthly bulletin
published today that tourism and exports showed signs of
weakening from October while household spending and investment
worsened, adding the data aren’t yet complete. Spain’s fragile
recovery in the first half was sustained by exterior demand as
the most drastic austerity measures in three decades pushed
unemployment to a 15-year high.  The Bank of Spain confirmed earlier forecasts that the
economy is worsening as Rajoy, who holds his second Cabinet
meeting tomorrow, has said he’ll announce his plans to carry the
nation through until a 2012 budget is presented in the first
quarter. Rajoy’s  People’s Party , which inherited a stalled
economy from the Socialist government after winning in a
landslide on Nov. 20, now faces the double challenge of tackling
the euro area’s  third-largest budget deficit (EUBDEURO)  and  Europe ’s
highest  jobless rate (UMRTEMU) .  “After the Spanish economy stalled in the third quarter,
available data show that activity contracted in the last months
in an environment of strong tensions in the financial markets”
and weakening growth prospects in the euro area and the rest of
the world, the central bank said.  In October, exports of goods rose at less than half the
pace registered in the third quarter and the increase of
tourists slackened in November, the Bank of Spain said.
Indicators show a “marked weakening” of household consumption
and investment in the last quarter while the  construction
industry  remains on a “path of contraction,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
