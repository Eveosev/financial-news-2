Peru’s government may declare a
state of emergency in the northern Andes if protests resume
against  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s $4.8 billion Minas Conga gold
project, daily  El Comercio  reported.  Opponents of the project, which was suspended last month
after weeks of protests, plan marches in the highland region of
Cajamarca Jan. 2 and 3, the Lima-based newspaper said, citing
Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes.  The government will take legal action against protest
leader Gregorio Santos, head of Cajamarca’s regional government,
for barring all industrial activity in the area around Newmont’s
project, El Comercio cited Valdes as saying.  This week, local officials excluding Santos accepted an
international review of the mine’s environmental impact study,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
