German  inflation (GRCP2SAY)  slowed in December
as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis damped economic growth.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, fell to 2.4 percent from 2.8 percent in November,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. That’s in
line with the median forecast of 18 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The 17-member euro region faces recession as cash-strapped
governments cut spending to contain the debt crisis. The
 European Central Bank  lowered its  benchmark interest rate (EURR002W)  for a
second straight month in December, saying economic activity is
subdued and price pressures will ease.  “The weakening economy is the main driving force behind
falling inflation rates,” said Marina Luetje, an economist at
Dekabank in  Frankfurt . “German and euro-region inflation will
fall to 1.7 percent in 2013.”  Euro-area inflation will slow to 2.8 percent this month
from 3 percent in November, according to the median of 24
estimates in another Bloomberg survey. That report is due on
Jan. 4.  “Cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should
remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon,” the ECB said
Dec. 15 in its monthly bulletin. “Inflation is likely to stay
above 2 percent for several months to come, before declining to
below 2 percent,” the bank’s inflation ceiling, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
