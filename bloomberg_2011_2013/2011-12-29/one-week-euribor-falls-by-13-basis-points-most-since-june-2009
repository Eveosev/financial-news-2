(Corrects direction in second paragraph.)  The  rate (EUR001W)  at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for one week fell the most
since June 2009, according to the European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
dropped 13.2 basis points to 0.704 percent, EBF data showed.
That’s the  lowest (EUR001W)  level since March 2, and the biggest daily
drop since June 25, 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The increase may be due to technical factors, according to
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  “Banks are now largely funded for year-end so you’re
seeing one-week euribor rates slump,” Chatwell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
