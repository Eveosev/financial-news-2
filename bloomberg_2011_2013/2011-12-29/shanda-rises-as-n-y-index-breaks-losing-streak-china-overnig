Chinese equities  listed in New York
rose for the first time in three days after U.S. housing and
labor market data improved and on speculation  China  may cut
banks’ reserve requirements in January to sustain growth.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. gained 0.8 percent to 95.49 as trading closed
in New York.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , the nation’s second-biggest online
travel company, jumped the most in a month after Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd. maintained a “buy” recommendation versus
a “neutral” for its biggest rival.  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC) 
rose the most in a week after signing an asset management
agreement with its unit.  Chinese policy makers may cut the amount of cash lenders
must set aside as reserves after the New Year’s Day, according
to a commentary in the official China Securities Journal
yesterday. The reserve ratios were last cut by half a percentage
point earlier this month. The U.S.  index (SPX)  of pending home sales
for November increased to the highest level since April 2010,
and the four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, dropped to the lowest
since June 2008.  “It’s possible for the central bank to cut the reserve
ratio by another 50 basis points before mid-January,” Ting Lu,
a Hong Kong-based economist with Bank of America Corp., wrote in
a report yesterday. Major growth indicators for December and the
fourth quarter will confirm a “soft-landing” in the Chinese
economy, he wrote.  Elong, whose biggest shareholder is U.S. online travel
agency Expedia Inc., surged 7.4 percent to a three-week high of
$14.50.  Elong, Ctrip.com  Elong’s e-coupon program, in which the company refunds part
of its fees back to travellers, “has proved to be successful”
since it started in 2009 and helped the company lead customer
growth, Muzhi Li, an analyst at Mizuho wrote in a research note
yesterday. Elong’s hotel bookings rose 42 percent in the third
quarter compared with a 17 percent increase for its rival
Ctrip.com International Ltd., the report said.  Li maintained a “buy” recommendation on Elong, with a 12-
month price target of $23. He kept a “neutral” for Ctrip,
which climbed 1.2 percent to $23.33 in  New York .  China, the world’s second-largest economy, grew 9.1 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5 percent
in the second. Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in November from
a year ago, the slowest pace in 14 months.  Growth may slow to 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter and
inflation rate may remain at 4.2 percent, Lu at Bank of America
predicted.  Business activity in the U.S. expanded more than forecast
yesterday. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said
its business barometer decreased to 62.5 this month from 62.6 in
November. Economists forecast the gauge would fall to 61,
according to the median of 49 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  China Life  China Life, the listed unit of the country’s biggest life
insurer, added 1.3 percent, the biggest daily gain since Dec.
20, to $36.86. The company signed an agreement with its asset
management unit to help invest up to 300 million yuan ($47.5
million) of its funds in 2012 and about the same amount for each
of the following two years, it said in a regulatory filing
yesterday.  The transaction will “help realize the effective
allocation and utilization of current resources, thereby raising
the profitability of the company and its subsidiaries,”
according to China Life’s statement.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  gained 1.6 percent, the
most in a week, to $21.11 in New York trading.  The company  said
Dec. 27 China Huaneng Group, which holds about 52 percent of the
unit’s shares, will continue to increase its stake by as much as
2 percent in a year, starting Dec. 31, after increasing its
holdings by 2 percent in the past year.  Shanghai Index  The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose for a second day,
rebounding 0.2 percent to 2,173.56 after reaching the lowest
level since March 2009 on Dec. 27. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index added 1.1 percent, restoring a gain for 2011, to 1,263.02.  The  Shanghai  benchmark is trading at an estimated price-
earnings ratio of 10.5 times. That compares with 13.6 for Indian
stocks, 10 for Brazilian shares and 4.9 for Russian equities.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  advanced the most among
solar shares in the Bloomberg gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese
shares. Yingli leaped 4.9 percent to $3.84, the most since Dec.
20.  JA Solar Holdings Co., based in Shanghai, said it won a
contract to supply Solarhybrid AG 19 megawatts of solar modules
for the Allstedt I solar project on a former German military
airfield in Halle. The company expects total shipments to
Solarhybrid to reach 40 megawatts in 2011, according to a
statement on Globe Newswire. The company advanced 3 percent to a
week high of $1.36 in New York trading.  Polysilicon  China said it will discourage foreign investment in
polysilicon, the raw material used in solar panels, curbing
supply in an industry struggling with overcapacity and falling
prices.  The ishares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 0.9 percent to
$34.85. The Chinese  yuan  was little changed at 6.3192 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  To contact the reporter on this story:
