China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , the biggest mainland developer listed in Hong Kong,
dropped to a one-month low after Chairman Kong Qingping reduced
his stake by 40 percent over three days.  Kong sold 3.5 million shares from Dec. 20 to Dec. 22,
cutting his stake to 5.3 million shares, according to a filing
to the Hong Kong stock exchange. That’s less than 1 percent of
the outstanding stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares fell 4.9 percent to HK$13.12 at the close in
Hong Kong, the lowest since Nov. 30. The retreat made it the
second-worst performer today on the MSCI China Index, which
tracks shares of Chinese companies in Hong Kong.  “These substantial sales may send a negative signal to the
market that the chairman thinks the sector’s stock prices have
peaked,” said Wee Liat Lee, an analyst at Samsung Securities in
Hong Kong.  Shares of other Chinese developers also dropped in Hong
Kong, leading declines on the  MSCI China Index. (MXCN)   Country Garden
Holdings Co. (2007)  lost 3.9 percent,  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383) 
declined 2.7 percent, while  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777)  fell
3.6 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
