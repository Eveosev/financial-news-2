What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that rain in
southern  Brazil  and  Paraguay  will revive yield prospects,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler  Indiana ,
said in a telephone interview.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected
to open 0.3 cent to 0.5 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that U.S. exports will slow after
the grain posted the longest rally since October 2007 and the
dollar rose to a 15-month high against the euro, making American
supplies more expensive on world markets, Gerlach said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1
cent higher on speculation that an eight-session rally to five-
week highs will reduce demand even as hot, dry weather threatens
to cut yields in  Argentina , Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
