Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the West
African nation’s biggest lender, rose the most in two weeks as
investors bet the stock will gain next year.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 0.5 percent, to 1.85 cedis by
the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Accra, the biggest increase
since Dec. 16.  “Ghana Commercial’s gains may top 2 cedis a share next
year as it becomes more attractive through cost reduction and
streamlining of the loan portfolio,” Haruna Gariba, a stock
trader at Accra-based Merban Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone
interview. “The bank has moved away from financing crude
imports and is now trying to do more cocoa loans.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
