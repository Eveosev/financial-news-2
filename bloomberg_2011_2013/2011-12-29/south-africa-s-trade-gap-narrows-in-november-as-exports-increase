South Africa ’s  trade gap  narrowed to
8 billion rand ($981 million) in November as exports of mineral
products and chemicals climbed.  The  shortfall (SATBAL)  eased from 9.6 billion rand in October, the
Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed
statement today.  South Africa posted a trade gap in eight of the past 11
months as higher crude prices and a weaker rand boosted import
costs, while  Europe ’s debt crisis undermined demand for exports.
That’s helped to widen the  current account deficit (SACTGDP) , the broadest
measure in trade in goods and services, to an 18-month high of
3.8 percent of gross domestic product in the third quarter,
according to central bank data.  The rand has slumped 19 percent against the dollar this
year, the worst performer of 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The currency gained as much as 1 percent to 8.1217
today.  Shipments of chemical products surged 59 percent last
month, helping boost total exports by 12 percent to 68.5 billion
rand, the revenue service said. Precious metal exports jumped 26
percent in November from the previous month, it said.  Imports rose 8.1 percent to 76.5 billion rand in the same
period, with purchases of mineral products such as oil rising 21
percent, machinery imports gaining 12 percent and vegetable
imports surging 52 percent.  Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
