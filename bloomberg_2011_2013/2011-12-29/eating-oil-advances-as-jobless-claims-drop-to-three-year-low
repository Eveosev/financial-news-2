Heating oil rose as jobless claims
slid to a three-year low over the past month and cooler weather
was forecast for the U.S. Northeast in January.  Futures gained after Labor Department figures showed the
four-week moving average for claims, a less volatile measure
than the weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week, the
lowest level since June 2008. The  National Weather Service ’s
Climate Prediction Center  forecast  lower-than-normal
temperatures Jan. 5-11 from Maine to  Florida .  “Not only are we going to have a return of winter but the
 U.S. economy  is improving and that should improve the demand for
diesel and even gasoline,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  January-delivery heating oil rose 2.45 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9179 a gallon at 1:09 p.m. on the Nymex. Prices
are heading for a 15 percent gain in 2011.  In other indications of a strengthening economy, the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its  business
barometer (CHPMINDX)  was little changed at 62.5 from a seven-month high of
62.6 a month earlier. The index of  signed contracts (USPHTMOM)  to buy
previously owned houses increased 7.3 percent in November, the
National Association of Realtors said.  Distillate stockpiles rose 1.21 million  barrels (DOESDIG5)  to 140.4
million in the week ended Dec. 23, the Energy Department
reported today. Inventories of industrial, shipping and heating
fuels are 13 percent below year-earlier levels.  Demand (DOEDDIST)  for distillates fell 14 percent to 3.8 million
barrels a day, the lowest level in four weeks. The four-week
average consumption was 3.9 percent above a year earlier.  Refinery Rates  Refiners lowered operating rates 0.7 percentage point to
84.2 percent, the lowest level in seven weeks. Utilization rates
in Padd 1, where three refineries that account for about half of
regional capacity are for sale, slid to 56.1 percent from 58
percent.  “There’s some cooler weather forecast and some refinery
issues and shutdowns so there’s potential for stronger demand,”
said  Gordon Elliott , a risk management specialist at FC Stone
LLC in  St. Louis Park , Minnesota.  Gasoline reversed a loss after the department reported that
 inventories (DOESTMGS)  of the motor fuel declined 692,000 barrels to 217.7
million.  Demand (DOEDMGAS)  rose 0.5 percent from the prior week.  “We did have a stock draw in the middle of winter and a
little bit stronger demand this week,” said  Sander Cohan , an
analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts.  Measured on a four-week average, gasoline  demand  was 5.6
percent below a year earlier. The four-week average of total
fuel supplied was 7.8 percent below 2010.  “We’re heading for January and that’s the nadir for
gasoline demand,” Cohan said.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 0.41 cent to $2.6554 a
gallon, after touching $2.6365. Prices are up 8.2 percent this
year, after climbing 41 percent through April 29.  Regular gasoline (3AGSREG)  at the pump, averaged nationwide, climbed
1.1 cents to $3.254 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices were 6.4 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
