cabinet meeting tomorrow, previously worked for  Lehman Brothers 
when Luis de Guindos, now the economy and competition minister,
was also there, the newspaper said.  The Economy and Competition Ministry didn’t immediately
respond to a call by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
