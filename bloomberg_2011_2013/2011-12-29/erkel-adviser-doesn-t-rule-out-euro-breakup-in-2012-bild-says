The euro currency area may break up
in 2012, as steps taken to preserve it remain inadequate,
Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers,  said  in an interview with
Bild Zeitung.  The German economy may shrink as much as 0.5 percent next
year if the crisis holds back growth in global trade; if the
situation is brought under control quickly, there could be
growth of about 0.4 percent, Bild cited Weder di Mauro as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
