PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, sold a 1,700-acre master-planned
community north of Denver to Wheelock Street Capital LLC.  The all-cash transaction is for the remaining developed
lots and undeveloped land in the Anthem, Colorado, development,
which is approved for about 1,500 homes, the  Bloomfield Hills ,
Michigan-based company said in a statement today. PulteGroup
didn’t disclose the transaction’s value.  PulteGroup won’t book a material loss or gain on the sale,
according to the statement. Wheelock, a privately held real
estate investment firm, has acquired more than 10,000
residential lots in master-planned communities in Texas, Florida
and North Carolina during the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
