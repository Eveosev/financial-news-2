Cyprusâ€™s bank deposits fell 0.9
percent in November to 69.1 billion euros ($89.1 billion), the
fourth straight monthly drop, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said.  Deposits by residents of the east Mediterranean island fell
1.9 percent to 43.1 billion euros from October, the Nicosia-
based bank said in a  statement  on its website today. The drop
was largely the result of a 19 percent slump in deposits held by
other financial intermediaries to 2.5 billion euros.  Deposits by residents of other countries in the euro area
rose 2.6 percent to 5.4 billion euros, the bank said in the
statement. Deposits by people who live outside the region
advanced 0.3 percent to 20.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
