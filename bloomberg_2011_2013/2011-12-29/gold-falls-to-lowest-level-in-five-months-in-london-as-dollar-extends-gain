Gold, on the brink of a  bear market ,
posted the longest slump since March 2009 as gains in the dollar
reduced demand for precious metals as alternative assets.  The dollar climbed as much as 0.6 percent against the euro
as an auction of Italian bonds fell short of the government’s
target. Gold, down 12 percent in December, is headed for the
biggest monthly drop since October 2008, compared to the
greenback’s almost 3 percent gain against a six-currency basket.  “The developments in  Italy  have perked up the dollar, and
that is pushing gold down,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at
Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone
interview. “I expect gold to remain in negative territory this
week.”  Gold futures for February delivery declined 1.5 percent to
close at $1,540.90 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal fell for a sixth straight session, the longest
slide since March 4, 2009. Today’s settlement leaves prices down
19 percent from a record close of $1,891.90 reached on Aug. 22,
about 1 percentage point shy of a bear market. Earlier, prices
reached $1,523.90, the lowest since July 7.  Still, gold is up 8.4 percent this year, heading for an
11th consecutive annual advance. Futures climbed as investors
and central banks bought the metal as a store of wealth.  “You have stagnating output and, on the demand side,
jewelry consumption adapts to higher prices,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,
 Switzerland . “The fundamental investment case for gold is still
intact.”  The  interest rate (.LIBGO6M)  for lending gold in exchange for dollars
jumped to 0.2085 percent, the highest since July 2010. One-month
lease rates fell to the lowest on record in December as European
banks sought ways to secure the U.S. currency amid the region’s
debt crisis.  Silver futures for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
$27.315 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has lost 12 percent
this year.  Platinum futures for April delivery declined 1.8 percent to
$1,366.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for March delivery slumped 3.6 percent to
$623.75 an ounce on Nymex, the biggest drop since Dec. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
