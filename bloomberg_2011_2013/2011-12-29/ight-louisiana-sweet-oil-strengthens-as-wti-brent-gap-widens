The premium for Light Louisiana
Sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast compared to West Texas
Intermediate strengthened as the gap between Brent and the U.S.
benchmark widened for the second session.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery increased 16 cents to settle at $8.36 a
barrel. The differential has narrowed 70 percent since reaching
a record of $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI gained 40 cents to
$9 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  increased 60 cents to $9.50
over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI added 5 cents to $6.55. The
premium for Mars Blend gained 5 cents to $5.20.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s
premium was unchanged at $4.90.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium decreased 15 cents to
$3.85.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount was unchanged at $1.25.  The discount for  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  narrowed 20 cents to
