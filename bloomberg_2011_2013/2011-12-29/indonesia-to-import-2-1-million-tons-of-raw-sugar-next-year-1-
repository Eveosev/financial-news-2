Indonesia ,  Southeast Asia ’s largest
sugar buyer, will allow refiners to import 2.1 million metric
tons of raw variety in 2012, according to Deputy Trade Minister
Bayu Krisnamurthi.  Indonesian refiners bought about 2.06 million tons of the
sweetener this year, below the 2.4 million-ton quota set by the
government, Krisnamurthi said.  Indonesia’s sugar industry is regulated by the government,
which sets import quotas. Households buy sugar made from cane
grown by local farmers, while industrial users import refined
sugar directly, or buy from domestic processors, which import
raw sugar.  The country’s white sugar output next year may rise to 2.7
million tons from 2.23 million tons this year, Agus Hasanuddin Rachman, director of seasonal crops at the  Agriculture Ministry ,
said Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
