The Argentine government may raise
export taxes on biodiesel to as much as 35 percent from the
current 20 percent, El Cronista Comercial reported.  The increase would boost annual revenue to $263 million
from the $150 million raised this year, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said, citing unidentified government officials.  Soybeans have a 35 percent export tax, while the levy on
by-products of the grain is 32 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
