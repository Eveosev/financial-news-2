The ruble depreciated for a third
day, heading for the weakest level in almost three months, after
oil traded near the lowest in a week and investors closed
positions before the long New Year holidays.  The Russian currency fell 1.6 percent to 32.2395 against
the dollar at the close of trading in Moscow, set for its
weakest closing rate since Oct. 6. The ruble slid 0.9 percent to
41.5700 versus the euro, putting it at 36.4382 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude for February delivery tumbled 2 percent yesterday
after a report showed U.S. fuel stockpiles surged, indicating
demand may be weakening. It was down 0.7 percent at $98.63 a
barrel today, trading near its lowest since Dec.20. While the
ruble and stocks trading in  Russia  next year resumes Jan. 3,
traders are closing their positions ahead of the country’s New
Year and Christmas national holidays than run between Jan. 1 and
Jan. 9.  “This looks like position squaring before a long break,”
Dmitry Dudkin, a fixed-income analyst at UralSib Financial Corp.
said by e-mail. “Investors fear the possible problems over New
Year holidays coming from  Europe  and want to limit their
exposure.”  The ruble weakened in the final week of each year since
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Russian
currency is 5.2 percent lower against the dollar this year.  Investors increased bets the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 32.6726
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
32.2247 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow investors and
companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular level in the
future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobonds due in 2020 rose,
pushing the yield three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
lower to 4.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
