Kyle Orton , the National Football
League player, sued a Chicago law firm alleging he and other
investors suffered millions of dollars of losses from
partnerships that failed to provide anticipated tax benefits.  Orton, in a complaint filed yesterday in state court in
Chicago, accuses Chuhak & Tecson PC of misrepresentation and
negligence over advice on investments in oil and gas
partnerships that were designed to grant tax credits. He and a
co-plaintiff seek to represent other investors in a class-action
lawsuit.  The firm didn’t warn Orton and other investors that there
was a possibility they wouldn’t receive the anticipated tax
credits because the partnerships, set up to sell biomass gas
from landfills to generate electricity, didn’t meet the
statutory requirements for the credits.  Andrew Tecson, president of Chuhak & Tecson, said in an e-
mail that the firm doesn’t comment on pending litigation.  Orton, 29, has started the past two games for Kansas City
after being claimed by the Chiefs off waivers on Nov. 23. The
quarterback began the season with Denver, then was replaced by
 Tim Tebow  as the Broncos’ starter.  The case is Orton v. Chuhak & Tecson, 11CH44662, Cook
County Circuit Court (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
