Treasuries rose for a third day,
pushing benchmark 10-year note yields to within a quarter-
percentage point of a record low, on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will curb global growth.  Thirty-year bond yields reached a one-week low as the euro
fell to the weakest level in 15 months versus the dollar while
Italian bond yields advanced. Italy sold less than its maximum
target at a debt auction, highlighting funding problems in the
region. Treasuries fell earlier as data signaled the  U.S.
economy  is strengthening.  “The reason yields are this low is largely because of
Europe,” said  Anthony Cronin , a trader at Societe Generale SA
in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “The U.S. economy seems to be fine, but the
big uncertainty looking ahead is if the situation over there
deteriorates.”  Ten-year note yields decreased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They advanced earlier
to 1.94 percent. The 2 percent securities maturing in November
2021 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 29/32.
The yields dropped to a record low 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  Thirty-year bond (USGG30YR)  yields fell two basis points to 2.90
percent after rising earlier as much as two basis points to 2.94
percent. They touched 2.89 percent, the lowest since Dec. 20.  Lower Volumes  Treasury market volumes have slid amid the Christmas and
New Year’s holiday season. About $109 billion of Treasuries
 changed hands (ICPTVOL)  today through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker. About $90 billion changed hands on Dec. 23.
The 2011 daily average is $286 billion.  U.S. government securities have returned 9.6 percent this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Treasury
Master index, as Europe’s debt crisis led investors to seek
refuge. The gain is Treasuries’ biggest since the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008. German  government bonds  have returned
9.3 percent. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks dropped 5.5 percent
this year after accounting for reinvested dividends.  Bonds declined earlier as U.S. jobless-benefit applications
over the past month fell to a three-year low. The four-week
moving average for the claims, a less volatile measure than the
figures reported weekly, dropped to 375,000 last week, the
lowest level since June 2008, Labor Department data showed today
in  Washington . Applications in the week ended Dec. 24 rose for
the first time in a month, climbing by a more-than-forecast
15,000 to 381,000.  Business Gauge  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business  barometer (CHPMINDX)  was at 62.5 this month, from 62.6 in
November. Readings above 50 signal growth. Economists had
forecast the gauge would fall to 61, according to the median in
a Bloomberg News survey. The National Association of Realtors’
index of pending home sales increased 7.3 percent to the highest
level since April 2010.  The  yield gap (USGGBE10)  between U.S. conventional 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt,
narrowed to 1.97 percentage points, from 1.99 percentage points
yesterday. The 10-year average for the measure, known as the
break-even rate, is 2.13 percentage points.  The difference between yields on two- and 30-year
Treasuries, known as the yield curve, shrank for a third day. It
contracted to 2.64 percentage points, the least since Dec. 19.
The average in 2011 is 3.47 percentage points, with the low of
the year, 2.49, reached on Oct. 3.  Emerging Markets   Treasuries extended gains today amid speculation expansion
in emerging markets is slipping.  Some investors are trimming their forecasts for global
growth as “the outlooks for some of the emerging markets are a
bit less certain than the performance suggested in 2011,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “They’ve clearly been a bright
spot in the global growth profile.”  Growth will slow in  Brazil  to 3.4 percent in 2012 from 7.6
percent in 2010, while  China ’s expansion cools to 8.5 percent in
2012 from 10.4 percent in 2010, according to Bloomberg surveys.  Treasuries rallied yesterday after the  European Central
Bank  said its balance sheet soared to a record following last
week’s lending to keep credit flowing in the region.  Italian Bonds  Benchmark Italian 10-year bond yields rose above 7 percent
today, the level that spurred  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland to
seek bailouts, after the nation’s auction of 7.02 billion euros
($9 billion) of debt fell short of the 8.5 billion-euro target.
Yields fell from the previous auctions. Yesterday, Italy sold 9
billion euros of 179-day bills at 3.251 percent, down from 6.504
percent at the previous auction on Nov. 25.  The euro dropped today to as low as $1.2858, the weakest
level against the greenback since September 2010, before erasing
losses.  The 17-country currency is the worst performer this year
against nine developed-nation counterparts measured by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, losing 1.7 percent as
European leaders have failed to contain the region’s two-year-
old debt crisis. The dollar gained 1.5 percent, second only to
the yen’s 4.8 percent increase.  “The world is still not all that interested in owning
European bank debt, European government debt, and that means de-
risking,” said  Tony Crescenzi , a portfolio manager and
strategist at  Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment
Management Co., which manages the world’s biggest bond fund.
Crescenzi spoke in an interview on Bloomberg Radio. “The world
right now wants to see more from European leaders than they’ve
seen so far.”  The U.S. 10-year yield will increase to 2.67 percent by the
end of 2012, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of banks and securities companies, with the most recent
projections given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
