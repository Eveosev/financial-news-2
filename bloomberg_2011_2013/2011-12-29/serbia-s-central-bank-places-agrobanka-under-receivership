Serbia ’s central bank fired the
management of  Agrobanka AD (AGBN)  and placed it under receivership
after inspectors discovered that “capital the bank has does not
match the risk” it has assumed with its business.  The decision was made after the central bank completed an
investigation into Agrobanka, which still has a “satisfying
degree of liquidity, above the legally set minimum,” and which
continues to operate, the Belgrade-based National Bank of Serbia
said in a  statement  on its website today.  Agrobanka, 20 percent owned by the state, has a market
share of less than 3 percent and ranks 12th among 33 banks
operating in the Balkan country. Its executive board chairman,
Dusan Antonic, spoke on Dec. 22 of plans to add as much as 100
million euros ($129 million) to boost capital next year, while
local media reported Bank of East Asia Ltd. may be interested in
Agrobanka.  The bank posted a loss this year of 2.27 billion dinars
($28 million) at the end of September, after full-year profit of
1.16 billion dinars in 2010, according to the central bank. Its
shares fell 3.4 percent to 3,405 dinars on the Belgrade Stock
Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
