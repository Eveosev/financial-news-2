Italian  business confidence (ITBCI)  fell to
the lowest in two years in December as the economy probably
entered its fourth recession in the last decade amid a wave of
austerity measures designed to fight the sovereign debt crisis.  The manufacturing-sentiment index dropped to 92.5, the
lowest since December 2009, from a revised 94 in November, Rome-
based national statistics institute Istat said today. Economists
had predicted a reading of 93.7, according to the median of 14
 estimates (ITBCI)  in a Bloomberg News survey. Istat originally reported
a confidence reading of 94.4 in November.  The mood among executives mirrors Italian consumers’
pessimism as Prime Minister  Mario Monti  implements a 30 billion-
euro ($39 billion) package of spending cuts and tax increases.
Italian  consumer confidence  fell in December to the lowest in 16
years and the economy shrank in the third quarter. The
government forecasts a further contraction in the current three-
month period, meaning Italy is in its fourth recession since
2001.  The euro-area’s third biggest economy won’t return to
growth until the second half of next year, employers’ lobby
Confindustria said in a Dec. 15 report. The $2.3 trillion
economy will contract 1.6 percent in 2012 after growing 0.5
percent this year, the lobby said.  Fiat SpA, Italy’s biggest manufacturer, will shutter its
Termini Imerese factory in Sicily at the end of the month,
making it the first European automaker to close a plant since
General Motors Co. shut a facility in  Belgium  in 2010. Fiat
agreed with unions to pay about 21 million euros ($27 million)
to support early retirement for about 640 workers.  Monti, who took office last month as head of an unelected
government of non-politicians, is seeking to show investors he
can tame Italy’s 1.9 trillion-euro debt, which is bigger than
that of  Spain ,  Greece , Portugal and Ireland combined.
