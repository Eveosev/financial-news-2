ETA Star  Mozambique  SA discovered 2
billion metric tons of coal reserves in Moatize in Mozambique’s
north-western Tete province,  Noticias  reported, citing Mohamed
Sathak, the company’s director general.  The deposit was found at the company’s 1,068L concession,
which covers an area of 4,000 hectares (9,884 acres), the
Maputo-based newspaper said. Eta Star plans to seek a license to
mine the area next year, it said.  The company, a joint venture between Dubai-based ETA Star
and Indico Investments and Minas do Zambeze of Mozambique, has
identified China, India and  Indonesia  as markets for the coal,
it said. Production is expected to be 5 million tons a year, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
