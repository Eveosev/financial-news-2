Hong Kong  exports will slow next
year as European consumers cut back amid the region’s debt
crisis, the government-backed Hong Kong Trade Development
Council said today.  Shipments will grow about 1 percent in 2012, compared with
the 10 percent increase in 2011, the council told reporters in
Hong Kong today.  Exports from the city are likely “to remain lackluster in
2012 due to a slow recovery in the U.S. and a worsening debt
crisis in  Europe ,” said Daniel Poon, assistant chief economist
at the council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
