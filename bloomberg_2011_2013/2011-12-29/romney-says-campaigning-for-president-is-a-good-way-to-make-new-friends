Running for president is a good way
to make new friends.  Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in his second
bid for the White House, said so at a campaign stop today in
Mason City,  Iowa .  "Is it hard running for the president?" eight-year-old
Ben Navratil asked the Republican candidate.  "The answer is yes, and no," Romney responded. "Ha, ha,
ha," he added. "Sounds like a politician, I apologize."  Romney, who also sought his party’s nomination in 2008 and
leads in a poll ahead of Iowa’s premier nominating caucuses on
Jan. 3, said it’s difficult to wake up early each morning after
staying in a different hotel every night.  Still, he called running for president "the greatest
opportunity" to meet new people and make new friends.  "So if you get the chance to do it, make sure and do it,"
Romney said. "Win or lose, it’s a great thing to do."  To contact the reporter on this story:
