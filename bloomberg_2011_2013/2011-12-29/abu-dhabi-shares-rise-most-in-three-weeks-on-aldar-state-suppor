Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  surged the
most in more than two years, helping to push up Abu Dhabi’s
benchmark index, after the emirate’s government agreed to buy
assets valued at $4.57 billion to support the company.  Aldar jumped 9.5 percent, the most since Dec. 14, 2009.
 Sorouh Real Estate Co., (SOROUH)  the second-biggest Abu Dhabi developer,
gained 7.6 percent. The benchmark  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  climbed 1.5
percent, the most since May 2010, to 2,402.28 at the 2:00 p.m.
close in the emirate, trimming its losses this year to 12
percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.5 percent.  The agreement “shows the significant support that the
government has for Aldar,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based
analyst at Gulfmena Investments. “The market is taking the news
very positively.”  Abu Dhabi  will purchase 760 homes in the Al Raha Beach
development and retire 5 billion dirhams of debt related to
infrastructure on Yas Island, Aldar said after the market closed
yesterday. It will also buy 5.7 billion dirhams of assets in
Central Market, a project in downtown Abu Dhabi, and finance the
completion of the district’s redevelopment. Abu Dhabi is the
capital of the United Arab Emirates and sits on about 7 percent
of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Aldar advanced to 92 fils, trimming its losses this year to
60 percent. The company was hurt when property values slumped in
the U.A.E. after banks curtailed lending and speculators pulled
out because of the global credit crunch. Sorouh climbed to 85
fils. There are 100 fils to the dirham.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.4 percent. United Development Co.,
an investor in infrastructure and energy, plunged 10 percent to
24.48 riyals after Qatar’s pension fund offered to buy a stake
below its trading value.  The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index rose 0.2 percent. Kuwait’s
measure gained 0.5 percent and Oman’s MSM30 Index advanced 0.3
percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share Index fell 0.1 percent.  Saudi
Arabia ’s stock market is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
