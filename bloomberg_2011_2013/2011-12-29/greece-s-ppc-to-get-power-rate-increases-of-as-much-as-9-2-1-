Greece announced tariff increases of
as much as 9.2 percent for  Public Power Corp (PPC)  SA, to help the
country’s biggest electricity company service its debt and
remain profitable.  In exchange for the increases, PPC, as the company is
called, must take actions including cutting operating expenses
by an additional 10 percent to 15 percent and further reducing
labor costs, the Energy Ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Without the increases and the cost cuts, “soon Public
Power won’t be able to meet its loan obligations and its
profitability is at risk,” Energy Minister  George Papaconstantinou  told a cabinet meeting in Athens today,
according to the e-mail.  Public Power’s net income in the first nine months of the
the year dropped to 90.8 million euros ($117.5 million) from
520.2 million euros a year earlier as expenses for fuel, natural
gas and energy purchases rose 22 percent, the company said on
Nov. 25. Public Power’s debt now stands at 4.5 billion euros,
the Energy Ministry said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
