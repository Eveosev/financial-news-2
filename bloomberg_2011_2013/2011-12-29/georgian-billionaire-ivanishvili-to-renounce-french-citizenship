Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili said he will give up his French citizenship after
losing a court appeal to restore his revoked Georgian passport.  Ivanishvili has already contacted the French Embassy in the
Georgian capital, Tbilisi, his press office said in an e-mailed
statement today. His Russian citizenship is already terminated,
according to the statement.  On Dec. 11, Ivanishvili held an inaugural rally for his
political campaign, called the “Georgian Dream,” which aims to
challenge the current government. He wants to create an
opposition party to take on President Mikheil Saakashvili.  To contact the reporter on this story:
