The zloty slid the most against the
euro in almost two months after state-run Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego said it hasn’t increased foreign-currency sales on the
market.  The zloty lost as much as 1.4 percent to 4.4616 per euro,
the biggest intraday decline since Nov. 1, and traded 1 percent
weaker as of 4 p.m. in Warsaw.  The Polish currency has rallied from the 2-1/2 year low
reached on Dec. 14 on speculation BGK will sell euros and
dollars on the market on behalf of the government before the end
of the year to reduce the value of government debt in foreign
currencies. Public borrowing rose to 52.8 percent of gross
domestic product in 2010. An increase above 55 percent will
trigger compulsory spending cuts and tax increases under public-
finance laws.  “Right now isn’t a time when we’ve been hyperactive,” BGK
Chief Executive Officer Dariusz Daniluk told reporters in Warsaw
today. The zloty’s exchange rate is “under control,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
