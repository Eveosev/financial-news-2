Iberia, the Spanish airline unit of
 IAG (IAG) , canceled 118 flights today as pilots’ union Sepla called a
strike to protest against the creation of a lower-cost carrier
for short-haul trips.  Iberia canceled 36 percent of its scheduled flights today,
including international and national flights, affecting more
than 10,000 passengers, the Madrid-based company said in a
statement. Sepla also called a strike on Dec. 18.  The company, which merged with British Airways at the
beginning of this year to create International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA, plans to transfer planes to the Iberia
Express unit in 2012 to boost the profitability of domestic and
European services. The new fleet is scheduled to be established
in three months.  Iberia said it offered alternative flights with Iberia and
other airlines to customers affected by the strikes. It also
offered ticket refunds and 9,000 hotel rooms from  Melia Hotels
International SA (MEL)  in  Madrid .  Iberia said in a Dec. 27 statement that the creation of
Iberia Express is “unnegotiable.” Strikes by pilots won’t
stall the transfer of aircraft to the lower-cost operation,
Iberia Chief Executive Officer Rafael Sanchez-Lozano said in a
Dec. 20 interview.  “No matter what happens, Iberia Express will be operating
as planned,” he said.  A spokeswoman for Iberia wasn’t immediately available for
comment when contacted by telephone today.  -- Editors: Robert Valpuesta, David Risser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
