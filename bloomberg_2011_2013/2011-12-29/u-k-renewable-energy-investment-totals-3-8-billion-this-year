U.K. renewable-energy investment has
totaled almost 2.5 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) so far this
financial year as companies from  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  committed funds, the government said.  Renewable-power plants, equipment factories and services to
the alternative-energy industry announced since the April 1
start of the tax year will create 11,619 jobs, the Department
for Energy and Climate Change said today in a website  report .  Britain is working toward a European Union goal of getting
15 percent of energy from clean sources by 2020. In a separate
 study  today, the department said renewable-energy consumption
rose 27 percent from 2008 through 2010. That means biofuels,
wind, solar and other alternatives to fossil fuels and nuclear
account for 3.3 percent of energy for heat, transport and power.  “Renewable energy is not just helping us increase our
 energy security  and reduce our emissions,” Energy Secretary
 Chris Huhne  said in an e-mailed statement. “It is supporting
jobs and growth across the country, and giving traditional
industrial heartlands the opportunity to thrive again.”  Projects detailed in today’s investment study include a 10
million-pound investment by Japanese carmaker Toyota in solar
panels at a plant in Derbyshire, a wind-turbine factory planned
by Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas in Kent, southeast England, and
wind-farm contracts involving German utility  RWE AG. (RWE)  The study
lists projects announced from April 1 through Nov. 16.  Yorkshire tops the regional table of announced investments,
with 469 million pounds and 2,501 jobs, followed by Wales with
430 million pounds and 849 jobs, southwest  England  with 356
million pounds and 22 jobs and  Scotland  with 315 million pounds
and 2,422 jobs.  London  had just 7 million pounds of announced
investments, while southeast England had a total of 261 million
pounds of announced spending and 2,081 jobs created.  To contact the reporter on this story:
