German power for next year dropped
to its lowest level in more than a week and European Union
carbon permits declined after Italy auctioned 18 percent less
debt than its target.  Baseload power for delivery in  Europe ’s largest electricity
market in 2012 fell 0.8 percent to close at 51.85 euros ($67.09)
a megawatt-hour, broker data shows. That’s the lowest since Dec.
19. Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
Group Inc. (GFIG) , ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullett Prebon Plc.  EU carbon permits for December 2012 decreased 6.6 percent
to 7.26 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. United Nations emission credits for December next year
lost 7.1 percent to 4.07 euros a ton.  Today’s sale of 7 billion euros of debt by the Treasury in
 Rome  fell short of the 8.5 billion-euro target even as borrowing
costs declined from last month. Some 90 percent of Germans
expect other euro-area countries will require a bailout in the
“near future,” AWD Holding AG said, citing a survey the
financial-services broker commissioned from polling company
Forsa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
