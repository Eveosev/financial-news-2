The  Chicago White Sox  agreed to
terms on a five-year, $65 million deal with pitcher John Danks,
a 26-year-old left-hander who has a 54-56 record over five Major
League Baseball seasons.  Danks had an 8-12 record with a 4.33 earned run average in
27 starts for the White Sox last season. After losing his first
eight decisions, Danks went 8-4 with a 3.69 ERA.  Danks, who broke into the major leagues with the White Sox
in 2007, will receive $8 million in 2012, which would have been
his final season of arbitration eligibility. Heâ€™ll get $14.25
million each season from 2013 through 2016, the White Sox said
in a  statement  on their website.  Danks went 15-11 during the 2010 season and ranks fourth
among American League left-handed pitchers with 48 wins over the
past four years, trailing Jon Lester of the  Boston Red Sox , CC Sabathia of the  New York Yankees  and former teammate Mark Buehrle, who signed with the  Florida Marlins  as a free agent in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
