Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures dropped after an Energy Department report
showed that U.S. inventories increased last week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, slipped to 32.5 percent at 1 p.m. in New York
from 33 percent yesterday. Oil dropped as much as 1.1 percent
after the department said supplies rose 3.9 million barrels to
327.5 million last week.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were March $120 calls, with 888 lots changing hands as of
1:08 p.m. in New York. The options rose 2 cents to 62 cents a
barrel. February $90 puts traded 760 lots, dropping 7 cents to
56 cents. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for February delivery declined 30 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $99.06 a barrel at 1:08 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  February $115 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 7,862 lots changing hands. They
declined 7 cents to 27 cents a barrel. The next-most active
options, February $90 puts, rose 22 cents to 63 cents on volume
of 7,479 contracts.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
37,830 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 37,159
contracts and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,346.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
