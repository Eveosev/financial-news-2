Kazakh prosecutors started a
criminal probe over the use of force by the police during unrest
in Zhanaozen, where 16 people died in a mass riot on Dec. 16.  The authorities have arrested 18 people suspected of
involvement in the violence that also left more than 100 people
injured, Nurdaulet Suindikov, a spokesman for the Prosecutor
General’s Office, told reporters today in the capital, Astana.  Oil workers at state-run  KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) 
in Zhanaozen have rioted after disputes over wages and job
losses. Unrest in the Mangistau region, bordering the  Caspian
Sea  in western  Kazakhstan , spread after police used arms to
suppress the riots, with one person killed in the nearby town of
Shetpe on Dec. 17 and protesters rallying in the regional
capital of Aktau.  “The immediate situation in Zhanaozen and the whole
Mangistau region remains stable and under the control of law-
enforcement bodies,” Suindikov said.  The Prosecutor General’s Office is denying reports that a
large number of people are missing following the riots in
Zhanaozen, Suindikov said. The authorities have received no
requests or petitions on the matter and “officially there are
no investigations ongoing,” he said.  Even so, officials have information that relatives are
searching for persons missing after their detainment by the
police, Suindikov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
