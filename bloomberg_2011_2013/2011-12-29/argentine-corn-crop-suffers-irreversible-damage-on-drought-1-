Corn production in  Argentina , the
world’s second-largest exporter after the U.S., has suffered
“irreversible damage” from dry weather in the major producing
provinces of Santa Fe and  Buenos Aires , the Buenos Aires Cereals
Exchange said.  “Most of the crops in the central area are facing
unfavorable weather conditions amid a critical stage of
development,” the exchange said on its website.  Corn has dropped 3.7 percent in the past month on concern
the drought will pare output in  South America . Argentine corn
growers have completed planting of 80 percent of the crop as of
today, from 75 percent a week ago, the exchange said.  Agriculture Minister Julian Dominguez said Nov. 29 that the
country would probably produce a record 30 million metric tons
of corn in the coming harvest, up from 21 million tons a year
earlier.  The country’s soybean crop is 81 percent planted, up from
76 percent a week ago, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
