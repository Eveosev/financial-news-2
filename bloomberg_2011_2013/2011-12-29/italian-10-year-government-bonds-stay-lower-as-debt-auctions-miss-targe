Italian 10-year bonds  stayed lower (GBTPGR10) 
after the nation raised less than its maximum target at a sale
of securities maturing between 2014 and 2022.  The 10-year bond yield climbed 12 basis points to 7.12
percent at 10:33 a.m. London time. Three-year note  yields (GBTPGR3) 
dropped four basis points to 5.83 percent, after earlier sliding
as low as 5.68 percent.  Italy sold 7.02 billion euros ($9.05 billion) of debt,
compared with a maximum target of 8.5 billion euros, the
Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
