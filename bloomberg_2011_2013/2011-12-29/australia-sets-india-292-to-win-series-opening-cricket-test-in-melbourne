India  slumped to 117-6 at tea on day
four of the first cricket Test against Australia in Melbourne
after being set 292 to win.  Australia bowlers  Ben Hilfenhaus , James Pattinson and Peter Siddle each dismissed two batsmen to get Australia to within
four wickets of the victory and a 1-0 lead in the best-of-four
contest.  Hilfenhaus and Pattinson earlier put on 43 for the last
wicket as the home team added 61 to its overnight total to post
240 in its second innings. After  Zaheer Khan  removed Mike Hussey
for 89, Hilfenhaus was the last man out for 14, leaving
Pattinson unbeaten on 37. Zaheer finished with 3-53.  Hilfenhaus removed  Virender Sehwag  before the lunch break
and India lost its next five wickets for 42 runs in the middle
session. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was 14 not out at tea,
with Ravichandran Ashwin unbeaten on 30.  To win, India needs to complete the biggest successful
fourth-innings chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1953,
when South Africa made 297-4 to beat Australia.  India, seeking its first Test series victory in Australia
since it began touring there in 1947, holds the Border-Gavaskar
Trophy after winning its last two home Test series against the
Australians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
