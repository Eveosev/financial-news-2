U.K. stocks climbed, sending the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to three-week high, as U.S. data showed
business activity and home sales in the world’s largest economy
increased more than forecast.  Companies from  ITV Plc (ITV)  to  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  and Next Plc all
climbed more than 1 percent in London trading.  The FTSE 100 added 59.39, or 1.1 percent, to 5,566.77 at
the close in London, the highest level since Dec. 6. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index also rose 1 percent today, and Ireland’s
ISEQ Index gained 0.5 percent.  The FTSE 100 has  lost 5.7 percent (UKX)  this year amid concern
the debt crisis that has sent euro-area borrowing costs record
highs will weaken global economic growth. Italy today sold 7
billion euros ($9 billion) of bonds today in the country’s final
debt sale of the year.  “The U.S. data was OK, which has helped sentiment,” said
Trung-Tin Nguyen, a hedge fund manager at TTN AG in Zurich.
“Moves are exaggerated with the light volumes.”  The  volume (VOLUKX)  of shares in the FTSE 100 that changed hands
today was less than 40 percent of the daily average this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks climbed today as business activity in the U.S.

manufacturing is weathering the slowdown in  Europe . The
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its  business
barometer (CHPMINDX)  decreased to 62.5 from 62.6 in November. Readings
above 50 signal growth. Economists had forecast the gauge would
fall to 61, according to a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Home Sales  The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously
owned homes rose more than forecast in November as falling
prices and low borrowing costs boosted demand. The  index of
pending home sales (USPHTMOM)  increased 7.3 percent to the highest level
since April 2010 after climbing 10.4 percent the prior month,
figures from the National Association of Realtors showed.
