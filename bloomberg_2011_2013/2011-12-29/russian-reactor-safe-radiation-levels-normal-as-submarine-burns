Radiation levels at a dockyard in
 Russia ’s northern Murmansk where a nuclear submarine is on fire
are normal, and the vessel’s reactor is safe after being shut
earlier for repairs, according to the Emergency Ministry.  There were no injuries from the blaze, officials said.  “Fire extinguishing continues,” said Irina Gretskaya, a
regional spokeswoman for the ministry, by phone from Murmansk.
“The situation is under control. Radiation levels are normal.”  The blaze began when the Yekaterinburg submarine was under
repair and Chief Military Prosecutor of Russia’s Northern Fleet
Yevgeny Tkachuk is leading an investigation into the incident,
said Roman Dmitriyev, representative for the Military Prosecutor
General’s office. The dock belongs to OAO United Shipbuilding
Corp., Dmitriyev said today by phone from Moscow.  The submarine’s shell caught fire after wooden scaffolding
surrounding it for the repairs began burning, Interfax reported
earlier, citing Vadim Serga, a local military official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
