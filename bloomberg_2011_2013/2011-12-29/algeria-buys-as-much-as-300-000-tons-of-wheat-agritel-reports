Algeria  bought 250,000 to 300,000
metric tons of optional-origin wheat, Agritel reported on its
website today, without saying where it got the information.
 Argentina  may supply a “good part” of the purchase, the Paris-
based farm adviser said, citing unnamed market participants, and
European origins might also be included.  To contact the reporter on this story:
