Online betting exchange Betfair
Group Plc identified a computer glitch that allowed hundreds
of customers to bet on a horse that was winning a race in
Ireland at odds of 28-1.  Bettors wagered more than 800,000 pounds ($955,000) on
Voler La Vedette as the horse led the 2 p.m. race yesterday at
Leopardstown. The technical fault allowed a single client to
match the bets, exceeding his exposure limit, according to an
e-mailed Betfair statement.  London-based Betfair last night voided all bets made during
the race several hours after Voler La Vedette had won, citing
its terms and conditions, and apologized to clients.  “We have identified the issue and replicated it in a test
environment last night,” Betfair said today. “A fix was
applied overnight, and is now subject to rigorous testing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
