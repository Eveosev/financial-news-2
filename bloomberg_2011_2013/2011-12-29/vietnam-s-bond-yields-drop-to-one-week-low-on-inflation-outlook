Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing yields to a one-week low, on speculation demand for the
securities will increase as inflation slows. The dong slid.  The pace of increases in consumer  prices (VNCPIYOY)  decelerated for a
fourth month in December to 18.1 percent from 19.8 percent in
November, official data showed on Dec. 23. The country can
reduce the inflation rate to below 10 percent in 2012 as long as
money-supply growth doesn’t exceed 16 percent, Do Thuc, general
director of the General Statistics Office, said at a briefing in
Hanoi today.  “Investors are buying bonds because they anticipate yields
will fall next year,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based money-market dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank. “Rates are expected to decline with the
inflation rate.”  The  yield (GGVN5YR)  on five-year government notes fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.55 percent, the lowest
level since Dec. 22, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The State Treasury sold 900 billion dong ($42.8 million) of
three-year bonds yesterday, compared with 700 billion dong
issued last week, according to the Hanoi Stock Exchange.  The dong weakened 0.2 percent to 21,038 per dollar as of
2:40 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate (SBVNUSD)  at 20,828 today, unchanged
for a third day, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
