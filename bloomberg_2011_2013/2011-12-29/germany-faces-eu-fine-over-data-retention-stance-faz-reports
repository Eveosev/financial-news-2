Germany ’s failure to introduce a law
in line with European Union guidance on data retention may be
brought before the  European Court  of Justice and result in a
fine,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung   reported , citing an
unidentified European Commission spokesman.  Germany could be fined millions of euros by the court after
“numerous” reminders from the Commission about the issue, FAZ
said.  The German Justice Ministry asked the EU in a letter dated
Dec. 23 to modify its guidelines so that data can only be stored
if it serves as a clue for specific crimes, FAZ reported, citing
the letter. A deadline to change the guidelines expired on Dec.
27, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
