AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s shares will be removed
from the New York Stock Exchange, a month after it filed for
bankruptcy, according to  NYSE Euronext. (NYX)   The stock has retreated 68 percent to 52 cents since  Fort
Worth , Texas-based AMR filed for Chapter 11 in November, with an
average of 73.7 million shares changing hands each day. NYSE
Euronext said last month that it would suspend AMR should it
receive evidence the share price will be “abnormally low” or
that the securities are “without value.”  AMR will be removed from the world’s largest equity venue
by value of companies listed before trading begins on Jan. 5,
according to a statement today from the bourse. It will leave 37
days after the company’s bankruptcy.  Delta Air Lines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp. both
filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 14, 2005. Nasdaq Stock Market
delisted Northwest 12 days later, and NYSE removed Delta in 29
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UAL Corp., the
parent of  United Airlines , filed for Chapter 11 on Dec. 9, 2002,
and was delisted by NYSE in 115 days, the data show.  US Airways Group Inc. went into bankruptcy on Aug. 11,
2002, and Sept. 12, 2004. NYSE delisted it the first time after
three days, and Nasdaq took action after 10 days the second
time, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
