Serbia, which holds national
elections next year, adopted a spending plan for 2012 that
seeks to narrow its  budget deficit  to 4.25 percent of gross
domestic product amid forecasts for slowing growth.  A total of 127 lawmakers in the 250-seat legislature
voted to back the spending plan which counts on economic
growth of 1.5 percent compared with 2 percent in 2011,
while opposition parties boycotted the vote. Half of the
890 billion dinars ($11 billion) in spending will go to pay
wages of public administration workers, teachers, doctors,
police and pensioners.  The 2012 budget relies on revenue of 750 billion
dinars, leaving a gap of 140 billion dinars for the central
government, a quarter-point below the limit of 4.5 percent
of GDP set by Serbian law.  Labeled by the government of Mirko Cvetkovic as
“anti-crisis,” next year’s budget is based on
expectations that troubles in the European Union, the
Balkan country’s key trading partner, won’t tip the economy
into recession.  “The 2012 budget envisages active support measures
for agriculture, real sector, subsidies and soft credits,
and there’s no plan for a tax increase or any additional
burdens,” Premier Cvetkovic told parliament on Dec. 26.  IMF Agreement  Keeping the gap within 4.25 percent of GDP was agreed
on with the  International Monetary Fund , which in September
approved a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) precautionary loan
for Serbia in case  Europe ’s debt crisis triggers capital
flight from the Balkan economy, putting pressure on its
currency and the balance of payments. The government
estimates a 4.5 percent deficit for 2011.  The 2012 budget will be one of the last laws adopted
by this parliament before elections are called for late
April or early May, speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic said
on Dec. 26.  Serbia is still emerging from its worst recession in a
decade and the government is trying to keep spending under
control and boost tax collection without cutting social
benefits. The government will increase subsidies for
tourism, agriculture, roads and railways and is keen on
allowing a 5.5 percent annual increase in public wages and
pensions affecting as many as 2 million voters ahead of
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
