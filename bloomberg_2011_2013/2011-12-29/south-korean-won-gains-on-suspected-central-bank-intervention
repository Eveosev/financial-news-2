South Korea ’s won reversed earlier
losses on speculation the central bank intervened to curb
declines as the currency headed for its first annual drop in
three years.  “Some banks placed orders suspected to come from the
authorities to defend the won,” said Nam Kyung Tae, a Seoul-
based foreign-exchange dealer at state-run Industrial Bank of
 Korea . “Market players were wary in the morning that they would
step in” to keep the won from falling beyond 1,160 per dollar,
he said.  The won gained 0.3 percent to 1,152.70 against the U.S.
currency as of 1:47 p.m. in Seoul, taking its drop for the year
to 2.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency fell as much as 0.5 percent earlier to 1,160.79.  Central banks intervene in  currency markets  to try and
influence exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
