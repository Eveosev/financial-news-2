Cocoa fell for a fifth session on
signs that supplies will be ample as Europe’s debt crisis
threatens economic growth. Sugar, cotton and orange juice
gained, while coffee slid.  In the week ended Dec. 18, cocoa deliveries to ports from
farms in  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest producer, rose 14
percent from a year earlier to 578,368 metric tons, a document
from the industry’s regulator showed. Purchases from farmers in
 Ghana , the second-largest grower, rose 4.3 percent in the first
nine weeks of the current season, the Ghana Cocoa Board said.  “Prices have weakened on supply ideas, especially from
western  Africa , where arrivals and export declarations are
running ahead of last year,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president
for Price Futures Group in  Chicago , said in an e-mailed report.  Cocoa for March delivery dropped 2.3 percent to settle at
$2,083 a ton at 11:59 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching $2,076, the lowest since Dec. 19. The price has
plunged 31 percent this year.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities has
dropped 3.4 percent since June 30 as  Europe ’s debt crisis
escalated.  “Traders are also worried about the economic situation in
Europe, the top destination for a lot of the cocoa produced in
the world,” Scoville said.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery climbed 1.6 percent to
23.51 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener has slumped 27 percent
in 2011, after advancing the previous three years.  Cotton futures for March delivery gained 1 percent to 91.63
cents a pound on ICE. Prices have still tumbled 37 percent in
2011, the most among commodities tracked by the GSCI.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery advanced 0.2
percent to $1.6855 a pound in New York. The price has climbed
3.1 percent this year.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery retreated 1.1
percent to $2.2425 a pound on ICE. The commodity is down 6.8
percent in 2011, heading for the first yearly drop since 2008.  In London futures trading, cocoa and robusta coffee slid on
NYSE Liffe, while refined sugar rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
