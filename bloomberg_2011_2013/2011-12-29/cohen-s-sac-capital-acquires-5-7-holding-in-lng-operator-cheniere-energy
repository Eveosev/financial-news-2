SAC Capital Advisors, the $14
billion hedge fund run by Steven A Cohen, bought a 5.7 percent
stake in  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , a liquefied natural-gas importer,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Comission today.  Cheniere has an import terminal in Sabine Pass, Louisiana,
that it’s trying to convert for export. The project, which would
cool gas into a liquid so that it can be loaded onto ships, will
initially cost as much as $5 billion. Cheniere faces a cash
crunch that may trigger a default in May,  Standard & Poor’s  said
in a note to clients Oct. 31.  Diane Haggard, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Cheniere,
didn’t respond to calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
