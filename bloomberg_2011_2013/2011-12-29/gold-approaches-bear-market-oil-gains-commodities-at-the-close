The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge (SPGSCI)  of
24 commodities rose to close at 645.81 at 3:46 p.m.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index (CMCIPI)  of 26 raw materials fell to
1,513.725 at 4:19 p.m.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold, on the brink of a  bear market , posted the longest
slump since March 2009 as gains in the dollar reduced demand for
precious metals as alternative assets.  The dollar climbed as much as 0.6 percent against the euro
as an auction of Italian bonds fell short of the government’s
target. Gold, down 12 percent in December, is heading for the
biggest monthly drop since October 2008, compared to the
greenback’s almost 3 percent gain against a six-currency basket.  Gold futures for February delivery declined 1.5 percent to
close at $1,540.90 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal fell for a sixth straight session, the longest
slide since March 4, 2009. Today’s settlement leaves prices down
19 percent from a record close of $1,891.90 reached on Aug. 22,
about 1 percentage point shy of a bear market. Earlier, prices
reached $1.523.90, a five-month low.  Silver futures for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
$27.315 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has lost 12 percent
this year.  Platinum futures for April delivery declined 1.8 percent to
$1,366.80 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for March delivery slumped 3.6 percent to
$623.75 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest drop since Dec. 14.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for the first time in three days after
pending sales of U.S. homes rose more than forecast, boosting
demand prospects for industrial metals.  The number of American signing contracts to buy previously
owned homes gained 7.3 percent in November to the highest since
April 2010, the National Association of Realtors said.
Economists forecast a 1.5 percent increase, the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. The average home uses about 400
pounds (181 kilograms) of copper in the U.S., the world’s top
consumer after  China .  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
close at $3.37 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The price dropped 3 percent in the previous two days.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid 0.5 percent to $7,425 a metric ton ($3.37 a pound).  Aluminum also declined in London. Tin, lead, nickel and
zinc advanced.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose on signals the  U.S. economy  is weathering
Europe’s debt crisis and amid speculation that escalating
tension in the  Middle East  may disrupt supplies.  Crude advanced for the seventh time in eight days after a
measure of U.S. jobless claims fell to a three-year low and
pending sales of existing homes jumped for a second month. Iran
threatened this week to block crude shipments through the  Strait
of Hormuz  if sanctions are imposed on its oil exports.  Crude oil for February delivery gained 29 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $99.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have risen 9.1 percent this year.  Brent oil for February settlement increased 45 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $108.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil rose as jobless claims slid to a three-year low
over the past month and cooler weather was forecast for the U.S.
Northeast in January.  Futures gained after Labor Department figures showed the
four-week moving average for claims, a less volatile measure
than the weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week, the
lowest level since June 2008. The  National Weather Service ’s
Climate Prediction Center forecast lower-than-normal
temperatures Jan. 5-11 from  Maine  to  Florida .  January-delivery heating oil rose 2.41 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.9175 on the Nymex. Prices are heading
for a 15 percent gain in 2011.  Gasoline futures for January increased 2.88 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6801 a gallon. Prices are up 9.2 percent this
year, after climbing 41 percent through April 29.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures dropped to the lowest price in more
than two years after a government report showed a smaller-than-
forecast decline in U.S. inventories and a growing surplus of
the heating fuel.  Gas fell 3 percent after the Energy Department said
stockpiles slipped 81 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec.
23 to 3.548 trillion. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed an expected withdrawal of 85 billion. The drop was
smaller than the five-year average decline for the week of 122
billion.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 9.4 cents to $3.027
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Sept. 11, 2009. The
futures have tumbled 31 percent this year.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn fell for the first time in nine sessions and soybeans
dropped for a second straight day on speculation that rains will
revive dry crops in  Brazil , reducing demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer.  About 85 percent of southern Brazil will get 0.25 inch (0.6
centimeter) to 1 inch of rain beginning tomorrow, with the rest
of the country getting regular showers for the next week, Global
Weather Monitoring said today in a report. Corn has jumped 10
percent since mid-December, and soybeans are up 6.8 percent, as
dry weather threatened South American crops.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to close
at $6.38 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the first drop since Dec. 15. Still, the grain has gained 1.4
percent this year as world reserves before the 2012 harvest are
forecast to drop to a five-year low.  Soybean futures for March delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$11.97 a bushel, capping the first two-session drop since Nov.
25. Yesterday, the price touched $12.19, the highest since Nov.
8. The oilseed has slumped 15 percent in 2011 as rising world
production slowed overseas demand for U.S. crops.  Wheat futures for March delivery slipped 0.9 percent to
