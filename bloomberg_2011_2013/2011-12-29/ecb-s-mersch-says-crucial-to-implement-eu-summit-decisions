European Central Bank council member
Yves Mersch urged the euro region’s leaders to quickly implement
the decisions taken at a summit earlier this month.  “At the European level the accord of Dec. 9 shows the
urgency to consolidate the economic chapter of the economic and
monetary union,” Mersch wrote in an outlook for 2012 published
today on the website of the Luxembourg Central Bank, which he
heads. “Its rapid and efficient implementation is crucial. Then
it will be up to each country of the euro zone to adopt an
adequate policy to keep in place budgetary discipline.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
