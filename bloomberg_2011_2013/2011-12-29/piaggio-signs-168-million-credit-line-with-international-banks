Piaggio & C. SpA (PIA)  signed a 130
million-euro ($168 million)  credit line  with international banks
to re-finance its medium-term debt and fund growth.  The four-year credit line was underwritten by Bank of
America Corp., BNP Paribas SA and HSBC Holdings Plc, Piaggio
said in regulatory filing. It is “extendible up to 200 million
euros through syndication,” the company said.  Piaggio will use the credit line to re-finance debt
maturing in 2012 and fund international growth projected in its
2012-2014 business plan,  Europe ’s largest motor-scooter maker
said. The plan includes boosting production in Vietnam and
development of the Moto Guzzi brand, according to the company
based in Pontedera,  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
