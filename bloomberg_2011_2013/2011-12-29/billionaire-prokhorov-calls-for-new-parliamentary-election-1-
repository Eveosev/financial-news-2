Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  said he will call new parliamentary elections next
December in case he defeats Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  for
the presidency in March.  Prokhorov also said he would serve for only five years of
his six-year mandate and make it easier for smaller parties to
get into Parliament, according to the campaign program published
on his website today.  Putin is facing the biggest protests of his 12-year rule
over allegations of fraud in Dec. 4 parliamentary elections that
gave his United Russia party a majority of seats. He has
repeatedly refused opposition demands to hold a re-run vote.  Prokhorov said he would reduce to 3 percent the barrier for
parties to gain seats under proportional representation in the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament. He also pledged to
allocate half of the 450 seats in the Duma for independent
candidates and restore direct elections for governors, measures
already promised by President  Dmitry Medvedev .  To contact the reporter on this story:
