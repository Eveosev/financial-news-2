Italian two-year notes rose for a
fourth day as the  European Central Bank  was said to have bought
the nation’s debt as part of its efforts to stem the spread of
the region’s financial crisis.  Ten-year bonds fell, increasing the additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark
German bunds, after the nation raised less than its maximum
target at an auction of debt due between 2014 and 2022. French
securities declined and the euro weakened to a 15-month low
against the dollar. German bunds rose for a third day as a
report showed  inflation (GRCP2HYY)  slowed in December.  “In this period the market is very thin, and the ECB can
easily lift the prices up,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior
rates strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.  Italy’s two-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.96 percent at 4:26 p.m.  London  time. The
2.25 percent note due November 2013 rose 0.08, or 80 euro cents
per 1,000-euro ($1,291) face amount, to 95.42.  The 10-year yield was two basis points higher at 7.02
percent, after climbing as high as 7.13 percent. The difference
in yield, or spread, with similar-maturity German bonds widened
seven basis points to 518 basis points.  The ECB bought Italian debt today, according to two people
with knowledge of the trades who declined to be identified
because the deals are confidential. A spokesman for the ECB in
 Frankfurt  declined to comment.  Annual Loss  Italian bonds have handed investors a loss of 5.8 percent
in 2011, set for the  worst year (ITGATR)  since the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg started compiling
data on the securities in 1992.  At a year-end press conference in  Rome  today, Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  said Italy’s borrowing costs -- more than
triple  Germany ’s for 10 years -- were unjustified.  Longer-maturity Italian bonds fell after the government
sold 7.02 billion euros of debt, less than its maximum target of
8.5 billion euros. The Treasury agreed to pay a yield of 6.98
percent on securities maturing in 2022, close to the 7 percent
level that prompted euro-area peers to seek bailouts.  “Yield levels around 7 percent are absolutely not
sustainable,” said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “They could not
sell the entire size they planned. It’s not positive news for
the stressed sovereign-debt markets in the  euro zone .”  Italy also auctioned 2.5 billion euros of notes due in
2014, versus the maximum of 3 billion euros, and investors bid
for 1.36 times the amount of securities sold, from 1.5 times
last month. The yield fell to 5.62 percent, from 7.89 percent at
the previous sale on Nov. 29.  ‘Disappointment’  “Bid-cover ratios were low, but with this being year-end
that is to be expected,”  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London, wrote in a note to clients. “The disappointment will
mainly be that the demand for the three-year failed to show any
improvement above the norm,” even after the ECB provided 489
billion euros of three-year loans to financial institutions last
week, he said.  French 10-year yields climbed seven basis points to 3.08
percent, and the rate on similar-maturity Portuguese securities
increased 17 basis points to 13.53 percent.  Volatility on  France ’s debt was the third-highest among 24
nations tracked by Bloomberg, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The euro fell as much as 0.6 percent to $1.2858, the
weakest level since Sept. 14, 2010. The currency dropped to a
10-year low of 100.06 yen.  German Bonds  German two-year yields fell one basis point to 0.16 percent
after matching yesterday’s low of 0.142 percent, the  least (GDBR2)  since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. The 10-year yield
dropped five basis points to 1.85 percent, after touching 1.83
percent, the lowest since Nov. 18.  The German inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized
European Union method, declined to 2.4 percent from 2.8 percent
in November, the Federal Statistics Office said. Slower
inflation helps preserve the purchasing power of the fixed
income from bonds.  German bonds have returned 9.4 percent this year, according
to the Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
