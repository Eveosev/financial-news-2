Thailand ’s baht fell to its weakest
level since August 2010 after the government cut the economy’s
growth forecast following the worst floods in almost seven
decades.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.1 percent this year,
compared with a November forecast of between 1.7 percent and 2
percent, Somchai Sujjapongse, head of the finance ministry’s
fiscal-policy office, said in Bangkok yesterday. Stock indexes
fell across  Asia  as a surge in the European Central Bank’s
lending to euro-area banks highlighted the growing risks from
the sovereign-debt crisis.  “The currency fell today along with other Asian currencies
on Europe’s lingering debt problems,” said  Frances Cheung , a
senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“Although Thailand was badly hit by the floods, it also gives
more room for it to grow in 2012.”  The baht weakened 0.7 percent to 31.76 per dollar in
Bangkok, taking its drop for the year to 5.6 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.77, the
weakest level since Aug. 18, 2010.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was little changed at 3.17 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year onshore interest-rate swap,
the fixed cost needed to receive a floating payment, fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.88 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
