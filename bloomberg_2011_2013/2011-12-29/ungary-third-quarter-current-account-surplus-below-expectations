Hungary’s third-quarter current-
account surplus shrank from the previous three months and was
smaller than analysts projected as the surplus on the trade of
goods and services declined.  The current-account showed a surplus of 381 million euros
($493 million), compared with a revised 530 million euros in the
April-June period and 260 million euros a year earlier, the
 Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said today. That compares with an estimate
for a 650 million-euro surplus in a Bloomberg survey of 8
economists. The seasonally adjusted current-account surplus was
340 million euros, the central bank said.  Hungary’s current-account balance has been improving as the
economy recovers from a  contraction (HUGPTOTL)  of 6.7 percent in 2009, its
worst in 18 years, which sapped consumer demand and reduced
industrial output. The government expects a current-account
surplus of above 2 percent of gross domestic product in 2012,
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on Sept. 30.  Hungary’s net external financing capacity, or the combined
surplus of the current and capital accounts, was an adjusted 3.5
percent of GDP in the third quarter.  The country had a surplus of 1.8 billion euros in the trade
of goods and services, down from 2.2 billion billion euros in
the previous quarter, while direct investment income showed a
deficit of 1.2 billion euros. Current transfers from the EU had
a surplus of 365 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
