Nordic power companies have failed
to restore power to about 51,000 customers in the region three
days after a storm swept through the region and damaged power
grids.  In Finland, 43,000 homes remain blacked out, including
31,000 households serviced by  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and 6,600 by  Sweden ’s
Vattenfall AB, the companies said today on their websites. The
rest of the power failures are at local utilities.  In Sweden, 7,000 people were without electricity, up from
4,700 earlier today, according to the websites of the three-
largest utilities, including Vattenfall and EON AG. Norway’s
grid operator  Statnett SF  said that about 1,500 clients were
without power, down from 2,500 last night.  The storm Dagmar lashed the Nordic countries with
hurricane-strength winds on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27, damaging
buildings, shutting roads and halting trains. Winds caused
“great damage” to the Finnish power grid, which needs to be
rebuilt in some places, Fortum said.  The repairs may take days in some areas, the Espoo-based
company said. Most of its blacked out customers have been
without power since the storm first hit, Fortum said.  Adequate Compensation  Finland ’s Economy Ministry will assess whether the
compensation paid by the power generators is adequate, Economy
Minister Jyri Haekaemies said in a statement. The ministry seeks
to encourage faster repairs and wider use of underground cables.
The compensation in Finland is currently set at a maximum of 700
euros ($902) per customer.  Putting all low- and medium-voltage network cables
underground may cost from 10 billion euros to 20 billion euros
($26 billion), Haekaemies said in a statement.  Norwegian insurance companies have received 6,000 claims
following storm Dagmar that swept in over Norway over the
Christmas holiday and more are expected, a trade group for
insurers said. Claims have reached 360 million kroner ($60
million), exceeding the 275 million kroner paid out after storm
Berit, Tonje Westby, a spokeswoman for Finance  Norway , which
manages tracking damage from natural disasters, said in a
statement yesterday.  Finnish insurance companies are assessing the extent of
damages and compensation, the Federation of Finnish Financial
Services said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
