Continental AG (CON)  has enjoyed stronger
sales in the fourth quarter than in the third as its electronics
and tire businesses grew faster than competitors,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Elmar Degenhart.  Continental will continue on a “positive path” until at
least March, Sueddeutsche cited Degenhart as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
