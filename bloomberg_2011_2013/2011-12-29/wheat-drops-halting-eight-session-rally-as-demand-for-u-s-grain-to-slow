Wheat futures fell on speculation
that demand will slow from importers and U.S. processors after
the longest price rally in four years.  Futures surged 12 percent in the previous eight sessions,
the longest rally since October 2007, on speculation dry weather
in  South America  would cut grain supplies. About 13.5 million
bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected for export in the week
ended Dec. 22, 18 percent less than a week earlier, according to
the government. Competition has increased for U.S. suppliers, as
countries including Russia and  Australia  boosted output.  Prices “have gotten into levels that start affecting
economics,” Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market
Concepts in Wamego,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview. “The
competitiveness of the product becomes a little hard to
justify.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to settle
at $6.4525 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The most-active contract has dropped 19 percent this year,
heading for the biggest annual slump since 2008.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
