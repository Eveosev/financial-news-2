Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Thailand  trading. (SET)  Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 12:30 p.m. break in
Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,024.54, declining for a
sixth straight day. The measure has fallen 0.8 percent this
year.  Khon Kaen Sugar Industry Pcl (KSL)  , a Thai sugar
producer, advanced 1.5 percent to 13.3 baht, the highest close
since Dec. 7.  Khon Kaen  will probably report “strong” year-on-
year profit growth for the first quarter of 2012, driven by
“substantially greater sugar, ethanol and electricity sales
volume,” Bualuang Securities said in a note to clients dated
today.  Quality Houses Pcl (QH)  , a property developer, rose 1.3
percent to 1.51 baht. The company plans to start sales at 23
real-estate projects valued at 21.4 billion baht ($677 million)
in 2012, the Bangkok Post reported, citing Suwanna
Buddhaprasart, a director at the company. Buddhaprasart couldn’t
be reached when called at her office.  Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC)  , the nation’s
second-biggest mobile-phone company, fell 2.3 percent to 71.5
baht, the lowest close since Sept. 5. The shares declined after
they began trading without the right to a dividend. The stock
was also downgraded to “sell” from “buy” by Rattana
Leenutaphong, an equity analyst at IV Global Securities Pcl.  To contact the reporters on this story:
