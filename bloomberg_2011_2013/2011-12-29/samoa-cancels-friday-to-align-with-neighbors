The South Pacific nation of  Samoa ,
which straddles the international dateline, will skip tomorrow
to align its calendar with nearby trading partners  Australia  and
New Zealand.  Samoa, with less than 200,000 people, will move straight
into New Year’s Eve at midnight, according to a statement on the
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour’s  website . The country
has lived almost one day behind its largest South Pacific
neighbors for more than 120 years after American businessmen
convinced officials to align its time closer to theirs.  “We will be waking up on Saturday 31st December 2011 and
lose one day in our lives, as there will be no Friday 30th
December 2011 in the history of Samoa,” said the statement from
the Apia-based government.  The nation’s government approved the time shift in May
after the time difference caused problems in business deals with
Australia and  New Zealand , according to the  government ’s
website. The country effectively had only four working days in
which to conduct business with the partners.  Samoa comprises 2,934 square kilometers (1,133 square
miles) of two main islands and seven smaller ones. It will move
to the west of the international date line, an imaginary north-
to-south boundary that passes through the middle of the  Pacific
Ocean .  To contact the reporter on this story:
