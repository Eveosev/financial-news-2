MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore miner controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, rose to a
three-week high after signing a $5 billion shipment agreement.  MMX  advanced (MMXM3)  3.3 percent to 6.67 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the highest since Dec. 6.  MRS Logistica (MRSA3B)  SA will transport about 36 million tons of
ore from mines to the Sudeste Superport each year for 26.463
reais per ton ($14.13), according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. The price is in line with the $14 per ton fee
forecast by analysts at Santander, makes the company’s mining
project less risky and will help MMX grow, the analysts wrote.
The value of the contract is about $5 billion over its 14-year
term, Raphael Biderman, an analyst at Banco Bradesco SA, wrote
in an e-mail message.  “Now we have confidence that the rail transportation from
the mine to the port is in place,” Felipe Reis, a Santander
analyst in Sao Paulo who has a “buy” rating on the shares,
said by phone today. “This is one less topic to be concerned
about and it shows the company is moving towards delivering on
what it has planned to become.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
