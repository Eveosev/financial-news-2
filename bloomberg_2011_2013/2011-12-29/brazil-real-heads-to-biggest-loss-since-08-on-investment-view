Brazil ’s real fell, heading for its
biggest yearly loss since 2008, amid speculation  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis will continue to reduce foreign investment
in Latin America’s biggest economy.  The real dropped 0.4 percent to 1.8814 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:20 a.m. in Sao Paulo, from 1.8736 yesterday. The currency has
plunged 12 percent in the last 12 months, its first yearly drop
since 2008 when it fell 26 percent. With markets closed tomorrow
in Brazil, today is the last trading day of 2011.  Brazil recorded foreign-currency outflows of $2.1 billion
from trade and investment this month, the central bank said
yesterday, the third straight month capital left the country.
The  European Central Bank  said yesterday its balance sheet
soared to a record 2.73 trillion euros ($3.51 trillion) after
lending to banks to ease a shortage of capital.  “The market is very sensitive to negative news on the
European situation,” Jose Carlos Amado, a currency trader at
Renascenca DTVM Ltda. in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview.  Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contracts fell for
a third day. The yield on the contract due in January 2013 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.05 percent.  Brazil’s broadest inflation index fell in December for the
first time in five months, lending support to the central bank’s
strategy of cutting  interest rates  to shore up growth.  The IGP-M index of wholesale, construction and consumer
prices dropped 0.12 percent in December from November, when it
climbed 0.5 percent, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said on its
website today. The median estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a decline of 0.05 percent.  Brazil’s central bank has cut the benchmark lending rate
150 basis points since August, to 11 percent, to shore up the
economy amid the debt crisis in Europe. The next two-day policy
meeting starts Jan. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
