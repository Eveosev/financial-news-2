Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , whose genetic
analysis tools are used in disease research and drug
development, accused  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE)  of infringing one
of its patents.  Life Technologies’ Ion Personal Genome Machine and Ion
OneTouch System infringe Illumina’s patent for a method of
“making and decoding of array sensors with microspheres,”
Illumina said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
San Diego. The company seeks a court order stopping the alleged
infringement and unspecified damages.  “Defendants’ infringing acts are willful in that they have
knowledge of Illumina’s rights under the ‘431 Patent, but have
continued to infringe, and actively induce and contribute to
infringement by others,” lawyers for San Diego-based Illumina
said in the complaint.  Mauricio Minotta, a spokesman for Carlsbad, California-
based Life Technologies, didn’t immediately return a call to his
office seeking comment on the complaint.  Life Technologies said in a Dec. 9 statement that its Ion
Personal Genome Machine in June solved  Europe ’s E. coli outbreak
by sequencing the bacteria’s DNA in two hours. The machine is
the first of its kind that translates chemical information into
digital data, the company said in the release.  The case is Illumina v. Life Technologies, 11-3022, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego).  To contact the reporter on this story:
