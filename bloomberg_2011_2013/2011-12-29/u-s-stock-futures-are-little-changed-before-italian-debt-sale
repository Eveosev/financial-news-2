U.S. stocks rose, restoring the 2011
gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as data signaled the
world’s largest economy is weathering Europe’s debt crisis.  All  10 groups (SPXL1)  in the  S&P 500  advanced as financial,
industrial and commodity gauges had the biggest gains.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and Alcoa Inc. increased at
least 1.2 percent. A measure of 12  homebuilders (S15HOME)  in S&P indexes
climbed 4.4 percent as PulteGroup Inc. and  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  jumped
more than 4.6 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a
proxy for economic growth, added 1.4 percent.  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,263.02 at 4 p.m. New York
time, almost wiping out yesterday’s slump. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 135.63 points, or 1.1 percent, to
12,287.04 today. About 4.2 billion shares  changed hands (MVOLUSE)  on U.S.
exchanges, or 46 percent below the three-month average.  “We’ve traveled very far this year, but have gotten
nowhere,”  Todd Lowenstein , a portfolio manager who helps
oversee about $16 billion for Highmark Capital Management Inc.,
said in a telephone interview from  Los Angeles . “Investors are
getting confident that the U.S. may decouple from some of the
European difficulties and not be dragged down into the abyss.
The data is quite strong and is validating the point that the
U.S. really has a certain amount of engines firing on its own.”  With only one trading day left this year, the  S&P 500 (SPX)  is up
0.4 percent in 2011. After rising 8.4 percent to start the year
and reaching an almost three-year high in April, the benchmark
measure for American equities fell as much as 19 percent through
Oct. 3 on concern Europe’s debt crisis would derail global
growth. Since then, the measure has rallied 15 percent.  Top Performers  Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are among the 10 best
performers this year among 91 national indexes tracked by
Bloomberg. The Dow has rallied 6.1 percent in 2011. That’s below
the average gains of 12 percent in years before presidential
elections since its creation in 1896, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg and Dow Jones.  Stocks gained today as companies cranked out more goods in
December and pending sales of existing homes jumped in November
for a second month, pointing to a pickup in U.S. economic growth
as 2011 comes to a close. The number of Americans filing claims
for jobless benefits dropped to 375,000  on average (INJCJC4)  over the past
four weeks, the fewest since June 2008, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington .  Investors also watched developments in  Europe ’s attempt to
tame its crisis. Italy auctioned 7.02 billion euros ($9 billion)
of bonds, falling short of the target, as borrowing costs
declined in its final debt sale of the year.  ‘Very Low’  “There were very low expectations for the Italian bond
auction,” Madelynn Matlock, who helps oversee about $14.5
billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a
telephone interview. “The fact that they got it off and the
price didn’t go up was probably the tiny positive.”  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index added 1.5 percent on
optimism about economic growth. The KBW Bank Index climbed 2.1
percent as all of its 24 stocks gained.  Bank of America rose 3.3 percent to $5.46, after falling
5.6 percent over the previous two days. GE increased 1.4 percent
to $18.07.  Alcoa (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, advanced
1.3 percent to $8.63.  All 12 stocks in the S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index
gained. PulteGroup, the largest homebuilder by revenue, added
6.1 percent to $6.31. Lennar climbed 4.6 percent to $19.86.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  fell less than 0.1 percent to $50.28. The
world’s largest producer of phosphate fertilizer said it will
cut output by as much as 250,000 metric tons through the first
quarter of 2012.  Amazon Falls  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  lost less than 0.1 percent to $173.86. The
world’s largest Internet retailer may miss fourth-quarter sales
estimates, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted, citing slower-
than-expected e-commerce growth over the holidays.  Trading of a new class of contracts that expire a week
after they’re listed pushed U.S. options volume to a ninth-
straight annual record as investors turned to shorter maturities
to hedge risk.  About 4.5 billion contracts changed hands through Dec. 27,
beating last year by 16 percent, according to data from Chicago-
based  OCC , which clears and settles equity derivatives. Weekly
equity options, which didn’t exist before last year, accounted
for 9.3 percent of industry volume for options tied to stocks
and exchange-traded funds this year through November, Steve Crutchfield, chief executive officer of NYSE Amex Options, said
in a telephone interview Dec. 22.  Exclusive License  One-week contracts on individual equities began trading in
June 2010 when NYSE Amex, an exchange owned by  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ,
listed them on the PowerShares QQQ Trust,  SPDR S&P 500 ETF
Trust (SPY) ,  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA)  and iShares
Russell 2000 Index Fund.  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) ’s Chicago Board
Options Exchange began  short-dated options  on the S&P 500 and
other benchmark gauges in 2005. Those trade only on the CBOE
because of an exclusive license, while weekly options on
equities can trade on all nine U.S. exchanges.  “They took off much quicker than we expected,”  Randy Frederick , the Austin, Texas-based director of trading and
derivatives for Charles Schwab Corp., said in a phone interview
Dec. 21. The firm has $1.68 trillion in 8.5 million  client 
accounts. “A good portion of the growth in weeklys has been in
the retail segment. It has definitely contributed to volume.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
