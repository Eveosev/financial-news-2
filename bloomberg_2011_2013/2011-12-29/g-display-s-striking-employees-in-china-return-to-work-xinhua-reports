LG Display Co. factory workers in
the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing returned to work after the
company agreed to double their year-end bonuses, Xinhua News
Agency reported late yesterday, citing a local government
official.  More than 2,000 workers of the South Korean company took
part in the strike, Xinhua reported, citing Cheng Shijun, an
official at the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development
Zone, where the factory is located. About 8,000 Chinese workers
went on strike, according to Sina.com and QQ.com, a news website
run by  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  yesterday.  The workers were unhappy about their year-end bonuses,
equivalent to a monthly salary of 1,400 yuan, which was one-
third of last year’s amount, Cheng was cited as saying by
Xinhua. The report didn’t say what their bonuses have been
raised to.  Officials at LG Display’s public relations team weren’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
