Japan’s Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said he wants to meet regularly with  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa to fight deflation as he tries to lead a
recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami.  “We must closely coordinate with the Bank of Japan to beat
deflation,” Noda said in a meeting of ruling party members
today that was open to reporters. “I want to have discussions
with the Bank of Japan governor on a regular basis face-to-face
in a way that’s transparent to the public.”  Deflation in Japan that first took hold a decade ago has
deepened, with consumer prices excluding fresh food falling 0.2
percent in November from a year earlier after a 0.1 percent
decline the previous month. Industrial output slumped 2.6
percent from October, a government report showed yesterday.  Noda is meeting with  Democratic Party  of Japan lawmakers as
he presses for a tax panel to decide what to do about increasing
the country’s sales tax by this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
