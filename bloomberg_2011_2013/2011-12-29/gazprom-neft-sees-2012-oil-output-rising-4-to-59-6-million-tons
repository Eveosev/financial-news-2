OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN) , the Russian energy
producer controlled by OAO Gazprom, expects oil and natural-gas
output to increase to a record next year as it seeks to almost
double volumes by the end of 2020.  Production will expand to 59.6 million metric tons of oil
equivalent in 2012, or 1.19 million barrels a day, the company
said today in a statement. That’s 4.2 percent more than the 57.2
million tons forecast for this year, the statement shows.  “We have approved a massive investment program for 2012
that will allow record oil output and the continuation of
refinery modernization,” Chairman  Alexei Miller  said in the
statement. Investment in the Omsk and Moscow refineries is set
to reach 25 billion rubles ($780 million) in 2012 through 2014.  Gazprom Neft, based in  St. Petersburg , plans to increase
annual oil and gas output to 100 million tons in the next nine
years as it expands in Iraq, Venezuela and Africa, adds assets
at home and abroad and develops Siberian fields. Global oil
demand is projected to rise 1.4 percent next year, led by Asian
growth, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Gazprom Neft’s SeverEnergia Arctic gas and condensate
project with Enel SpA, Eni SpA and OAO Novatek is due to begin
production next year. The company will also add more than 20
million tons by 2020 from its share of output in Russian fields
at Orenburg, Messoyakha and Novoport, the statement shows.  The company pumped more than 52.8 million tons of oil and
gas in 2010, according to an Oct. 18 presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
