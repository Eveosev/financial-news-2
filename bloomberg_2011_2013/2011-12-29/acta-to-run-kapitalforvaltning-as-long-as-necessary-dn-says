Acta Holding ASA (ACTA)  plans to keep its
Acta Kapitalforvaltning AS unit as long as necessary and has
enough money to meet customer claims, Dagens Naeringsliv
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Geir Inge Solberg.  It was “non-dramatic” and part of the company’s strategy
for Acta Kapitalforvaltning to hand back its license, the Oslo-
based newspaper cited the executive as saying. The unit has
about 90 million kroner ($15 million) to pay claims from
dissatisfied clients, Solberg told DN. Customers are requesting
160 million kroner in damages for losses they suffered during
the financial crisis, the newspaper said.  Acta Kapitalforvaltning has discontinued its licensable
activities and voluntarily surrendered the license to provide
investment services,  Norway ’s Financial Supervisory Authority
said on Dec. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
