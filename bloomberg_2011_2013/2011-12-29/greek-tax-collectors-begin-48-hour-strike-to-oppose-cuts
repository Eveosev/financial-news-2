Greek tax collectors began a 48-hour
strike today to oppose government tax policies and public-sector
staff cuts, ignoring a plea by Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos to call off the walkout.  “Decisions taken by the government contribute to the
destruction of the tax collection mechanism and further
financial distress of workers,” Haralambos Nikolakopoulos, who
heads the Federation of Tax Collectors, said in a letter posted
on the union’s website. “Tax collectors, fully aware of the
difficult situation the country is in, can’t remain silent.”  Fiscal measures tied to international financing for  Greece ,
which agreed to a European Union-led bailout in May 2010 and
secured a second aid package in October, have led to strikes and
protests as Greeks see their wages and pensions reduced and
taxes raised.  Venizelos, at a meeting with union representatives in
Athens yesterday, said the strike would cause “intolerable
damage to fiscal targets.” The union went ahead, saying the
discussion at the meeting was about “generalities” and no
specific commitments were made, according to a separate
statement posted on the union’s website late yesterday.  The union says not enough is being done to clamp down on
 tax evasion .  To contact the reporter on this story:
