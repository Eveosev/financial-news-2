Paris Saint-Germain said it will
hold a news conference today amid reports the French soccer
league leader is set to hire  Carlo Ancelotti  as its new coach.  The club said in a  statement  on its website last night that
the event would begin at 3 p.m. local time at the Parc des
Princes stadium in the French capital.  Ancelotti, who won league titles coaching Italy’s AC Milan
and England’s Chelsea, will make as much as 7 million euros ($9
million) a year, making him the best paid coach in  France , Le
Parisien reported yesterday, without citing anyone. The 52-year-
old was pictured with PSG officials yesterday.  Ancelotti will replace Antoine Kombouare, who was fired
last week even though PSG tops France’s Ligue 1 at the midseason
break. The Qatari Investment Authority bought control of PSG
this year with plans to build it into one of  Europe ’s top teams.
Former England captain  David Beckham  is also in talks to join
the club, which last won the French championship in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
