Taiwan ’s government bonds rose for a
third straight day as economists predicted the central bank will
leave borrowing costs unchanged at a review today. The currency
gained.  The monetary authority will keep its  benchmark discount
rate (TAREDSC)  to banks at 1.875 percent, according to 11 of 15 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. Four predicted a cut to 1.750 percent.
The decision is due after 4 p.m. Taiwan’s dollar reversed
earlier losses after global investors poured $243 million into
local stocks this week through yesterday, taking net purchases
for the month to $1.1 billion, according to exchange data.  “It’s very unlikely the central bank will cut rates this
time, maybe in March when they have a meeting again,” said
George Pu, a Taipei-based bond trader at Sinopac Securities
Corp.  The yield on the 1 percent notes maturing in January 2017,
the most-traded  government securities , dropped to 0.972 percent
from 0.975 percent yesterday, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market. That was the lowest level for  benchmark (GVTWTO5)  five-
year rates since Sept. 26. Benchmark five-year notes have fallen
20 basis points this year.  The monetary authority may halt the sale of monthly 364-day
certificates of deposits next year to maintain the availability
of cash in the system, Pu said.  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$30.290 against its
U.S. counterpart, after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It has advanced 0.3 percent in
2011.  The  overnight money-market rate (NTON) , which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.401 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
