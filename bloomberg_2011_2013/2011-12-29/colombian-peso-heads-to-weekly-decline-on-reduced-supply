Colombia ’s peso rose as data
signaled the world’s largest economy is weathering  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis, helping appetite for higher-yielding
assets.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,939.90 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,941.25 yesterday. The currency fell 1.7 percent this
year. With markets closed tomorrow in Colombia, today is the
last trading day of 2011.  “The latest U.S. numbers are driving away fears of a
recession,” said Omar Escorcia, an analyst at Asesores en
Valores SA brokerage in Bogota. The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest
trading partner, buying about 40 percent of the nation’s
exports.  U.S. stocks extended gains as an index of pending U.S. home
sales rose more than economists forecast, while other reports
showed stronger-than-projected growth in American business
activity and a drop in jobless claims over the past month to a
three-year low.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.64 percent,
according to the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
