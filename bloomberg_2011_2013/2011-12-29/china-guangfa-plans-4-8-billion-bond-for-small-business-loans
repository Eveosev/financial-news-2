China Guangfa Bank Co. will apply to
sell about 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) of bonds next year to
offer financing to small companies as the government seeks to
aid entrepreneurs.  China Guangfa will use the proceeds for loans to small- and
micro-enterprises, the Guangzhou-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The government’s “fine tuning” of economic policy
includes adjustments to areas lacking financial support such as
small and medium-sized enterprises, Xia Bin, a central bank
adviser and researcher at the State Council’s Development
Research Center, said in Beijing Nov. 30. Officials have also
pledged to set up a fund to support smaller companies and
improve their prospects for growth.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988)  won approval to sell as much
as 50 billion yuan of bonds to support lending for small
businesses, the country’s first non-state lender said in a
filing to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange on Nov. 8.  Industrial
Bank Co. (601166)  sold 30 billion yuan of bonds on Dec. 26 and Dec. 28 to
fund loans to small enterprises, according to filings to the
Shanghai stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
