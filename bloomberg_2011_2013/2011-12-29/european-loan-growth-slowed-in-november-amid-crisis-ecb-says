Growth in loans to households and
companies in the 17-nation euro area slowed in November as the
sovereign debt crisis damped demand for credit and banks
tightened lending.  Loans to the private sector grew 1.7 percent from a year
earlier after gaining an annual 2.7 percent in October, the
 European Central Bank  said today. The rate of growth in  M3 money
supply (ECMAM3YY) , which the Frankfurt-based ECB uses as a gauge of future
inflation, fell to 2 percent from 2.6 percent.  “Loan growth reflects the economy and we’re heading for a
credit crunch,” said  Jacques Cailloux , chief European economist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “It’s not going
to get easier as banks deleverage next year.”  The ECB cut its benchmark  interest rate  to 1 percent this
month, matching a record low, and loaned banks a record 489
billion euros ($632 billion) for three years to keep credit
flowing to the economy. So far, banks are depositing excess cash
back with the ECB at the overnight rate of 0.25 percent,
incurring a loss rather than lending it for more elsewhere.  M3 grew 2.5 percent in the three months through November
from the same period a year earlier, the ECB said. M3 is the
broadest gauge of  money supply  and includes cash in circulation,
some forms of savings and money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
