Lupatech SA (LUPA3) , a Brazilian provider of
oil equipment and services that is selling assets to meet debt
payments, said it will offer as much as 700 million reais ($374
million) of new stock.  Brazilian development bank BNDES and pension fund Petros
have agreed to buy a combined 300 million reais of stock in
Lupatech. GP Investments agreed to buy 50 million reais worth of
shares. Existing shareholders will have preferential rights to
buy the remaining 350 million reais worth of equity offered in
the sale, Lupatech said. Petros and BNDES are Lupatech’s second-
and third-largest shareholders.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
producer and Lupatech’s biggest client, plans to use the
company’s services and equipment as it seeks to develop the
Western Hemisphere’s largest crude discovery in more than three
decades. BNDES is looking to help Lupatech implement its
investment plan as part of a policy to expand the domestic oil-
services industry.  Lupatech, based in Caxias do Sul,  Brazil , said it expects
to conclude the stock sale in 45 days. The company also said it
will buy oil-services provider San Antonio Brasil for 50 million
reais.  Lupatech rose 3 percent to 4.43 reais in  Sao Paulo  at 1:20
p.m. The stock has fallen 77 percent this year amid weak demand
for its anchor ropes and valves for offshore oil platforms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
