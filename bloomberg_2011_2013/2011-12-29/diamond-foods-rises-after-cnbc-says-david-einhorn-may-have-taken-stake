Diamond Foods Inc. (DMND)  rose after CNBC
reported that hedge-fund manager  David Einhorn  may have taken a
stake in the snack maker, citing speculation.  Diamond, based in San Francisco,  advanced (DMND)  7.2 percent to
$31.51 at the close in New York. The shares have declined 41
percent this year.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Einhorn, declined to
comment. Stephen Sibert, a spokesman for Diamond Foods, didn’t
respond to a voice mail and an e-mail seeking comment.  Diamond is undergoing an internal and U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into whether it violated
accounting rules. Last month, the company said the internal
probe would delay its purchase of Pringles potato chips from
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  in a deal valued at $2.35 billion.  Speculation that Einhorn, the president of Greenlight
Capital Inc., will invest in Diamond with an accounting probe
going on is “counterintuitive,”  Louis Meyer , an analyst at
Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview.  The shares surged 53 percent on Dec. 9 after an analyst at
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. said the investigation would
conclude quickly and wouldn’t jeopardize the acquisition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
