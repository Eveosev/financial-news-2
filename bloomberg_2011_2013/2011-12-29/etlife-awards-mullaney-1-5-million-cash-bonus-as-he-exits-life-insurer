MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it plans to award William Mullaney, the former
head of its U.S. business, cash-incentive compensation of $1.5
million for 2011 as the company prepares for his departure.  Mullaney is also scheduled to receive $1.8 million in long-
term stock-based compensation, New York-based MetLife said today
in a regulatory filing. Mullaney will also get $650,000 in
exchange for his cooperation with the company and a pledge not
to “make statements that damage, disparage, or otherwise
diminish MetLife’s reputation and business,” MetLife said.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  eliminated
Mullaney’s job in November when he placed the U.S. business in a
larger Americas division under the supervision of William Wheeler. Kandarian is reorganizing the insurer since his
promotion to CEO in May.  Mullaney will be a consultant to Kandarian until March 31,
MetLife said. The company will provide Mullaney with
outplacement services and it agreed not to disparage him,
MetLife said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
