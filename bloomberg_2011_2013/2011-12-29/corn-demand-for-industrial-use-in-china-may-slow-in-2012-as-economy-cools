Industrial use of corn in  China , the
second-biggest consumer, may grow at the slowest pace in at
least five years as the economy cools, curbing the need for
imports, said state-affiliated researcher Cngrain.com.  The amount processed may expand by 5 percent in the year
ending Sept. 30 to 55 million metric tons, compared with 11
percent last year, Cngrain.com analyst Zhang Zhixian said in an
interview on Dec. 27. The researcher is owned by China Grain
Reserves Corp., which manages state grain inventories.  Lower Chinese demand for imported corn may pressure prices
in  Chicago , which have tumbled 17 percent since Aug. 31 on high
global grain supplies and concern that  Europe ’s deepening debt
crisis and a slowing global economy may sap demand.  China’s
economy  will grow 8.5 percent next year, down from 10.4 percent
in 2010, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development projected on Nov. 28.  “China’s economic growth is causing people a lot of
concern,” Chen Baomin, a manager at Jilin Grain Group Co.,
said by phone from Shandong. “High corn prices have also caused
industrial corn demand to slow.”  Spot prices for corn in  Dalian (JCIACODA)  surged to a record of more
than 2,500 yuan ($395) a ton in September, compared with 2,080
yuan at the beginning of the year，according to data from
 Shanghai  JC Intelligence Co.  “Industrial corn consumption is much more dependent on the
economy, which is seen slowing,” Cngrain.com’s Zhang said by
phone from Zhengzhou. “The rapid growth of the sector is over,
and it is settling down to a modest and stable rate,” Zhang
said.  Fivefold Jump  Non-feed usage of corn has jumped about fivefold in the
last 10 years, making up about one third of the total, Zhang
said. It has grown by more than 10 percent a year since
2007-2008, and helped deplete China’s surplus, according to
Zhang.  China imported 1.3 million tons of corn in 2009-2010, the
most in 14 years, according to data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . It may have also ordered 4.2 million tons this year
to boost its state reserves, Zhang said.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $6.4125 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 5:57 p.m in  Shanghai .  Supply ‘Comfortable’  Supply this year will be more “comfortable” because of a
record harvest, Zhang said. Output may rise 9 percent to record
180 million tons, Cngrain.com estimated. That compares with
191.8 million tons reported by China’s official statistics
authority. The U.S., the largest producer and exporter,
harvested 313 million tons this year, USDA data show.  China will receive 3.5 million tons of shipments from the
U.S. in the 2011-2012 marketing year as these were purchased
this year and contracted to be delivered through 2012, he said.  Prices of starch, alcohol, protein and corn oil have all
declined between 3 percent and 6 percent this month from
November, and declining profits are forcing out some inefficient
plants, Zhang said. The government is also curbing the expansion
of the industry and will phase out inefficient plants to ensure
supplies for livestock feed, he said.  Livestock corn demand, still the biggest share of China’s
consumption, may rise by 5 million tons to 105 million tons,
which is a more “sustained pace,” Zhang said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
