The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell
for a third day as a surge in lending by the  European Central
Bank  to ease the debt crisis sent the euro to a 10-year low
against the yen, clouding the earnings outlook for exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , maker of  office equipment  that gets about a
third of its sales in Europe, fell 0.4 percent.  Elpida Memory
Inc. (6665)  sank 5.1 percent after a report the chipmaker may seek to
delay repayment of bailout funds. Olympus Corp., the camera
maker that has lost about its value amid an accounting scandal,
rebounded 5.3 percent.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 8,398.89 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo . With one trading day left this year, the gauge
is headed for an 18 percent drop in 2011, its biggest full-year
decline since 2008. Volume on the Nikkei was about half the 100-
day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
broader Topix Index finished up 0.1 percent after earlier
dropping as much as 0.6 percent.  The surge in ECB lending “has caused the euro to drop
against the yen, fueling investors’ concern on the region’s debt
issues,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Some investors are buying
cheap stocks as institutional investors have already sold out of
Japanese stocks.”  ECB Lending  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.4 percent
today. The measure dropped 1.3 percent in  New York  yesterday
after the ECB said its balance sheet ballooned to a record
following last week’s loans to banks. The loans were meant to
encourage banks to buy  government bonds .  The 17-nation currency depreciated to as low as 100.36 yen
today in Tokyo, the lowest since 2001. A weaker euro reduces the
value of European income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Exporters to Europe declined. Canon fell 0.4 percent to
3,400 yen. Ricoh Co., a maker of cameras and copiers that gets
21 percent of its revenue in Europe, slid 0.6 percent to 663 yen.  In Japan, a computer glitch slowed trading “momentarily”
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, bourse spokesman Satoshi
Mimura said. A blockage in some networking cables was fixed and
the problem didn’t affect transactions, Mimura said by phone.
Mimura declined to say how long the problem lasted.  The following are among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Asahi Tec Corp. (5606)  (5606 JT), a maker of iron products for
cars, soared 10 percent to 32 yen, its highest since March 11.
RHJ International SA (RHJI BB) agreed to sell its stake in Asahi
Tec to private-equity firm Unison Capital Group, according to a
statement.  Cosmos Pharmaceutical Corp. (3349)  (3349 JT), a drugstore operator,
advanced 3.4 percent to 3,975 yen. The retailer boosted its
full-year net income forecast 16 percent to 6.81 billion yen
($87.6 million) on growing sales buoyed by good weather and
consumers who prefer low-end products.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665 JT) sank 5.1 percent to 351 yen
after the Asahi newspaper reported the company may seek to delay
payments to the government, saying the European crisis had hurt
earnings. The company in August 2009 received a 30 billion yen
capital injection from the state-owned  Development Bank  of Japan
following a record loss.  J Trust Co. (8508 JO), a financial-services company, surged
11 percent to 556 yen. Consumer lender  Takefuji Corp. (8564)  (8564 JP)
said it chose J Trust to acquire the company for 25.2 billion
yen after South Korea’s A&P Financial Co. was unable to meet
obligations. Takefuji will be reorganized under J Trust’s Lopro
unit, according to a statement.  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  (6503 JT), a maker of electronic
equipment, rose 1.8 percent to 724 yen. The company expects
operating profit next fiscal year will probably exceed the
record 267.2 billion yen reached in the fiscal 2007, the Nikkei
newspaper reported, citing President Kenichiro Yamanishi. Orders
for factory automation systems are recovering at the plants
damaged by floods in Thailand, the report said.  Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. (6474)  (6474 JT), a maker of bearings and
machine tools, gained 2.4 percent to 337 yen. Operating profit
at Nachi-Fujikoshi probably jumped 80 percent to about 15
billion yen in the fiscal year ended November due to strong
sales of robots and machine tools for  China  and other emerging
markets, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Sharp Corp. (6753 JT), Japan’s largest producer of liquid-
crystal displays, lost 3.2 percent to 666 yen, extending
yesterday’s 3.2 percent drop, after it and other display
producers including Samsung Electronics Co. agreed to pay $538.6
million to settle antitrust claims by indirect purchasers.  Terumo Corp. (4543)  (4543 JT), a maker of medical devices, slipped
3.2 percent to 3,630 yen after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut the
stock price estimate on the stock to 4,600 yen from 5,100 yen,
citing an expected drop in catheter prices.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo.
