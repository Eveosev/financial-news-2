Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  is
aiming for a first round win in Russia’s March presidential
elections, Gazeta.ru reported, citing two people familiar with
the matter.  Putin’s campaign is now being handled by Vyacheslav Volodin, a leader in the ruling United Russia party who this
week replaced the government’s top political strategist,
 Vladislav Surkov , as first deputy head of the presidential
administration, the Moscow-based news site said, citing an
unnamed Kremlin official.  The prime minister, who is confronting the biggest anti-
government protests in more than a decade after alleged fraud in
Dec. 4 parliamentary elections, doesn’t want to drag out the
electoral process with a second round, Gazeta.ru cited an
official in Putin’s campaign team as saying.  This strategy risks triggering bigger protests after the
March 4 vote as Putin’s victory on the first round will require
mass fraud, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin adviser.
Putin’s spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov , wasn’t immediately available
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
