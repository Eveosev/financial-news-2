SeverEnergia,  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s
gas venture with OAO Gazprom Neft and OAO Novatek, will borrow
about 120 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) from banks to create one
of  Russia ’s biggest producers of the fuel, Vedomosti reported.  State-run  OAO Sberbank  and VTB Group agreed to provide 50
and 30 percent of the loan for the Arctic project, respectively,
and Gazprombank the rest, the Moscow-based newspaper said today,
citing unidentified bankers familiar with the matter.  Gazprom Neft expects SeverEnergia to start production in
the Yamal region of the Arctic next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
