The  Cyprus Bankers Employers’
Association  and bank employees’ union  ETYK  agreed on a wage
freeze in the east Mediterranean island’s banking sector for
2012 and 2013, the CBEA said.  The two sides also agreed to cut pay scales for new hires
at banks, and modify retirement benefits for bank employees who
will start paying contributions into their provident fund,
Andreas Eliades, chief executive officer of Bank of Cyprus,
which chairs the CBEA, told reporters in Nicosia today. The
asociation will pay 1 million euros ($1.3 million) into ETYK’s
social fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
