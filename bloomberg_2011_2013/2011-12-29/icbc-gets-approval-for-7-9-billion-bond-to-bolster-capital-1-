Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. (1398) , the world’s biggest lender by market value, won
approval to sell as much as 50 billion yuan ($7.9 billion) of
subordinated bonds to bolster its capital.  The sale in  China ’s interbank bond market was approved by
the  China Banking Regulatory Commission  and the People’s Bank of
China, the Beijing-based lender said in a filing to the  Hong
Kong  stock exchange yesterday.  China’s five biggest banks are seeking funding from the
domestic and overseas bond markets to replenish capital as
regulators tighten requirements to curb inflation and reduce the
risk of defaults. Shares of the lenders, which raised $61.5
billion from equities last year, have lost an average 22 percent
this year on concern that a record two-year credit boom may
unravel and lead to rising bad debts.  The two-day sale of fixed-rate bonds will start today,
comprising 10 billion yuan of 10-year bonds and 40 billion yuan
of 15-year securities, according to a Dec. 26 statement posted
on Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt clearing house.  Banks have led returns in China’s bond market this year on
signs of monetary policy easing, even as the risk of holding
their debt doubled.  Finance company bonds, including  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) , returned 7.9 percent, topping the 7.4 percent gain for
utilities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s China
Broad Market Index. The performance beat a loss of 0.2 percent
for global financial notes, the data show. Contracts to protect
 Bank of China Ltd. (3988) ’s debt from non-payment rose to 274 basis
points from 121 on Jan. 1, prices from data provider CMA show.  Shareholders of ICBC approved plans to raise as much as 70
billion yuan by selling subordinated bonds through the end of
June 30, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
