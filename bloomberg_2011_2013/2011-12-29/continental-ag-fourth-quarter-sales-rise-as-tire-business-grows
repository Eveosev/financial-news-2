Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
biggest car-parts maker, said revenue in the fourth quarter will
be slightly higher than in the third as the company’s tire and
electronics businesses grew faster than competitors.  Customer demand shows that the fourth quarter is developing
very well, said Antje Lewe, a spokeswoman for the Hanover,
Germany-based company, confirming a report in today’s
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  “The environmental requirements for tires and the higher
safety requirements is something from which we as a supplier are
profiting,” Lewe said by telephone. “Demand from our customers
particularly in the tire business and the electronics business
has grown strongly.”  Earnings before interest and taxes at Continental, whose
biggest shareholder is German roller-bearing maker  Schaeffler
Group , surged 74 percent to 635.7 million euros ($822 million)
in the third quarter on sales of 7.71 billion euros. The company
has predicted full-year revenue of 29.5 billion euros or more.  Continental will publish full fourth-quarter figures
alongside its annual results on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
