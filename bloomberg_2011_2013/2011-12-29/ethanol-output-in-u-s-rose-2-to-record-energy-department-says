Ethanol  output (DOETFETH)  in the U.S. increased
2 percent last week to 962,000 barrels a day, according to an
Energy Department report. It was the highest production since
the department began weekly reports in June 2010.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  rose to 17.7 million barrels, the department
said in the report released in  Washington  today. Output was 5.4
percent higher than a year earlier.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol (DOETCWAT) 
slipped 0.4 percent to 5.24 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel, a measure that expires Dec. 31.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.23 a gallon at 11:04 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have dropped 6.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
