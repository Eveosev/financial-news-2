Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) ’s
$27.1 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit was approved
by a U.S. judge who said the deal was reasonable and would allow
the bankrupt company to complete its Chapter 11 plan.  The Police and Fire Retirement System of Detroit had
challenged the bankruptcy judge’s September approval of the
deal, partly because it stops other parties from suing Ambac,
the bankrupt holding company for a failed bond insurer.  In a memorandum and order filed in court today, U.S.
District Judge Naomi Buchwald said the bankruptcy judge was
right to approve the deal after determining the settlement fell
“well above the lowest point in the range of reasonableness,”
warranting its approval by court measures.  “Settlements are strongly favored in the bankruptcy
context, as they help clear a path for the efficient
administration of the bankrupt estate,” she wrote in the
memorandum.  The shareholder suits against Ambac, which filed for
bankruptcy in 2010, sought to recover losses suffered because of
Ambac’s exposure to the credit crisis tied to subprime
mortgages. Ambac will pay $2.5 million, and its insurers will
pay the remaining $24.6 million, according to Buchwald.  Creditors’ votes on Ambac’s reorganization plan must be in
by Jan. 30, Ambac said this month. The company listed
 liabilities (ABK)  of $1.68 billion in its initial Chapter 11 petition.  The holding company case is In re  Ambac Financial Group
Inc. (ABK) , 10-15973,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
