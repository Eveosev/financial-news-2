PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s largest
gas producer, started commercial operations at its liquefied
natural gas terminal in Dalian, said parent  China  National
Petroleum Corp. in its online newsletter today.  The terminal started delivering gas on Dec. 27 at a daily
rate of 6 million cubic meters to the Dalian-Shenyang pipeline
network in the northeastern Liaoning province,  said  CNPC.  China, the world’s biggest energy user, is planning to
triple the use of gas by 2020 to about 10 percent of total
consumption to cut reliance on more polluting coal and oil.
PetroChina started commercial operation of its first LNG
terminal in the eastern Jiangsu province on Nov. 8.  The Dalian terminal, which has a designed capacity of 3
million metric tons a year, started trial operations last month
when it received its first cargo on the tanker Expedient on Nov.
