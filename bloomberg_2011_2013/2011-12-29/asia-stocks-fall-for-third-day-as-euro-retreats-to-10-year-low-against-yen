U.S. stocks rose, restoring the
yearly gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as economic
data signaled the U.S. is weathering  Europe ’s debt crisis. The
euro erased an earlier loss versus the dollar and European
shares gained. Treasuries rose.  The  S&P 500  climbed 1.1 percent to close at 1,263.02 at 4
p.m. in  New York , leaving it up 0.4 percent for the year, and
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 135.63 points, or 1.1
percent, to 12,287.04. The euro added 0.2 percent to $1.2964,
after falling as much as 0.6 percent, and trimmed a 0.8 percent
slide versus the yen to 0.3 percent.  Italy ’s 10-year bond yield
rose three basis points to 7.03 percent after climbing 13 basis
points earlier. Ten-year U.S. Treasury rates lost two basis
points to 1.90 percent.  U.S. equities  extended early gains (SPX)  as an index of pending
U.S. home sales rose more than economists forecast, while other
reports showed stronger-than-projected growth in American
business activity and a drop in jobless claims over the past
month to a three-year low. European stocks fell earlier, while
the euro touched a decade low against the yen and a 15-month low
versus the dollar, after Italy raised less than its maximum
target at a debt auction.  “There has been a much better tone in the U.S.,”  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. “We’re
optimistic that corporate earnings can continue to be strong and
that will be a driver of the market.”  Financials Lead  Financial stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 percent as a
group to lead an advance in all  10 of the main industries (SPXL1)  as
 Wells Fargo & Co ., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
advanced more than 2.3 percent to pace gains. The group of 80
banks, insurers and investment firms has tumbled 18 percent this
year for the worst performance among the 10 industries.  M/I Homes Inc. and KB Home rose more than 6 percent to lead
gains in all 12 companies in an S&P gauge of  homebuilders (S15HOME) . The
National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales
increased 7.3 percent to the highest level since April 2010.
Economists forecast a 1.5 percent gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, dropped to 375,000
last week, the lowest level since June 2008, Labor Department
figures showed. Applications rose for the first time in a month
in the week ended Dec. 24, climbing by a more-than-forecast
15,000 to 381,000.  Economic Data  Other data showed business activity in the U.S. expanded
more than forecast in December, prompting companies to boost
employment. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s
business barometer was 62.5. Readings above 50 signal growth.
Economists forecast the gauge would fall to 61, according to the
median of estimates in a survey.  Yields on two-year Treasuries were also little changed,
trading at 0.27 percent, while 30-year bond yields lost two
basis points to 2.90 percent. U.S. Treasuries are up 9.6 percent
in 2011, headed for their best year since 2008, according to
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch indexes. The ten-year yield
reached a record low of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities was little changed as
natural gas, cocoa and lean hogs fell at least 1.3 percent to
lead losses among 13 of 24 materials, while lead, silver and
sugar climbed more than 1.6 percent each.  Gold futures fell for a sixth straight session, the longest
slump since March 2009, with a 1.5 percent drop to $1,540.90.
Gold, which is poised to complete its 11th consecutive annual
gain, is on the brink of a  bear market . Gold futures have
declined 19 percent from a record close of $1,891.90 in August,
or 1 percentage point away from a bear-market plunge of 20
percent.  ‘Constructive on Gold’  “We’re still constructive on gold, as a hedge, a store
value,” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, told Bloomberg Television.
“If investors continue to gravitate toward it as a currency in
lieu of other fiat currencies that are in the process of being
debased by many central governments around the world.”  Oil in New York gained 0.3 percent to $99.65 a barrel.
Prices have gained 9.1 percent this year.  The euro weakened against 11 of 16 major peers, losing at
least 0.3 percent versus the Australian dollar, Norwegian krone
and South African rand. The dollar weakened against 13 of 16

index. The dollar has advanced 1.5 percent and the yen has
gained 4.8 percent.  Leaders in the European parliament have proposed including
a “road map” for common euro-region bonds in a new European
treaty on fiscal discipline, the  Financial Times  reported,
citing amendments submitted to the treaty’s drafters. The
amendments, which would not create common bonds immediately,
would focus on creating conditions where  Germany  may support the
plan, the newspaper reported on its website.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  increased 0.9 percent today as
real-estate firms, utilities and chemical companies led gains.
The Stoxx 600 has dropped 12 percent this year, compared with an
18 percent slump in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The S&P 500 had
drifted above and below its 2010 closing level since the end of
October and the Dow has gained 6.1 percent this year, with both

indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  Emerging Markets   The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.1 percent after
falling for three straight day. Russia’s Micex climbed 0.3
percent. Indian stocks dropped for a third day, with the Sensex
sliding 1.2 percent.  China ’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 0.2 percent, a

requirements after New Year’s Day, according to a commentary in
the China Securities Journal today. Reserve ratios were last cut

year to cool inflation and exports to Europe slowed because of
the debt crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
