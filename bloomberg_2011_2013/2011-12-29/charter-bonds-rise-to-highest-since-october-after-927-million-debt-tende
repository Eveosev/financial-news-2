Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR)  bonds
rose to the highest since October after the fourth-largest U.S.
cable company completed a $927 million debt tender that cuts
interest costs and said it will buy back shares from Oaktree
Capital Management LP and Apollo Global Management LLC.  Its $1 billion of 7.25 percent notes due in October 2017
gained 1.5 cents to 106 cents on the dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities,
which yield 5.8 percent, are at the highest level since Oct. 26.  Charter aimed to refinance as much as $1 billion, including
high-cost debt that funded its November 2009 bankruptcy exit.
The St. Louis-based company has gained 45 percent in 2011 as it
pushed out maturities and repurchased 12.7 percent of its
outstanding shares, even after reporting net losses in all
except one of its quarters since the reorganization.  “It’s a great transaction for the company,” said Lance Vitanza, a senior media analyst for CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , who estimates the tender will save
Charter $30 million a year or more in annual interest expense.  Investors offered $407 million of 2012 notes, $234 million
of 2014 bonds and $669.4 million in 2016 notes, Charter said
today in a statement. The company accepted all of the 2012 and
2014 tender offers and $286 million of the 2016 note offer.  Charter arranged a $750 million  term loan  this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $750
million of 7.375 notes due June 2020 on Nov. 30 to finance the
tender. The bonds, which priced at 100 cents on the dollar to
yield 558 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
last traded at 105.4 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg and Trace
data show.  Moody’s Rating  The second-lien notes due in 2012 have an 8 percent coupon,
the 2014 bonds pay 10.875 percent and the 2016 senior notes
carry a 13.5 percent coupon.  “The transaction favorably extends the maturity profile
without materially impacting leverage and could modestly reduce
interest expense,” Moody’s Investors Service said in a Nov. 30
statement. The rating company grades Charter Ba3.  Charter bought back about 4.125 million shares of its class
A stock at a cost of about $200 million, the company said in a
separate statement today. It has agreed to purchase a further
5.891 million in privately negotiated transactions.  Charter rose 52 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $56.48 as of 1:09
p.m. in  New York .  Analysts  surveyed (CHTR)  by Bloomberg don’t expect the company to
earn a profit through next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
