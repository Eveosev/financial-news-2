Nathan Blanche, a partner and
economist at Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Tendencias
Consultoria Integrada, comments on the outlook for the Brazilian
currency in 2012. His forecast for the real to strengthen to 1.7
per  U.S. dollar  would represent a 9.8 percent gain. He spoke in
a telephone interview.  On the possibility of a worsening European debt crisis:  “Even with a lot of volatility in the first half of 2012,
we probably won’t have a credit crunch. The situation in  Europe 
should be under control in the second half. I expect the real at
1.70 per dollar at the end of 2012.”  On government currency measures:  “I assume the government will retract most of the measures
previously taken to contain the real’s appreciation.”  On currency inflows:  “Brazil’s trade surplus will continue to be sustained by
commodities. Foreign exchange inflows to the country will
continue to be positive, although smaller next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
