The U.S. Interior Department is
seeking comment on how it should issue right-of-way leases for
competing solar and wind projects on government land.  The department wants to establish a competitive bidding
process that would bring “fair market value for the use of
public land,” it said in a  statement today . The government is
considering bidding procedures within zones designated for wind
and solar projects, including how companies would qualify and
what financial arrangements would apply. A 60-day comment period
ends Feb. 27.  These zones may be beneficial to birds, the American Bird
Conservancy said in a statement today. “American Bird
Conservancy is developing a map of the areas where  wind energy 
would be most risky to birds,” said Kelly Fuller, the
organization’s wind-campaign coordinator.  The Department’s Bureau of Land Management oversees 245
million acres (992,000 sq. kilometers) across the U.S, according
to the report. It plans to have 10,000 megawatts of wind, solar
and geothermal projects approved by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
