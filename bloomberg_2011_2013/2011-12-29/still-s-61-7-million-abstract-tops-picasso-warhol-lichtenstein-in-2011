As the European debt crisis roiled
financial markets in 2011, the value of the most expensive works
of art sold at auction fell 41 percent.  The priciest 10 lots amounted to $413.6 million, compared
with a tally of $698.6 million in 2010, according to Bloomberg
News calculations.  With a dearth of major estates and masterpieces by market
stars, not a single artwork crossed the $100 million threshold
in 2011, compared to two pieces the previous year:  Pablo Picasso ’s 1932 painting “Nude,  Green Leaves  and Bust,” which
fetched $106.5 million at Christie International, and  Alberto Giacometti ’s bronze “Walking Man,” which sold for 65 million
pounds (then $103.4 million) at Sotheby’s.  Evening sales of Impressionist and modern art in  London  and
New York dropped by 21 percent from last year; their postwar and
contemporary counterparts fared better, gaining 35 percent,
according to Bloomberg News calculations. Together, the major
auctions, including private collections, in these categories at
Sotheby’s and Christie’s International tallied $3 billion, just
beating the $2.9 billion in 2010.  Museum-quality works by undervalued artists, from  Old
Masters  to postwar set records and ignited bidding wars.  Here are the year’s 10 most valuable artworks at auction.  1. A large abstract painting by Clyfford Still fetched a
record $61.7 million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  on Nov.  9 , surpassing the
reclusive artist’s previous auction high of $21.3 million. The
brooding canvas, “1949-A-No.1,” led a group of four Still lots
consigned by the City of Denver to raise money for the endowment
of the  Clyfford Still Museum , which opened in November. The
group tallied $114.1 million.  2.  Roy Lichtenstein ’s 1961 painting of a man looking
through a peephole sold for $43.2 million at Christie’s
International on Nov.  8 , setting a record for the pop artist.
Titled “I Can See the Whole Room!… And There’s Nobody in It!”
it was consigned by Courtney Ross, the widow of former Time
Warner Chief Executive Officer Steven J. Ross.  3. An 18th-century view of  Venice ’s Grand Canal by Francesco Guardi fetched 26.7 million pounds ($42.7 million) at Sotheby’s
on July  6 , a record for the artist and the second-highest price
paid at auction for an Old Master painting. Dating from the late
1760s, the work was consigned by heirs of the Conservative
politician Paul Channon, who died in 2007. The record auction
price for an Old Master is 49.5 million pounds for Peter Paul Rubens’s “Massacre of the Innocents” at Sotheby’s London in
2002.  4. Pablo Picasso’s painting of his mistress Marie-Therese
Walter sold for 25.2 million pounds ($40.5 million) at Sotheby’s
on Feb.  8 . Painted in 1932 -- the same year as Picasso’s Walter-
inspired “Nude, Green Leaves and Bust” -- ”La Lecture”
attracted seven bidders and was bought by a client of Mark Poltimore, deputy chairman of Sotheby’s  Europe , who works with
Russian buyers.  5. A 1915 landscape by  Gustav Klimt  surged past its presale
estimate of $25 million to reach $40.4 million at Sotheby’s on
Nov.  2 . Stolen by the Nazis from its Jewish owner, the work was
consigned by the woman’s grandson, Georges Jorisch. “Litzlberg
am Attersee” depicts verdant hills above the lake of the title
in western  Austria . Earlier in the year, Museum of  Modern Art  in
Salzburg, Austria, returned the painting to Jorisch. Zurich
dealer David Lachenmann bought the work on behalf of a client
who he declined to identify.  6. A 1914 townscape by  Egon Schiele  fetched an artist
record 24.7 million pounds ($40 million) at Sotheby’s on June
 22 . Titled ”Houses with Laundry (Suburb II),” the work was
offered by the Leopold Museum in Vienna to pay for its
“Portrait of Wally,” Schiele’s 1912 portrait of his lover
Walburga (Wally) Neuzil at the heart of the world’s longest-
running art-restitution case. Sotheby’s Poltimore bought the
work for a client.  7. Andy Warhol ’s 1963-64 “Self-Portrait,” made of four
photo-booth-strip images in different shades of blue, sold for
$38.4 million at Christie’s on May  11 .  8.  Francis Bacon ’s 1964 painting “Three Studies for a
Portrait of Lucian Freud” fetched 23 million pounds ($37
million) at Sotheby’s on Feb.  10 . The artist sitter, grandson of
 Sigmund Freud , died in July. The triptych was the star of a 60-
lot sale of works that had belonged to the low-key Geneva
collector George Kostalitz. The group raised 93.5 million
pounds.  9. A 1765 painting of a champion race horse by George
Stubbs brought an artist record 22.4 million pounds ($36
million) at  Christie’s  on July  5 . Titled “Gimcrack on Newmarket
Heath, with a Trainer, a Stable-Lad, and a Jockey,” the canvas
depicted a horse that had won 27 of the 36 races he entered. It
was consigned by the U.K.-based  Woolavington Collection  and was
bought with a single bid by Piers Davies Fine Art of  New York .  10. An undocumented Mark Rothko canvas, “Untitled No.
17,” fetched $33.7 million at Christie’s on May  11 , surpassing
its high estimate of $22 million. Painted in 1961, it depicted
pink and red rectangles on a tangerine-yellow background and
hadn’t been seen publically since 1965.  (Katya Kazakina and Scott Reyburn are reporters for Muse,
