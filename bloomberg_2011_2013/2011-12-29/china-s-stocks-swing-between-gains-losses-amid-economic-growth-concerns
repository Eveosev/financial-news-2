China stocks (IFB1)  rose for a second day,
with the benchmark index capping its first back-to-back advance
in a month, as investors speculated declines were overdone.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , China’s largest carmaker paced gains by
automakers after the People’s Daily said the government will
boost spending on rural road construction. Sany Heavy Industry
Co., the maker of construction equipment run by China’s richest
man, added 1.1 percent. Chongqing Iron & Steel Co. fell 1.7
percent after the steelmaker said it may post a “substantial”
loss this year.  “Low valuations and anticipation of policy easing have
enticed some buying interest,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based
chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co.,
which manages about $120 million. “The trend on the broader
market hasn’t changed with economic growth still slowing.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,173.56
at the close, adding to yesterday’s 0.2 percent gain. The gauge
closed at the lowest level since March 2009 on Dec. 27. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.2 percent to 2,311.36 today. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, retreated 0.8 percent yesterday in  New York .  The central bank may cut banks’ reserve requirements after
New Year’s Day, according to a commentary in the China
Securities Journal today. Reserve ratios were last cut by 50
basis points to 21 percent with effect from Dec. 5.  December Decline  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 6.9 percent in December,
taking the year-to-date drop to 23 percent. The central bank
raised  interest rates  three times this year to cool inflation
and exports to  Europe  slowed because of the debt crisis.
Slumping equity prices helped send the  value (VOSHTVA)  of stocks traded in
 Shanghai  to the weakest level in three years on Dec. 26.  The 14-day relative strength measure for the Shanghai
Composite, which measures how rapidly prices have advanced or
dropped during a specified time period, was at 29.8 yesterday.
Readings below 30 indicate to some traders that stocks may be
poised to rise.  SAIC Motor advanced 4.1 percent to 13.88 yuan. FAW Car Co.,
which makes passenger cars in China with Volkswagen AG, jumped
7.9 percent to 8.45 yuan, trimming its loss to 47 percent this
year.  Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. (600418) , a unit of China’s biggest
light-truck exporter, added 2.5 percent to 5.68 yuan.  China will invest more than 200 billion yuan ($31.6
billion) in rural  road construction  in the five years through
2015, the People’s Daily reported, without citing anyone. The
investment will be more than the total of the previous five-year
period, it said.  Stocks Discount  Sany Heavy gained 1.1 percent to 12.39 yuan. Guangxi
Liugong Machinery Co., a Chinese maker of construction
equipment, advanced 0.8 percent to 11.67 yuan.  Companies in the Shanghai Composite  traded (SHCOMP)  at a record-low
10.41 times on Dec. 22, the biggest discount to the ratio for
the MSCI AC World Index since April 13, 2006, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The growth outlook is pretty bleak next year as the
government won’t increase  money supply  aggressively or introduce
a huge stimulus plan because inflation is still at a pretty high
level,” said  Zhang Qi , an analyst in Shanghai at Haitong
Securities Co., China’s third-largest brokerage.  China’s gross domestic product growth will slow to 8.5
percent in 2012, the least in 11 years, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The
nation’s money supply expanded 12.7 percent in November, the
smallest monthly change in a decade.  Profit Warning  Chongqing Steel retreated 1.7 percent to 2.89 yuan. The
steelmaker said it may post a loss this year, citing a downturn
in demand for steel products as well as higher raw material
prices and operating costs.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , the listed unit of China’s
second-biggest steelmaker, dropped 1.2 percent to 4.85 yuan.
Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of the second largest,
lost 0.7 percent to 2.84 yuan.  Suning Universal Co. (000718)  plunged the 10 percent daily limit to
5.39 yuan. The China Securities Regulatory Commission is
investigating the property developer for suspected violations of
information disclosure requirements, the company said in a
statement.  The benchmark money-market rate surged the most in three
months as banks hoarded cash to meet year-end  capital
requirements  and customer withdrawals ahead of the Lunar New
Year on Jan. 23.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose the most since Sept. 27, according to
a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center. The People’s Bank of  China  suspended a three-
month bill sale for the first time since June and also didn’t
offer 91-day repos today, according to a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at auctions, who wouldn’t be identified
because of central bank restrictions.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
