India ’s food inflation rate fell to
the lowest level in at least five-and-a-half years, increasing
the scope for the central bank to cut  interest rates  after it
halted a record pace of monetary tightening.  An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products, including rice, wheat and vegetables, rose 0.42
percent in the week ended Dec. 17 from a year earlier, the
commerce ministry said in a statement in  New Delhi  today. The
increase compares with a 1.81 percent gain the previous week,
and is the smallest gain since at least April 2006, according to
the earliest available data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Reserve Bank of India  refrained from raising rates this
month for the first time in eight meetings as inflation eases
and the fallout from  Europe ’s debt crisis threatens growth in
Asia’s third-largest economy. Slowing expansion in the region
has prompted policy makers to cut or hold borrowing costs in
recent months to counter faltering global demand.  “Food inflation is coming off rapidly,” Shubhada Rao,
Mumbai-based chief economist at Yes Bank Ltd., said before the
report. “We expect the RBI may cut the repurchase rate by 50
basis points in March to support growth.”  India’s benchmark inflation gauge, the  wholesale-price
index , rose 9.11 percent in November from a year earlier, the
smallest gain in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
