A European Commission  task force 
began working with Greek authorities to identify the country’s
technical-assistance needs and to accelerate its absorption of
European Union structural funds.  The mission of about 30 officials, including national
experts, will prepare an initial report by the end of October,
commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told reporters in Brussels
today.  Horst Reichenbach, vice president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and head of the task force,
begins a three-day visit to Athens today, Bailly said.  “The commission does not intend to act as a tutor over
 Greece ,” Bailly said. “Rather we’re helping Greece to identify
the measures necessary to ensure its own financial viability,”
he said. “We’re not taking over from the country, we’re
contributing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
