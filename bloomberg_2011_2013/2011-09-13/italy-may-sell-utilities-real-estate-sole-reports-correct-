(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  Italy may sell municipal utilities
and real estate as part of a plan to dispose of state assets
valued at as much as 500 billion euros ($683 billion),  Il Sole
24 Ore  reported without saying where it got the information.  The government would keep stakes in energy company  Eni SpA (ENI) 
and utility  Enel SpA (ENEL) , the newspaper added. Government officials
are planning a meeting with domestic and foreign investors to
present the project, after Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti 
discussed the plan with Italian bankers in Milan yesterday, Sole
said. Tremonti said Aug. 13 at a press conference that the
government was considering possible asset sales, without
elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
