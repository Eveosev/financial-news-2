Standard & Poor’s  affirmed
Ukraine’s credit rating at B+, four levels below investment
grade, as double-digit inflation and the country’s exchange-rate
policy keeps the company from making an upgrade.  S&P lowered the long-term local-currency sovereign rating
to ‘B+’ from ‘BB-’ based on its recently revised sovereign
rating methodology, which puts more weight on the exchange rate
system, the agency said today in an e-mailed statement. S&P left
the outlook stable.  Ukraine’s central bank manages the hryvnia by buying and
selling foreign currency on market. It promised the
 International Monetary Fund , which approved a new $15.6 billion
loan program in July last year, to allow wider fluctuations in
the hryvnia, First Deputy Central Bank Governor Yuriy Kolobov
said last month. The hryvnia has lost 0.36 percent to the dollar
so far this year, Bloomberg data shows.  “Ukraine’s reliance on a managed  exchange rate , combined
with limited monetary flexibility, requires an equalization of
the local and foreign currency ratings,” S&P said.  Ukraine’s inflation rate eased to 8.9 percent in August
from 10.6 percent in July, according to the state statistics
office.  “We expect Ukraine will record current-account deficits of
between 2.5 percent and 3 percent of gross domestic product over
the next few years, with net foreign direct investment inflows
amounting to about 4 percent of GDP,” S&P said. Still, “high,
albeit improved, inflation could undermine competitiveness and
weaken investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
