Senegal ’s economy will expand 4
percent this year and 4.4 percent in 2012 as electricity
production improves and investments are made in infrastructure,
according to the country’s  Finance Ministry .  Growth “remains solid” even as the projections are “exposed
to major risks,” Pierre Ndiaye, director of the ministry’s
division for projections and economic studies, told reporters in
Dakar, the capital, today. He cited concern that a debt crisis
in  Europe  could weaken demand for Senegalese exports and cut
remittances from emigrants.  Senegal, which saw violent protests against frequent power
cuts in June, plans to raise 650 billion  CFA francs  ($1.35
billion) to end the crisis by 2014, le Soleil newspaper reported
in April, citing Karim Wade, the minister of energy. Power
plants with the capacity to produce as much as 1,288 megawatts
are being planned, the newspaper reported Aug. 23.  A $460 million airport may open next year in Dakar and
funds from the $540 million  Millennium Challenge Corp. , a U.S.
government aid program, will be spent on roads and farmland,
said Djibril Dione, head of macroeconomic projections at the
ministry.  The country needs faster growth, around 6 percent or 7
percent annually, said Valeria Fichera, the International
Monetary Fund’s resident representative. “Growth on the level of
4 percent is not what Senegal needs right now,” she told
reporters today, declining to give details.  Inflation for this year is forecast at 3.3 percent before
slowing to 2.7 percent in 2012, the ministry said in a statement
today. The country’s budget deficit will reach 6.9 percent of
gross domestic product this year before narrowing to 5.6 percent
in 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
