Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest miner of the precious metal, will complete a $550
million investment upgrade of its two  gold mines  in Peru by
2013, the company’s country manager Darrell Wagner said.  The plan will extend operations at the Alto Chicama and
Pierina mines by at least four years to 2021 and 2018,
respectively, Wagner said. Production will drop at both mines
this year as reserves deplete, he said.  The Toronto-based company is adding processing facilities
and water treatment plants to tap lower-grade ore which became
profitable after prices doubled over the past two years, Wagner
said. Alto Chicama will produce 740,000 ounces this year and
Pierina will produce 160,000 ounces, down from 850,000 ounces
and 200,000 ounces in 2010, respectively.  “The problem is, like most mines, ore grades are
falling,” Wagner told reporters today at a conference in the
city of Arequipa,  Peru . “The price of gold helps and
exploration has found some extra reserves at Pierina.”  Gold for December delivery gained $16.80, or 0.9 percent,
to $1,830.10 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . The precious
metal rose to a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  Barrick fell 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to C$52.75 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The stock gained 16 percent over
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
