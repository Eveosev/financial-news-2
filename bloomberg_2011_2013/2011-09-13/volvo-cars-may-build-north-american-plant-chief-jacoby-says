Volvo Car Corp., the Swedish
automaker owned by  China ’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., may
build a plant in  North America , Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Jacoby  said.  “One weakness of Volvo cars is the exposure to the  U.S.
dollar , so we are investigating increasing our sourcing in North
America” to balance currency movements, Jacoby told reporters
today at the International Motor Show in  Frankfurt . ”The utmost
solution would be to have a North American industrial footprint.
We haven’t made up our mind.”  Volvo, which makes cars in Sweden and Belgium and is
building a factory in China, is likely to decide this year to
build a second plant in China, in the city of Daqing, Jacoby
said.  Gothenburg, Sweden-based brand Volvo, which  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
sold last year to Zhejiang Geely for about $1.5 billion, aims to
more than double annual sales to 800,000 cars by 2020.  It plans
to invest $11 billion over the next five years to tap demand in
markets including China.  Volvo may build a North American plant alone or with a
partner, Jacoby said. The company is ”overall optimistic”
about the auto market, the German executive said. ”Right now we
have no indication of a decline in the market, but if it comes
we are more prepared than in 2008, with respect to our financial
strength and flexibility in our plants.”  Volvo, which employs about 20,000 people globally, has a
bigger share of temporary workers today than in 2008, allowing
it to respond faster to a potential slowdown, he said.  Volvo is likely to sell more than 400,000 cars this year,
and may reach 430,000, up from 373,525 last year, Jacoby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
