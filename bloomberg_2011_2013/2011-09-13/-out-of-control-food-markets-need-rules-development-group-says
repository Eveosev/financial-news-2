New rules are needed to limit the
influence of financial speculation and stabilize food markets
that are “out of control,” an anti-poverty campaign group
said.  Regulators in the U.S., the European Union and the Group of
20 should move trading of derivatives from over-the-counter
markets to regulated exchanges and introduce position reporting,
the London-based  World Development Movement  said in a report
today. Individual traders and speculators should also be limited
in the share of markets they can control, the group said.  “Effective regulation can tackle excessive financial
speculation and prevent it from driving food prices higher,”
the group said in a report titled “Broken Markets.”  Financial speculators control more than 60 percent of some
commodity markets, compared with 12 percent 15 years ago,
according to the report. Regulation might limit financial
speculation to a 25 percent share, the group said.  “This financial takeover of commodity markets has
effectively broken them, undermining their ability to fulfill
their basic intended functions,” it said.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has delayed
consideration of rules limiting speculation in oil, natural gas,
wheat and other commodities until Oct. 4, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said yesterday. The agency proposed
speculation limits in January as one of more than 40 rules
required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial-overhaul enacted
in July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
