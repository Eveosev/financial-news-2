Kenya ’s benchmark coffee price fell
4.8 percent at an auction today on lower bean quality and a drop
in global prices, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade declined to
$479.56 a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $503.91 a week ago,
the exchange said by e-mail. The grade sold for as much as $519
a bag, compared with $538 at the previous sale, while supplies
declined 41 percent to 400 bags, it said.  The average price for all coffee sold slipped to $349.56 a
bag from $350.52 at the previous auction.  “Prices dropped partly because the quality of the coffee
was lower than for last week,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at
Alanwood Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi. “Prices at  New York 
were lower and negatively affected prices at the exchange.”  Sales at the auction climbed 7.6 percent to 8,313 bags
valued at $3.5 million from 7,726 bags worth $3.3 million last
week as buyers replenished their stocks ahead of the close of
the 2010-11 season on Sept. 30, the agency said.  Supplies of beans at the auction fell 5 percent to 12,577
bags from 13,232 bags last week because of reduced stocks, the
agency said. Supplies in the market are lower than usual as the
nation draws closer to the end of the coffee year after a
drought cut yields, the exchange said.  Kenya’s coffee production in the 12 months through
September may decline to 40,000 metric tons from the previous
forecast of between 49,000 and 55,000 tons, James Wahome,
quality manager at the Coffee Board of Kenya, has predicted.
Output was 45,000 tons last season.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December and a secondary crop from April to June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
