Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi
said European policy makers should decide themselves whether
they need fiscal assistance from  Japan .  “Whether Japan and countries like the U.S. and  China 
should help out is something that  Europe  itself needs to
decide,” Azumi told a news conference in Tokyo today. “We want
to watch the active discussions in Europe.”  Chinese officials have held talks with their Italian
counterparts about potential investments in the euro area’s
third-largest economy, an Italian government official said. U.S.
shares and most Asian stocks rose after the new of possible
Chinese investment eased concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis would worsen.  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government rushed
through a 54 billion-euro ($74 billion) austerity package to
convince the  European Central Bank  to buy its debt. More than 60
billion euros of European bond purchases in the past five weeks
have done little to shore up Italian debt. Italy will seek to
raise as much as 7 billion euros in a bond sale today.  Azumi said he would ask  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa about the condition of European banks when Shirakawa
returns from a central bank meeting in Europe.  Separately, Azumi said it would be “one option” to use
the proceeds of a planned emissions tax for post-earthquake
reconstruction. The Mainichi newspaper reported earlier that the
government is considering the move, which may help it levy
smaller income and corporate taxes to fund rebuilding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
