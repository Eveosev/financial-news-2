Diageo Plc (DGE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Walsh  was paid less by the Smirnoff vodka maker last year
after getting a smaller amount from a long-term incentive plan.  Walsh received 4.41 million pounds ($6.96 million) in the
year ended June 30, the London-based distiller said in its
 annual report  published today. That included 1.23 million pounds
under a long-term incentive plan, down from 2.86 million pounds
a year earlier. The CEO also got 1.88 million pounds from an
annual incentive plan and a base salary of 1.17 million pounds.  Walsh and Chief Financial Officer Deirdre Mahlan each
received 160 percent of their salary in annual incentives after
Diageo beat targets for sales, earnings and  cash flow . Mahlan
was paid a total of 1.57 million pounds, including a base salary
of 431,000 pounds and 215,000 pounds of long-term incentives.  Diageo last month reported a 5 percent increase in full-
year organic operating profit as higher sales of whiskies such
as Johnnie Walker in emerging markets offset a slide in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
