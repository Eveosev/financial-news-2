China ’s money-market rate dropped
to a two-week low on speculation the central bank won’t seek to
tighten monetary policy after cash supply expanded at the
slowest pace in at least six years.  The broadest measure of money supply, M2, rose 13.5 percent
in August from a year earlier, the central bank said on Sept.
11. That was the slowest pace since at least January 2005, when
Bloomberg started compiling such data. Bills and repurchase
contracts worth 139 billion yuan ($21.7 billion) will mature
this week, compared with 176 billion yuan in the previous five-
day period, according to Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China
Merchants Bank Co.  “The central bank may not implement tightening measures as
 money-supply  growth slows,” Shenzhen-based Liu said. “The
maturing bills this week will also help ease a cash shortage.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 34 basis points to 3.29 percent as
of 10:51 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
3.27 percent, the least since Aug. 24.  Current liquidity levels are “appropriate,” the central
bank  said  in a statement yesterday. Growth in China’s money
supply probably exceeds what is captured by the M2 data because
of the availability of new financial instruments, the statement
said.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
