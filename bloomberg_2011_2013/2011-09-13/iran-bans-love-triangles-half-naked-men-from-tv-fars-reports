Iran ’s state television has been
banned from featuring scenes that show “half-naked” men and
“love triangles” that depict complicated love stories and are
“provocative,” state-run  Fars  news reported, citing a TV
management directive.  The “unnecessary mingling” of men and women in scenes
including weddings, family parties, work situations and
celebrations must also be “strictly avoided,” the report said,
citing the directive, which was sent by the TV organization’s
deputy head to programming directors.  Since the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy, women
in Iran have been required by the government to cover their hair
and bodies in line with Islamic values and men usually avoid
wearing shorts in public. The sexes are also separated in buses,
mosques and primary schools, as authorities deem mixing to be
“immoral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
