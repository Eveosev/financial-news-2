INA  Industrija Nafte d.d.’s
management and supervisory boards approved changes in internal
documents that regulate the refiner’s operational and decision-
making rules, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The approved changes are not linked to a request by the
market regulator that INA change its internal acts dealing with
dispersing privileged information, the company said in a
separate statement to Bloomberg.  The market regulator, or Hanfa, on July 29 extended  a
trading suspension of INA shares until the company complies with
the request.  The Croatian refiner is controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt.,
which owns 47.47 percent of INA. The government holds 44.84
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
