Accor SA (AC) , Europe’s largest hotel
company, said it would consider offers for its Motel 6 economy
brand in the U.S.  The hotelier would listen to expressions of interest in the
chain, which has about 1,100 Motel 6 and Studio 6 lodgings in
 North America , Chief Executive Officer  Denis Hennequin  said
today at an investor conference in Paris.  “The brand is strong, there is no fire sale on Motel 6,”
the CEO said.  A recovery for economy brands in the U.S. remains slow amid
high unemployment, Accor said in  July . Its goal “is to have no
investment in the mid-term in the U.S.,” Hennequin said.  The Evry, France-based company said today it plans to
“sharply accelerate” the transformation of Motel 6’s business
model, aiming to “significantly” reduce capital employed over
the medium term and improve margins.  Jim Amorosia was promoted to CEO of Motel 6 and Studio 6,
replacing Olivier Poirot who is leaving, Accor said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
