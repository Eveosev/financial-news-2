Morgan Stanley (MS)  reduced its year-end
forecast for the euro to $1.30, from $1.36, the firm said in a
research note today.  The New York-based bank estimated the shared currency will
trade at $1.25 by the end of the first quarter of 2012, compared
with a previous estimate of $1.38, citing economic-weakening
concern from European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet , the resignation of Juergen Stark from the central
bankâ€™s executive board and deteriorating fundamentals. The euro
will stabilize in the second half of next year, analysts led by
Gabriel de Kock, head of foreign-exchange strategy in New York,
wrote to clients.  Morgan Stanley was the 10th biggest currency trader by
market share in a survey published in May by Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc.  The 17-nation currency was little changed at $1.3678. It
fell toward its weakest level in a decade against the yen today,
trading at 105.19 yen. It touched 103.90 yesterday, the lowest
since June 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
