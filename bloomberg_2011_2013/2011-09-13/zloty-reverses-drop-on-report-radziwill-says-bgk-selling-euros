The zloty reversed its decline to
advance for the first time in four days after  Poland ’s Deputy
Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  was reported as saying by PAP
newswire that state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego is
“consistently” converting euros on the currency market.  The zloty gained 0.1 percent to 4.3328 per euro as of 1:47
p.m. in Warsaw after earlier depreciating as much as 0.7 percent
versus the European common currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
