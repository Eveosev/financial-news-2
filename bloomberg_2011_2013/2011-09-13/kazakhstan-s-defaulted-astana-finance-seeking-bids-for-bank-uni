AO Astana Finance, the smallest
Kazakh financial company to default in 2009, said it plans to
sell a 100 percent stake in its commercial bank.  Astana Finance invited buyers to submit bids for the
lender, the company said in a statement on its website late
yesterday. Askar Barlubaev, the company’s manager overseeing the
sale, declined to comment on the possible price, adding that
Astana Finance hasn’t hired banks to arrange the transaction.  Astana became the third Kazakh lender to default after it
stopped paying interest and principal in May on $175 million of
9 percent bonds maturing in 2011 as  Kazakhstan  slipped into its
first recession in a decade. The company has $1.7 billion of
debt outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Astana Finance’s creditors’ committee rejected its debt-
restructuring proposal last month for the second time, the
company said Aug. 23.  AO Bank Astana Finance’s loan portfolio reached 23 billion
tenge ($156 million) as of Aug. 1 and loan-loss provisions were
at 2.4 billion tenge, in accordance with international reporting
standards, the central bank’s financial oversight committee said
in a report on its website last month.  The lender, Kazakhstan’s 23rd largest, had equity capital
of 5.5 billion tenge as of Aug. 1, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
