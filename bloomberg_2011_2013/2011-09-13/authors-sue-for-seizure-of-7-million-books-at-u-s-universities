The Authors Guild , a U.S. advocacy
group, is leading a copyright infringement lawsuit seeking
seizure of 7 million books digitized by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and stored
at five colleges including the  University of Michigan .  The writers, including the Australian Society of Authors
and the Quebec Writers Union, sued yesterday in federal court in
New York claiming the universities obtained unauthorized scans
of the copyright-protected books. The University of Michigan
plans to release next month 27 works by French, Russian and
American authors that it deems “orphans” for free downloads to
about 250,000 students and faculty, according to the lawsuit.  “This is an upsetting and outrageous attempt to dismiss
authors rights,” Angelo Loukakis, executive director of the
Australian Society of Authors, said in a statement on the
guild’s  website .  The lawsuit comes after a U.S. judge gave Google and a
group of publishers and authors more time in July to try and
negotiate a settlement of a legal dispute over the search-engine
company’s digital reproduction of books. The Mountain View,
California-based company was sued in 2005 by authors and
publishers who said the company was infringing their copyrights
by digitizing books and allowing “snippets” of them online.  The case is The Authors Guild Inc. against  HathiTrust . File
No. 11-cv-6351. United States District Court for the Southern
District of  New York  (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
