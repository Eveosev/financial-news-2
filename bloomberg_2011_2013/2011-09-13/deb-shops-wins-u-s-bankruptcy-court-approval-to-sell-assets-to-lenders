Deb Shops Inc. , a bankrupt retailer
of clothing for teenage girls and young women, won court
approval to sell virtually all its assets to lenders in exchange
for $75 million in debt.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today approved the sale after Deb didn’t receive any competing
offers and canceled an Aug. 31 auction.  Ableco Finance LLC, as the agent for lenders, offered fair
and reasonable value for the assets, said Damon P. Meyer, a
company lawyer, at today’s hearing. Ableco owns most of the
$129.9 million in debt with a first priority of repayment.  Lee Equity Partners LLC, the New York-based private-equity
firm that bought Philadelphia-based Deb in 2007, is part of the
purchasing group, according to a June 26 statement. Lee will own
about 3 percent of the new equity, Meyer said.  The company listed debt of $270.1 million and assets of
$124.4 million as of April 30 in Chapter 11 documents filed June
26. The retailer, which traces its roots to 1932, has about 318
stores in 44 states, court papers show.  The main case is In re DSI Holdings Inc., 11-11941,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
