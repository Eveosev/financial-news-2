Egypt ’s former Vice President  Omar Suleiman  testified before the court trying ex-President  Hosni Mubarak  on charges he conspired to kill some of the protesters
who ended his rule, the state-run Nile News said.  Suleiman’s testimony was the first by current and former
officials ordered by the court to give evidence at the trial.
Many Egyptians hope their testimonies will shed light on
Mubarak’s actions during the uprising and what orders he may
have given for dealing with demonstrators. Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who heads the military council that took over
power from Mubarak in February, was due in court on Sept. 11
before his appearance was postponed.  Mubarak’s trial began on Aug. 3 after pressure from
demonstrators demanding a swift and public prosecution of the
man they blamed for corruption, political repression and police
abuses. At least 846 people were killed during the revolt. He
has pleaded not guilty.  After five days of protests demanding Mubarak’s ouster, the
former president appointed Suleiman, who was the head of the
country’s intelligence service, as his vice president on Jan.
29. Mubarak hadn’t had a vice president since he came to power
in 1981.  Other officials summoned to appear in the court are Chief
of Staff Sami Annan, Interior Minister Mansour El-Essawy and
former Interior Minister Mahmoud Wagdy. Chief Judge Ahmed Refaat
ordered the sessions in which the officials appear to be closed
and imposed a gag order on the men.  To contact the reporter on this story:
