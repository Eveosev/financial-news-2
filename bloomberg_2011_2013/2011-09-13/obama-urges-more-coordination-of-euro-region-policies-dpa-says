Euro-area countries need to better
coordinate their fiscal and economic policies to overcome the
crises facing the region, President  Barack Obama  said in an
interview with European media.  “It’s difficult to coordinate when you have that many
countries with different politics and different economic
situations trying to agree on a common course,” he said,
according to German news agency  Deutsche Presse-Agentur . “And
so we will continue to see weaknesses, I think, in the world
economy so long as this issue does not get resolved.”  The U.S. is working with European countries and through
global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund,
Obama said, adding that the euro-region crisis will be a major
issue at the November meeting of Group of 20 governments.  Greece has “taken some steps to slow the crisis but not
solve the crisis,” Obama said, according to DPA. “The bigger
problem is what happens in Spain and  Italy , if the markets keep
on making a run at those very big countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
