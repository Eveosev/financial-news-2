The  Bank of Korea  said it will
recruit a new head to manage its foreign-exchange reserves this
year in a bid to invest the record funds more effectively.  The three-year contract position will be open to both
central bank officials and outsiders and the compensation will
be similar to that of a deputy governor, the Bank of Korea said
in a statement today.  South Korea ’s foreign-exchange reserves climbed to a record
of $312 billion at the end of August. The Bank of Korea bought
gold for the first time in more than a decade between June and
July, saying that diversifying its reserves by holding the metal
will help “reduce investment risks.”  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo expanded in February
the reserve-management team, which is now headed by central bank
official Hong Taeg Ki.  The position is open only to Koreans, and the qualification
is work experience of a decade or more in finance or investment,
the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
