The increase in European coffee
stockpiles has stopped, partly because the marketing season in
most countries is coming to an end, according to the European
Coffee Federation.  Bean stockpiles at European ports climbed 35 percent to
13.66 million bags from Dec. 31 to July 31, data from the
federation showed. The coffee season in most countries usually
runs from October to September.  Inventories in Antwerp fell in July, Roel Vaessen,
secretary general of the federation, said in an interview at a
conference in the Belgian city today. Stock increases may also
be halting because roasters tend to buy supplies before the last
quarter, when consumption traditionally rises, he added.  European coffee demand will be stable in 2011, with
consumers shifting to drinking at home rather than elsewhere, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
