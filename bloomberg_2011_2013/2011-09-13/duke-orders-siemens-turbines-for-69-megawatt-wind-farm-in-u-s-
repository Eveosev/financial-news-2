  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  said it would
build a 69-megawatt wind farm in north-central Pennsylvania and
sell electricity from the plant to Delaware Municipal Electric
Corp. under a 25-year agreement.  The Laurel Hill Windpower Project in Lycoming County will
have 30  Siemens AG (SIE)  turbines, each capable of generating 2.3
megawatts, according to a statement released on PR Newswire
today. Duke started work on the project in August and plans
commercial operation in September 2012.  It’s Duke’s second windfarm in Pennsylvania after the  70-
MW North Allegheny Windpower Project in Blair and Cambria
counties, 95 miles east of Pittsburgh.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
