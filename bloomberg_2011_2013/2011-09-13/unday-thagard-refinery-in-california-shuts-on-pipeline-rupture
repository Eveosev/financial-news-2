Lunday-Thagard Co. shut a 10,000-
barrel-a-day oil refinery in Southern  California  after a
pipeline associated with the crude unit ruptured, injuring a
worker, according to a  filing  with state regulators.  The pipeline released one barrel of asphalt at the plant in
South Gate, California, at about 2:30 p.m. local time, according
to the company’s notice to the California Emergency Management
Agency. An employee burned by hot asphalt was treated at the
plant and taken to a local trauma center, Quvondo Johnson, an
inspector for the  Los Angeles  County Fire Department, said in a
telephone interview.  The South Gate-based company shut the refinery, south of
Los Angeles, and evacuated 20 workers, the filing showed. Peter
Stockhausen, Lunday-Thagard’s vice president of refining, didn’t
immediately return a telephone request for comment.  The refinery produces distillate feedstocks that are sold
to other refineries in California to be upgraded into gasoline
and diesel, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
