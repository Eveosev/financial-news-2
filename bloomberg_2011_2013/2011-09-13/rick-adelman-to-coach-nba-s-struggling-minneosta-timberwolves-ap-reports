Rick Adelman, who ranks eighth in
National Basketball Association history with 945 coaching wins,
will seek to turn around a Minnesota Timberwolves team that’s
gone 32-132 the past two seasons, the  Associated Press  said.  Adelman, 65, has agreed to contract terms to replace Kurt Rambis, AP reported, citing two unidentified people with
knowledge of the agreement.  Adelman left the  Houston Rockets  in April, ending a four-
year tenure during which he had the best winning percentage in
franchise history. Adelman has a career  945-616  coaching record
in 20 seasons with the Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers,
 Sacramento Kings  and  Golden State Warriors .  He’s had a losing record twice in 18 full seasons and led
the Trail Blazers to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. Adelman
now takes over a Minnesota franchise that had a league-worst 17-
65 record last season after going 15-67 the previous year.  The Timberwolves have All-Star forward Kevin Love, along
with No. 2 overall draft pick Derrick Williams and Spanish point
guard Ricky Rubio, who will make his NBA debut this season after
being taken with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft.  Minnesota has had six straight losing seasons and last made
the playoffs during the 2003-04 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
