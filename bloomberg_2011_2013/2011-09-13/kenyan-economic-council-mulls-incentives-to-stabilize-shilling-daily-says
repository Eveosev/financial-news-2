Kenyaâ€™s National Economic and
Social Council is considering incentives to attract more
remittances to the country to help stabilize the shilling, the
Business Daily reported, citing Secretary Julius Muia.  Reducing the cost for Kenyans living abroad to send money
home would help offset a decline in foreign-currency earnings
from agricultural exports, which have fallen because of a
drought, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  About 2.5 million Kenyans sent an average of 6.2 billion
shillings ($65 million) home monthly in the seven months through
July, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
