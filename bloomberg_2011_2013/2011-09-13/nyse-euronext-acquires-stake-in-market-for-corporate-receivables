NYSE Euronext (NYX)  acquired a minority
stake in the Receivables Exchange as part of a plan to increase
its role helping companies get short-term funding.  The purchase, disclosed in a statement today, gives NYSE
Euronext access to the $17 trillion market for accounts
receivable, or bills to customers. The New Orleans-based firm
operates an online market where companies can sell debts and
other obligations owed by customers. NYSE Euronext, the New
York-based exchange operator that Frankfurt-based  Deutsche
Boerse AG (DB1)  has agreed to buy, didn’t say how much of the
privately held company it bought or what it paid.  Paul DeDomenico, a former executive at the lending unit of
General Electric Co., will lead the corporate receivables
program, the statement said.  Shares of NYSE Euronext rose 0.7 percent to $25.30 at 9:34
a.m. in  New York . Before today, the stock had lost 16 percent
this year.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse agreed to buy NYSE Euronext
on Feb. 15 to create the world’s largest exchange operator. The
merger is awaiting regulatory approvals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
