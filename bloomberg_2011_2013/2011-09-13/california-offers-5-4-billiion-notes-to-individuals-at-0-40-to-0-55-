California began taking orders from
individual investors for $5.4 billion of notes due June 2012,
offering yields of as much as 0.55 percent as one-year tax-
exempt rates lingered near the lowest in more than a decade.  The revenue-anticipation notes, meant to bolster  cash flow 
until more tax collections arrive, offer yields ranging from
0.40 percent to 0.55 percent, Dana Obrist, spokeswoman for
senior manager  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , said in an e-mail.  California’s individual pricing range is 18 basis points to
33 basis points above today’s 0.22 percent yield on AAA one-year
tax-exempt debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-year tax-exempt yields declined to 0.30 percent last
week, according to a Bond Buyer index. That’s down from 0.44
percent a year earlier and 3.97 percent at the end of 1999.  Revenue anticipation notes are a type of short-term
municipal bond that the state offers when cash is low and repays
from later tax collections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
