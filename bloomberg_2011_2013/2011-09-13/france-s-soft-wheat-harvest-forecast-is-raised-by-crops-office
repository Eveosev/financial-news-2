France ’s soft-wheat harvest will
fall less than previously expected after rain aided recovery
from a spring drought, crops office FranceAgriMer forecast.  Farmers will reap 33.4 million metric tons of the grain
this year, against 35.7 million tons in 2010, the office said in
a report handed out today at a meeting in Montreuil-sous-Bois,
outside Paris. The forecast was raised from 32 million tons in
July.  Milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris has slumped 26
percent from the May 9 high on reduced concern about drought
damage to the French crop, the biggest in the European Union.
Prices also retreated as Russia allowed a ban on grain exports
imposed last year amid a drought to expire July 1 as scheduled.  French soft-wheat exports in the year through June 2012 are
forecast to fall to 14.5 million tons, the crops office said.
Shipments outside the EU are expected to slide to 8 million
tons.  France leapfrogged  Russia  last year to become the world’s
second-largest wheat exporter behind the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
