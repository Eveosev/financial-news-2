The  International Energy Agency  cut
global oil demand forecasts for this year and next as the
economic recovery falters.  The Paris-based adviser reduced its estimate for 2012
consumption by 400,000 barrels a day, and for 2011 by 200,000 a
day. Worldwide demand will rise by 1.2 percent to 89.3 million
barrels a day this year and by 1.6 percent to 90.7 million next
year. The full resumption of Libyan exports following the ouster
of  Muammar Qaddafi  will be “long and difficult,” it said.  “Global oil demand continues to expand at only a tepid
pace,” the IEA said today in its monthly Oil Market Report.
“There are certainly growing concerns about the health of the
global economy.”  Brent crude futures have dropped 11 percent from a 2011
peak of $127.02 a barrel reached in April, as  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis spreads and global manufacturing slows. Brent fell
below $112 today after the release of the report. Worldwide
gross domestic product will expand by 4.2 percent next year,
less than the 4.4 percent previously expected, the agency said.  “The IEA is more bearish than before, but I’m a little
more pessimistic,” said  Christophe Barret , a London-based
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB whose prediction for 2011 demand
growth is 200,000 barrels a day less than the agency’s forecast.
“The demand side will be weak. The impact of prices on growth
is starting to show with the slowdown in economic activity.”  ‘Call on OPEC’  Supplies from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries may be sufficient to meet demand over the next three
quarters without the need for more production increases, the IEA
said. The estimated demand for OPEC crude, or “call on OPEC,”
will average 30.5 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter,
close to the group’s production rate in August of 30.26 million
a day, according to IEA estimates.  “That suggests that the recent spell of market tightening
could moderate in the short-term, assuming that recent supply
disruptions also recede,” the agency said.  OPEC’s 12 members collectively bolstered production by
165,000 barrels a day last month, led by increases in  Saudi
Arabia  and  Nigeria . That still left OPEC crude supply below the
estimated level of demand for that oil this quarter, estimated
at 31.3 million barrels a day, the report showed.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global oil production,
also trimmed demand estimates in its monthly report yesterday.  Slower Resumption  The IEA predicted a slower resumption of output in  Libya 
than the producer group. The North African nation will likely
restore output to 350,000 to 400,000 barrels a day by the end of
this year, from zero last month, according to the IEA. OPEC
forecast that Libya can reach 1 million barrels a day within six
months and full capacity within 18 months.  The agency lowered its forecasts for oil supplies from
outside OPEC, by 200,000 barrels a day this year because of
field maintenance in the North Sea and  Kazakhstan , and by
150,000 a day in 2012 amid weaker-than-expected output of
natural gas liquids. Non-OPEC producers will boost shipments by
0.4 percent to 52.8 million barrels a day this year, and by 1.9
percent to 53.8 million a day in 2012.  Lower production caused oil stockpiles in developed nations
to fall below their five-year average for the first time since
2008, according to the report. Inventories held by companies
were at 2.687 billion barrels in July, or 58.4 days worth of
consumption, after increasing 10.8 million barrels that month,
less than half the typical increase for the time of year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
