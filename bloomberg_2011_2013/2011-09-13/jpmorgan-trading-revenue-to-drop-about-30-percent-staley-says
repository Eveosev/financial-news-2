JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said trading
revenue will drop about 30 percent this quarter from the prior
three months as the economy weakened and volume declined.  Corporations pulled back from the market, particularly in
August, James Staley chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s
investment bank, said today at a Barclays financial-services
conference in  New York . Debt and equity sales were down across
the board as were mergers and acquisitions, Staley said.  The company earned $5.5 billion in equity and fixed-income
trading during the second quarter. Third-quarter fees from
 investment banking  will fall by about half, Staley said,
projecting about $1 billion in total fees compared with $1.92
billion in the second quarter.  JPMorgan will report a “modest loss” in its private-
equity unit of about $100 million, Staley said.  The bank’s exposure to  Portugal , Ireland, Italy,  Greece  and
Spain is about $14 billion, a figure that includes loans and
derivatives contracts and is mostly a mix of sovereign and bank
debt, Staley said.  “The issue really is if there is an uncontrolled default
in Europe, to define the contagion of that is very difficult,”
he said. “What we learned in 2008 is that we are
interconnected. I don’t think any of us have been able to figure
out what the ultimate impact would be of a default in Greece.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
