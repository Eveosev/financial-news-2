Mytrah Energy Ltd., the Indian
wind-farm developer formerly known as Caparo Energy Ltd., is in
talks to raise $189.3 million to fund orders it placed with
 Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)   The company, which announced an agreement in January to buy
1 gigawatt of turbines from Suzlon, is in “advanced” talks
with an Indian lender to obtain senior debt for 261.2 megawatts
of purchase orders, it said today in an earnings statement.  Mytrah has placed orders with Suzlon,  India ’s largest wind-
turbine maker, for a total of 362 megawatts, according to the
statement. It may sign a contract for a further 138 megawatts by
the end of the month, Gus Hochschild, a London-based analyst at
Mirabaud Securities LLP, said in an e-mail to clients today.  The company, which changed its name on Sept. 7, agreed in
May to buy 2 gigawatts of turbines from  Spain ’s Gamesa Corp.
Technologica SA, India’s largest order to date. The Hyderabad-
based company expects to have 500 megawatts of wind-power
capacity running by March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
