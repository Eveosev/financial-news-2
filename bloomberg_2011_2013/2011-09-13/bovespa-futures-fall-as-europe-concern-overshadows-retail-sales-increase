The Bovespa stock index fell for a
third day as prospects for further interest-rate cuts diminished
after  Brazil ’s retail sales rose more than analysts forecast.  Lojas Renner SA and BR Malls Participacoes SA led declines
for companies that depend on domestic demand as traders drove up
yields on interest-rate futures. Itau Unibanco Holding SA led a
slump for banks. Losses were partially offset as B2W Cia. Global
do Varejo, a Brazilian online retailer, soared after its parent
decided to sell bonds, while OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA
followed crude higher.  The Bovespa declined 0.3 percent to 55,543.97 at the 4:15
p.m.  New York  time close. Forty-three stocks dropped on the
index while 22 rose. The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7118 per
dollar.  “Retailers and banks have been suffering because the
inflation question is getting worse,” said Marcello Paixao, a
 money manager  at Sao Paulo-based hedge fund Principia Asset
Management. “It’s hard to know what to expect from the central
bank as it isn’t managing to indicate clearly to the market what
it’s doing.”  Brazil’s retail sales rose 1.4 percent in July from the
previous month, the national statistics agency said today.
That’s the largest increase this year and compares to a median
projection for a 1 percent increase among 32 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The yield on the interest-rate futures due in January 2013
jumped 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 10.73
percent.  Shopping Malls  Lojas Renner SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded clothing
retailer, sank 6 percent to 56.87 reais while BR Malls, Brazil’s
biggest owner of shopping malls, dropped 4.6 percent to 19.41
reais. Itau,  Latin America ’s biggest bank by market value,
dropped 1 percent to 28.02 reais.  B2W jumped 9.6 percent to 17.72 reais. Parent Lojas
Americanas SA advanced 3.6 percent to 16.15 reais after deciding
to issue as much as 500 million reais ($292 million) of local
bonds maturing in seven years.  “Investors are expecting that either Lojas Americanas will
use part of the proceeds from the bond sale to inject more money
in B2W, or B2W itself will follow suit and go to the market to
raise some money,” Julia Monteiro, an analyst at Ativa
Corretora, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro .
“Most of B2W sales are on credit, so they have high financing
needs. It’d be better if they can get longer-term loans.”  Crude Climbs  OGX, controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , gained 1.5
percent to 11.03 reais after crude rose above $90 a barrel in
New York.  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  on July 27 after plunging
20 percent from its bull-market peak in November. The measure
extended that drop to 24 percent through yesterday and trades at
9.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 11.5 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 5.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.2 for
 India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 5.34 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a
daily average this year of 6.55 billion reais through Sept. 6,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
