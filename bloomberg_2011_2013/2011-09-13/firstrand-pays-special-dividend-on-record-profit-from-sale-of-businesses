FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial services company, said it will pay a
special dividend of 70 cents per share after full-year profit
more than doubled following asset sales.  Net income rose to 20.1 billion rand ($2.7 billion) in the
12 months through June, from 9.44 billion rand a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based firm said in a statement today. Earnings
per share excluding one-time items were 1.79 rand, in line with
the median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  FirstRand’s first special dividend since its foundation in
1998 came after the company sold its stake in Outsurance
Holdings Ltd. for more than 4 billion rand and spun off its
Momentum Group Ltd. insurance business. Earnings were also
boosted by a “significant decrease” in bad debts at its retail
bank, the company said.  FirstRand has gained 2.8 percent in Johannesburg trading
this year, compared with a 37 percent slump in the 46-company
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
