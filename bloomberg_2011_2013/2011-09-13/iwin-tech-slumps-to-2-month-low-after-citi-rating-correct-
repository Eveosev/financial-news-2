(Corrects magnitude of decline in headline.)  Hiwin Technologies Corp. (2049)  slumped to
the lowest in more than two months after the ball-bearing maker
was rated “hold” in new coverage at Citigroup Inc., which said
the recent demand slowdown from machine tool makers is likely to
impact Hiwin in the first three months of next year.  The stock sank 6.6 percent to NT$271 as of 1:25 p.m. local
time, set for the lowest close since June 30. The surge in the
stock price in the past year “limits the head-room for further
appreciation,” the brokerage also said. The stock has jumped
268 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
