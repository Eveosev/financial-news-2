The European Union threatened to
renew a tariff on chamois leather from  China  for another five
years to curb import competition for U.K. producers.  The EU said it would review whether to let lapse the 58.9
percent duty on the soft leather, which is used to dry cars and
windows.  The bloc imposed the levy in 2006 to punish Chinese
exporters of chamois leather for selling it in  Europe  below
cost, a practice known as  dumping . The goal was to protect EU
producers such as U.K.-based Hutchings & Harding Ltd. from less
expensive imports.  The review will determine whether the expiry of the levy
“would be likely, or unlikely, to lead to a continuation of
dumping and injury,” the European Commission, the 27-nation
EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said today in the  Official
Journal . The duty was due to expire this week and will now stay
in place during the probe, which can last as long as 15 months.  The inquiry results from a June 14 request by the U.K.
Leather Federation, which represents more than half of EU
production of chamois leather, according to the commission. When
imposing the anti-dumping duty five years ago, the EU said
Chinese exporters tripled their share of the European market to
30 percent in the 12 months to end-March 2005 compared with
2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
