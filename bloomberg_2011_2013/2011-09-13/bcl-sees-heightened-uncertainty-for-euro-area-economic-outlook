Luxembourg’s central bank said the
euro-area economic outlook has worsened and inflation risks are
balanced.  The outlook is subject to “especially heightened
uncertainty” and “risks on the outlook for the evolution of
prices in the medium term remain globally balanced,” the BCL
wrote in its quarterly bulletin, echoing remarks by European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  on Sept. 8.  Europe’s recovery is running out of steam as the sovereign
debt crisis roils markets and erodes confidence. Investors are
betting the ECB will have to cut interest rates after two
increases this year. The central bank’s chief economist,  Juergen Stark , resigned on Sept. 9 in protest over ECB bond purchases,
which he says blur the line between monetary and fiscal policy.  “ Monetary policy  is accommodative even as certain
financing conditions have become more restrictive,” the BCL
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
