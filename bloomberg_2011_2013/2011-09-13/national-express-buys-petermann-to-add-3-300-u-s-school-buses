National Express Group Plc (NEX)  said it
bought Cincinnati-based Petermann Partners Inc., the fifth-
largest U.S. school bus operator, for $200 million to swell its
North American fleet by 3,300 vehicles or 20 percent.  The purchase from Macquarie Global Opportunities Partners
LP and Petermann’s management adds a company that generated an
operating profit of $13.5 million on sales of $150 million in
the year to June 30, London-based  National Express  said today.  Britain’s biggest long-distance bus operator is seeking to
boost profit through bolt-on deals after being stripped of the
East Coast rail route by the U.K. government in 2009 and failing
to make the shortlist to keep the Greater Anglia franchise,
reducing it to a single service, C2C, which expires in 2013.  “This deal is a clear first step to address the loss of
rail income and hence is positive for the group’s investment
case,” Geoff Van Klaveren, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in
 London , said in a note to clients. “The price is a touch rich,
but this should be outweighed by the positive sentiment.”  National Express rose as much as 2.7 percent and was
trading 1.9 percent higher at 225.4 pence as of 9:21 a.m. in
London. The stock has declined 10 percent this year, reducing
the company’s market value to 1.1 billion pounds.  The purchase of Petermann, which was founded 12 years ago
and has operations across 10 states in the U.S. Midwest, West
and Southwest, was funded with cash and existing credit
facilities, National Express said in its statement.  Outsourcing Trend  The company’s North American student transport business
competes with operators including U.K. rivals  FirstGroup Plc (FGP) ,
which became the No. 1 U.S. school bus operator with the $3.6
billion purchase of Laidlaw International Inc. in 2007, and Go-
Ahead Group Plc, which entered the market last year.  While regarded as a national icon, America’s 400,000 yellow
buses are a drain on cash-strapped school boards, prompting some
districts to outsource operations.  National Express, which fended off three takeover attempts
in 2009, rose 7 percent Aug. 31 after UBS AG identified it as a
top bid pick because of a 24 percent discount to peers and deal-
friendly investors in the Cosmen family and Elliott Advisors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
