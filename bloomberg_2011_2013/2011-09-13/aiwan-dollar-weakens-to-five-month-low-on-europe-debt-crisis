Taiwan ’s dollar dropped by the most
since April 2009 as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis curbed demand
for higher-yielding emerging-market assets. Bonds rallied as
investors sought the perceived safety of sovereign debt.  The local dollar fell to a five-month low after global
funds sold $508 million more Taiwanese shares than they bought
today, taking net sales for the year to $9.2 billion, according
to exchange data. The chance of a default by  Greece  in the next
five years has soared to 98 percent, credit-default swaps show,
after Prime Minister  George Papandreou  failed to reassure
investors that his country can survive the euro-region crisis.  “Europe’s debt crisis continues to damp sentiment,” said
 Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin
Kong Commercial Bank. “Looks like the depreciation trend will
continue.”  Taiwan’s dollar slumped 0.9 percent to NT$29.487 from Sept.
9 versus its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. That’s the weakest level since
March 31. Financial markets were closed for a public holiday
yesterday. Lin forecast the currency could drop to NT$29.50 this
week.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due September 2021 fell
one basis point to 1.28 percent, the lowest rate for a benchmark
10-year security since November, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show.  Exports rose 7.2 percent in August from a year earlier, the
least since they last declined in October 2009, the Ministry of
Finance reported on Sept. 8. Economists expected a 15.5 percent
increase, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.393 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
