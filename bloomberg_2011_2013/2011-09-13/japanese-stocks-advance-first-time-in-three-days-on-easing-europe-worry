Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
rebounded from a two-and-a-half-year low after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the region has enough
“weaponry” to keep its debt crisis from spreading.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender
by market value, advanced 2.5 percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the world’s
biggest maker of machine-tool controls, gained 2.3 percent,
recovering part of a 15 percent loss last week.  Elpida Memory
Inc. (6665)  led chip-related companies higher on signs semiconductor
prices have bottomed.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1 percent to 8,616.55 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, rebounding from the lowest level since April
2009 yesterday. The broader Topix gained 1.2 percent to 749.82
afterTrichet signaled support for the banking system, saying:
“We have the weaponry to provide what is necessary.”  “Trichet said the right thing,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84 billion. “Still, even
if his comments helped to prevent contagion,  Europe  has a debt
problem, beginning with  Greece , that can’t be solved until the
economy heals.”  The Topix has fallen 17 percent this year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  Italy, China Talk  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounded 0.7 percent
yesterday, reversing losses in the last 90 minutes of trading,
after the Financial Times reported Italy aims to sell a
“significant” amount of bonds and stakes in strategic
companies to  China . Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.3 percent
today.  While Italian officials have had talks with Chinese
counterparts about potential investment in the euro region’s
third-largest economy, the purchase of Italian bonds by China
was not the focus of the discussion, an Italian official said on
condition of anonymity.  The yen depreciated to as low as 105.64 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 104.35 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday, after Trichet’s comments. A weaker yen boosts
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  ‘Short-Term Positive’  “The fact that the yen stopped gaining against the euro is
a short-term positive,” said Mitsubishi UFJ Asset’s Ishigane.  Japanese banks gained on speculation the ECB will prevent
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis from spreading to the financial
sector. Mitsubishi UFJ advanced 2.5 percent to 331 yen. Smaller
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. climbed 1.2 percent to
2,105 yen.  Fanuc and electronics-parts maker  Kyocera Corp. (6971)  contributed
the most to gains in the Nikkei, rebounding from losses last
week. Fanuc climbed 2.3 percent to 10,610 yen. Kyocera, which
depends on Europe for almost 20 percent of its sales, jumped 3.4
percent to 6,740 yen.  Chip-related companies advanced after the Philadelphia
Semiconductor Index, which tracks the performance of 30 industry
stocks, yesterday rallied 3 percent to the highest since Aug. 15.  Elpida, the world’s third-largest maker of computer-memory
chips, soared 13 percent to 557 yen. Advantest Corp., the
biggest producer of chip testers, advanced 4.8 percent to 896
yen. Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., a maker of chip-
manufacturing equipment, climbed 4.8 percent to 462 yen.  Among decliners, Nintendo Co. sank 5.1 percent to 12,320
yen after analysts said the company will probably sell fewer 3-D
handheld game players than it’s targeting because price cuts and
new accessories will fail to make up for a lack of hit titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
