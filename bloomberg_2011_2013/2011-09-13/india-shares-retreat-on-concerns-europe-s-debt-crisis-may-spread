Indian equities reversed advances,
dragging the benchmark index lower for a third day, as European

crisis is hurting interbank lending.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the nation’s biggest truck-maker, lost
4.7 percent, set for its biggest two-day decline in more than a
month. European stocks dropped, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
extending a two-year low. U.S. futures slid, while Asian shares
pared an early advance. Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India’s largest
state-run oil explorer, retreated 1.2 percent.  The BSE India Sensitive Index dropped 37.66, or 0.2
percent, to 16,464.08, according to preliminary closing prices
as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, after gaining 1.6 percent intraday.  Asian equities pared most of their early gains. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index added 0.1 percent to 118.05 after rising as
much as 0.6 percent earlier. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange of  India  slid 0.1 percent to 4,940.95.
