Britain’s statistics watchdog urged
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to stop allowing
ministers and government officials access to information before
it is made public.  Statistics Authority Chairman Michael Scholar said in a
letter to Osborne that the current system is “highly damaging”
to public trust and gives the impression that data are
manipulated by ministers. It is also inconsistent with
international practice, he said.  “I very much hope that, on reflection, you and your
colleagues will reconsider your position on this important
matter,” Scholar said in the letter published on the watchdog’s
 website  today.  The move follows the “unauthorized” release of inflation
data to 400 people on May 16 when it should have gone to 50
individuals. Osborne says early access is needed to allow
ministers time to prepare a prompt response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
