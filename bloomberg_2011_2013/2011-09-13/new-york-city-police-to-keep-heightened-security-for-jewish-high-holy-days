New York  City police will keep
security that was tightened for the Sept. 11 anniversary at that
level for the Jewish High Holy Days.  Officers this month will increase patrols near Jewish
institutions and continue checks at transit points, such as rail
and subway stations, Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a
headquarters news conference.  “We know of no specific plots against Jewish institutions,
but we will take steps to protect neighborhoods and
synagogues,” Kelly said. Police will continue to check bags on
subways, and scrutinize vehicles using tunnels and bridges.  Rosh Hashana begins after sundown Sept. 28. Observances of
the Jewish new year last through the end of Yom Kippur on Oct.
8.  Authorities in New York and  New Jersey  last week increased
security after uncorroborated reports of a credible terrorist
plan to harm people.  There is “no finality to the threat,” Kelly said. ‘We
don’t know what was set in motion.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
