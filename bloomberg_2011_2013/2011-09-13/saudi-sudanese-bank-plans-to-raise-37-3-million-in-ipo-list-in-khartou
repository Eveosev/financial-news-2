Saudi Sudanese Bank , a Khartoum-
based lender, said it planned to raise 100 million Sudanese
pounds ($37.3 million) in an initial public offering.  The sale of 800 million shares will open on Oct. 4 and
close on Nov. 3, the Khartoum-based lender said in a statement
published in the  al-Intibaha  newspaper today. The stock will
trade on the Khartoum Stock Exchange, it said, without providing
further details.  Saudi Sudanese would rank as the 18th biggest of 21 banks
currently listed on the exchange in terms of market
capitalization, Magdy Mohamed al-Hassan, research director at
the bourse, said in a phone interview today.  The Khartoum bourse has 56 listed companies with a total
market value of 7.1 billion Sudanese pounds, he said. The last
public offering of shares in  Sudan  was by al-Jazeera Sudanese
Jordanian Bank in June to fund its expansion, al-Hassan said.  The Khartoum Stock Exchange holds trading sessions from 10
a.m. to 11 a.m. Sunday through Thursday.  Saudi Sudanese’s public relations department didn’t answer
the phone when Bloomberg called seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
