Video-game analyst Atul Bagga left
ThinkEquity LLC for Lazard Capital Markets, where he will be
covering U.S. game makers and Chinese Internet companies.  Bagga, 40, spent more than five years at San Francisco-
based ThinkEquity and joined Lazard to gain a larger audience,
he said in an interview today. His last day was Sept. 9 and the
firm is searching for a replacement, said Janet Faleski, a
spokeswoman for ThinkEquity.  “I enjoyed my time with ThinkEquity, but it was time for
me to move,” Bagga said. “This is a chance to join a much
bigger platform.”  Bagga, who is staying in San Francisco, covers video-game
companies including  Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS)  and  Activision Blizzard
Inc. (ATVI)  and Chinese Web companies such as  NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc. and
Changyou.com Ltd. He said he will be spending more time with the
Chinese companies in his new role. Bagga also covers Zynga Inc.,
the biggest maker of games on Facebook Inc., and other social-
game companies. Zynga said in July it would seek to raise $1
billion in an initial public offering.  Prior to joining ThinkEquity, Bagga spent almost five years
as director of corporate development at software maker Ideate
Inc., according to his profile on LinkedIn Corp. He studied at
the  Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology  in  India  and
earned a master’s degree in business administration at the
University of Mumbai, his profile says.  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the biggest non-bank merger adviser, is the
parent of Lazard Capital Markets. The Hamilton, Bermuda-based
company fell 26 cents to $24.22 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
