Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
was little changed as sellers were said to raise offer prices
amid signs that demand for crude may rise because of winter fuel
needs.  Qatar Marine was at a premium of 11 cents a barrel over its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Murban from Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Co. was at a premium of 13
cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Sellers were offering cargoes of the grade at a premium of
50 cents a barrel to the official price, said three traders of
the region’s oil, who declined to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak with the media.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose $1.62, or 1.6
percent, to $106.36 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November climbed 1.6 percent to $105.98. Murban
rose 1.5 percent to $110.14.  Dubai for November was at a premium of $1.32 a barrel above
supplies loading in January, a market structure known as
backwardation, which suggests demand for oil is higher for
prompt cargoes. That’s up from $1.23 yesterday.  Oman futures for November delivery rose 49 cents to $107.29
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:32 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,451 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.29 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The October Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 21 cents to $6.49 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates, a broker. The exchange for swaps for November
rose 5 cents to $4.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
