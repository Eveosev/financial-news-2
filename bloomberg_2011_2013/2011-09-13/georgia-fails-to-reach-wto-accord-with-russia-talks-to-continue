Georgia  failed to reach an
agreement with  Russia  on its entry into the World Trade
Organization during talks yesterday in Geneva, Foreign Minister
Grigol Vashadze said.  Talks ended with “no result” and will be continued,
Vashadze told reporters today in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.
Russia hasn’t accepted the “concrete demands and compromises”
offered by Georgia, Vashadze said, declining to disclose further
details of the negotiations.  Switzerland has mediated between Georgia and Russia, which
fought a five-day war in 2008, in their WTO negotiations.
Russia, the largest economy outside the world trade arbiter, has
been trying to join the organization since 1993, surpassing the
15 years  China  had to wait before becoming a member. While the
U.S. and the European Union back Russian membership, its
southern neighbor Georgia has blocked its accession.  Maxim Medvedkov, Russia’s chief negotiator for membership
in the WTO, declined to comment on yesterday’s talks, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the three countries. Only the
Swiss Foreign Ministry, as a representative of the organizers,
will comment on the results, Medvedkov said in a telephone
interview today.  Georgia, a WTO member that can block Russia’s membership,
objects to customs checkpoints in the breakaway regions of  South
Ossetia  and Abkhazia. Georgia insists its opposition isn’t
related to Russia’s five-year-old trade embargo against the
Black Sea country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
