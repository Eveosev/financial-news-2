The quality of Ukraine’s wheat
harvest declined this year, producing 40 percent to 45 percent
of milling wheat, down from 60 percent last year, researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  The country’s harvest is expected to be 20.6 million metric
tons, with more feed wheat and less milling wheat than last
year, due to poor weather conditions, Kiev-based UkrAgroConsult
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
