Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest lender, reduced its forecast for the nation’s
economic growth this year and next to reflect a  U.S. economy 
that had a deeper recession than previously reported, according
to Craig Alexander, the bank’s chief economist.  TD cut its growth forecast to 2.2 percent this year, from
2.8 percent. It reduced the forecast for next year to 1.9
percent, from 2.5 percent, and raised the 2013 outlook to 2.6
percent, from 2.1 percent.  “The downgrade to Canadian growth this year and next is
largely based on a downgrade to the external environment in
which the Canadian economy is operating,” Alexander said today
in a telephone interview from Toronto.  Toronto-Dominion lowered its U.S. forecast for this year
and next to below 2 percent after the  Bureau of Economic
Analysis  revised its numbers, showing that the recession was 25
percent deeper and was a third longer than forecast, and the
economy stalled in the first half of the year, Alexander said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
