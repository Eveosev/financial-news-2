Bloomberg LP,  New York Times Co. (NYT) ,
 News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Dow Jones & Co. and four other media outlets were
sued for allegedly infringing two patents for “instantaneous
symbol lookup,” used on websites.  Boadin Technology LLC, which said it owns the rights to the
patents, filed the lawsuit yesterday in federal court in
Wilmington,  Delaware . Boadin, whose office is in Newark,
Delaware, is seeking a finding of infringement and unspecified
compensatory damages, according to the complaint.  The news providers infringed Boadin’s patents by selling
“certain computer products that embody” the covered
technology, according to the complaint, which said the companies
used the technology on their websites.  Other defendants include News Corp. units Fox News Network
and Marketwatch Inc., Gannett Co. and  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s CNBC TV
network. Defendant Bloomberg LP is the parent company of
Bloomberg News.  Ty Trippet, a Bloomberg spokesman, and Danielle Rhoades Ha,
a New York Times spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit.
Charles Douglas, a Comcast spokesman, didn’t immediately
comment.  Jack Horner , a News Corp. spokesman, and Robin Pence, a
spokeswoman for the Gannett newspaper chain, didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment.  The case is Boadin Technology LLC v. Bloomberg LP, 11-CV-
00802, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
