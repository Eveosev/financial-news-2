Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said he sees the purchase of sovereign bonds on the
secondary market by the  European Central Bank  as “completely
correct” and “appropriate to the situation,”  Berliner Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  Rostowski said the ECB’s bond purchases had saved the euro
area and, ultimately, the whole European Union from collapse,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
