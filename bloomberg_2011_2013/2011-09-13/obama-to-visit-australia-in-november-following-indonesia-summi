U.S. President  Barack Obama  plans
to travel to Australia and Indonesia in November, the Australian
prime minister’s office said.  Obama will visit Australia on Nov. 16 and 17, after
chairing a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Honolulu, according to an e-mailed statement today from Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard ’s office. He will then travel to Bali for
the East Asia Summit, the release said.  “The president’s visit will be an important opportunity to
renew our close ties and take forward shared objectives,”
Gillard said in the release.  The announcement of Obama’s visit comes as Gillard
struggles to shore up support after her approval slumped six
points to 32 percent in a Nielsen poll published in  Fairfax
Media Ltd. (FXJ)  newspapers yesterday. The prime minister’s public
backing has plummeted after News Ltd. newspapers, a unit of
Rupert Murdoch’s media enterprise, this month said that unnamed
Labor party members wanted her to quit.  Obama last year twice canceled trips to Australia, first in
March to pass his health care plan in Congress, and then in June
due to the BP Plc oil spill in the  Gulf of Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
