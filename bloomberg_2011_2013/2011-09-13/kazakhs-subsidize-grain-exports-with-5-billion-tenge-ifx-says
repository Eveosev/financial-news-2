Kazakhstan will spend 5 billion
tenge ($34 million) to subsidize the cost of transporting grain
through  Russia  as it seeks to bolster exports, Interfax said,
citing Finance Minister Bolat Zhamishev.  The central Asian country also plans to ease the burden of
storing grain at elevators in its northern region by spending
1.7 billion tenge to move stocks to other regions, Zhamishev
said, according to Interfax. Kazakhstanâ€™s potential grain
exports this year exceed 10 million metric tons, the news
service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
