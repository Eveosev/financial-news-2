Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of phone-network equipment, agreed to cooperate
with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  on cloud computing and data centers, a
move that may help boost sales at Huawei’s enterprise business.  The companies will share expertise in the enterprise market
and jointly develop a China information, communications
technology and systems integration business with a focus on
cloud computing, data centers and networks, Huawei said in an e-
mailed statement today. The agreement was signed in Shenzhen,
where Huawei is based, on Sept. 6, according to the statement.  Huawei is expanding beyond its traditional business of
supplying equipment for phone networks as it strives to more
than triple sales to $100 billion in the next 10 years. The
company has identified an expansion into enterprise computing,
or the sale of  information systems  to businesses and government
agencies, as a key driver of planned revenue growth.  Huawei aims to double annual sales at its enterprise group
to $4 billion this year, from $2 billion last year, Leon He,
Huawei’s president of solution sales at the enterprise unit,
said in an interview in May. Within three to five years the
unit’s sales will more than triple again to between $15 and $20
billion, He said at the time.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
