Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to a one-week high, before a debt swap this month in
which the government offered to buy back as much as 39.5
trillion pesos ($22 billion) worth of local securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent benchmark bonds due in
July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.31 percent at 2:26 p.m. New York time. That’s its highest
level on a closing basis since Sept. 2. The bond’s price fell
0.117 centavo to 121.941 centavos per peso.  Colombia on Sept. 9  announced its plan  to carry out a peso
bond swap as it seeks to issue new securities maturing in August
2026. The  Finance Ministry  on Sept. 20 will seek to repurchase
peso bonds due April 2012, August 2012, April 2013, November
2013 and May 2014, and offer in return peso debt due October
2015, October 2018 and August 2026, it said in a statement.  “The market continues to react to the swap that will
result in an increase in the amount of long term bonds and a
reduction in short term securities,” said Daniel Escobar, an
analyst at brokerage Global Securities in Bogota. Yields have
risen 12 basis points since the day the swap was announced.  Concern inflation may quicken as heavier-than-average rain
hurts crops and pushes up food prices is also leading to
declines in peso bonds, known as TES, according to Escobar.  Floods  President  Juan Manuel Santos  has warned Colombia may face
floods and mudslides as a result of heavy rains that are
expected to start this month and last through December.  Colombia’s peso rose the most in two weeks after global
stocks gained as investors watched developments in Europe for
signs of progress in  Greece ’s debt crisis.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,813 per dollar, from
1,820.99 yesterday. The currency yesterday plunged 1.2 percent,
the most in a month, as concern Greece may default on its debt
prompted investors to sell higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she’s confident Europe
will find a solution for  Finland ’s objections to Greece’s
bailout, blunting concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “Investors are waiting to see what political solutions
will be taken in Europe which could help risk appetite,” said
Escobar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
