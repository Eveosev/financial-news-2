BP Plc (BP/)  said it halted a court
ruling in  Russia  that led to raids on its Moscow offices last
month while it appeals.  The court in the Tyumen region in Siberia had ruled on Aug.
30 that documents could be seized on behalf of minority
shareholders in the TNK-BP venture, who claimed that failure of
an Arctic exploration deal with OAO Rosneft deprived the unit of
$3 billion in potential profit. Armed men occupied BP’s Moscow
office on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 to search for evidence.  BP Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  this week visited
Russia with U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  in the first
meeting between a British leader and  Vladimir Putin  since 2007.
Last month’s raid echoed BP’s trouble in Russia in 2008, when
Dudley fled Russia after running TNK-BP for five years.  BP Exploration Operating Co., the raided entity, said the
move was part of a “pressure campaign.”  According to today’s ruling, enforcement procedures against
BP EOC” that led to the raids “must be stopped,” BP said in
an e-mailed statement. “The hearing of BP EOC’s appeal against
the ruling issued on July 19 will take place in the appeal court
in Omsk on 7 October.”  Lawyers representing the minority shareholders in TNK-BP
said they can still seek the documents they’re looking for
during the court hearings. That may lengthen the damages
appraisal process, according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
