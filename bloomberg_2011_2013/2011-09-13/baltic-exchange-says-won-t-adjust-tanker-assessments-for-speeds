The  Baltic Exchange , the London-
based publisher of freight rates, said it doesn’t intend to
alter how it assesses tanker earnings to reflect the fact
vessels are cutting speeds to lower their fuel consumption.  Supertankers delivering Middle East cargoes to the U.S. are
losing $14,946 a day while returns from shipments to  Japan  are
minus $3,624, implying owners contributing to fuel costs on both
voyages, Baltic Exchange data show.  Frode Morkedal, an analyst at Oslo-based investment bank RS
Platou Markets AS, estimates the two routes are making owners
$7,000 a day and $14,500 respectively. The difference between
his assessments and those of the Baltic Exchange is “all down
to speed,” he said.  “There are no plans to change it,” Bill Lines, Baltic
Exchange spokesman, said by phone today, adding the
organization’s formula to calculate returns is transparent,
allowing customers to factor in their own assumptions about
speeds.  An empty supertanker burns as much as 95 metric tons of
fuel a day sailing at 14 knots, Halvor Ellefsen, a broker at
Galbraith’s Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mail today. That drops
to between 50 and 60 tons when speeds fall to between 8 and 9
knots, he said. Fuel costs $650.50 a ton in Fujairah, the
biggest refueling center for shipping in the  Persian Gulf ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
