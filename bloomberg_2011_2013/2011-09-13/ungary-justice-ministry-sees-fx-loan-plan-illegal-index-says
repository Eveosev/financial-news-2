The Hungarian Justice Ministry
considers the government’s plan to allow borrowers to repay
their foreign-currency mortgages at fixed-exchange rates illegal
and  Hungary  may have to compensate banks for any incurred
losses, news portal  Index  reported, citing a ministry assessment
obtained by the portal.  The assessment, sent to the government prior to Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban ’s endorsement of the plan yesterday,
states that Hungary’s Constitutional Court or the European Court
of Justice would find that the program breaches the law, Index
said.  The government may end up having to repay estimated costs
of 250 billion forint ($1.2 billion) from banks, the assessment
said, according to Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
