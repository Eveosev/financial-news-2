Libyan oil exports, which were
shuttered during fighting against  Muammar Qaddafi , may resume
and reach 200,000 to 250,000 barrels a day by the fourth
quarter, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Exports may rise to 650,000 to 850,000 barrels a day by the
end of 2012, the Paris-based adviser said today in its monthly
report. The IEA revised higher its expectations of Libyan crude
production capacity to 350,000 to 400,000 barrels a day by the
end of 2011 as hostilities may end earlier than expected, rising
to 1.1 million barrels a day by the fourth quarter of 2012.  “The prospects for partial restoration of Libyan
hydrocarbon supplies in the short term have improved following
the fall of Tripoli to rebel forces” on Aug. 21, the IEA said.
“Damage to production facilities, pipelines, refineries and
ports, although believed comparatively light, will need to be
fully assessed, and security on the ground assured before major
increases in production can be expected.”  Brent oil futures surged as high as $127.02 a barrel in
April following the halt of  Libya  output, which was about 1.6
million barrels a day in January. It will take two to three
years before Libya restores full production, the IEA said.  The IEA was more cautious than the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which said in its own monthly
report yesterday that it expects Libyan production to reach 1
million barrels a day within six months. The North African
nation, one of OPEC’s 12 members, will be able to restore output
to full capacity in less than a year-and-a-half, OPEC said. The
IEA is an adviser to oil-consuming nations, while OPEC supplies
about 40 percent of the world’s oil.  Refinery Shutdowns  Oil demand in the holder of  Africa ’s biggest crude reserves
fell to just over 100,000 barrels a day from March to July as
refinery shutdowns, disrupted port operations, infrastructure
damage and slowing economic growth cut consumption from an
average 260,000 barrels a day in 2010, according to the report.  Local consumption should recover to 200,000 barrels a day
by the end of the year and average 225,000 barrels in 2012 or
more if reconstruction proceeds faster than anticipated, the IEA
said. The Zawiya and Tobruk refineries may restart “relatively
quickly” once crude supplies resume, while the largest plant at
Ras Lanuf may take several months, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
