Tropical Storm Maria, drifting east
of the southeastern Bahamas, was forecast to start moving north
through tomorrow with little change in strength, according to
the  National Hurricane Center .  Maria’s top winds are at 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour,
according to an advisory before 11 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time
yesterday. The storm, no longer expected to reach hurricane
strength, is about 780 miles south-southwest of  Bermuda  and
moving northwest at 2 mph.  Fourteen named storms have formed in the Atlantic since the
start of the six-month  hurricane season  on June 1.  Over the weekend, the remains of Tropical Storm Nate
dissipated over Mexico.  Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said it resumed operations at its
explorations and production offshore facilities affected by
Nate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
