U.S. stock-index futures resumed
declines after a spokesman for French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
rejected reports of a new French-German initiative to resolve
the Greek debt crisis.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 0.7 percent at 7:49 a.m. in  New York . The contract
earlier erased its drop after Reuters reported that  France  and
 Germany  were planning an announcement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
