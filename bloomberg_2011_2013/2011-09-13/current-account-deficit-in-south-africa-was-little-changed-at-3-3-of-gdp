South Africa ’s current account
deficit was little changed in the second quarter as a record
gold price helped to boost exports, while oil imports climbed.  The shortfall, the broadest measure of trade in goods and
services, widened to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product
compared with 3.1 percent in the first quarter, the  Reserve Bank 
said in its Quarterly Bulletin released in  Pretoria  today.  The current account gap, which the government has referred
to as the economy’s “Achilles’ Heel,” has narrowed since 2009
as economic growth stalled, crimping demand for imports. Gold
soared 28 percent this year to a record $1,921.15 an ounce on
Sept. 6, boosting export earnings, while oil imports climbed as
crude prices jumped.  “The balance of payments situation remains one of fairly
moderate current account deficits financed comfortably by
capital inflows on the financial account,”  Monde Mnyande , the
central bank’s chief economist, said in a speech in Pretoria
today.  Africa’s biggest economy relies on foreign portfolio
investment to fund the current account deficit, flows that have
fluctuated depending on investors’ appetite for riskier assets.
Foreign investment in stocks and bonds increased to 35.1 billion
rand ($4.74 billion) in the second quarter from 20.8 billion
rand in the previous three months, the central bank said.  Direct investment by foreigners, including takeovers and
building of plants, jumped to 12.3 billion rand in the second
quarter, the biggest increase in two years, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
