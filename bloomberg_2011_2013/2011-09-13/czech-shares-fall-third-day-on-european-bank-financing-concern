Czech shares fell for a third day,
led by  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , on concern the
euro area’s sovereign debt crisis is hurting interbank lending.  The PX gauge of companies slid as much as 1.6 percent and
traded down 0.7 percent to 940.1 as of 1:47 p.m. in Prague. A
close at that level would be its lowest since July 2009.
Komercni, the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, slumped 1.4
percent to 3,155 koruna, after earlier retreating 4.7 percent.  European stocks fell, the euro weakened and Italian bonds
dropped as BNP Paribas SA denied a Wall Street Journal article
that said the French lender struggled to obtain dollar funding.
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told Inforadio she won’t let
 Greece  go into an “uncontrolled insolvency” because of the
risk of contagion for other countries.  “Risk assets are back under pressure,” RBC Capital
Markets strategists led by  Nick Chamie  in Toronto wrote in an e-
mailed report to clients today. “The markets’ focus is squarely
on European banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
