Multi Corp. BV , the European mall
developer that’s 85 percent owned by a  Morgan Stanley (MS)  fund,
named a new chief executive officer as it announced a new 850
million-euro ($1.16 billion) financing package.  A group of 11 banks led by NIBC Bank NV agreed to extend
Multi’s loans and borrowing facilities by four years, according
to a statement released today by the Gouda, Netherlands-based
developer.  The deal will help finance Multi’s 14 existing mall-
development projects across  Europe  as well as new investments
under the team to be led by Heino Vink, Multi’s former head of
Benelux and  France .  Vink, 37, takes over as chief executive from Glenn Aaronson, who is leaving to pursue his own projects and to
become non-executive chairman of Forum Turkey Fund, for which
Multi plans an initial public offering within the next four
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
