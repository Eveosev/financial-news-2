The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
announced that tax returns for estates of people who died in
2010 that are worth more than $5 million will be due no earlier
than Jan. 17, 2012, instead of Nov. 15, 2011.  The estate tax lapsed during 2010, and the filing process
has been complicated because the IRS hasn’t released details and
forms that govern how heirs should establish the basis of assets
inherited without an estate tax.  Executors of estates of people who died in 2010 can choose
between paying no tax or filing under the 2011 tax parameters,
which are an exemption of $5 million per-person and a 35 percent
top rate. The decision announced today by the IRS gives
executors more time to make that choice.  For estates of less than $5 million, the 2011 rules are
typically more advantageous, because no estate tax is due and
the heirs receive the property with a step-up in basis. If the
heirs later sell those assets, they pay capital gains taxes only
on the difference between the sale price and the value at death.  For larger estates, the issue is more complicated, because
the choice to pay no tax is accompanied by what is called a
modified carryover basis, which hadn’t been part of prior law.
Under that structure, heirs must pay capital gains taxes upon a
sale based on the difference between the sale price and the
purchase price that the dead person paid. Those rules and forms
are what have proven more difficult for the IRS to establish.  In addition to the delayed deadline, the IRS announced
today that executors of large estates will be able to request an
extension to file their returns until March 19, 2012.  Heirs who sold assets in 2010 that they inherited will
receive relief from income tax penalties they might otherwise
pay because those sales may have been made without knowing the
basis of the asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
