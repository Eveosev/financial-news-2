England  prop  Andrew Sheridan  will
miss the remainder of the Rugby  World Cup  with a left shoulder
injury.  Sheridan was hurt in England’s opening 13-9 win over
 Argentina  on Sept. 10. He’ll return home from  New Zealand  for
treatment, subject to approval from the tournament’s medical
director, the Rugby Football Union said in a statement.  Manager  Martin Johnson  has yet to decide who will replace
Sheridan in the 30-man squad, the RFU said. England next plays
Georgia in five days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
