Chile’s peso gained after German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she’s confident  Europe  will find a
solution for Finland’s objections to Greece’s bailout, blunting
concerns about Europe’s debt crisis.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 475.25 per  U.S. dollar  from a
five-month low of 476.05 yesterday.  European stocks rebounded from a two-year low after Merkel
said she’s “very optimistic” that Finland’s demands for
special collateral as part of the Greek bailout package will be
met within the parameters of measures agreed by euro-area
leaders. A spokesman for French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  denied
a report that he and Merkel would today announce a joint
initiative to stem the debt crisis.  “The market was extremely volatile this morning,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Inversiones in Santiago.
“The peso had traded in a range since April, and yesterday it
left that range, which suggests it will go to 484 to 485, but
there’s fierce resistance at 475.”  Foreign investors in the forwards market increased
positions against the peso to $886 million on Sept. 9 from $768
million on Sept. 8, according to central bank data. That’s more
than double the $386 million position against the peso they had
on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
