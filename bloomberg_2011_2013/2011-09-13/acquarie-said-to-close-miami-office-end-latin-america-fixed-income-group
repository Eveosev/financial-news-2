Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
largest investment bank, closed its Miami office and shut down
its Latin America fixed-income business, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  John Welch, chief emerging-market strategist for the bank,
was among those fired in the move, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the information hasn’t been made
public. Paula Chirhart, a spokeswoman in  New York  for Sydney-
based Macquarie, declined to comment.  Latin America bond sales are slowing as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and the global economic slowdown erode demand for higher-
yielding assets. The region’s companies and governments have
sold $19.7 billion of bonds overseas since mid-June, a 16
percent drop from the previous three-month period.  The extra yield investors demand to own Latin American
 government bonds  instead of Treasuries has risen 38 basis
points, or 0.38 percentage point, this month and touched 457
basis points yesterday, the highest since July 2009, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.  Macquarie may have to cut 1,000 jobs to offset a decline in
trading and corporate advisory income, UBS AG analysts Jonathan Mott and Chris Williams wrote in a research note today. The bank
employed about 15,500 workers as of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
