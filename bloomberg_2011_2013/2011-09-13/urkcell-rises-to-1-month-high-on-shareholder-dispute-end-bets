Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,
 Turkey ’s largest mobile-phone company, rose to a one-month high
after saying dividend payments and board positions will be
discussed at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting Oct. 12.  The shares gained 26 kurus, or 3.2 percent, to 8.4 liras,
their highest intraday level since Aug. 10.  The news “increases hopes for resolution of the conflict
between shareholders regarding board structure and dividend
distribution,” Alper Demir, an analyst at Oyak Securities in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  Shareholders failed to approve the dividend or financial
statements on Aug. 12 amid ongoing disputes about the company’s
management.  Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  and Moscow-based Altimo, along with
Turkey’s Cukurova Holding AS, control Turkcell, and helped block
a decision on dividend payments at the company’s April 21 annual
meeting after failing to oust Chairman  Colin Williams . The
Swedish and Russian partners argued that Williams has hampered
Turkcell’s growth by favoring its founding shareholder, Cukurova
Chairman Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, Turkey’s richest man.  To contact the reporter on this story:
