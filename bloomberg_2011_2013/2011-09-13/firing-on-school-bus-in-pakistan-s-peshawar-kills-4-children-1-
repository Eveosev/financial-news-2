At least four school children and
their driver were killed as militants opened fire on a bus in
 Pakistan ’s  Peshawar  city.  Pakistan ’s military offensives against the Taliban and
allied guerrillas have sparked retaliatory attacks in cities
nationwide that killed more than 2,000 civilians and security
personnel last year, according to the South Asian terrorism
database of the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict
Management.  “There seems no reason to attack a school bus,” Saif-ul-
Rehman, a city police official, said in a phone interview from
Peshawar. “It’s a cowardly terror attack.” The children were
returning from school when the vehicle was attacked, Rehman
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
