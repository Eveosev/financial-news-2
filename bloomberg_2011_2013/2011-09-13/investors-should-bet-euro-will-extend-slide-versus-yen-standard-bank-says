Investors should sell the euro
against the yen, betting the 17-nation currency will extend
losses after sliding to a 10-year low yesterday, according to
 Standard Bank  Plc.  The bank recommends selling the euro at 104.90 yen with an
initial target of 103.50 followed by 100.40,  Steven Barrow , head
of Group of 10 currency strategy, wrote today in a note to
clients. Investors should exit the trade if the euro strengthens
to 108.10 yen, he said.  “Our indicators of euro-yen remain weak and we will add a
short position here,” London-based Barrow wrote in the note.  The common currency fell 0.5 percent to 105.10 yen at 11:09
a.m. in London, after sliding to 103.90 yesterday, the lowest
level since June 2001. The euro has slumped 9.2 percent against
the yen in the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
