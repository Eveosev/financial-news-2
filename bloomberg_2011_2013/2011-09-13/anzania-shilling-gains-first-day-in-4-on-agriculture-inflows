Tanzania’s shilling gained for the
first day in four against the dollar as companies received the
U.S. currency for agricultural exports.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.6 percent to 1,624.5 per dollar, and traded less
than 0.1 percent up at 1,634.5 by 1:26 p.m in Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital.  “We have seen some proceeds come in today from the
 agriculture sector  which caused a slight appreciation of the
shilling,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at National Bank of
Commerce, Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone today
from Dar es Salaam.  Tanzania is Africa’s second-biggest producer of cotton
after Nigeria, according to the Food and Agriculture
Organization. The nation is the continent’s fourth-largest
producer of coffee, with arabica beans accounting for 75 percent
of its crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
