Somalia’s transitional government
says it will appoint a committee this month to draft a new
constitution that it hopes will be adopted in January.  The so-called committee of experts will be appointed by
Sept. 19 and will discuss the constitution with religious
scholars, women’s organizations and business groups prior to
sending the charter to parliament for approval, the government
said late yesterday in a statement from Mogadishu, the capital.  Political leaders signed an agreement known as the “road
map” last week to end the transitional government by August. It
plans to draft the constitution, reform parliament and improve
security in Mogadishu in the next 12 months. It’s the latest
effort to end conflict in the Horn of Africa nation, which has
been wracked by civil war for two decades.  “I appeal to all Somalis to take part in this process,”
Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said in the statement. “We
are embarking on a new era of making a difference to our
people.”  The transitional government was established in Somalia in
2004, the 14th attempt to create a functioning central
administration since the fall of Mohamed Siad Barre’s
dictatorship in 1991. The Western-backed government’s mandate,
which had been scheduled to end last month, was extended for 12
months in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
