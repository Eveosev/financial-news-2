U.S. commercial-insurance prices
rose 1.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier and
may keep climbing, according to a survey by consulting firm
 Towers Watson & Co. (TW)   Rates increased for all standard lines of coverage,
including workers’ compensation and property, for the first time
since the fourth quarter of 2003, New York-based Towers Watson
said today in a statement. Gains were biggest on policies for
midsized and large companies, the firm said.  Commercial insurers such as Travelers Cos.,  Chubb Corp. (CB)  and
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  faced claims this year from
catastrophes. The March earthquake in  Japan  and second-quarter
tornadoes in the U.S. contributed to more than $70 billion in
losses during the first half. Carriers may benefit if rates
continue to rise, eclipsing claims costs, said Bruce Fell,
managing director of Towers Watson’s property and casualty
practice in the Americas.  “What’s really a good sign is that we saw consistency
across almost every line,” Fell said in a phone interview. “If
this holds for the next few quarters, then I think it’s a really
good, strong sign that discipline” has returned, he said.  The Towers Watson data is based on a survey of prices for
new and renewal coverage reported by 38 insurance companies,
representing about 20 percent of the commercial insurance
market, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
