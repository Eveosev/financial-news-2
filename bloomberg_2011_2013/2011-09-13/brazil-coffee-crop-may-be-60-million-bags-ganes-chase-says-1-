Brazil  has the potential to produce
60 million bags of coffee in the 2012-13 season even though
yields in general have been dropping, according to J. Ganes
Consulting.  The South American country will produce 49.2 million bags
in the 2011-12 season, which started in July, as trees entered
the low-yielding half of a two-year cycle,  data  from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture show. That’s down from 54.5 million in
2010-11.  Producers in Brazil increased the number of trees planted
in areas of the same size, which resulted in lower yields, Judy Ganes-Chase, president of the Katonah, New York-based
consultancy said today on the first day of a two-day conference
in Antwerp,  Belgium .  Brazil, the world’s biggest producer, has virtually no
coffee stocks and inventories may rebound by 8 million bags in
the 2012-13 season, which starts next July, she said.  Coffee prices may fall as Brazilian producers have no
incentive to hold back beans, she said, adding growers were
selling when prices rallied on ICE Futures U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
