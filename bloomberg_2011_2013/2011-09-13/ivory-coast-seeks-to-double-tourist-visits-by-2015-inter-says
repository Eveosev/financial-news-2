Ivory Coast  plans to double the
number of tourists that visit the West African nation to 500,000
by 2015, l’Inter newspaper reported, citing Guy Francis Kodjo,
cabinet director for the minister of tourism.  The country plans to build as many as 15 hotels to attract
tourists and increase profit from the industry to 200 billion
 CFA francs  ($415 million) each year from the current 50 billion
francs, the Abidjan-based newspaper reported. Most of the visits
made to  Ivory Coast  are for business or family reasons, l’Inter
