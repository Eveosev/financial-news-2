Saudi Aramco Total Refining &
Petrochemical Co., known as Satorp, plans to complete building
its refinery by the end of 2013, said Chief Executive Officer
Fawwaz Nawwab.  “This is a very good project, a secure project,” Nawwab
said in  Riyadh  after a meeting with potential investors. “The
risk factor is very low and there is a lot of cash in the
kingdom.”  A joint venture between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Total SA (FP) 
started offering today 3.75 billion riyals ($1 billion) of
Islamic bonds to investors in the Arab world’s largest economy.
The sukuk offering will help finance Satorp’s 400,000 barrel-a-
day refinery and petrochemicals complex, which is being built at
an estimated cost of $14 billion in Jubail on the Persian Gulf
coast of Saudi Arabia.  “Sixty-eight percent of the refinery’s engineering,
procurement and construction has been completed globally as of
today,” Nawwab said.  Satorp’s sukuk will mature about 14 years from the date of
completion, and may have a semi-annual floating-rate coupon,
according to Usman Sikandar, co-Head  Investment Banking  at
Calyon Saudi Fransi Ltd.  The sale, to be completed on Oct. 8, will be the fourth
Shariah-compliant issue from  Saudi Arabia  this year, bringing
total sukuk sales in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to
$4.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
