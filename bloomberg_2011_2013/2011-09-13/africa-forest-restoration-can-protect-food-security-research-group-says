Restoring and preserving dry-land
forests can help provide food and fertilizer on small farms and
prevent the recurrence of famine in  Kenya  and other African
countries, a research group said.  The destruction of forests and other forms of human-caused
land degradation have caused more damage than drought, turning
vast areas of once-grazeable and farmable land into near-desert,
forestry experts from the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “Deforestation and land degradation have hindered
capacities to cope with disasters and adapt to climate
variability and change in the long-term,” said Frances Seymour,
director general of the group’s  Center for International
Forestry Research . Research carried out by the center in 25
countries shows that forests serve as an important defense
against poverty, providing about a quarter of  household income 
for the people living in and around forest areas.  Famine in the Horn of  Africa  has put millions of people at
risk in  Somalia , Kenya and other countries. The United Nations
estimates that hundreds of people are dying every day, more than
13 million are at risk, and a third of Somalia’s population has
been displaced.  Seymour said that dry-land areas are likely to suffer more
frequent and severe droughts as the climate changes, and that
protecting and restoring forests in such areas should have a
more prominent place in the debate about global warming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
