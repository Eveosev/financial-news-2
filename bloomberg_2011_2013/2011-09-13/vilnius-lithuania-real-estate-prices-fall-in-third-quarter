Property prices in the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, fell for a second consecutive in the three
months that will end in September, according to preliminary
figures from the nation’s  registry office .  Prices fell 0.8 percent from the previous quarter after a
2.2 percent drop in the second quarter, the Vilnius-based office
said today in an e-mailed statement. Outside of the capital,
real-estate prices fell 2.9 percent, it said.  The Baltic nation’s property market is recovering from a
property market bust in 2009. Lithuanian real-estate prices fell
an average of 13 percent last year.  Prices rose 3 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier in Vilnius and increased 6 percent elsewhere, the office
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
