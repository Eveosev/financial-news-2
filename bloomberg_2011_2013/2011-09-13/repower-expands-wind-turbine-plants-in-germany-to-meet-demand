Repower Systems SE is spending 10
million euros ($14.6 million) to expand two wind-turbine
production facilities in  Germany  to satisfy increasing demand.  The Hamburg-based company, a unit of Asia’s third-largest
turbine maker  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will boost annual capacity at
its nacelle and hub production plant in Bremerhaven to 900
megawatts from 600 megawatts by 2012, the company said today in
a website  statement .  Repower is also expanding its facility in the state of
Brandenburg to assemble 3-megawatt turbines, instead of 2-
megawatt machines, by the end of this year. The smaller turbines
will be built at plants in Germany, Portugal and  India , Repower
said.  “We have to reposition our three German plants and expand
capacities in good time,” Gregor Gnaedig, Repower’s chief
operating officer, said in the statement. “The European
offshore business will also increase significantly over the next
few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
