The  European Investment Bank  is
considering a loan of as much as 450 million euros ($612
million) for a German offshore wind farm developed by WPD AG.  The facility in the  North Sea  near the Danish border would
have a capacity of about 288 megawatts, the lending arm of the
European Union said in a website  statement .  The Butendiek project, developed by the offshore wind unit
of Bremen, Germany-based WPD, may cost about 1.29 billion euros,
according to the bank, which increased its lending to climate-
related projects to a record 19 billion euros last year.  The loan for the wind farm, which would have 80 turbines of
3.6 megawatts each, is under appraisal, according to the bank.
 Germany  plans to have 10,000 megawatts of sea-based turbines
installed by the end of the decade.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
