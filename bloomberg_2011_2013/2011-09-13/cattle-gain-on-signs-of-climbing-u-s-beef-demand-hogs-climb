Cattle rose for the second straight
day on signs of climbing demand for U.S. beef. Hog futures
gained.  At midday, wholesale-beef prices jumped 1.1 percent to
$1.8375 a pound, a two-week high, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. The cost of the meat will continue to climb this
week, according to Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind
Cattle Brokerage in  Chicago .  “There is definitely some renewed buying interest” amid
reports that the number of animals for sale has declined,
Vetterkind said in an e-mailed report today.  Cattle futures for December delivery jumped 1.025 cents, or
0.9 percent, to settle at $1.1975 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 11 percent
this year.  Hedge funds  increased their net-long positions in cattle
futures and options by 4.7 percent to 56,714 contracts in the
week ended Sept. 6, the first gain in three weeks, data from the
U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission show.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement climbed 1.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.37025 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at 82.825 cents a pound in Chicago. The most-
active contract has climbed 3.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
