European soccer’s governing body
rejected an appeal by  Switzerland ’s Sion, clearing the way for
Celtic to play in the Europa League this season.  UEFA’s appeal body upheld an earlier ruling that Sion used
ineligible players in qualifying matches against the Scottish
club, according to a statement on the governing body’s website.
The decision will allow Celtic to play in the group stage,
beginning Sept. 15 against  Atletico Madrid , although Sion had
the option of appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport
within 10 days.  Agence France Press reported earlier today that a Swiss
regional court ordered UEFA to reinstate Sion. UEFA said it got
a decision from the court, but won’t comment until later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
