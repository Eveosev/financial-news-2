Saudi shares rose the most in
almost a week on bets a drop prompted by investor concern over
the European debt crisis is overdone given prospects for
earnings growth and as crude oil gained for a second day.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest chemicals
maker, advanced as much as 1.6 percent.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI)  increased
for a second day this week. The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.4
percent, the most since Sept. 7, to 6,062.61 at 2:38 p.m. in
Riyadh, trimming a drop in the past month to 1.5 percent. The
market has slumped 7.8 so far this quarter on investor worries
that global economic growth may slow.  “Debt issues in Europe are not reflective of the
fundamentals of the Saudi market although investors are reacting
to events there; it’s purely sentiment,” said Asim Bukhtiar, a
Riyadh-based equity analyst at Riyad Capital. “If you look at
the fundamentals, structurally the market is still sound;
earnings in the first half of 2011 were decent and we expect the
second half to be even better.”  Sabic, which has the heaviest weighting on  Saudi Arabia ’s
index, on July 17 said it had a record revenue in the second
quarter as exports rose amid rising petrochemicals demand from
Asia. The company’s quarterly profit jumped 61 percent to 8.1
billion riyals ($2.16 billion). The shares rose the most since
Sept. 7 to 92.75 riyals before trading at 91.75 riyals.  Crude Inventories  Crude oil for October delivery rallied as much as 1.8
percent to $89.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Saudi Arabia, the Arab region’s largest
economy, is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil.  A U.S. Energy Department report tomorrow may show crude
inventories slid 3 million barrels last week after storms
curtailed offshore production, according to the median of 10
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline supplies
probably fell 500,000 barrels, the survey shows. The industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  will report its own data
today.  Al Rajhi, Saudi Arabia’s second-largest publicly traded
lender by assets, rose 0.7 percent, the most since Sept. 10, to
70 riyals.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s
MSM 30 Index advanced 0.3 percent and Bahrain’s gauge gained 0.1
percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  and the Kuwait Stock Exchange
