The U.S. House passed an extension
of aviation, highway and transit programs in a move to avert
another partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration
and the suspension of construction projects around the country.  The legislation, passed today by voice vote, extends FAA
operations through January 31 and highway and transit programs
through March 31.  The extension of FAA programs, if passed by the Senate this
week, would be the 22nd since the last multiyear reauthorization
bill expired at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. The extension
would apply to the funding authority of FAA, highway and transit
programs, ticket taxes and fuel taxes.  “I can guarantee it will be the last extension, because we
must and we will pass a four-year authorization,” John Mica, the
Florida Republican who chairs the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, said today.  The most recent extension, which expires Sept. 16, was
signed Aug. 5 after a two-week partial shutdown of the FAA
triggered by disagreements between the House and Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
