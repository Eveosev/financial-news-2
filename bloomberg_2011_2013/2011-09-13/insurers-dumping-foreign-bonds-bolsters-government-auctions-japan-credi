The slide in overseas  interest
rates  is spurring Japanese insurers to dump foreign debt in
favor of domestic fixed-income securities, supporting demand at
the nation’s bond auctions.  Germany’s 20-year bonds yield 69 basis points more than
similar-maturity Japanese debt sold yesterday, near the lowest
in at least 17 years. The rate advantage of 10-year Treasuries
shrank to 91 basis points on Sept. 9, the narrowest in two
years. Japanese life insurers sold a net 550.6 billion yen
($7.16 billion) of foreign debt last month, the most since
December 2008, Ministry of Finance data showed.  The lower yield advantage of overseas bonds has coincided
with heightened volatility in  currency markets , with the euro
falling to a decade low against the yen. That’s spurred domestic
financial companies to funnel more funds into Japanese
 government bonds , helping the world’s most indebted nation
borrow at the second-lowest rates globally after  Switzerland .  “High yields are what make foreign bonds attractive, so
the narrowing yield differences diminish their allure,” said
Shinichi Horikawa, general manager at the accounting and
investment department of Mitsui Sumitomo Kirameki Life Insurance
Co. in Tokyo., which manages $16 billion. “In relative terms,
Japan’s government bonds have become more attractive.”  Yesterday’s 1 trillion yen sale of 20-year Japanese bonds
drew bids valued at 3.39 times the amount on offer, the highest
since the offering in May. Twenty-year yields slid 2.5 basis
points to 1.740 percent after the auction, and the advantage
they offered over five-year notes declined to 139 basis points,
or 1.39 percentage point, the least since Sept. 29, 2010  ‘Good’ Auction  “The auction results were pretty good,” said  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., one of the
25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.
“The bullish trend for longer-term bonds is likely to last for
a while.”  Germany’s 20-year bonds yield 2.44 percent, compared with
1.75 percent for Japan’s, and the gap between the two narrowed
to 66 basis points on Sept. 12, the least in Bloomberg data
going back to December 1993. The rate on Switzerland’s 20-year
security is lower at 1.44 percent.  Sumitomo Mitsui’s Horikawa said his company’s holdings of
Japanese debt are centered on maturities from 10 and 30 years.
Life insurance companies typically try to match the maturities
of their assets and liabilities to minimize the effects of
interest-rate fluctuations.  Insurer Holdings  Insurance companies owned 20.2 percent of  Japan ’s
outstanding debt as of March 2011, the second-biggest holders
after banks with 44.8 percent), according to the latest data
from the Ministry of Finance.  Japanese government debt due in 10 years or longer has
handed investors a 3.16 percent return this year, compared with
a 0.27 percent gain for bonds maturing between one and three
years, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.  “Short-term notes offer too little income,” said Mitsui
Sumitomo’s Horikawa. “To gain sufficient income, investors have
to buy longer-maturity bonds.”  The yen climbed to a postwar high of 75.95 per dollar on
Aug. 19, even as the nation sold 4.51 trillion yen that month to
weaken the currency, the biggest foreign-exchange intervention
on a monthly basis since 2004. The yen reached 103.90 per euro
Sept. 12, the strongest since June 2001.  Currency-Hedged Yields  Treasuries have returned a 0.63 percent in the past three
months to investors who converted proceeds into yen, compared
with 4.94 percent in dollar terms, a Bank of America index
showed. The comparable returns for German debt were negative
1.86 percent and positive 7.57 percent, the indexes showed.  Currency-hedged yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries stood at
1.83 percent today, down from 3.18 percent at the end of last
year. The fees to borrow the U.S. currency to cover dollar
investments are based on the difference between the London
interbank offered rates for three-month dollar and yen loans.  Currency-hedged yields on  Germany ’s 10-year debt were 0.46
percent. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield stood at 0.995
percent today.  The dollar Libor rate climbed to 0.347 percent yesterday, a
level unseen since August 2010, according to the British
Bankers’ Association.  “Because of rising dollar Libor, currency hedge costs are
increasing,” said Makoto Noji, a senior debt and foreign-
exchange strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo,
another primary dealer. “Japan’s government bonds are
relatively more attractive than overseas debt, and they are even
more attractive if hedging costs are taken into account.”  CDS Prices  Credit-default swaps insuring Japan’s sovereign debt for
five years reached 123 basis points on Sept. 13, the highest
level since CMA started gathering prices in 2004. That compared
with 85.5 basis points to protect German debt and 52.2 for U.S.
bonds, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
