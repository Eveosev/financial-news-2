Piedmont Inc.’s possible offer to
buy  Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the U.K. owner of the All Bar One
pub chain, for 230 pence ($3.63) a share is “insulting” to
shareholders, David Cumming, head of U.K. equities at Standard
Life Investments, said today.  “Mitchells & Butlers have lost four chairmen in the last
18 months and it is clear that the influence of Piedmont has
impeded the board from acting in the interests of all
shareholders,” Cumming said in an e-mailed statement.
“Piedmont has now exploited this instability with a wholly
unsatisfactory offer for the company.”  Piedmont, which is controlled by U.K. billionaire  Joe Lewis 
and owns 23 percent of Birmingham, England-based Mitchells &
Butlers, said yesterday that it was considering an offer for the
remainder of the company after a previous proposal of 224 pence
a share in cash or stock was dismissed by the U.K. company.
Mitchells & Butlers also said yesterday it would reject the
possible 230 pence a share offer, because it “significantly”
undervalues the company.  “This offer is insulting to all other shareholders,”
Cumming said. “The business is worth substantially more than
the terms proposed.”  Standard Life Investments holds 0.34 percent in Mitchells &
Butlers, according to its statement.  Piedmont wasn’t immediately available for comment, a
spokesman said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
