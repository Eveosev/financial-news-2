Tanzania’s economic growth
accelerated to 6.7 percent in the second quarter as farming and
manufacturing output increased.  The figure was provided to reporters in the commercial
capital,  Dar es Salaam , by Morrice Nyattega Oyuke, a director at
the National Bureau of Statistics. The economy grew an annual
5.8 percent in the first quarter, the bureau said on Sept. 9.  Agricultural output increased an annual 3.5 percent and
manufacturing grew 6.2 percent, the agency said. The first-
quarter rates were 2.6 percent and 4.8 percent respectively.  Tanzania vies with Mali to be  Africa ’s third-biggest
producer of gold after Ghana and  South Africa  and has the
world’s only known deposit of tanzanite, a gem. The government
aims to increase output by 8 percent a year through 2016 in the
nation of about 40 million people.  Growth may accelerate in the last quarter as the government
begins disbursing funds after parliament approved its budget,
Haji Semboja of the University of Dar es Salaam said in an
interview. Output has also been capped by a drought that drained
Tanzania’s main hydropower dams and led to power rationing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
