Bonds of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  France ’s
largest bank, dropped amid concern U.S. money market funds are
shutting off lending to the nation’s banks because of their
sovereign debt holdings.  BNP’s 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of 4.5 percent
senior unsecured bonds due in 2023 dropped 3.65 cents to 101.72
cents on the euro, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The cost of insuring the bank’s senior debt against default
surged to a record.  The Paris-based lender’s shares tumbled 12 percent in Paris
after an unidentified bank official told the Wall Street Journal
BNP can’t borrow in dollars because money-market funds are no
longer lending to it. The bank denied the report and said in a
statement that it can fund in the U.S. currency at normal levels
“directly and through foreign-exchange swaps.”  French lenders top the list of Greek creditors with $56.7
billion in overall exposure to private and public debt,
according to a June report by the  Bank for International
Settlements . U.S. money-market fund managers have cut loans to
French banks at a pace that may force the institutions to raise
capital by selling assets, William Prophet, a Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. analyst in  New York , wrote in a Sept. 9 report.  Spreads Widen  Investors demand 2.64 percentage points in extra yield to
buy BNP’s 4.5 percent 2023 notes instead of benchmark German
government debt, Bloomberg bond trader prices show. That
compares with a spread of 1.37 percentage points when the notes
were issued in March.  The bank’s 900 million euros of 4.125 percent securities
due 2022 slid 2.959 cents on the euro to 99.110, Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices show. The yield relative to German debt has
widened to 2.64 percentage points from 1.36 percentage points at
the end of July.  Credit-default swaps on BNP’s senior debt surged 18 basis
points to 323, an all-time high based on closing prices,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. A
basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10 million euros
of debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
