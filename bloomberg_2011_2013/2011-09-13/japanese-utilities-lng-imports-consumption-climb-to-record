Japan ’s 10 regional power
utilities’ imports and consumption of liquefied natural gas rose
to a record for a second month in August because of all-time low
utilization rates at nuclear power plants.  The companies led by Tokyo Electric Power Co. imported 5.28
million metric tons of LNG last month, up 23.5 percent from the
same month last year,  the Federation of Electric Power Companies 
said today. Consumption rose 15.4 percent to 4.81 million tons.  Operating rates for nuclear stations fell to 26.4 percent,
the lowest since the federation started compiling monthly data
in April 1977. Thermal generation rose 8.2 percent from a year
earlier, while overall electricity output by the utilities
dropped 12.1 percent because of power-saving efforts and lower
temperatures, according to the federation.  Of the 54 reactors in the country, 41 units were idled
because of the meltdown after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, maintenance and other upsets at the end of August,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for August. Fuel
oil and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for LNG and
coal are in metric tons.
