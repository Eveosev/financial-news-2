Labor Statistics.  U.S. IMPORT AND EXPORT PRICE INDEXES  - AUGUST 2011  U.S. import prices declined 0.4 percent in August, the  U.S.

year ended in August, compared to a 13.8 percent advance for
the July 2010-11 period.  Fuel Imports: The August drop in overall import prices was

was led by a 2.1 percent drop in petroleum prices which more
than offset a 3.3 percent advance in the price index for
natural gas. Despite declines in three of the past four
months, fuel prices rose 41.1 percent over the past year.
Prices for petroleum and natural gas each increased over the
