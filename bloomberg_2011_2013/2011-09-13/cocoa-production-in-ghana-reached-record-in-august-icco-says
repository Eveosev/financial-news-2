Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, reaped a record crop last month, the
International Cocoa Organization said in a report.  That contributed to purchases declared by the Ghana Cocoa
Board reaching 1.01 million metric tons by the end of the month,
the ICCO said today. Supply was boosted by favorable weather,
fertilizers and hybrid plantings, the London-based group said.  “Smuggling from neighboring countries has also been
reported to have inflated the country’s data,” the ICCO said,
without naming the reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
