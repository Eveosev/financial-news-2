Family Bank Ltd. fired 48 people,
half of them managers, after their positions were made redundant
by technology, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Peter Munyiri.  The lender hired Munyiri in June ahead of a planned listing
on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  later this year, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
