Novak Djokovic’s four-set victory
yesterday over  Rafael Nadal  in the men’s final of the U.S. Open
drew a big-market rating of 2.6, up 18 percent from last year’s
final between the same players, as the tennis tournament was
pushed to a Monday finish for the fourth consecutive year.  Djokovic’s first career U.S. Open title, a 6-2, 6-4, 6-7
(3-7), 6-1 victory over defending champion Nadal, was seen in
2.6 percent of U.S. homes in the top 56 metered television
markets,  CBS Corp. (CBS)  spokesman Jerry Caraccioli said in a
telephone interview, citing  Nielsen Media Research . Last year’s
final, also played on a Monday, drew 2.2 percent.  This is the fourth consecutive year that weather has forced
the men’s final beyond its scheduled Sunday timeslot. The last
time the match was played on a weekend,  Roger Federer ’s 2007
victory over Djokovic, it drew a 3.7 rating, Caraccioli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
