(Corrects to show refining capacity sought is 800,000
barrels a day, in fourth paragraph.)  Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Mexico ’s
biggest oil company, plans to take advantage of its increased
power as a shareholder in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  to boost production and
gain new reserves, La Jornada reported.  The strategy ranges from using the Spanish oil driller´s
most sophisticated seismic technology, known as  Caleidoscopio ,
to rigging oil ships in Korea and signing joint ventures to
drill in Colombia or the  Gulf of Mexico , the  Mexican daily 
reported on Sept. 11, citing an internal Pemex document.  The Mexican state-run oil producer, which imports about 40
percent of the nation’s gasoline demand, hopes to take advantage
of the price differential between European and Gulf of Mexico
gasoline through storage and term contracts, the report said.  Pemex may gain access to a refining capacity of 800,000
barrels a day, the report said, citing the unpublished document
titled “Context for Pemex’s Increased Stake in Repsol.”  A Repsol spokesman in  Madrid  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
