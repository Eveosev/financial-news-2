Polish stocks gained for the first
time in four days as banks rebounded after their valuations fell
to the lowest level in more than two years and commodities rose.  The benchmark WIG20 Index jumped 0.7 percent to 2,195.89 at
5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, after closing at the lowest level
since February 2010 yesterday.  The WIG Banking Index has slumped 25 percent since the end
of June, heading for the steepest quarterly decline in 2 1/2
years on concern the sovereign-debt crisis is spreading in
 Europe . The retreat has left the gauge trading at 10.1 times the
estimated earnings of its companies, the lowest valuation since
April 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Banks are rebounding after recent sharp losses,” Tomasz
Bursa, a Warsaw-based analyst at Ipopema Securities SA said by
phone. “Even though it’s not that bad with Polish banks from a
fundamental point of view, their stock prices were hard hit by
the poor sentiment in Europe.”  PKO Bank Polski SA, the country’s largest lender, jumped
2.4 percent to 29.92 zloty, rising for the first time in four
days.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, increased
3.8 percent to 129.2 zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole copper producer, soared
1.7 percent to 157.8 zloty, rising for the first time in three
days. Copper rose on reduced concern about Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis amid reports that  China  may invest in  Italy  and on a
mine strike in  Peru .  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, increased 1.1
percent to 35.9 zloty, snapping a two-day losing streak as crude
oil advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
