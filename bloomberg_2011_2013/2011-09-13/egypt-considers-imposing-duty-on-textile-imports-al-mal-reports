Egypt’s Ministry of Trade and
Industry may levy  customs duties  on textile imports after
receiving a complaint from the state-owned Holding Co. for
Spinning & Weaving,  Al Mal  reported.  The ministry’s anti-dumping group will finish studying the
complaint in two days, the newspaper said, citing Ali Abdel
Ghafar, who heads the group. An import duty could be imposed in
a month if it is found that companies exporting to Egypt are
hurting local producers by charging dumping prices,  Al Mal  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
