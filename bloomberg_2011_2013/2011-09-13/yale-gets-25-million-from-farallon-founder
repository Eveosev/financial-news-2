Yale University  received $25
million from Thomas Steyer, founder of Farallon Capital
Management LLC, and his wife, Kathryn Taylor, to help open the
school’s Energy Sciences Institute.  The university will hire new faculty members to conduct
research on renewable fuel sources in 40,000 square feet of
laboratory space at Yale’s West Campus, the New Haven,
Connecticut-based school said today in an e-mailed  statement .  Steyer, 54, is a 1979 graduate of Yale. He founded
Farallon, an investment company based in  San Francisco , in 1986.
He’s also a managing director of Hellman & Friedman LLC, a San
Francisco-based private-equity firm. Taylor serves on the board
of  One PacificCoast Bank , a community bank which she co-founded
with Steyer. Last year the couple donated $7 million to  Stanford
University , near Palo Alto,  California , to create the Steyer-
Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.  “This new institute will draw on the scientific resources
of the university to find new and better ways to convert the
sun’s energy into fuel,” Yale President Richard Levin said in
the statement. “Yale needs to be making a contribution in this
area, and this gift will assure an intensified effort.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
