U.S. stock-index futures erased
losses as German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she’s confident
 Europe  will find a solution for  Finland ’s objections to  Greece ’s
bailout and American retail sales increased.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December were down less than 0.1 percent at 1,156.7 at 8:43 a.m.
in  New York . U.S. retail sales rose 1.3 percent last week,
according to an ICSC-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
