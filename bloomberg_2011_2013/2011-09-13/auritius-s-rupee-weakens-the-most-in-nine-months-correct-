Mauritius’s rupee weakened the most
in more than nine months against the euro, the currency of its
main trading partner, as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will
spread curbed demand for riskier assets.  The currency depreciated as much as 4.1 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 6, and traded down 2.6
percent at 39.0948 by 4:55 p.m. in Port Louis, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the dollar, the
rupee climbed 0.5 percent to 28.6000.  The chance of a default by Greece in the next five years
has soared to 98 percent, credit-default swaps showed. The so-
called troika of the  International Monetary Fund ,  European
Central Bank  and European Commission representatives will return
to Greece this week, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said in an
interview with Berlin-based broadcaster Inforadio. Italy’s
Treasury sold five-year bonds at an average yield of 5.6
percent, compared with 4.93 percent on July 14, the last time
securities of a similar maturity were sold.  “We fear that a number of investors have had to reduce
positions in emerging-market assets, almost regardless of the
country of the assets, in a process of significant  risk
reduction ,” analysts led by Guillaume Salomon at Societe
Generale SA wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.
“Ongoing concerns about European sovereigns and the banking
sector have pushed many investors to reduce exposure to certain
asset classes and go back to cash.”  Europe is the biggest buyer of Mauritian goods, according
to the  Central Statistics Office , and accounts for 63 percent of
tourism arrivals in the Indian Ocean island nation, the
Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority said.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.6726 to 27.8404
and the selling price strengthened to 29.1518 compared with
29.1554 on Sept. 12, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  Mauritian stocks dropped for a third day, with the 38-
member SEMDEX gauge retreating 0.2 percent to 1,925.58, its
lowest level since Aug. 22, led by New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. and
Sun Resorts Ltd., the country’s largest leisure groups by market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
