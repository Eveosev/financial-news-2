U.S. monetary policy is appropriate
for the current state of the economy and the risk of recession
remains low, said  James Bullard , president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of  St. Louis .  “The stance of monetary policy has been appropriately
calibrated to try to meet, as best we can, the unusual
macroeconomic circumstances,” Bullard said today in remarks at
the St. Louis Fed. “The most likely path for the economy going
forward is one of modest, albeit unspectacular, growth, and that
the chances of recession are only modestly higher than they were
earlier this year.”  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month in a speech at a
Fed conference at  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, that the central bank
still has stimulus tools, while not providing details or
committing to deploying them.  Policy makers will meet for two days this month to “allow
a fuller discussion” of the economy and the Fed’s possible
response, Bernanke said. They are scheduled to meet Sept. 20-21.  At their meeting last month, Fed officials decided to hold
the benchmark  interest rate  at a record low at least until
mid-2013.  Bullard said today the central bank shouldn’t commit to a
particular monetary policy for a set period of time. Instead,
policy makers should determine the level of stimulus at each
meeting based on fresh economic data, he said.  “It is time for the committee to discard one-time policy
changes with fixed end dates,” Bullard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
