Ghana ’s cedi fell to weakest level
in more than seven months against the dollar as traders bought
the U.S. currency to import goods in West Africa’s biggest
economy after  Nigeria .  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 1.5532 per dollar, before
trading 0.3 percent down at 1.5449 per dollar as of 2:07 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level will be the lowest since Feb. 4.  “Importers bought the dollars to take stock of goods,”
Chris Nettey, a currency trader the local unit of Standard Bank
Group Ltd., said in a telephone interview.  The central bank continued to refrain from dollar sales for
the fourth straight week, Nettey said.  Head of treasury at the  Bank of Ghana , Adams Nyinaku,
didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
