-- Leveraged-loan returns will
trail those of bonds this year after the  Federal Reserve 
indicated it will keep  interest rates  near zero until mid-2013,
according to analysts at  Barclays Capital .  Loans lag high-yield bonds on a yield-to-worst and current
yield basis, analysts led by Brad Rogoff wrote in a report
today. Investors should consider swapping out of loans into
comparable secured bonds, the analysts wrote.   Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard &
Poor’s. Loans are typically repaid first in a bankruptcy before
bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
