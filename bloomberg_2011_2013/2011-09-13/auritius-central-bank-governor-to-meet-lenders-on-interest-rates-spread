Mauritius’s central bank Governor
Rundheersing Bheenick plans to meet with commercial banks about
reducing the spread between the benchmark rate and lending
rates.  The Bank of Mauritius wants to bring the differential down
to “more reasonable levels,” Bheenick told reporters today in
 Port Louis , the capital. Initial discussions in 2010 resulted in
lenders publishing their interest rates on the central bank’s
website, he said.  The central bank’s monetary policy committee left the
benchmark rate unchanged at 5.5 percent yesterday as inflation
slowed, after increasing it at the last two meetings. Commercial
bank’s lending rates range from between 2 percent and 19.75
percent above the prime rate, which varied from 7.3 percent to 9
percent at end-June, according to data on the Bank of
Mauritius’s  website .  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  and  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) 
are the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
