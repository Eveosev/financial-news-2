Two Americans given eight-year
prison sentences for spying and entering  Iran  illegally will be
released “in two days,” the country’s president  Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad  said, NBC reported, citing a one-on-one interview
due to be broadcast today.  Josh Fattal  and  Shane Bauer  argue that they were walking in
northern  Iraq  and mistakenly crossed over into Iran in July
2009, the news service said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
