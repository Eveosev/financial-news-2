Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
inched up to 10.42 billion euros ($14.27 billion) at the end of
August, led by favorable credit and donation inflows as well as
rising global gold prices.  Foreign-exchange reserves rose a net 36.3 million euros in
August, with an inflow of 15.3 million euros of credits and
donations, while the rally in gold prices pushed the value of
the Serbian central bank gold assets by 54.1 million euros, the
Belgrade-based National Bank of Serbia said in an e-mail today.  The Balkan nation’s spending included repayment of 16
million euros to foreign creditors and 17.7 million euros to
locals whose savings were frozen in the early 1990s and which
the government pays through a so-called savings bond.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , expanded to 5.81 billion euros from 5.75 billion in July,
the  Narodna Banka Srbije  said.  That level of the reserves matched 413 percent of M1 money
supply, or more than seven months of goods and services imports
and 1,269 percent of short-term debt, it said.  Interbank trading volumes fell in August to 2.42 billion
euros from 2.45 billion euros in July, pushing January through
August traded volumes to 12.9 billion euros.  The dinar gained a nominal 0.5 percent against the euro in
August, according to the bank, which sold 10 million euros last
month to stem excessive daily swings in the dinar exchange rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
