Usain Bolt ran a season-best 9.85
seconds to win the 100 meters at the Zagreb World Challenge.  The Olympic champion and world record holder from  Jamaica 
set a track record 15 days after being disqualified from the 100
meters final at the world championships for a false start.  Bolt finished 0.16 second ahead of Kim Collins of St. Kitts
and Nevis at the 61st Boris Hanzekovic Memorial in Zagreb,
 Croatia . Richard Thompson of Trinidad was third, in 10.03
seconds.  Bolt, whose run put him in a tie for the  season’s  fifth
fastest time, told reporters that he “kind of lost
concentration after the start.” Fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell
has gone quickest this year with 9.78 seconds on June 30.  “I could have done better,” Bolt said, according to his
website. “Especially with the weather like this because the
conditions were good.”  Bolt ran a world-record 9.69 seconds in the 100 meters
final at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He lowered the mark to
9.58 seconds at the world championships the following year in
Berlin, where he also set a world record in the 200 meters with
a time of 19.19 seconds.  Collins’s time of 10.01 seconds in Zagreb was his season
best. American Justin Gatlin, who won the 100 meters gold medal
at the 2004 Olympics in  Athens , finished sixth in 10.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
