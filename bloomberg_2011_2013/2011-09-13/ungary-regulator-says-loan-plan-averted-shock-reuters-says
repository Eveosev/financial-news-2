Hungary  averted a “shock” to the
financial system by not forcing lenders to issue forint loans to
replace foreign-currency mortgages, Reuters reported, citing
Karoly Szasz, the head of the country’s financial regulator.  “That would have caused a shock to the banking system,”
Szasz was quoted as saying by the newswire, adding that such a
move could have cut the banking system’s capital by 1 trillion
forint ($4.8 billion) if all borrowers with foreign currency
loans opted for conversion. The regulator will “safeguard
unwinding” should any bank decide to exit the Hungarian market,
Reuters said.  Hungary plans to allow early repayment on mortgages
denominated in Swiss francs or euros at more than 20 percent
below market rates, forcing lenders to swallow the losses, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
