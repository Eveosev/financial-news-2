HSBC Holdings Plc (5)  is seeking to
sell its general insurance business for about $1 billion as part
of Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver ’s plan to divest some
assets, the London-based Times reported.  Information about the non-life insurance unit may have been
sent to potential buyers including private equity firms, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
A deadline for initial bids for the division has been set for
mid-October, the Times said.  HSBC said last month it will eliminate 30,000 jobs
worldwide by the end of 2013, or about 10 percent of staff, and
cut expenses by as much as $3.5 billion to stem rising salary
costs and prepare for stricter capital rules. Gulliver is
cutting costs and selling assets as he invests and focuses the
lender’s growth in emerging markets.  London-based HSBC “doesn’t comment on market
speculation,” Jessica Lennon, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for
the bank, said in a telephone interview.  HSBC is exploring its options for the insurance business,
which sells non-life policies in the U.K., France,  Hong Kong  and
 Singapore , the newspaper said, citing a person it didn’t
identify.  Last month, HSBC said it will reap a $2.4 billion after-tax
gain from the sale of its U.S. credit card division to Capital
One Financial Corp. The U.K. lender has this year also sold
assets in  Russia  and said it will shut branches in Poland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
