Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s rules that
set the  retirement age  for pilots at 60 are unlawful, the
European Union’s highest court said.  “Prohibiting airline pilots from working after the age of
60 constitutes discrimination on grounds of age,” the  EU Court
of Justice  said in a statement on today’s ruling in Luxembourg.
“While the right to act as a pilot may be limited from that
age, total prohibition goes beyond that which is necessary to
ensure air traffic safety.”  Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, is being
challenged by three former pilots whose contracts were
terminated when they reached 60. The pilots, Reinhard
Prigge, Michael Fromm and Volker Lambach, argued the company’s
rules infringed German and international laws that say pilots
can continue to fly until the age of 65, if accompanied by a
pilot younger than 60.  A German court handling the dispute sought the European
tribunal’s guidance in 2009 on whether rules that limit the age
for pilots at 60 for air-safety reasons infringe EU laws that
prohibit age discrimination.  The case is: C-447/09, Reinhard Prigge, Michael Fromm and
Volker Lambach v.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
