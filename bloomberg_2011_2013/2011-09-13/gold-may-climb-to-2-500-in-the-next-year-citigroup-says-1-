Gold may extend its record to as
high as $2,500 an ounce in the next year if sovereign debt
concerns escalate, Citigroup Inc. said.  The metal climbed to a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6
as concerns about debt crises and slowing economic growth
boosted demand for a protection of wealth. The metal could
“briefly spike” to between $2,000 and $2,500 in the next 12
months and will likely stay above an average $1,200 a year in
the long-term, Citigroup predicts.  Bullion is headed for an 11th straight annual gain, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920 in  London . The metal
is up 27 percent this year as investors seek to diversify away
from equities and some currencies. Investors’ assets in
exchange-traded products climbed to a record 2,216.8 metric tons
last month, more than the holdings of all except four central
banks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The threat to the global financial structure during the
credit crisis has led to high net-worth individuals seeing gold
as an insurance against such instability in future,” a team of
analysts including London-based Jon Bergtheil wrote today in a
report. “This insurance role will likely continue to assist
demand while concerns remain about sovereign risk and the
longer-term issue of whether the dollar will still be the
world’s reserve-currency in 5-10 years time.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,806.60 an ounce by
10:37 a.m. in London. The metal will average $1,650 next year,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
