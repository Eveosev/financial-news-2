Copper held at bonded warehouses in
 China , the biggest user, will increase as tightened credit
results in more metal held locally by international traders,
possibly boosting imports and prices, according to Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  “More bonded stocks will be required; material to flow
into China from LME system will add to apparent demand and
support prices in next 6-12 months,” ANZ Senior Metals
Strategist Nicholas Trevethan said in a report today. The
typical working inventories of copper in Shanghai bonded
warehouses may gain to 400,000 metric tons to 500,000 tons, from
about 200,000 tons to 250,000 tons in recent years, he said.  Increased imports may help lift London copper prices, which
have dropped 14 percent from a record $10,190 a ton in February
on concern slowing global growth and spreading sovereign debt
crisis may damp metals demand.  Shanghai  will increase storage
for metals at bonded warehouses as much as fivefold next year,
Eric Ni, a business development manager at Shanghai Free Trade
Zones United Development Co., has said.  “Costly domestic credit is driving a shift towards just in
time stock management and greater reliance on international
merchants by consumers,” Trevethan said. “Shanghai futures
will increase in influence. Arbitrage windows will shorten.”  The central bank has increased the amount of cash major
lenders are required to keep in reserve nine times since
September 2010, with the ratio now at a record 21.5 percent, and
boosted benchmark rates on five occasions in a bid to curb
inflation that hit a three-year high in July.  Market Deficit  Copper may remain in short supply for a third straight year
in 2012 as demand led by China increases. Demand will likely
exceed supply by 495,000 tons in 2011, the biggest deficit since
2004, Akira Miura, executive officer of the marketing and raw-
material department at Pan Pacific Copper Co., said Sept. 1.  “In a market facing deficits for the next two to three
years and pressure on mine supply, a stock build of 200,000 to
300,000 tons would be highly supportive of the international
market,” Trevethan said. “If nothing else, it may result in
visible stocks in the LME system, currently at 465,000 tons,
migrating to the opaque world of Shanghai bonded storage, and
boost apparent demand from China.”  Copper for three-month delivery was little changed at
$8,750 a ton on the  London  Metal Exchange at 5:38 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
erasing a gain of as much as 1.4 percent.  The area for storing metals in Shanghai’s free trade areas
will increase to 200,000 square meters to 250,000 square meters
next year from 50,000 square meters, Shanghai Free Trade Zones’s
Ni has said.  The administration manages free-trade zones in Shanghai’s
Yangshan, Waigaoqiao and Pudong Airport. Two warehouses in
 Yangshan  started in March offering delivery services for copper
and aluminum futures traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metals stored there are exempt from a 17 percent value-added tax
and import tariffs, bringing prices more into line with those
traded in London and  New York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
