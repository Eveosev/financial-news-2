The zloty’s weakening against the
euro is a “natural stabilizer” for  Poland ’s economy that will
boost exports and protect jobs without increasing the country’s
foreign-denominated public debt to “any dangerous extent,”
Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said today in an  interview  on
Radio Zet.  Poland’s banking system isn’t exposed to any “direct
risk” from a possible Greek default as lenders don’t hold any
Greek bonds, Rostowski said. He added that a default could exert
some “indirect” influence on the Polish economy if it results
in slower growth in France and  Germany .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
