Dell Inc. (DELL) , the second-largest
personal-computer maker, has added $5 billion to its stock-
buyback program, citing a resurgence in its cash flow.  The repurchase adds to the $2.16 billion remaining from
prior authorizations at the end of the fiscal second quarter,
which ended in July, Dell said today in a statement. The  Round
Rock , Texas-based company spent $1.6 billion on buybacks through
the first half of the year.  Dell has cut expenses and focused on more profitable
customers and products, helping boost its cash and investments
to a record $16.2 billion at the end of last quarter. In August,
the company said operating income would increase by as much as
23 percent this fiscal year, excluding some items. That was up
from a previous forecast of as much as 18 percent.  “Our efforts to streamline our operations and reduce costs
have resulted in outstanding  cash flow  from operations,” Brian Gladden, chief financial officer, said in the statement. “We
have the flexibility to continue making opportunistic share
repurchases.”  Dell rose 19 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $14.38 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 6.1 percent
this year.  The company ranks second to Hewlett-Packard Co. in PC
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
