South African President  Jacob Zuma ,
who is leader of the African National Congress, said  Julius
Malema , leader of the party’s youth wing, would be able to
remain a member of the organization if he watched his conduct,
the Star reported, citing Zuma.  The ANC’s role is to help Malema, who has potential, Zuma
told the Johannesburg-based newspaper. Malema is facing a
disciplinary hearing by the party after he called for regime
change in neighboring Botswana. Yesterday, a South African court
ruled that Malema used hate speech when he sang a song
advocating the shooting of white farmers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
