German stocks gained for the first
time in three days, with the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rebounding from
its lowest level since July 2009, as  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  increased.  The DAX rose 94.03, or 1.9 percent, to 5,166.36 at the 5:30
p.m. close in  Frankfurt , having earlier tumbled as much as 2
percent. The gauge is trading at 8 times the estimated earnings
of its companies, according to Bloomberg data. The broader HDAX
Index added 1.7 percent.  “Some of the cheap prices some stocks are trading at now
are slowly becoming irresistible to some traders,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London .
“As long as there is no fundamental change in regard to the
European financial crisis and the stalemate in the USA continues
to persist, every recovery should be rather short lived.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said that  Greece  is taking
the right steps to get its next bailout payment, warning against
allowing a Greek default because of the risk of contagion for
other euro-area countries.  Merkel, in a German radio interview today, said that an
“uncontrolled insolvency” would further roil markets spooked
by the prospect of a Greek default. The euro region has no
system for “orderly” insolvency until the permanent rescue
fund is established in 2013, she said.  Deutsche Boerse   Deutsche Boerse jumped 4.6 percent to 40.06 euros. NYSE
Euronext and Deutsche Boerse plan to make about 200 million
euros ($274 million), or half of the proposed cost cuts from
their combination, through technology and clearing savings,
according to a regulatory filing.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, jumped 8.2 percent
to 23.15 euros as banking shares rallied across  Europe . Smaller
rival  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  added 3.8 percent to 1.59 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s
largest makers of luxury cars, advanced 2.1 percent to 51.95
euros and 2.1 percent to 32.43 euros, respectively. Carmakers
were among the best performers in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
today, climbing 2 percent as a group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
