U.K. 10-year government bonds
gained for a third day and the pound dropped versus the dollar
as stocks declined across  Europe  and Italian borrowing costs
surged at a debt sale.  Two-year gilt yields were five basis points away from a
record low after a report showed U.K. house-price expectations
fell last month. The 10-year gilt stayed higher as a report
showed U.K. inflation in August matched the fastest pace since
October 2008. The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  of stocks fell 0.4 percent
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5 percent.  “The theme remains one of support for quality bonds,”
said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
SA in  London . “Risk sentiment is providing underlying support
for gilts. We have a number of event risks today.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell five basis points to
2.33 percent as of 10:20 a.m. in London, after reaching 2.18
percent yesterday, the least since at least January 1989, when
Bloomberg started collecting the data. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2020 rose 0.465, or 4.65 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,582) face amount, to 112.545. Two-year yields were little
changed at 0.54 percent. They fell to a record low 0.49 percent
on Sept. 12.  The  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors’ real-estate
price expectations measure fell to minus 23 last month from
minus 13. The number of real-estate agents and surveyors saying
prices fell last month exceeded those seeing gains by 23
percentage points, compared with 22 percentage points in July,
the London-based group said today.  Italian Sale  Italy sold 3.9 billion euros of a new 5-year benchmark bond
at an average yield of 5.6 percent today, compared with 4.93
percent the last time securities of a similar maturity were sold
on July 14.  Demand was 1.28 times the amount on offer, compared with
1.93 times at the last sale.  The pound dropped against the dollar for a fourth day,
losing 0.4 percent to $1.5799, and was 0.7 percent weaker at
121.63 yen. It was little changed at 86.28 pence per euro after
appreciating yesterday to the strongest level since March 3.  The pound has depreciated 4.5 percent in the past 12 months
against a basket of nine major peers, the second-worst performer
after the dollar, which fell 6.8 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  Gilts have returned 3.6 percent this month, compared with
2.9 percent for German  government bonds  and 1.2 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
