Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi will beat
 Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in 2011 deliveries as demand exceeds
company targets, Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler said.  Audi will probably sell more than 1.3 million cars and
sport-utility vehicles this year compared with a previous
forecast of 1.2 million, Stadler told reporters today at the
International Motor Show in  Frankfurt .  “We’re looking at super order books, and order intake is
also very reasonable,” Stadler said. “ Although there may be
headwinds, we expect to keep growing in 2012.”  The VW unit has overtaken Mercedes in sales this year, and
Stadler has a goal of outranking  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,
the luxury-car industry’s current leader, by 2015. Daimler CEO
Dieter Zetsche, who told employees in July that the company
can’t settle for second or third place, said today he’s sticking
to a target of 1.35 million sales in 2011. The figure includes
the Mercedes luxury marque and the Smart two-seat car brand.  Audi, which has its headquarters in Ingolstadt,  Germany , is
introducing hybrid and “S” performance versions of its A6 and
A8 models as well as the S7 four-door coupe at the Frankfurt
show. It’s also unveiling an electric two-seat “Urban Concept”
city car and a facelift of its A5 coupe.  Showcasing Models  BMW is showcasing new generations of the 1-Series compact
and 6-Series coupe in Frankfurt. BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer said
yesterday that as much as 40 percent of the Munich-based
manufacturer’s fleet will be small cars in 10 years, with
electric-powered vehicles accounting for 5 percent to 7 percent
of annual sales by then.  Mercedes-Benz has a target of selling 1.5 million vehicles
a year by 2014, Zetsche said yesterday at a press conference.
The Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer aims to gain market
share in 2012, when industrywide sales growth is likely to slow,
and orders are “very strong,” he said today.  Daimler is in talks with closely held U.K. sports-car maker
Aston Martin on cooperating on the German company’s ultra-luxury
Maybach, the CEO also said. The brand, which was reintroduced in
2002, hasn’t met Daimler’s sales target of 1,000 cars a year,
and only 200 were delivered last year.  Audi is counting on the first full year of sales in 2012
for the Q3 compact SUV, revamped A6 and the A1’s new 5-door
variant to boost deliveries next year. Audi expects deliveries
in  China  this year to top 300,000 for first time, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
