Oil fell from a six-week high in
 New York  as investors speculated that increasing gasoline
stockpiles in the U.S. indicate fuel demand is faltering in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures slipped as much as 0.4 percent after the American
Petroleum Institute said inventories rose 2.76 million barrels
last week. An Energy Department report today is forecast to show
supplies of the motor fuel decreased 500,000 barrels.  Crude for October delivery dropped as much as 40 cents to
$89.81 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $89.96 at 8:57 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday advanced $2.02 to $90.21, the highest close
since Aug. 3. Prices are 17 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement declined 36 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $111.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe Exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contract’s
premium to U.S. futures narrowed for a second day, settling at
$21.67 compared with a record close of $26.87 on Sept. 6.  U.S. crude supplies fell 5.05 million barrels last week,
the  American Petroleum Institute  said. The Energy Department
report may say they declined 3 million barrels, according to the
median of 14 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
