Australian properties listed for
sale fell 3.8 percent in August from the previous month,
according to data from  SQM Research Pty.   Homes listed for sale fell to 362,793 in August from
377,315 in July, the Sydney-based research group said in an e-
mailed statement. Listings jumped 23.6 percent in August from a
year ago.  The decline from July “could be a seasonal effect and it
also could be vendors withdrawing their properties on the hope
of re-listing during better market conditions,” SQM Managing
Director Louis Christopher said in the statement. “Our base
case here is that listings will rise during the spring selling
season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
