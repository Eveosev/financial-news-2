Boise State University ’s athletic
department has been placed on three years’ probation, fined
$5,000 and had scholarships and recruiting visits reduced for
multiple teams, the  National Collegiate Athletic Association 
said in a statement.  The football team was cited for recruiting, impermissible
housing and transportation violations during the summers of 2005
through 2009 involving 63 prospective student-athletes, the NCAA
said. The team will lose three scholarships through the 2013-
2014 academic year.  In tennis, the university’s former coach provided
prospective student-athletes impermissible cash payments,
educational expenses, entertainment and lodging. The coach also
allowed one student-athlete to compete a year beyond her
eligibility, the governing body said. The NCAA also noted that
the athletic department overlooked the early arrival of
international students who weren’t academically qualified to
enroll at the school.  “The university failed to provide adequate rules education
and training to staff members to ensure compliance,” the NCAA
said in a statement.  Penalties  The NCAA imposed the following penalties:  -- Public reprimand and censure.  -- Three years of probation from Sept. 13, 2011, through
Sept. 12, 2014.  -- A one-year ban on postseason play following the 2011-12
women’s tennis season.  -- Reduction of football scholarships from 85 to 82 for the
2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 academic years.  -- Four-year show-cause order for the former women’s tennis
head coach from Sept. 13, 2011, through Sept. 12, 2015.  -- Two-year show-cause order for the former assistant track
coach.  -- Reduction of men’s and women’s track and field
scholarships by 1.5 equivalencies from the average annual amount
awarded the past four years during the 2011-12 and 2012-13
academic years (self-imposed by the university).  -- Reduction of women’s tennis scholarships from eight to
five during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 academic years (self-imposed
by the university).  -- Reduction in practice opportunities for football, men’s
tennis and women’s tennis (men’s and women’s tennis self-imposed
by the university).  Other Violations  -- Reduction of official recruiting visits for men’s
tennis, men’s track and field and cross country, and women’s
track and field and cross country (self-imposed by the
university).  -- Reduction in number of recruiters permitted to recruit
off-campus for six months during the 2011-12 and 2012-13
academic years for men’s and women’s track and field and cross
country (self-imposed by the university).  -- Two-year prohibition in the recruitment of international
prospective student-athletes for men’s and women’s cross country
and track and field and women’s tennis (men’s and women’s cross
country and track and field self-imposed by the university).  -- The institution must pay a $5,000 penalty as a result of
a student-athlete’s ineligible participation (self-imposed by
the university).  -- Vacation of all wins in which a particular women’s
