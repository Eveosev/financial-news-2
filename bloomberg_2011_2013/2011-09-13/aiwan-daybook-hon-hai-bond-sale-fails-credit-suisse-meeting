Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , the
world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronics, failed to
sell NT$6 billion of corporate bonds, according to four people
with knowledge of the matter.  Bids for the five-year unsecured notes didn’t reach the
company’s own expectations, the people said.  Edmund Ding ,
spokesman for Taipei-based Hon Hai, didn’t answer two calls to
his mobile phones today.  Credit Suisse and the Taiwan Stock exchange are co-hosting
an Asian Technology Conference in Taipei from Sept. 14 to 16.
Companies attending include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., MediaTek Inc. and AU Optronics Corp.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
