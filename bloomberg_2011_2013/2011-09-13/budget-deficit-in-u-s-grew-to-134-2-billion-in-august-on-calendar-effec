The U.S. government’s budget
deficit widened in August, primarily reflecting a calendar-
related jump in spending compared with the same month last year.  The gap climbed to $134.2 billion last month, exceeding the
August 2010 shortfall of $90.5 billion, according to the
Treasury Department’s monthly budget statement issued in
Washington. For the fiscal year to date, the deficit increased
to $1.23 trillion, less than at the same point in 2010.  Improved income-tax collections and efforts to cut spending
signal the deficit will stop climbing, according to government
and Wall Street analysts. The drive to limit debt prompted
President Obama to send a $447 billion job-growth package to
Congress this week that he stressed would be paid for with
offsetting reductions in outlays and increases in tax revenue
over the next decade.  “The red ink has maxed out for this recession,” Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in New York, said before today’s report. Just the same,
“austerity is in, and stimulus is out,” Rupkey said.  Congress has assigned a special 12-member panel the task of
finding as much as $1.5 trillion in additional savings under the
terms of the debt-ceiling deal reached in early August. The
committee’s plan is to be submitted to Congress with a vote
before the end of the year.  The White House Office of Management and Budget and the
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office both now estimate the
budget deficit will total $1.3 trillion in the year ending Sept.
30, about $10 billion less than in 2010. The OMB and CBO lowered
estimates for the following fiscal year as well.  Calendar Shift  Regarding the August budget deficit, the CBO projected a
shortfall of $132 billion in a statement issued Sept. 8. The
higher monthly gap came “because Aug. 1, 2010, fell on a
weekend and certain payments ordinarily made on the first of the
month were instead made in July of that year,” the CBO said.
The median forecast of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was also $132 billion.  Spending jumped 19 percent in August from the same month a
year earlier to $303.4 billion, and revenue climbed 3.2 percent
to $169.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  Individual income tax receipts have climbed 23 percent in
the fiscal year to date, and corporate tax receipts decreased
0.2 percent.  The deficit totaled $1.26 trillion at this point last year
and reached $1.29 trillion for all of fiscal 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
