Kenya ’s shilling strengthened as
much as 1.6 percent as traders said the central bank sold
dollars in the foreign-exchange market.  The currency was trading at 94.45 against the dollar at
3:38 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, after earlier strengthening
to as high as 93.95. It closed at 95.48 yesterday. It was the
second time in a week the central bank acted to boost the
shilling, after it sold dollars on Sept. 6.  “The central bank is in the market selling dollars, an
indication that it’s backing up the stand taken by the president
on support for the local currency,” Duncan Kinuthia, a trader at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview. Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of treasury at  Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said the central bank was had made
“enquiries” in the market.  President Mwai Kibaki said last week his government had
asked the International Monetary Fund for an early release of
funds from its Extended Credit Facility to help stabilize the
shilling, Africa’s second-worst performing currency this year
after neighboring Uganda. Kibaki also urged financial regulators
to “deal firmly deal with any speculators” in  currency trading .  Joseph Tirop, head of trading at the Central Bank of Kenya,
declined to comment about the bank sale of dollars in the market
when contacted today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
