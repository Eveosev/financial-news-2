Nissan Motor Co.,  Japan ’s second-
largest automaker, plans to export its Leaf electric car to
 China  for fleet sales, the head of the company’s Chinese venture
said.  The carmaker will be the first to export an electric car to
China, Kimiyasu Nakamura, president of Dongfeng Motor Co., told
reporters today in Yokohama, Japan, where Nissan is based. He
didn’t say when exports will begin.  “If sales numbers of the Leaf go up, we may discuss
producing the Leaf in China,” Nakamura said.  Nissan had sold about 11,000 Leafs globally as of mid-July,
after introducing the car in December, the company said Aug. 2.
The carmaker plans to introduce seven additional electric models
by fiscal 2016 and is targeting sales of 1.5 million electric
vehicles over the next six years along with its French partner,
 Renault SA. (RNO)   Nissan builds the Leaf in Oppama, Japan, and is planning to
add output in  Tennessee  and the U.K. The carmaker may start
producing the Leaf in China after 2013, Chief Operating Officer
Toshiyuki Shiga said in December.  Nissan rose 2.2 percent to 661 yen as of 2:02 p.m. in Tokyo
trading, trimming its loss this year to 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
