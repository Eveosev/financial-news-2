Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
company, forecast full-year earnings growth of as much
as 19 percent after a “promising” summer season in all regions.  Earnings before interest and taxes will be 510 million
euros ($698 million) to 530 million euros in 2011, compared with
446 million euros in 2010, Evry, France-based Accor said in a
statement today. That compares with a 529 million-euro average
estimate of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Accor, the owner of the Motel 6, Ibis and Sofitel brands,
agreed in August to sell its Lenotre catering unit to Sodexo
after completing the disposal of its stake in casino-company
Groupe Lucien Barriere and other assets to focus on its lodging
business. The company is selling hotels and signing agreements
to operate or franchise most of them to cut debt.  Accor said today it plans to dispose of 175 hotels between
2013 and 2015, reducing adjusted net debt by 1 billion euros.
The company has already completed half of its plan to dispose of
450 hotels between 2010 and 2013.  The hotelier will open 35,000 rooms in 2011 and plans to
open 40,000 rooms a year in 2012 and 2013. Accor will meet this
goal through “organic growth and targeted acquisitions” in
Europe, Asia-Pacific and  Latin America , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
