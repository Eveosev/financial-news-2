The Dutch government sees a Greek
default as unavoidable and urges a default in an “orderly
manner,” RTLZ television reported, citing government officials
that were not identified.  Spain and  Italy  could run into difficulties if a Greek
default doesn’t occur in a controlled manner, RTLZ reported.  Simone Boitelle, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
