Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  may apply for a
contract for its Far South East project in the  Philippines ,
Mines and Geosciences Bureau director Leo Jasareno told
reporters in  Manila  today.  Gold Fields, the worldâ€™s fourth-largest producer of the
metal, last month said its Philippine project could contain 15
million ounces to 20 million ounces. A deposit of that size may
be mined over 12 to 14 years, Chief Executive Officer Nick
Holland said on Aug. 11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
