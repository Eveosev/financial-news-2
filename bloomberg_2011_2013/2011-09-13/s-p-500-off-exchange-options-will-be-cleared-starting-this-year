OCC, which clears and settles all
equity options traded on U.S. exchanges, will begin processing
over-the-counter Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index equity derivatives
later this year, according to an executive at the organization.  The Chicago-based clearinghouse will begin clearing
contracts traded between dealers in the fourth quarter, pending
regulatory approval, and those between dealers and clients in
the first three months of next year, Carolyn Mitchell, first
vice president for business development at Chicago-based OCC,
said today at an options conference in  New York . OCC will begin
testing its systems in the coming weeks, she said.  S&P 500 options are currently traded only on the  Chicago
Board Options Exchange , owned by  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  Mitchell
spoke at an equity options conference sponsored by the Futures
Industry Association and Options Industry Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
