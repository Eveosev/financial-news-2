England  forward Courtney Lawes was
banned for two games at the 2011  Rugby World Cup  after being
found guilty of recklessly striking Argentina’s Mario Ledesma
with his knee, tournament organizers said.  Second-rower Lawes appeared before a tournament judicial
hearing in Auckland today, where the minimum suspension for his
offense was reduced from three weeks because of his record,
remorse and the absence of aggravating factors, Rugby  World Cup 
Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement. He’ll miss England’s Pool B
games against Georgia and Romania.  Lawes, 22, was the first player to be cited at the 20-
nation tournament and it came after he collided with Ledesma,
who appeared to have been momentarily knocked out in the first
half of England’s 13-9 victory over the Pumas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
