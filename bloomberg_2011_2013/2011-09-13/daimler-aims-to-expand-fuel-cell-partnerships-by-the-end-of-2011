Daimler AG (DAI) , the worldâ€™s third-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles , is in advanced talks about
expanding its fuel cell partners beyond  Ford Motor Co. (F)  as it
targets widescale production of the technology, development
chief Thomas Weber said today in an interview at the
Internationa Motor Show in Frankfurt.  The Stuttgart, Germany-based maker of Mercedes-Benz
vehicles is in talks with other automakers as well as companies
that would set up a hydrogen fuel station network, Weber said.  Daimler, which introduced a fuel cell-powered concept
vehicle in Frankfurt, plans to produce more than 1,000 B-Class
F-Cell vehicles, which are powered by the chemical reaction that
creates water. The production run will rise to more than 10,000
with a next generation in 2017, Weber said.  Mercedes plans to expand its fuel cell offering with a
sedan below the S-Class by 2017, he said. Daimler and Ford both
own stakes in Automotive Fuel Cell Corp.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
