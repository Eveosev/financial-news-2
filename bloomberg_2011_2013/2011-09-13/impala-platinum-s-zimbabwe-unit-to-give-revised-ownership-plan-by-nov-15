Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s
 Zimbabwe  unit will submit a revised plan to meet the
government’s ownership law by Nov. 15, said  David Brown , the
chief executive officer.  The Johannesburg-based company, the biggest investor in
Zimbabwe’s mining industry, met with Empowerment and
Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere , Brown told reporters
today in Harare, the capital. Zimbabwe wants foreign companies
to sell 51 percent of local assets to black citizens.  “There is a sense of understanding and realization that
Zimplats is a very important company in the country and that
it can play a very important role in the economy moving
forward,” Brown said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
