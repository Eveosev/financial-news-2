Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s biggest
natural-gas producer, is holding talks with PKN Orlen SA on
developing shale gas in Poland, Alan Boras, an Encana spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Encana doesn’t have an agreement with the largest Polish
oil refiner, Boras said, denying a report in Poland’s
Rzeczpospolita newspaper yesterday. “The company’s focus” is
on “operations and opportunities” in  North America , he said.  Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and Talisman Energy Inc.
are among companies that bought about 100 licenses from the
Polish government to explore the possibility of extracting the
estimated 5.2 trillion cubic meters (of gas in shale rock
formation that the country may hold, according to the Energy
Information Administration.  Orlen is working to find a partner to help it develop shale
gas licenses, Beata Karpinska, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
today, declining to give other details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
