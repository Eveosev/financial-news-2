Two advocacy groups asked the
prosecutor for The Hague-based  International Criminal Court  to
investigate “high-level” Catholic Church officials for alleged
crimes against humanity related to sexual abuse.  “The detailed complaint will assert a systematic and
widespread practice of concealing rape throughout the world,
tolerated and enabled by the Vatican,” according to a statement
from Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests and the Center
for Constitutional Rights, which was posted today on the website
of a member of the SNAP network.  The Vatican has said that between 2001 and 2009 there were
3,000 accusations of sexual wrongdoing by clergymen, of which 60
percent could be categorized as “same-sex,” while 30 percent
were heterosexual. The remaining 10 percent concerned serious
claims of abuse of minors. Priests in the U.S. represented 80
percent of those currently under investigation by the church.  The Vatican press office declined to comment on the
advocacy groups’ request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
