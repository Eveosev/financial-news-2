A glut of supertankers seeking to
load crude from Persian Gulf ports and terminals stayed near an
11-month high as the fleet of ships competing for business
expands and oil-demand growth slows.  There are 24 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, available for hire over the next 30 days than there are
cargoes, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of five shipbrokers and one shipowner today. That’s 1
percentage point less than a week ago, when the excess expanded
to the highest since Oct. 5, 2010.  The number of VLCCs, which can ship 2 million-barrel
cargoes of crude oil, in service worldwide expanded 3.6 percent
to 550 vessels this year, according to data from IHS Fairplay.
Global oil demand will expand 1.2 percent to 89.3 million
barrels a day this year, the  International Energy Agency 
forecast today, cutting a previous forecast.  “Even if all the remaining September cargoes get covered
today, it’s not likely to shake things up as there are plenty of
ships around,” Marex Spectron, a Singapore-based freight
derivatives broker, wrote in an e-mailed report, adding that
holidays in  Asia  meant there were no vessel bookings yesterday.  Owners are contributing an average of $9,285 a day toward
fuel costs to ship Persian Gulf oil to the U.S. and Asia,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. Sometimes they will
do this because it’s a cheaper way of moving vessels to new
markets than sailing empty. The bourse’s earnings estimates
don’t reflect speed alterations that can cut fuel consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
