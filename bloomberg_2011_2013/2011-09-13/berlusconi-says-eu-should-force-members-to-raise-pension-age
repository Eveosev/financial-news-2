Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said the European Union should force its members to
raise the  retirement age , saying it would help governments pass
an unpopular measure.  “If  Europe  decided to provide an indication on the
retirement age, all the member governments would be happy to
raise” it, Berlusconi said today at a joint news conference in
Brussels with EU President  Herman Van Rompuy .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
