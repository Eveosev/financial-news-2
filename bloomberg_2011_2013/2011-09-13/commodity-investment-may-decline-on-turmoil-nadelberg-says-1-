Investment in commodities may be
reduced by turmoil in financial markets, Eric Nadelberg, senior
vice-president of investments at Jeffries Bache LLC, said today
at a conference in Antwerp,  Belgium .  Long-only commodity funds do not generate price bubbles, he
said. Long positions are bets on higher prices. Jeffries Group
Inc. completed its acquisition of Prudential Bache in July, the
Jeffries website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
