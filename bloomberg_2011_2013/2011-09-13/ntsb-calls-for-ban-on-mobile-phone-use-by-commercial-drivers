The U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, concluding its investigation of a crash that left
11 people dead last year, recommended banning the use of mobile
phones by commercial drivers except in emergencies.  The NTSB, in a statement today, cited its finding that the
2010 crash was probably caused by a tractor-trailer driver
becoming distracted while using a mobile phone. The truck
crossed a median on Interstate 65 near Munfordville,  Kentucky ,
striking a 15-passenger van carrying 12 family members from a
wedding.  “Distracted driving is becoming increasingly prevalent,
exacerbating the danger we encounter daily on our roadways,”
NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. “It can be
especially lethal when the distracted driver is at the wheel of
a vehicle that weighs 40 tons and travels at highway speeds.”  The U.S. Transportation Department proposed banning the use
of hand-held phones by truck and bus drivers in December, while
permitting hands-free models. The NTSB recommends safety
improvements for U.S. agencies to act upon; it cannot implement
them itself.  In the proposed regulations, which haven’t yet gone into
effect, commercial-vehicle drivers would face fines of us much
as $2,750 and loss of their licenses. Companies would face
penalties of as much as $11,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
