Yukinori Oishi,  Japan ’s No. 2-
ranked analyst for small companies last year, is starting an
asset management business that bets on Japan’s small- and mid-
cap growth stocks.  Indigo Blue Asset Management registered its business with
the nation’s Kanto regional bureau of the Ministry of Finance,
according to Oishi, formerly of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. The company  aims to increase its assets under
management to 3 billion yen ($39 million) in the first year and
10 billion yen by the following year, he said. Oishi was Japan’s
second-ranked small company stocks analyst in 2010 by
 Institutional Investor  magazine.  “We’re aiming positive return through active investment in
small- and mid-cap growth stocks,” said Oishi in an interview
today.  The  asset management company , established on July 1, is a
subsidiary of  Indigo Blue Co. , a management consulting and human
resource development company. Oishi said he left Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley, the brokerage unit of Japan’s biggest lender, in
June. A spokesman for Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, who would
not give his name, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
