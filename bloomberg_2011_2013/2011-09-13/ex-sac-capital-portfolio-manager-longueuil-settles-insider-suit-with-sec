Donald Longueuil, a former junior
portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors LP, agreed to settle a
civil suit filed by the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission .  Longueuil was sentenced to 30 months in prison in July
after pleading guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and
securities fraud in a case that also included former SAC
portfolio manager Noah Freeman, Samir Barai, founder of Barai
Capital Management, and Jason Pflaum, an analyst who worked for
Barai.  All four men pleaded guilty in a U.S. investigation
targeting insider trading at hedge funds. The settlement, filed
in U.S. District Court in  Manhattan  today, says that Longueuil
is cooperating with the SECâ€™s investigation.  Longueuil agreed to pay the SEC $353,000 in the settlement.
The agreement gives him credit for the larger amount,
$1.25 million, that he is required to forfeit to the government
as part of the criminal conviction.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Longoria,
11-CV-753, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
