Japan  is holding a group of nine
potential defectors from North Korea and is weighing a response
to their request for assistance after finding them off Japan’s
west coast this morning.  The three men, three women and three children said they had
sailed from North Korea and asked to be rescued, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters in Tokyo today. Japan’s
Coast Guard located their 8-meter (26 feet) wooden boat off of
Ishikawa prefecture after reports from Japanese fisherman, he
said.  Japan’s government will “make an appropriate decision
based on past examples,” Fujimura said.  The group hopes to defect to  South Korea , Kyodo News
reported today, citing an unidentified coast guard official. The
leader of the group identified himself as a member of the North
Korean military and the others are relatives, Kyodo said.  Impoverished  North Korea , led by reclusive dictator Kim
Jong Il, has relied on international food aid since the
mid-1990s, when an estimated 2 million people died from famine.
Hundreds of people were left dead or missing in North Korea this
summer after heavy rain and flooding that damaged farmland, the
country’s official Korean Central News Agency said in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
