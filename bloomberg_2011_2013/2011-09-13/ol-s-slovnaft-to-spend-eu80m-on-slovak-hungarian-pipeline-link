Mol Nyrt.’s Slovak unit plans to
spend 80 million euros ($109 million) to upgrade an oil pipeline
link between Slovakia and  Hungary .  The upgrade will allow Mol’s  Slovnaft AS (SLOVN)  to process oil
flowing from the Adria pipeline and reduce Slovakia’s dependence
on Russian crude being transported through the Druzhba pipeline
system, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based refiner said in an e-
mailed statement today.  After the upgrade, as much as 6 million tons of crude could
be transported through the link annually, fully matching
Slovnaft’s processing capacity, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
