Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  sold $4.6
billion of bonds with yields hovering at about record lows to
help pay for the proposed acquisition of Autonomy Corp.  The world’s largest maker of personal computers sold the
debt in five parts with maturities from three to 30 years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Palo Alto-based
company extended a deadline for search-software company
Autonomy’s shareholders to agree to the sale, Hewlett-Packard
said today in a regulatory filing.  Sales of corporate bonds are rebounding, after falling in
August to the lowest since May 2010, as investors gain
confidence that companies can survive a slowing U.S. economy and
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis. Yields on investment-grade
corporate debt averaged 3.7 percent yesterday and touched 3.45
percent, the lowest in data extending to October 1986, on Aug.
4, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index.  The company sold $350 million of three-year floating-rate
securities that pay 155 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show.  The PC maker also issued $750 million of 2.35 percent
fixed-rate notes due in three-and-a-half years that yield 200
basis points more than similar maturity Treasuries, $1.3 billion
of 3 percent, five-year debt that pays a 215 basis-point spread,
$1 billion of 4.375 percent, 10-year notes that priced to yield
240 basis points more than the benchmark and $1.2 billion of 6
percent, 30-year bonds that pay a spread of 270 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Hewlett-Packard last sold bonds on May 25, when it issued
$5 billion of notes in its largest-ever debt offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
