Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. in Taipei.  The Taiex Index fell 219.20 points, or 2.9 percent, to
7,391.37, the biggest drop since Aug. 19. Taiwan’s stock market
was closed for a holiday yesterday, when the MSCI  Asia  Pacific
Index dropped 2.3 percent.  Financial shares: Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. (2891
TT) slumped 7 percent to NT$19.35. Fubon Financial Holding Co.
(2881 TT) slid 6.9 percent to NT$36.50 and Shin Kong Financial
Holding Co. (2888 TT) sank 5.9 percent to NT$9.03.  The stocks slumped because “investors are worried” about
how much Greek debt Taiwanese banks own, Diana Wu, vice-
president at Capital Securities Co. wrote in an e-mail. The
chance of a default by  Greece  in the next five years has soared
to 98 percent as Prime Minister  George Papandreou  fails to
reassure international investors that his country can survive
the euro-region crisis, credit default swaps showed.  Foxconn Technology Co.(2354 TT), the computer-case maker,
tumbled 6.4 percent to NT$103 after August sales dropped 52
percent from a year earlier.  Hiwin Technologies Corp. (2049)  (2049 TT) dropped 6.6 percent to
NT$271. The ball-bearing maker was rated “hold” in new
coverage at Citigroup Inc., which said a demand slowdown from
machine tool makers is likely to hurt Hiwin in the first three
months of next year.  The surge in the stock price in the past year “limits the
head-room for further appreciation,” the brokerage also said.
The shares have jumped 265 percent the past 12 months.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) lost 4.9 percent to NT$770, halting
four days of gains. Asia’s second-largest smartphone maker was
lowered to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. by equity analyst Alvin Kwock. The brokerage has a share-
price estimate of NT$800.  Taiwan Cement Corp. (1101)  (1101 TT) retreated 6.9 percent to
NT$34.90, the lowest close since March 28. Taiwan’s largest
maker of the construction material was cut to “hold” from
“buy” at Yvonne Tsai, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. The
brokerage has a 12-month share-price estimate of NT$37.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
