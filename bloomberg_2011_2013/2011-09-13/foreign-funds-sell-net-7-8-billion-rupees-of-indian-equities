Overseas investors sold a net 7.8
billion rupees ($166 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
reducing their investment in equities this year to 19.1 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 16.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
24.2 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold a net 5.41 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their flows into debt this year to 194 billion rupees.  The BSE India Sensitive Index has dropped the most in  Asia 
this year on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt
crisis may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.
Overseas funds withdrew a net $2.1 billion from Indian stocks in
August, the most since October 2008, according to data from the
nation’s regulator. That caused the Sensex to decline 8.4
percent last month, making the gauge’s worst August in at least
a decade, according to Bloomberg data.  India ’s $1.3 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign funds have placed 4.49 trillion rupees in stocks
and 980.7 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
