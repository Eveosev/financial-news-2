Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  is working on
a proposal that would allow it to refinance the loan it used to
buy a stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  as a 10-year project finance
facility,  El Confidencial  reported, citing people it didn’t name
on Sacyr’s board.  Sacyr aims for Repsol to increase its dividend by 10
percent a year during the next 10 years, helping the builder
refinance the almost 5 billion euro ($6.8 billion) loan it got
to buy a 20 percent stake in the Spanish oil company, the
financial news website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
