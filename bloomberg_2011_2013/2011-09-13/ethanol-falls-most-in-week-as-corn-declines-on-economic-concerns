Ethanol futures fell the most in a
week in Chicago as corn slid on concern that Europe’s economic
crisis will limit demand for commodities.  Futures dropped to a four-week low after German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said an “uncontrolled insolvency” would hurt
markets that are wary of a Greek default. Ethanol is made from
corn in the U.S.  “There’s not much going on” to make prices gain, said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
Iowa. “We still have that tie to corn. We can’t shake that
market, yet.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery dropped 4.6 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.735 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since Aug. 10. Futures have gained 15
percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast at $3.01,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  lost 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.81
a gallon and in  New York  the additive slid 2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.93.  Corn for December delivery decreased 22.5 cents, or 3
percent, to $7.23 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
