Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, said it’s considering building
what it says will be the first gas-to-liquids plant in the U.S.  The Johannesburg-based company may build either a 2 million
metric ton per year or 4 million ton plant at Calcasieu Parish,
 Louisiana , it said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We believe Sasol’s proprietary GTL technology can help
unlock the potential of Louisiana’s clean and abundant natural-
gas resources,” Sasol said. The feasibility study will take
about 18 months to complete, it said.  Sasol, which uses proprietary technology to make  jet
fuel , gasoline and diesel, is shifting production away from
South African coal to natural gas overseas to help counter the
effect of a strengthening local currency and as carbon-emissions
rules make coal less attractive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
