Malaysia’s ringgit fell to a two-
month low on speculation  Europe ’s debt-market turmoil will sap
the global economic recovery and prompt policy makers to halt
monetary policy tightening.  The currency slid 2.9 percent in seven straight days on
concern a default by  Greece  will temper demand for emerging-
market assets. The one-year interest-rate swap declined
yesterday to the lowest level in 2011 after  Bank Negara Malaysia 
kept its policy rate on hold last week, citing the possible
fallout from the slowdown in the world economy. Bonds dropped.  “The Europe situation remains unresolved and people are
avoiding risk because of the potential domino effect,” said Nik M. Khairul, a treasury dealer at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur. “There’s little room for central banks to tighten
for the rest of this year given the slowdown signs.”  The ringgit fell 0.6 percent to 3.0555 per dollar as of
4:20 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has lost 4.2 percent since hitting a 14-
year high of 2.9335 on July 27, trimming its advance this year
to 0.3 percent.  The one-year onshore swap rate, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, fell to 3.14 percent yesterday after
 Bank Negara  kept its overnight policy rate unchanged at 3
percent on Sept. 8. Swaps have dropped 36 basis points, or 0.36
percentage point, this quarter. The central bank holds its final
scheduled meeting of this year on Nov. 11.  Malaysia’s five-year government bonds fell, lifting yields
from a 10-month low. The rate on the 4.262 percent notes due
September 2016 increased four basis points to 3.25 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  The treasury will sell 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of
Shariah-compliant notes maturing in November 2016 tomorrow in
the first of two debt sales scheduled for this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
