European Union rules that require a
separation of the ownership of electricity generation from
transmission hold back investments in renewable energy by
institutional investors,  Allianz SE (ALV)  finance head  Paul Achleitner 
said.  Institutional investors need to invest in both power grids
as well as wind and solar parks to better diversify their risks
and use their capital in the best possible way, Achleitner wrote
in an opinion piece in  Germany ’s Handelsblatt newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
