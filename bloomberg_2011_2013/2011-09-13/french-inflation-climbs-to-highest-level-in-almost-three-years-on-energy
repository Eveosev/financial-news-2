French inflation accelerated to the
highest in almost three years in August as the end of summer
sales boosted prices of manufactured goods and the cost of
energy jumped.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent in July,
national statistics office Insee said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the highest since October 2008. Economists
expected a 2.2 percent gain, the median of seven estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  “This is more of a catching up story than a threatening
drift,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in
Paris. “Aggressive seasonal sales in July are the main factor
behind” the increase. Prices rose 0.6 percent in the month.  The  European Central Bank  has raised  interest rates  twice
this year before saying last week that the risk of a recession
outweighs the threat from inflation, giving officials the option
to take further action should the euro-area debt crisis worsen.  The monthly increase in inflation in the region’s second-
largest economy “comes essentially from the growth in
manufactured products at the end of seasonal sales,” Insee
said. “Energy prices are also higher, both because of an
electricity-price increase and a slight gain in oil products.”  The price of manufactured goods climbed 1.6 percent in
August from July, with shoes and clothes advancing 9.8 percent.
Energy prices gained 0.4 percent in the month, while food prices
fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
