At least seven people died and 214
were injured in Buenos Aires early today when a train crashed
into a bus and then veered off the tracks to collide with
another train.  Video shot by a city government security camera showed the
train hitting a bus that had passed a half-closed level crossing
barrier and then careering into a second train that was stopped
at an adjacent  railway station .  Police spokesman Fernando Sostre said seven people had died
in the accident, which occurred at 6:15 a.m. local time (5:15
a.m. New York time) in the cityâ€™s Flores neighborhood. TV
channels Todo Noticias and C5N put the death toll at nine,
without specifying where they obtained the information.  Rescue workers recovered corpses and sent 214 people to
local hospitals, according to a statement by the city
government.  Television footage showed helicopters lifting wounded from
the wreckage and cranes removing debris.  The trains, belonging to the  Trenes de Buenos Aires SA 
railroad company, were on a commuter line that links the center
of the capital with its western suburbs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
