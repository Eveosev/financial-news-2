J&F Participacoes SA, which
controls Brazilian beef producer  JBS SA (JBSS3) , will buy all of lender
Banco Matone SA, more than the purchase of a 60 percent stake
announced in March,  Valor Economico  reported.  J&F will inject 1.85 billion reais ($1.1 billion) into Rio
de Janeiro-based Banco Matone to increase its capital, the
newspaper said, citing Emerson Loureiro, chief executive officer
of J&F’s Banco JBS SA banking unit.  The holding company will get a loan from  Brazil ’s
government-run bank deposits insurance fund, known as FGC, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  A spokesman for J&F didn’t immediately return a call from
Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
