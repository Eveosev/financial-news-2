Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d. wrote
down assets exposed to  Greece  and other smaller euro-region
countries on concern the European Union’s most indebted country
will default on its debt in the next five years.  “We have already wrote down assets that are exposed to
Greece as the likelihood of default increases,” Executive
Finance Director Uros Ivanc said in a Webcast via the Ljubljana
stock exchange today. “The value of our exposure to bonds and
other assets of Greece,  Portugal , Ireland and other peripheral
countries is less than 100 million euros ($137 million).”  Greece has a 98 percent chance of defaulting on its debt in
the next five years, according to credit default swaps tracked
by CMA. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she won’t let
Greece go into “uncontrolled insolvency” as politicians try to
limit the contagion to other euro members and Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  fails to reassure investors his
country can survive the debt crisis.  The Slovenian insurer, in which the government has an
indirect majority, is recovering from the 2009 recession in
Slovenia and heavy flooding last year. The company, which
operates units throughout the Balkans, aims for a profit of 54
million euros this year after net income surged 90 percent in
the first six months, Ivanc said.  The threat to profit guidance comes from possible spill-
over effects from the debt crisis in  Europe , Ivanc said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
