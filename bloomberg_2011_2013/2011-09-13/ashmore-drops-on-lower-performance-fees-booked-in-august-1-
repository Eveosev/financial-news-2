Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) , a U.K. fund
manager focusing on emerging markets, declined in London trading
after performance fees fell 57 percent.  The stock dropped 3.7 percent to 385 pence a share, giving
the company a market value of 2.73 billion pounds ($4.3
billion). The annual fees for funds booked at end of August
dropped to 18.8 million pounds from 43.5 million pounds a year-
earlier, the London-based firm said today in a statement.  “This number is a little disappointing albeit not
unexpected given the degree of market dislocation prevailing
throughout August,” Mark Williamson, a London-based analyst at
Peel Hunt with a “buy” rating on Ashmore, wrote in a note to
clients today.  Ashmore, which has almost half its assets invested in
emerging-market debt, has risen 13 percent in London trading
this year even though inflation has slowed growth in developing
economies such as China and  Argentina . Ashmore’s flagship
Emerging Markets Liquid Investment Portfolio fund, with $4.2
billion of assets, is up 9.9 percent this year beating 98
percent of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income climbed to 189 million pounds in the 12 months
to June 30, from 160 million pounds a year earlier, the company
said. That beat the 180 million-pound estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This was broadly a good year for the group, with strong
growth in assets under management from both out-performance and
net subscriptions,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Coombs said in
the statement.  Ashmore will pay a second-half dividend of 10.34 pence a
share, bringing the year’s payout to 14.5 pence a share. The
firm paid 13 pence a share in the year to June 30, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
