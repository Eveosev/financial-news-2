Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said that the U.S. is “redoubling efforts” to get Israeli and
Palestinian leaders back to negotiations in advance of a vote at
the  United Nations  on recognizing a Palestinian state.  Clinton criticized the move by Palestinians to seek
recognition from the world body as counterproductive. “It will
create more distractions toward achieving that goal,” of a two-
state solution, Clinton said. “We have to keep our eye on what
the objective truly is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
