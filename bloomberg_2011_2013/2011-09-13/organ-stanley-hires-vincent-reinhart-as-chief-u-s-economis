Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the
world’s biggest brokerage, hired former Federal Reserve senior
staffer  Vincent Reinhart  as chief U.S. economist.  Reinhart was previously a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, New York-based Morgan
Stanley said today in a statement. His positions at the Fed from
1990 to 2007 included secretary and economist of the Federal
Open Market Committee, according to the statement. He was the
Fed’s chief monetary-policy strategist from 2001 until 2007.  Reinhart’s team will include David Greenlaw, U.S. fixed-
income economist and managing director at Morgan Stanley, the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, according to the statement.
Reinhart, who will be based in New York, is scheduled to start
on Oct. 1.  “Vincent has been an important voice in global economic
debates for years,” Ted Pick, global head of equities at Morgan
Stanley, said in the statement. “He complements a talented
global team of economists and strategists at the firm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
