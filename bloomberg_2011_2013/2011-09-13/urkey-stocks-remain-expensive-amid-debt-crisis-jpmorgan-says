Turkish stocks are expensive and
will only rally when the European sovereign-debt crisis
diminishes, JPMorganCazenove said.  Turkish stocks trade at around 8.5 times their estimated
12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio and investors could
find “a lot of places that are cheaper than  Turkey  in absolute
terms as well as cheaper relative to their own histories,”
wrote JPMorgan analyst David Aserkoff in a report, giving  Russia 
and Poland as cheaper examples.  Investors in Turkey should move into banks, which may
“surprise on the upside” with earnings upgrades, JPMorgan
said. Top picks are  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s largest
bank by market value, UniCredit SpA Turkish unit Yapi & Kredi
Bankasi AS and state-run Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi AS.  For investors looking to benefit from a rebound in emerging
markets, the nature of the bounce is key, JPMorgan said. A
bounce-back driven by better global growth prospects would favor
Russia, while a recovery stimulated by a pickup in  Europe ’s
financial crisis is more likely to favor Turkey, it said.  Turkey is one of the most-exposed emerging markets to
European exports and “risks to growth are high,” Aserkoff
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
