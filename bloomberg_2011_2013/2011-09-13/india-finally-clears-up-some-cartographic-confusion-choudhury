On Sept. 7, many Indians awoke to find that their country had just become smaller -- by about 40 square kilometers (15.4 square miles). A long-neglected episode of postcolonial cartographic confusion, lasting several decades and affecting the lives of at least 50,000 "stateless citizens" of  India  and its eastern neighbor Bangladesh, had at long last been resolved by the prime ministers of the two countries. For several decades, India and Bangladesh had shared not only a fairly porous 4,156 kilometer-long (2,582 miles) border stretching across forests, rivers, marshes and fields, but also, remarkably, borders within each other's territories in the form of little pockets of land called "enclaves." These neighborhoods (locally called "chitmahals") were, in the 18th and 19th centuries, part of princely states in the region previously known as  Cooch Behar . When south Asia was parceled into nations in 1946-1947, the states were assimilated by India and what was then East  Pakistan , leaving behind little dribbles and specks of their holdings on either side of the newly drawn border. For decades, the inhabitants of the chitmahals, which range in size from entire villages to small hamlets of a few dozen people, lived in a surreal world of two nations and no state. They sometimes transgressed a national border when they crossed the road or visited a neighbor, but were unable to access education and health care because they were ringed on all sides by a country that wasn't theirs, even as their own nation was helpless to reach them. The  new pact between the countries , signed in Dhaka by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of  Bangladesh , grants Indian citizenship to the residents of Bangladeshi enclaves in India and Bangladeshi citizenship to the inhabitants of Indian enclaves in Bangladesh. This rationalization of territorial seepage meant that India acquired about 30 square kilometers of new land and ceded about 70 square kilometers. This led to  protests  about the overall loss of territory, as if these things were purely mathematical matters independent of human dilemmas. It also meant that the entire border between the countries, the fifth-longest in the world, was now demarcated to the satisfaction of both parties. India Today  reported : The  plight of the residents of the enclaves , and the arbitrariness and perversity of the categories of citizenship and nationhood that defined their lives, were acutely captured by Madhuparna Das of the Indian Express. Journeying to the Bangladeshi enclave of Mashaldanga the day before the accord was signed,  Das reported : And in a longer essay over the weekend called " Two Nations, New Citizens ," Das offered more stories of the difficulties faced by the inhabitants of Mashaldanga: Earlier this year, the Economist's blog on  Asia , Banyan, had an excellent post called " The Land That Maps Forgot ": And, taking stock of what India stood to gain from the resolution of these disputes, the writer of the post continued: The agreement over the exchange of enclaves was among  a list of measures  -- including the cutting of duties on many Bangladeshi imports into India, especially textiles -- that were approved at the Dhaka meeting. If there was one black mark on the negotiations, though, it was the failure of the two countries to reach an understanding on  the sharing of the waters  of the Teesta River, long a subject of dispute. That, in turn could have opened up other mutually advantageous connections, such as the formation of a  transit corridor  across Bangladesh that would allow India better  access  to the remote and economically backward states of its northeastern region. These are connected to the rest of the country only through a narrow channel of land called the Siliguri corridor, which snakes between Nepal and Bangladesh, and is no more than 40 kilometers wide. Taking stock of the negotiations in the Deccan Chronicle,  Srinath Raghavan remarked : There clearly is plenty of room for further engagement and economic cooperation between the countries, which for four decades have done little to leverage this potential. For the moment, though, the belated application of the spirit of justice to the quirks of history means that at least the inhabitants of the chitmahals can heave a sigh of relief, and look forward to a more settled life in their old neighborhoods and new countries.
