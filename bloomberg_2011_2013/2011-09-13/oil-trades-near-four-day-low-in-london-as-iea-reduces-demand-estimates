Oil rose for a second day in  New
York  before data forecast to show that crude supplies declined a
second week in the U.S., the largest consumer of the commodity.  The U.S. Energy Department may say tomorrow U.S. crude
supplies dropped by 3 million barrels last week as a result of
storms in the  Gulf of Mexico , according to a Bloomberg survey.
Oil extended its advance in New York as the dollar reversed
gains and U.S. stock index futures pared their declines. Brent
pared earlier gains in  London  after the  International Energy
Agency , an adviser on  energy policy  to 28 nations, reduced its
estimate of 2012 global oil demand by 400,000 barrels a day.  “This is a market that’s been tightening for the past 12
to 15 months,”  David Fyfe , head of the IEA’s industry and
markets division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
“This year the tightening has been more about supply outages
than demand.”  Crude for October delivery advanced as much as $1.74, or 2
percent, to $89.93 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract traded for $89.77 at 1:48
p.m. London time. Prices have risen 16 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement was up 39 cents at $112.64
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange after
gaining as much as $1, or 0.9 percent, to $113.25 a barrel.
Yesterday Brent fell to $110.42, the lowest since Sept. 6.  Brent Backwardation  The European benchmark contract closed at a premium of
$24.06 to U.S. futures yesterday, the smallest since Aug. 23 and
down from a record close of $26.87 on Sept. 6. The spread is at
$22.87 a barrel today.  The October Brent contract was at a premium of $2.25 a
barrel to the November future, the most since June 15. This
market structure, where prompt supplies are more expensive than
later deliveries, is known as backwardation and signals demand
for near-term supplies is greater than for future shipments.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said that  Greece  is taking
the right steps to get its next bailout payment, warning against
allowing a Greek default because of the risk of contagion for
other euro-area countries.  The Paris-based IEA said that demand worldwide will rise by
1.2 percent to 89.3 million barrels a day this year, and by 1.6
percent to 90.7 million in 2012. The full resumption of exports
from  Libya  will be “long and difficult,” it said.  The Energy Department report may show U.S. crude
inventories slid 3 million barrels last week, according to the
median of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Gasoline supplies probably fell 500,000 barrels, the survey
shows. The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
report its own data today.  Output in the Gulf of Mexico, which accounts for 27 percent
of U.S. supply, was cut 61 percent last week after Tropical
Storm Lee shut production platforms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
