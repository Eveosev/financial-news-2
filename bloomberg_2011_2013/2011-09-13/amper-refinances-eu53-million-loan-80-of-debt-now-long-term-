Amper SA (AMP) , a Spanish maker of
communications equipment, refinanced a syndicated loan for 53
million euros ($72.5 million), extending the average term of its
debt.  The company, based in Madrid, said in a filing yesterday
that the portion of debt due in the “long term” has risen to
80 percent from 16 percent. The company said a total of 29
lenders were involved in the seven-year loan without naming them
or disclosing the terms.  Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Redondo said in April the
company was focusing on breaking even within three years as
sales and earnings from  Latin America  may offset declines in
Amper’s domestic market.  Amper rose 1.2 percent to close at 2.65 euros in  Madrid 
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
