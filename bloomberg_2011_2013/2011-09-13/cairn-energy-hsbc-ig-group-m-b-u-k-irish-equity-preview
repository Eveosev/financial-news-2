The following is a list of

Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses and prices are
from the last market close.  Futures on the benchmark FTSE 100 Index jumped 1.4 percent
at 7:33 a.m. in London. The FTSE 100 dropped 1.6 percent to
5,129.62 yesterday, while the FTSE All-Share Index fell 1.6
percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 2.5 percent.  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  : The oil explorer said it will
plug and abandon the Gamma-1 well offshore Greenland after
failing to find any hydrocarbons. The shares fell 1.9 percent to
312.5 pence.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  : The bank is seeking to sell
its general insurance business for about $1 billion as part of
Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver’s plan to divest some
assets, the London-based Times reported. The shares lost 2.4
percent to 492.35 pence.  IG Group Holdings Plc (IGG)  : The company said first-

million) in the three months ended Aug. 31 from a year earlier,
and climbed 30 percent on a comparable basis. The shares fell

dismissed. That proposal was for 224 pence a share in cash or
