the underlying futures climbed for a second day in  New York  on
speculation a report tomorrow will show stockpiles dropped in
the U.S., the biggest oil-consuming country.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in

gauge of options prices, was 41.6 percent at noon in New York,
down from 43.4 yesterday.  Oil for October delivery rose 81 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$89 a barrel at 12:08 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .

October $90 calls, with 1,177 lots changing hands as of 12:38
p.m. The options gained 16 cents to 95 cents a barrel. October
$95 calls, the next-most active contract, were unchanged at 5
cents a barrel with 900 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  October options expire Sept. 15.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  March $79 puts were the most active options traded in the
