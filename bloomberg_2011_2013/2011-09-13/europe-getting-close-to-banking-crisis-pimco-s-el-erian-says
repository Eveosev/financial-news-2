Mohamed A. El-Erian said organizations such as the International
Monetary Fund need to act now with European banks being at risk
of being engulfed in the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  “We’re getting close to a full-blown banking crisis in
 Europe ,” El-Erian, Pimco’s chief executive officer and co-chief
investment officer, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  BNP Paribas SA, France’s biggest lender, was forced to deny
an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal today that cited an
unidentified official as saying the bank could no longer borrow
in dollars. French banks are in the spotlight because of their
holdings of bonds issued by the euro region’s most-indebted
nations, topping the list of Greek creditors with $56.7 billion
in overall exposure, according to a June report by the  Bank for
International Settlements .  To contact the reporter on this story:
