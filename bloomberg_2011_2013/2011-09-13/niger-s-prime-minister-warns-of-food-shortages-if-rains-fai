Nigerien Prime Minister Brigi Rafini warned the West African country may face food and
livestock shortages in the 2011-12 agricultural season unless
rains arrive.  “The situation is not conducive to optimism,” Rafini said
in remarks broadcast on Tele Sahel, a Niamey-based broadcaster.  Last month, Niger’s government announced a 10 billion CFA
franc ($21 million) irrigation program to produce 400,000 metric
tons of cereals in 2011-12.  A drought from 2009 to 2010 left one in five of the
nation’s children under five years of age malnourished,
according to the  World Food Programme .  To contact the reporter on this story:
