Britain’s 65 to 74 year-old age
group suffered the highest rate of inflation for the fourth
consecutive month in August because gas and electricity prices
accelerated, said the Alliance Trust Research Centre.  Inflation for this age group at 5.4 percent is the fastest
since October 2008, analysts at the Dundee, Scotland-based
 investment company  said in a monthly study of inflation
published today. Alliance Trust Plc is the U.K.’s largest
closed-end fund.  “Gas-price inflation accelerated from 6.4 percent to 8.2
percent and electricity price inflation rose from 4 percent to 5
percent, impacting the older age groups as they spend relatively
more on these areas than the other age groups,” said Alliance
Trust. “The over-75 year-old households also allocate a larger
proportion of their spending to goods and services for routine
household maintenance where inflation increased from 2.1 percent
to 4.6 percent.”  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier in
August, the fastest in three months, compared with 4.4 percent
in July, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
 London . That matched the median estimate of 34 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
