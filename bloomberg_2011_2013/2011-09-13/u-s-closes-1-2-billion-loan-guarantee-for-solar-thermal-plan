Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish  power-
equipment maker, received a $1.2 billion loan guarantee from the
U.S. Energy Department to build a 250-megawatt solar-thermal
power plant in southern  California .  When complete, the Mojave Solar Project in San Bernardino
County will increase the amount of solar-thermal energy capacity
in the U.S. by 50 percent, the department said today in a
statement.  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  will buy its electricity under a 25-year
contract.  Abengoa, a Seville, Spain-based power-equipment maker,
plans to get more than 80 percent of the project’s components
from U.S. suppliers.  Solar-thermal plants use mirrors to focus the sun’s rays on
various liquids and generate steam that drives a turbine and
produces electricity. By storing the heated liquid, solar-
thermal plants can generate power at night, unlike photovoltaic
solar plants  The Mojave Solar guarantee was approved through the same
program that backed a loan to solar panel maker Solyndra LLC,
which has filed for bankruptcy. The Energy Department is working
to close pending loan guarantees under the program before it
ends Sept. 30, Damien LaVera, an agency spokesman, said in an
interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
