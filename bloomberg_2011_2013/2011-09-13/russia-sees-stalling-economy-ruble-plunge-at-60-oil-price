Oil at $60 a barrel may halt
 Russia ’s two-year economic expansion next year, triggering a
“substantial” devaluation of the ruble, the  Economy Ministry 
said, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg.  Gross domestic product may shrink as much as 1.4 percent
next year under a negative scenario that projects a “world
recession” cutting the average price of Urals crude by almost a
half from the current level, according to the report, submitted
to the government for approval last week. The price of Urals,
the nation’s chief export oil blend, has averaged $109.35 this
year and was at $114.23 yesterday.  A reliance on raw materials, which President  Dmitry Medvedev  called “humiliating” and “primitive,” has left the
economy vulnerable to dropping global demand for its commodity
exports. Russia’s sovereign rating, which was last raised by
Moody’s Investors Service in 2008, is exposed to sudden changes
in the price of oil,  Fitch Ratings  and  Standard & Poor’s  said as
they kept the credit grade unchanged in the past two weeks.  Under the government’s base “moderate-optimistic”
forecast, oil will average $108 this year, $100 in 2012 and $97
in 2013, supporting growth of 4.1 percent this year, 3.7 percent
in 2012 and 4 percent in 2013, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said Aug. 27. The ministry previously expected growth of
4.2 percent, 3.5 percent and 4.2 percent.  Svetlana Glikman, a spokeswoman for Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina , confirmed that the document was last week submitted
to the government’s budget committee chaired by Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, where it was discussed last night.  ‘Patient on a Drip’  The  U.S. economy  is “resembling a patient on a drip” and
a default by a European Union member will create “systemic
risks,” leading to the “next profound crisis,” Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said in St. Petersburg Sept. 10.  Kudrin estimates the chances of “a second wave” of the
global economic crisis at more than 25 percent.  Russia, the world’s biggest crude producer and largest
energy exporter, needs higher  oil prices  than  Saudi Arabia  to
balance its budget, Deutsche Bank AG estimated in June. Economic
growth is lagging behind emerging-market rivals Brazil,  India 
and  China .  The country’s reliance on oil and natural gas means it
doesn’t belong among the so-called BRIC nations, Nobel economics
laureate  Paul Krugman  said in an interview last week.  ‘Petro-Economy’  “Russia really doesn’t belong in the group, it’s a petro-
economy in terms of world trade,” Krugman said. “There are a
lot of people and a lot of technical skills and at least
potentially Russia could be a part, but its role in the world
right now is not at all similar to China.”  Oil and gas account for 17 percent of Russia’s GDP compared
with less than 10 percent in  Brazil , and contribute about 40
percent to government revenue.  Urals has gained about 24 percent this year, reaching
$122.88 on April 8, the highest price this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Windfall revenue may allow Russia to
run a balanced budget this year and narrow its deficit to below
1.5 percent in 2012, Putin  said  at a meeting yesterday.  Keeping Pace  Medvedev is targeting annual growth of at least 8 percent
within 5 years to keep pace with the other so-called BRIC
countries. GDP expanded 4 percent in 2010 after a record 7.8
percent contraction the previous year, when Urals averaged about
$61. Russia posted an average growth rate of almost 7 percent
from 1999 to 2008.  The economy expanded 3.4 percent from a year earlier in the
second quarter, compared with 4.1 percent in the previous three
months, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said Aug. 11.  The country’s economic expansion accelerates by about half
a percentage point for every $10 advance in the price of oil,
Klepach estimated last year. The country needs oil to average
more than $60 a barrel this year to ensure a sustained recovery
from its record slump in 2009, Kudrin said in October.  Brent, the oil blend that underpins prices for Russia’s
Urals, may average $114 next year, according to the median
forecast of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It may drop to
$90 next year, Citigroup Inc. predicts, while Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. expect Brent to
trade at $90 in 2012.  After expanding every year since 1998, Russia’s economy
contracted in 2009 after the credit crunch and global slowdown
that followed collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. crimped
demand for commodities, sending Urals to as low as $32.34 a
barrel on Dec. 24, 2008. The decline was a 77 percent drop from
a high of $142.50 in July that year.  The central bank drained more than $200 billion, or about a
third of its international reserves, in the six months through
January 2009 to stem a 35 percent devaluation of the ruble to
the dollar.  Stress tests by the central bank in 2009 showed the
country’s lenders can weather a slump in the price of oil to $25
a barrel if they keep debt at close to 20 percent of their total
liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
