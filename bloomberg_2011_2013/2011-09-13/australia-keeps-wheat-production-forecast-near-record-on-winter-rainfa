Australia  may ship a record amount
of wheat in the coming year, displacing the European Union as
the world’s second-biggest supplier, and helping cap gains in
global prices.  The country may export 20.4 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, the  Australian Bureau of Agricultural  and
Resource Economics and Sciences said today. That’s 1.5 percent
more than predicted on June 15 and 9.4 percent higher than the
previous year, the bureau said. Production was forecast at 26.2
million tons, unchanged from its previous estimate and just
short of the record 26.3 million tons in 2010-2011, it said.  Increased sales would add to global supplies, potentially
curbing prices that surged 19 percent since July 1 when  Russia 
resumed exports after an almost yearlong ban and drought wilted
crops across the Great Plains in the U.S. Global inventories may
total 194.59 million tons by May 31, 3 percent more than
estimated in August, as production in Russia and Canada climbs,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “Consistent monthly winter rainfall of between 25 and 100
millimeters was received across Western Australia’s cropping
regions, which is a stark turnaround from last season’s dry
conditions,” Terry Sheales, acting deputy executive director at
the bureau, said in a statement. “South Australia, Victoria and
southern New South Wales recorded average August rainfall and
crops in these regions look promising.”  Second Place  Wheat exports from the European Union may slump 29 percent
to 16 million tons in 2011-2012, according to USDA data. That
would lift Australia into second place globally behind the U.S.  Wheat for December delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade
gained as much as 0.7 percent to $7.32 a bushel and traded at
$7.29 at 4 p.m. in  Melbourne . Futures slumped 5.9 percent last
week after climbing 11 percent in August.  The area sown to wheat may decline to 14.1 million hectares
(35 million acres) from 14.3 million hectares estimated in June,
the bureau said. Plantings in Western Australia, set to be the
biggest producer, may total 5.1 million hectares, it said.  “Northwest New South Wales and southwest Queensland have
experienced below-average winter rainfall and rain will be
needed soon to achieve average yields,” Sheales said.  Recent dry weather has spurred concerns that lower yields
on the east coast may offset optimism that output in Western
Australia will boost the harvest. The Murray-Darling Basin,
which extends from southern Queensland to  South Australia , had
the  driest  June since 1986, according to the Bureau of
Meteorology. New South Wales, the biggest wheat producer in
2010-2011, had below-average rainfall in July, it said.  ‘Too High’  Analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
National Australia Bank Ltd. and  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
all cut their harvest estimates in August, citing dry conditions
on the east coast. ANZ lowered its forecast again this month.  “Abares wheat production forecast is simply too high,”
 Luke Mathews , a strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
said in an e-mailed report. “In order to achieve Abares
production forecast, seasonal conditions over the next few
months need to be perfect. Perfect conditions rarely occur in
agriculture.”  Wheat production in  Western Australia  may total 9 million
tons in 2011-2012, 3 percent more than the June forecast and
almost double last year’s drought-affected harvest, the bureau
said. The Grain Industry Association of Western Australia said
Aug. 22 output may surge 76 percent to 8.05 million tons.  Cotton Record  Australia’s total winter-crop production, including wheat,
barley and canola, may be 41 million tons in 2011-2012, the
fourth-largest on record, according to the bureau. That compares
with a June forecast of 40.8 million tons, the bureau said. Last
year’s total was estimated at 42 million tons, it said.  Cotton production in Australia, the fourth-largest exporter,
may reach a record 1.1 million tons this year, in line with
June’s forecast, according to the report. Production may have
reached 898,000 tons in 2010-2011, buoyed by rainfall, the
bureau said.  La Nina-linked wet weather brought record rainfall to parts
of eastern Australia last year, ending drought and replenishing
dams used for irrigating cotton, which is planted around
November and mostly harvested from April.  Canola production is expected at 2.29 million tons in 2011-
2012, compared with the 2.27 million tons predicted in June.
Output may reach about 2.5 million tons, the Australian Oilseeds
Federation said Aug. 16.  The bureau raised its forecast for barley production to 8.3
million tons from 8.09 million tons in June and compared with
9.3 million tons in the previous year.  Production of summer crops, planted in the next few months
and harvested next year, may increase to total 4.8 million tons
from 4.7 million in 2010-2011, according to the bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
