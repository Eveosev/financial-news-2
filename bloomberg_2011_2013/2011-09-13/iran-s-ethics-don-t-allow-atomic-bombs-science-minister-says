Iran  won’t develop nuclear weapons
because of its “ethics,” Science and Technology Minister
Nasrin Soltankhah said.  “We are clarifying now as we will clarify in the future
that  Iran’s nuclear program  is exclusively for peaceful
purposes,” Soltankhah said today at a press briefing in Vienna.
“Our ethics prohibit us from pursuing any other directions.”  The  International Atomic Energy Agency  has said it can’t be
certain the program is peaceful, citing inspectors’ concerns
about administrative connections between civilian and military
nuclear researchers and scientists. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei calls nuclear weapons  anti-Islamic  and has forbidden
their development.  Iran, which has been subjected to four rounds of United
Nations Security Council sanctions over its nuclear work, isn’t
providing the “necessary level of cooperation” to resolve
questions about its work, the IAEA said in a  Sept. 2 report .  The UN agency is weighing whether to release more
information detailing inspectors’ concerns about Iran’s nuclear
work, Director General Yukiya Amano said yesterday at a press
conference. The IAEA has been investigating Iran since 2003.  “We are transparent in this regard,” Soltankhah said.
“We have answered and will continue to answer questions from
the IAEA.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
