What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that slower
growth in Europe, the U.S.,  China  and other emerging economies
may restrain demand for food, animal feed and fuel made from the
crop, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Chicago-
based Archer Financial Services Inc., said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture unexpectedly
raised its forecasts for domestic production and global
reserves, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
down 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open $1 to $2 lower for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rising global supplies reduced demand for U.S.
grain, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
