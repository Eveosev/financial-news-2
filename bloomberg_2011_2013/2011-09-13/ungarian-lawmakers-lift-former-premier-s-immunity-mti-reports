Hungarian legislators lifted the
immunity of former Prime Minister  Ferenc Gyurcsany  in a
parliamentary vote late yesterday, opening the way for criminal
proceedings against him, state-run news agency  MTI  reported.  Lawmakers voted 306-52, with only Gyurcsany’s Socialist
Party voting against, according to MTI.  Gyurcsany, who was premier for five years until 2009, is
facing charges for the abuse of power related to a real-estate
transaction to set up a casino, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
