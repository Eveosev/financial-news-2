The world’s bankers are escaping
with as much money as they can, says Ry Cooder on his new CD.  “They robbed the nation blind,” Cooder intones on the
folky opening track, “No Banker Left Behind.” He sneers at
Wall Street bonuses and the champagne lifestyle in a song that
sounds like a Woody Guthrie Dust Bowl ballad.  “Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down” is an old-fashioned
concept  album  about U.S. corruption. Those City types who grew
up loving Cooder’s rootsy rock shouldn’t be surprised. He has
long cast himself on the side of the working man (“Bourgeois
Blues,” “How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?”).  Rhetoric aside, this is a fine recording to file alongside
Cooder’s excellent “Paradise and Lunch” 1974 LP.  Rating: *****.  “Revolution” is  Jon Regen’s  second straight great album.
The jazz pianist, who started a U.S. tour this week, continues
to broaden into pop songwriting.  After my favorable review of Regen’s “Let It Go,” he has
been twittering and messaging asking for my verdict on his
latest, which again has Andy Summers of the Police among the
guests. Don’t worry Jon, it’s good. “She’s Not You (But Tonight
She’ll Have to Do)” has strong hooks and should be a hit.  Rating: ****.  Kanye West  and Jay-Z spent years battling to become the
King of Rap. They now have joined to make “Watch the Throne,”
which they bill as a triumph. In truth, they fail. The CD is a
catalog of all that’s wrong with rap: chest-beating braggadocio,
bombastic beats, foulmouthed bad rhymes.  Rating: *.  If you want to hear rap done with infinitely more style,
check out “We’re New Here.” It’s U.K. producer Jamie ‘xx’
Smith’s remix of “I’m New Here” by performance poet Gil Scott-
Heron, who died in May, and is a fitting homage to the man who
brought us “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.”  Rating: *****.  Seasick Steve is another veteran, thankfully very much in
his prime. The bluesman chose the cover shot of an elderly cross
Labrador-collie because he says it looks like him (true). He
goes on to disprove the title “ You Can’t Teach an Old Dog New
Tricks ,” making some of the most innovative music of his
career. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin joins the party on
“Back in the Doghouse.”  Rating: ***.  Two names to watch from  Canada :  Daniel Isaiah  and  Ron
Sexsmith . Isaiah, from  Montreal , mixes Leonard Cohenesque lyrics
with dizzily ambitious music on “High Twilight.”  Sexsmith has been making music for three decades, gradually
building a following and perfecting his songcraft. Now 47, he
has just about succeeded with the aptly named “Long Player Late
Bloomer.”  Rating for both: ***.  Jamie Woon , 27, is a U.K. singer-songwriter with a much
shorter story. He graduated from the  BRIT School  after  Amy Winehouse , and supported her in concerts. His debut,
“Mirrorwriting,” has a restrained dubstep feel that recalls
 James Blake  and the xx. The soulful voice on “Street” suggests
that he will go far.  Rating: **.  Samuel Beam from  South Carolina , better known as  Iron &
Wine , released “Kiss Each Other Clean” back in January.
Underwhelming at first listen, it’s a grower and with
perspective sounds better than some other 2011 releases: King
Creosote, Gregg Allman and Moby among them.  Rating: ***½.  Cooder is on Nonesuch Records, Regen on CDBaby, Scott-Heron
on XL, Daniel Isaiah on Secret City, Ron Sexsmith on Thirty
Tigers, and Iron & Wine on Warner. Prices from $12. Kanye West
and Jay-Z, on Roc-A-Fella, is also available in a deluxe edition
for $14. Seasick Steve is on Third Man and Jamie Woon is on
Verve, both on import to the U.S. for $20. All are available in
the U.K. for about 9 pounds. Download fees vary across services.  (Mark Beech writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
