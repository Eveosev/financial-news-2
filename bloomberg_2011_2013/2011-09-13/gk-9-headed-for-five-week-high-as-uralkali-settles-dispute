OAO TGK-9 jumped its highest level
in five weeks after OAO Uralkali, the potash producer, agreed to
pay the power generator 499 million rubles ($16 million) to
settle a dispute.  The shares rose 3.8 percent to 0.326 kopeks by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest level since Aug. 3.  The Perm Arbitration Court approved the amicable agreement,
Uralkali said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
