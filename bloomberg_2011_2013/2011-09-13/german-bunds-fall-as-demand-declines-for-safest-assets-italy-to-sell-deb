Italy’s bonds fell, with two-year
yields rising to the highest since before the  European Central
Bank  began buying the nation’s debt last month, as concern the
debt crisis is worsening sapped demand at a note sale today.  Greek two-year notes slid for a 10th day, pushing yields
toward 77 percent, as credit-default swaps showed the nation has
a 98 percent chance of default in the next five years. Italy
sold 3.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of five-year notes at an
average yield of 5.60 percent, up from 4.93 percent at the
previous auction of similar-maturity debt in July. Demand
dropped to 1.28 times the amount on offer, from 1.93 times.  The auction “wasn’t particularly inspiring,” said Eric Wand, a bond strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets based
in  London . “There aren’t many investors out there who are
willing to put their money on the table. Until policy makers
come up with the goods, people are going to continue to shun
peripheral paper.”  Italian two-year note yields rose 14 basis points to 4.65
percent at 4:35 p.m. in London, after climbing to 4.81 percent,
the most since Aug. 5. The 4.25 percent security due in August
2013 fell 0.235, or 2.35 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
99.385. Five-year rates climbed 17 basis points to 5.32 percent,
and 10-year yields gained 13 basis points to 5.70 percent.  Italy had originally planned to sell a maximum of 4 billion
euros of new benchmark five-year notes. It also auctioned 2.6
billion euros of securities due in 2018 and 2020.  ECB Buying  Italian borrowing costs increased even as the ECB bought
the nation’s debt in the secondary market, according to three
people with knowledge of the deals who declined to be identified
because the transactions are confidential. A spokeswoman for the
Frankfurt-based ECB declined to comment on the purchases.  “If the ECB hadn’t intervened, yields would have been a
lot higher” at the auction, Lloyds’ Wand said.  The ECB began buying Spanish and Italian bonds on Aug. 8 to
curb a surge in yields as contagion from the debt crisis that
engulfed  Greece , Ireland and Portugal spread to the two larger
economies. The central bank said yesterday it settled 14 billion
euros of debt purchases last week, up from 13.3 billion euros
the previous week.  Spanish 10-year bond yields added six basis points to 5.38
percent after rising as much as 11 basis points to 5.44 percent,
the highest level since Aug. 8. The nation is scheduled to sell
securities maturing in 2019 and 2020 on Sept. 15.  Rate Outlook  The ECB left  interest rates  at 1.5 percent on Sept. 8,
after increasing its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points on
April 7 and July 7, from a record low 1 percent.  A Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps shows traders
are betting the ECB will lower its benchmark by 24 basis points
during the next 12 months. As recently as Aug. 1, the index
forecast an increase of 25 basis points.  German bunds fell, reversing earlier gains. The yield on
the 10-year security climbed four basis points to 1.78 percent,
after dropping to 1.679 percent, the lowest since the euro was
introduced in 1999. Two-year note yields advanced seven basis
points to 0.50 percent.  Germany  plans to sell 5 billion euros of two-year notes
tomorrow.  Greek two-year yields jumped 718 basis points, or 7.18
percentage points, to a euro-era record 76.73 percent. The yield
has surged more than 19 percentage points since last week, when
it closed at 56.98 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Ten-
year bond yields climbed 109 basis points to 24.63 percent,
after increasing to an all-time high 25.01 percent.  ‘Edge of the Abyss’  Credit-default swaps insuring $10 million of Greek debt for
five years now cost $5.8 million upfront and $100,000 a year, up
from $5.5 million in advance on Sept. 9, according to CMA.  Similar contracts on Belgium, France, Italy,  Portugal  and
 Spain  also rose to records, CMA data show. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  “Greece is absolutely on the edge of the abyss,” said
 John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London.
“No one really knows whether the next tranche of aid is coming.
The market is understandably extremely worried.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Greece is taking the
right steps to get its next bailout payment, warning against
allowing a Greek default because of the risk of contagion for
other euro-area countries.  Merkel, in a German radio interview broadcast today, said
an “uncontrolled insolvency” would further roil markets
spooked by the prospect of a Greek default. The euro region
currently has no system for “orderly” insolvency until the
permanent rescue fund is established in 2013, she said.  German  government bonds  have returned 8.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Italian
government bonds have lost 3.3 percent and Greek bonds have
slumped 38 percent the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
