Nigerian prosecutors charged six
suspected members of a militant Islamic group today with two
bombings earlier this year in the town of Suleja, north of the
capital, Abuja, according to court proceedings.  The accused persons, who prosecutors said were members of
Boko Haram, a group inspired by  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement,
were charged with two counts each of conspiracy and terrorism at
the Abuja Magistrate Court. They pleaded not guilty.  Magistrate Oyeyeola Oyewumi accepted prosecutors’ request
to keep the suspects in custody, saying they could be held “for
up to three weeks” while investigations continue. She set
hearing for Oct. 4.  Authorities in  Nigeria  blame Boko Haram for a wave of
violence since last year targeting government buildings and
security forces. At least 15 people died in the Suleja, which is
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Abuja. The first attack was
on the local office of the electoral commission on April 8 and
the second on a church on July 10.  The group claimed responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide
car-bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja that killed
23 people and wounded 71 as well as multiple blasts on Christmas
Eve in the central city of Jos that killed 80 people.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporters on this story:
