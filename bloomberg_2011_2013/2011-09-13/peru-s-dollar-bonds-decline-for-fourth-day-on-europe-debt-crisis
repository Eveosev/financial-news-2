Peru ’s dollar bonds fell, pushing
up yields for a fourth day, as concern Greece will default and
Italy will struggle to pay its debts sapped demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.07 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time.
The bond’s price fell 0.49 cent to 121.10 cents per dollar.  The cost of insuring against non-payment on European
sovereign and bank debt rose to records on mounting concern a
default by Greece will trigger losses for banks holding the
country’s bonds. Italian borrowing costs jumped at an auction on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis would spread to the euro zone’s
third-biggest economy.  “Volatility is going to remain for a few more days until
it becomes clear how the Greek situation will be resolved,”
said  Hugo Perea , chief economist at BBVA Banco Continental in
Lima. “As long as there isn’t a disorderly resolution of
Greece’s problem, we’ll see a normalization in prices.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed two basis points to
5.47 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7310 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7335 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the spot
currency market today, the bank said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
