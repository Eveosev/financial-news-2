Oil futures fluctuated in  New York 
amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis and a faltering economic
recovery in the U.S. will reduce demand for raw materials.  Futures pared earlier gains after the  International Energy
Agency  cut global oil demand forecasts for this year and next
because of the global economic outlook. Prices advanced as much
as 1.2 percent earlier today before an Energy Department report
tomorrow that may show U.S. oil supplies fell for a second week.  “Demand growth has slowed,”  David Fyfe , head of the IEA’s
industry and markets division, said in a telephone interview
from Paris. “This is market that’s been tightening for the past
12 to 15 months. This year the tightening has been more about
supply outages than demand.”  Crude for October delivery was at $88.26 a barrel, up 7
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4:27 p.m. Singapore time. It earlier rose as much as $1.02 to
$89.32 a barrel. The contract yesterday increased 95 cents to
$88.19. Prices are 14 percent higher the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
