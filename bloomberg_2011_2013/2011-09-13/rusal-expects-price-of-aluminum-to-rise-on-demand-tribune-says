United Co. Rusal, the largest
aluminum producer, expects the price of the metal to rise to as
much as $2,600 a metric ton in the next months, supported by
transport-based demand, first deputy chief executive officer
Vladislav Soloviev said in interview with  La Tribune .  Aluminumâ€™s decline to $2,300 a metric ton in August was
the bottom price, the French daily reported the executive as
saying. Rusal predicts aluminum demand will increase 10 percent
in 2011, Soloviev said, according to La Tribune.  To contact the reporter on this story:
