CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  said SPXpm, a
new type of Standard & Poor’s 500 Index option, will start
trading Oct. 4 on the exchange operator’s C2 platform.  The C2 Options Exchange was given permission on Sept. 2 to
create the derivatives, which settle based on end-of-day prices
rather than levels at the start of the session. CBOE Holdings
has exclusive rights to list  S&P 500  contracts, which currently
only trade at the company’s  Chicago Board Options Exchange .  David Gray , head of New York business development at CBOE
Holdings, said at an options conference in New York today that
pricing for the product will be available soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
