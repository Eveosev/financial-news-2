Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  rose the most
in almost a week after HSBC Holdings Plc said investors may be
overreacting to recent “bad” news about royalties and salt
disputes with the Israeli government.  The shares gained 3.7 percent, the biggest intraday move
since Sept. 7, to 41.60 at 2:16 p.m. in Tel Aviv. That trimmed
the slump this month to 19 percent.  The royalties and salt disputes may reduce Israel
Chemicals’ stock value by 4.8 shekels, analyst Yonah Weisz wrote
in a report to clients. He increased his share-price estimate
for the company by 3.8 percent to 67.5 shekels and maintained
his “overweight” recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
