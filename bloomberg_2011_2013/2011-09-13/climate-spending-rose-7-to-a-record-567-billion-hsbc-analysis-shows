Global climate-protection spending
rose by 7 percent last year to a record $567 billion, as
spending in  Latin America  more than doubled, according to
calculations by  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   So-called global climate revenues are measured by summing
reported revenue of each company in the HSBC Climate Change
Index, analysts at the bank, including Joaquim de Lima in
 London , said today in an e-mailed research note. The revenues
exceed the gross domestic product of  Switzerland , they said.  The index has fallen 22 percent in the year to date, as
equity markets dropped on concern that slow economic production
will cut profits. There will be 380 companies in the index
starting Sept. 16 after additions and deletions, with a minimum
market capitalization of $400 million, according to the report.  “Latin America saw its climate-related revenues rise 110
percent in 2010, which was by far the largest rise seen across
any region, and was driven by strong revenue growth in the low-
carbon energy production and water, waste and pollution-control
sectors,” the analysts wrote.  The U.S. had the biggest share of revenue, with more than
$100 billion, followed by Japan, France and  Germany . China moved
to eighth spot, rising 31 percent to $12.3 billion.  Integrated power companies delivered the largest spending
at $187 billion, followed by nuclear at $76.8 billion and water
at $55 billion, according to the analysts. Energy efficiency and
energy management dropped 19 percent to $133.3 billion, while
climate finance fell 7.8 percent to $122 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
