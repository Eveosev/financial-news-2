Three  Ohio State  football players
were reinstated by the  National Collegiate Athletic Association 
after serving a two-game suspension.  Starting running back Jordan Hall, Travis Howard and Corey
Brown were declared ineligible by the school for violations of
NCAA extra benefit rules after they received envelopes with $200
at a charity event in February. They’ll be eligible to compete
once they repay the money to charity, the NCAA said in a press
release yesterday.  The players missed games against Akron and Toledo. The 2-0
Buckeyes play at the  University of Miami  on Sept. 17.  Ohio State is still awaiting the NCAA’s decision on the
unrelated suspensions of five football players disciplined for
selling or trading uniforms and other memorabilia to the owner
of a tattoo parlor. Former quarterback Terrelle Pryor was among
them and left to play in the  National Football League , while the
violations led to Jim Tressel’s resignation as coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
