Peru ’s dollar bonds fell, pushing
up yields for a fourth day, as concern Greece will default and
Italy will struggle to pay its debts sapped demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 5.07 percent at 12:54 p.m. New York time.
The bond’s price fell 0.50 cent to 121.09 cents per dollar.  The cost of insuring against non-payment on European
sovereign and bank debt rose to records on mounting concern a
default by Greece will trigger losses for banks holding the
country’s bonds.  “Volatility is going to remain for a few more days until
it becomes clear how the Greek situation will be resolved,”
said  Hugo Perea , chief economist at BBVA Banco Continental in
Lima. “As long as there isn’t a disorderly resolution of
Greece’s problem, we’ll see a normalization in prices.”  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell eight basis points to 218,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The sol was little changed at 2.7345 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7335 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
