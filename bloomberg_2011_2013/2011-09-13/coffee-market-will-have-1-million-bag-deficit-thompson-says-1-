Global coffee consumption will
outpace supplies by 1 million bags in the 2011-12 season
starting next month, according to researcher CoffeeNetwork.  Bean production will be 135 million bags, while usage will
come to 136 million bags,  Andrea Thompson , head of research and
analysis at CoffeeNetwork in Belfast,  Northern Ireland , said
today at a conference in the Belgian city of Antwerp.  Brazil , the world’s largest grower and exporter, will
produce 45 million to 46 million bags amid the lower-yielding
half of a two-year cycle for trees, she said. That compares to a
forecast of 43.1 million bags today from the Brazilian ministry
of agriculture’s crop-forecasting agency, known as Conab.  Vietnam will produce 21 million bags of coffee in the 2011-
12 season, Thompson estimated. The country ranks second overall
among producers and is the top grower of the robusta variety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
