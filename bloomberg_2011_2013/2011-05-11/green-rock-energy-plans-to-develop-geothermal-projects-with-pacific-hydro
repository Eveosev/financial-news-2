Pacific Hydro Pty Ltd., owned by
Australian pension fund Industry Funds Management Pty, and  Green
Rock Energy Ltd. (GRK)  plan to develop geothermal power projects
together.  The companies may start with 25 megawatts of projects in
the North Perth Basin and the Great Artesian Basin in  South
Australia , where they hold licenses, Perth-based Green Rock said
in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange today.  Power produced from the projects could supply the National
Electricity Market and Western Australiaâ€™s South West
Interconnected System, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
