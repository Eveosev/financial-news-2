JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s biggest beef
producer, fell for the first day in three sessions after
inflation data in Brazil and  China  fueled bets for higher
borrowing costs and sparked declines in commodity prices.  The shares slid 0.4 percent to 5.60 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. JBS gained as much
as 5.5 percent earlier today, the most intraday since Nov. 24,
after it reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The
Bovespa index fell 1.7 percent to 63,775.82. Sixty stocks
dropped on the 69-member gauge.  JBS said in a regulatory filing that first-quarter net
income rose to 147 million reais ($91 million) from 99.4 million
reais a year earlier. The average estimate of five analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a profit, excluding some items, of 73.5
million reais.  “Results were better than expected, with a strong
performance from the U.S. unit,” Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at
SLW Corretora in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview.  Revenue from JBS’s U.S. beef unit rose 34 percent from a
year before and accounted for 43 percent of the company’s total
net sales worldwide in the first-quarter, according to the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
