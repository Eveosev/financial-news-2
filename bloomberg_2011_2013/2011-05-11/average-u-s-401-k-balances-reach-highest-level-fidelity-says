Average balances of 401(k) retirement
plans reached the highest level since  Fidelity Investments  began
tracking account values in 1998.  The average account balance in the U.S. rose to $74,900 as
of March 31, an increase of almost 12 percent from last year,
according to a report released today by the Boston-based mutual-
 fund manager . Fidelity, the largest provider of 401(k)s, has 11
million participants in almost 16,500 employer-sponsored defined
contribution plans.  “This for us is an all-time high since Fidelity began
tracking this figure back in 1998,” said Beth McHugh, vice
president of market insights for Fidelity. “The other positive
indicator that we saw was more participants increasing deferrals
versus decreasing them.”  About 10 percent of workers increased their savings rate
during the first quarter, the most since Fidelity started
reporting on that number in 2006, said McHugh, who is based in
Covington,  Kentucky . Participants saved an average 8.2 percent
of their salaries, a rate unchanged since the first quarter of
2009, she said.  A 401(k) plan generally lets employees defer a portion of
their wages to the account on a pretax basis. Contributions are
 limited  to $16,500 for 2011 and those age 50 or older may set
aside an additional $5,500, according to the  Internal Revenue
Service .  Vanguard Accounts  In a March report, Vanguard Group Inc. said that average
account balances rose to  $79,077  at the end of 2010, their
highest level since the  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based mutual-
fund company began tracking the data in 1999. Vanguard has about
3.5 million participants in defined-contribution  retirement
plans  with about $460 billion in assets under administration,
according to spokeswoman Linda Wolohan.  Americans held $3.1 trillion in 401(k)s as of Dec. 31,
according to the Washington-based  Investment Company Institute ,
a trade group for the mutual-fund industry. The ICI released a
separate  study  yesterday, which said the percentage of
participants who stopped contributing to their defined-
contribution plans declined last year, while loan activity
increased.  About 2.4 percent of workers halted contributions in 2010,
compared with 3.4 percent in 2009, according to the ICI, which
surveyed administrators of more than 23 million accounts. The
share of those with loans outstanding rose to about 18 percent
as of December, compared with about 17 percent at yearend 2009,
the report said.  Market Performance  As life expectancies increase and companies shift from
traditional pensions to 401(k) retirement plans, worker
confidence about having enough money in retirement has declined.
More than a quarter of U.S. workers said they’re “not at all
confident” about their ability to afford a comfortable
retirement, the highest percentage in two decades, according to
a March report by the Washington-based  Employee Benefit Research
Institute .  Men have a life expectancy of 17 years at age 65, based on
government tables from the  National Center for Health
Statistics . For women it’s 20 years.  About two-thirds of the increase in account balances in the
first quarter was driven by market performance, while one-third
was from participant contributions, said Fidelity’s McHugh. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained about 13 percent in the 12
months through March 31.  ‘Meaningful’ Rate  “A lot of people will say $74,000 on average is not that
great,” McHugh said. “If you look at those that are 10-year
continuous participants, their average balance is about
$191,000, and if they’re age 55 years or older and are a 10-year
continuous participant their average is about $233,800.”  Those figures show that contributing to a 401(k) early, at
a “meaningful” rate and continuing to save makes a difference,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
