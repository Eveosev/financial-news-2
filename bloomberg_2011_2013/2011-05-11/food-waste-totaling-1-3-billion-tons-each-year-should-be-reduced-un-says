Food wasted or lost during production
totals about 1.3 billion metric tons a year, or one-third of
global production for human consumption, the  United Nations ’
 Food and Agriculture Organization  said.  Farmers in low-income countries lack suitable storage and
cooling facilities, so food spoils before getting to consumers,
the UN said. Rich countries waste about 222 million tons of
food, nearly the total food output in sub-Saharan  Africa ,
according to the report. Food losses occur during production or
processing. Waste is usable food that’s not consumed.  “Economically avoidable food losses have a direct and
negative impact on the income of both farmers and consumers,”
the UN said. “Improving the efficiency of the food supply chain
could help to bring down the cost of food to the consumer and
thus increase access.”  Retailers put too much emphasis on appearance, the UN said.
Studies show consumers are willing to buy produce that doesn’t
meet appearance standards as long as it is safe and tastes good,
the organization said.  “Customers thus have the power to influence quality
standards and should do so,” the UN said. “Selling farm
produce closer to consumers, without having to conform to
supermarkets’ quality standards, is another suggestion. This
could be achieved through farmers’ markets and farm shops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
