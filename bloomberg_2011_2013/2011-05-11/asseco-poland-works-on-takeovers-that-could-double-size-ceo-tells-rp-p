Asseco Poland SA (ACP) , central  Europe ’s
largest software maker, is working on two “very big”
acquisitions of European software and information technology
service providers that may double the company’s market value,
the newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported, quoting Asseco Poland’s
Chief Executive Officer Adam Goral.  While Goral declined to identify the takeover targets, he
said their combined size is roughly equivalent to Asseco’s
market value, the newspaper said. Asseco is already auditing one
company and if both acquisitions succeed, would become a
“global” player, possibly under a new name with “Asseco” as
one of the elements, Rp.pl quoted Goral as saying.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
