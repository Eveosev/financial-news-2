The  International Swaps and
Derivatives Association  selected the Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. to help it record all trades in the $348 trillion
interest-rate swap market, the group said in an e-mailed
statement.  The selection takes the business from TriOptima, now a unit
of  ICAP Plc (IAP) , which in 2009 was selected by ISDA to record all
transactions in the market. After the Dodd-Frank Act was passed
in July, ISDA issued a call in March for companies to submit
repository proposals based on the increased regulatory demands
mandated by the new law.  The rates steering committee of ISDA, the industry and
lobbying group for dealers and money managers active in swaps,
made the DTCC selection, the statement said.  Dodd-Frank requires that most interest-rate and other swaps
be processed by  clearinghouses  to lower systemic risk. All
trades, whether cleared or not, must be reported to repositories
so regulators can have a full view of the market at any point in
time. The New York-based DTCC also manages the trade repository
for the credit-default swap market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
