AS Nordecon, the second-biggest
Baltic builder, reported an almost unchanged first-quarter loss,
citing adverse weather conditions.  The net loss was 1.2 million euros ($1.7 million), compared
with a loss of 1.3 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn,
Estonia-based Nordecon said in a stock exchange filing today.
The year-earlier figures were boosted by one-time financial
revenue of 1.2 million euros on the sale of its Latvian unit, it
said. Revenue jumped 58 percent to 17.7 million euros.  Nordecon said it is “moving in the right direction” for
restoring profitability in 2011 as a whole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
