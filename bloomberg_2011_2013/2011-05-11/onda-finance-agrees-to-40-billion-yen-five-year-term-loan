Honda Finance Co., a unit of Honda
Motor Co., agreed to a 40 billion yen ($494 million) term loan,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., which arranged
the facility.  The five-year loan, which was increased from 30 billion yen
on strong demand from lenders, will pay 30 basis points more
than similar-maturity government debt, the bank said in an e-
mailed statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
