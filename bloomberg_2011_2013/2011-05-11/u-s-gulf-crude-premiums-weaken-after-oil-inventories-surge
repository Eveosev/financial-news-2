U.S. Gulf oil premiums over benchmark
West  Texas  Intermediate weakened after a U.S. Energy Department
showed crude supplies surged to a two-year high.  Domestic crude stockpiles jumped 3.78 million barrels to
370.3 million last week, the highest level since May 2009,
according to the report.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 40 cents to
$14.50 a barrel at 1:57 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 50
cents to $15.75 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend weakened 25
cents to $8.10 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s premium narrowed 40
cents to $8.20.  Thunder Horse’s premium slipped 25 cents to $13.50 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 60 cents to
$6 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude slipped 20 cents to $14.30 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 20 cents to
$17.45 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
