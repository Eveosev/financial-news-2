The  University of Pennsylvania School
of Medicine , the oldest medical school in the U.S., received
$225 million from Raymond Perelman and his wife, Ruth, the
largest single contribution in the institution’s 246-year
history.  The gift will increase the School of Medicine’s financial
aid budget by at least 20 percent for the 2012 class and will be
used to recruit physicians and scientists, as well as to support
research, according to a  statement  today from the Philadelphia
institution. It will be renamed the Raymond and Ruth Perelman
School of Medicine, the statement said.  Raymond Perelman is a Penn Medicine trustee and chairman of
RGP Holdings Inc., a privately held investing company. The
Perelmans are the parents of  Ronald Perelman , the billionaire
chairman and chief executive officer of REV Holdings LLC.  “Raymond and Ruth’s gift propels us to redouble our
efforts to make Penn a global model of a comprehensive academic
medical center,” said  Amy Gutmann , Penn’s president, in today’s
statement. The gift is “both transformational and inspiring.”  The gift brings Penn’s Making History capital campaign to
$3.31 billion, almost 95 percent of the campaign’s $3.5 billion
goal by June 2012. With today’s donation, the Perelmans have
contributed more than $250 million to the campaign, according to
the statement.  Endowments Increase  Penn’s endowments increased by 9.6 percent to $5.67 billion
in 2010, and the university received the 11th largest amount
among U.S. and Canadian schools, according to the  National
Association of College and University Business Officers .  The Perelmans in 2005 gave Penn $25 million to create the
Ruth and  Raymond Perelman  Center for Advanced Medicine, which is
part of the  University of Pennsylvania  Health System. The center
opened in 2008, according to the statement. They also endowed a
professorship in internal medicine.  “Ruth and I believe the future of medicine depends on the
ability to produce world-class clinicians and researchers, the
hallmarks of Penn and a Penn education,” said Raymond Perelman,
in the statement. “We are confident that Penn’s outstanding
faculty and students will continue to make significant
contributions to medicine in the years ahead.”  Penn’s School of Medicine, which has 2,200 students and
trainees and 1,800 faculty members, was founded in 1765. The
 National Institutes of Health  awarded the school $508 million in
the 2010 fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
