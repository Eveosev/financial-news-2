Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest
pipeline owner, is considering expanding outside its main North
American market to capture growth opportunities in  South America 
and Asia, Chief Executive Officer Pat Daniel said.  The Calgary-based company is “looking at” pipeline and
distribution-related opportunities in South America, including
Colombia, as well as in China, Daniel said today during a
conference call with analysts. There are no specific plans at
the moment, he said.  Enbridge sold its CLH pipeline system in Spain in 2008 and
it Ocensa pipeline in Colombia in 2009,  Jennifer Varey , a
company spokeswoman, said. The company wanted to capture a
“premium” on the value of those assets and use the proceeds to
fund expansion in  North America , Daniel said today. It was never
a strategy to exit the international business, he said.  Enbridge today said adjusted earnings in the first quarter
rose 5 percent to C$334 million ($349 million), helped by an
agreement with shippers. Cash flow from operating activities
increased to C$957 million from C$646 million, helping to
provide “a strong balance sheet” if the company chooses to
spend on additional projects, Daniel said.  The shares fell C$1.24, or 2 percent, to C$60.20 as of 4:15
p.m. in Toronto stock exchange trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
