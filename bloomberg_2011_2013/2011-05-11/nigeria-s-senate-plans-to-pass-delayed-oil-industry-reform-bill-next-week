Nigeria’s Senate plans to pass a bill
to regulate the oil industry of  Africa ’s top producer next week,
after addressing concerns about taxes and royalties raised by
international energy companies, Lee Maeba, chairman of the Joint
Senate Committee on Petroleum, said in an interview today in
Abuja, the capital.  The lawmakers have decided to make a legislation that won’t
“scare the multinationals,” said Maeba. “They’re the people
producing the oil, hence there should be a balance between the
government’s take and their take.”  The Senate will start final deliberations on the bill on
May 17, subsequently passing it, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
