The  Detroit Red Wings  came within 10
minutes of elimination before rallying for a 3-1 victory against
the San Jose Sharks to force a deciding seventh game in their
National Hockey League playoff series.  Henrik Zetterberg and Valtteri Filppula scored in a two-
minute span midway through the third period and Darren Helm
added a late empty-net goal at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. San
Jose hosts Game 7 tomorrow.  The Sharks, who won the first three games of the series
before a pair of 4-3 losses, took the lead 3 minutes, 54 seconds
into the third period on a goal by Logan Couture.  Three teams in NHL history have come back from a 3-0
deficit to win a best-of-seven playoff series, including the
 Philadelphia Flyers  last year.  The Red Wings are the second team this season to rally from
three games down in a series, joining the  Chicago Blackhawks  --
who lost Game 7 and their first-round series to the Vancouver
Canucks.  The winner of the series plays Vancouver in the Western
Conference finals. The Eastern Conference finals begin May 14
when the Tampa Bay Lightning play at the  Boston Bruins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
