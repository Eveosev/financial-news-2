Derrick Rose  scored 33 points and the
 Chicago  Bulls defeated the Atlanta Hawks 95-83 to take a 3-2
lead in their National Basketball Association playoff series.  Luol Deng added 23 points at United Center in Chicago last
night as the Bulls moved within one win of clinching a spot in
the Eastern Conference finals. Game 6 in the best-of-seven
series is tomorrow in Atlanta.  Jeff Teague had 21 points for the Hawks, who went 1-for-12
from behind the 3-point line. Atlanta trailed by one point after
three quarters before being outscored 26-15 in the fourth.  The  Boston Celtics , trailing 3-1 in their series against
Miami, visit the Heat tonight. The winner of that series will
play the Bulls or Hawks in the Eastern Conference finals.  Memphis and Oklahoma City, their series tied 2-2, also play
tonight. The winner of the Western Conference series will face
the Dallas Mavericks for a place in the NBA Finals. Dallas swept
the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers out of the
