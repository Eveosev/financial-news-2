JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said first-quarter profit rose 48 percent on increased
sales to the U.S. and  Brazil .  First-quarter net income increased to 147 million reais
($92 million), or 6 centavos a share, from $99.4 million, or 4
centavos a year ago, Sao Paulo-based JBS said today in a
regulatory filing. The company was expected to post a profit of
2 centavos excluding some items, the average of four analysts in
a Bloomberg survey.  Sales of beef in the U.S. rose 34 percent to $3.79 billion
in the quarter from a year earlier, while pork and chicken
revenue increased 30 percent and 15 percent respectively, JBS
said. Total sales climbed 20 percent to 14.7 billion reais.  JBS returned a 50 percent stake in the Italian Inalca
venture with Cremonini SpA after a legal dispute over management
and corporate governance, it said March 4. Under the termination
agreement, Cremonini paid back the 218.9 million euros ($312
million) that JBS invested in the venture in 2008.  JBS rose 2.7 percent to close at 5.62 reais yesterday. The
stock has fallen 22 percent so far this year, underperforming
the benchmark Bovespa index’s 6.4 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
