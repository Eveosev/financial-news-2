New York Mets first baseman  Ike Davis 
will return to New York to meet with team doctors after injuring
his left leg during yesterday’s 2-1 loss to the Colorado Rockies
in Denver.  Davis is hitting .302 with a team-leading seven home runs
and 25 runs batted in this season.  Davis was injured when he collided with Mets third baseman
 David Wright  on an infield pop fly. Davis didn’t return to the
field the following inning.  The Mets had today’s Major League Baseball game in Denver
postponed by rain and cold weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
