Japan’s Ministry of Finance said the
country’s March intervention to curb the yen’s strength involved
buying only the dollar.  The country sold 692.5 billion yen ($8.6 billion) to
purchase dollars on March 18, the only intervention during the
quarter ended March 31, the ministry said on its  website  today.  The Group of Seven nations jointly intervened in foreign-
exchange markets on March 18, a day after the yen climbed to a
record 76.25 per dollar amid speculation Japanese investors
would sell overseas assets to fund rebuilding from the nation’s
biggest earthquake on March 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
