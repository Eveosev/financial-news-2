BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil explorer
focused on Cameroon, gained the most in six months after its
Sapele-2 well off the African country’s coast found oil.  BowLeven surged 10 percent to 313 pence in London, the
biggest jump since Nov. 11.  The company drilled the Sapele-2 well, which encountered a
total of 35 meters (115 feet) of hydrocarbon-bearing interval in
the Omicron reservoir in the Douala Basin, Edinburgh-based
BowLeven said today in a statement. It will need more tests to
estimate the deposit’s resource potential.  “A welcome positive after the mixed initial results from
Sapele-1 sidetrack, and we see a further recovery in shares
ahead of the flow test update,” Phil Corbett, an analyst at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed report.  BowLeven is drilling Block 5 in Cameroon, which may hold as
much as 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Chief Executive
Officer Kevin Hart forecast in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
