Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  said first-quarter
profit rose as  Poland ’s second-largest oil refiner benefited
from climbing crude prices, the strengthening zloty and an
increase in capacity.  Net income jumped to 635.2 million zloty ($233 million)
from 22.9 million zloty a year earlier, the Gdansk-based company
said in a regulatory statement today. That beat the 512.1
million-zloty mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  A 17 percent rise in the oil price during the quarter
raised the value of crude in Lotos’s tanks, contributing 278.1
million zloty of its 412.6 million-zloty earnings before
interest and taxes. Lotos and larger rival PKN Orlen SA want the
government to reduce the amount of oil they’re required to hold
as strategic reserves, to reduce the volatility of earnings.  Lotos this year completed a 5.6 billion-zloty investment
that boosted capacity at its refinery by 75 percent to 10.5
million tons a year. The company refined 2.22 million tons of
oil in the first quarter, compared with 1.61 million tons a year
earlier, helping push sales up 67 percent to 6.52 billion zloty.  Lotos borrowed dollars to fund the investment, and the
Polish currency’s gains during the quarter cut the zloty-
denominated value of this debt, increasing income from financial
operations to 335.3 million zloty, compared with a loss of 131.2
million zloty last year.  The start of production from Lotos’s Yme Norwegian offshore
field, in which it holds 20 percent, will be delayed to the end
of the year, the company said, confirming a report by operator
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  Lotos had forecast it would extract about
100,000 tons of oil a quarter starting in July.  Lotos’s management proposed that shareholders pay
themselves no dividend from last year’s profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
