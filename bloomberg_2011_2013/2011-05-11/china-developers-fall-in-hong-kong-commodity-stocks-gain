real-estate company in the southern Chinese city, slid 1.2
percent. Automakers fell after China’s passenger-car sales

here for longer than anticipated,” said  Andrew Sullivan ,
director of institutional sales trading at OSK Securities  Hong
Kong  Ltd.  “ Asia  has an inflation problem, but it’s still seeing good
growth. A lot of that is because Asia is running on cash rather
than running on debt, which is what you’re seeing in  Europe . At
the end of the day, Asia is still providing growth.”  Consumer Prices  China Resources Land sank 1 percent to HK$13.44, and
Guangzhou R&F Properties lost 1.2 percent to HK$10.30. Shimao
Property Holdings Ltd., which receives all its revenue from
China, sank 0.8 percent to HK$10.36.  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a

as 1 percent. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., the unit of the
