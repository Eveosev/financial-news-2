Rational AG (RAA) , the world market leader
for automated cookers in professional kitchens, said first-
quarter profit rose 23 percent as restaurant chefs in  Asia 
bought more equipment.  Net income increased to 15.3 million euros ($22 million)
from 12.4 million euros a year earlier, the manufacturer said
today in a statement. A 41 percent jump in Asian revenue
propelled a sales gain of 21 percent to 88 million euros.  The company’s cookers, installed at Queen Elizabeth II’s
Buckingham Palace kitchen, helped feed guests at the wedding
reception of her grandson,  Prince William , and his wife  Kate
Middleton  on April 29. Based in Landsberg am Lech, Germany,
Rational sells about half its equipment to canteen kitchens and
about one-third to restaurants, with the remainder going to
hotels and caterers.  “We’ll increase investments in sales and marketing by more
than 10 percent to grow across all regions this year,” Chief
Executive Officer Guenter Blaschke said in an interview. “We
are back on our normal growth path.”  Blaschke, 61, has been CEO since 1999 and has led the
company through 10 consecutive annual increases in net income.
He plans a special dividend this year to make up for scaling
back shareholder payments for 2008, when Rational sought to save
cash during the global recession.  “We’re compensating for cutting the payout for 2008 as we
don’t need that liquidity buffer anymore,” Blaschke said.  Revenue Growth  Revenue rose by 17 percent in Germany, 18 percent in the
rest of  Europe , and 10 percent in the Americas, Rational said,
without specifying figures. Outside of those markets and Asia,
sales increased 47 percent.  Profit this year will rise 9.2 percent to 87.1 million
euros, according to the average of eight analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales have increased every year since
1996, apart from an 8 percent drop in 2009.  The company today reiterated that revenue will rise by
about 10 percent in 2011, while earnings will show a “good
performance.” Blaschke declined to comment further.  Rational has a market share of 54 percent for new equipment
sold, and plans to add about 100 jobs this year, about as many
as in 2010, Blaschke said.  The manufacturer’s pretax margin amounted to 30.2 percent
of sales, the highest among 133 global appliance makers last
year, Bloomberg data show. Rational’s cookers, which can cost as
much as 30,000 euros apiece, are installed at Munich’s landmark
eatery Hofbraeuhaus, and canteen kitchens at corporations and
universities.  Rational has risen about 65 percent in the past 12 months,
outpacing a gain of 33 percent for  Germany ’s MDAX index for
medium-sized companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
