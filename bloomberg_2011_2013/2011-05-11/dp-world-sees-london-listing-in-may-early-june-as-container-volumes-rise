DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the Dubai World-
controlled company that operates ports from  Europe  to  Asia ,
plans to list its shares on the  London  Stock Exchange this month
or early June as volumes grew at its terminals.  DP World’s shares are currently traded on Nasdaq Dubai and
the listing in London is subject to completion of the U.K.
Listing Authority’s admission process, the company said in a
statement today. DP World last year hired Deutsche Bank AG and
Citigroup Inc. to manage the listing.  The company will seek shareholders approval today to
combine 20 shares into one and the consolidation will take place
May 19. Shareholders will receive one $2 share for every 20
existing shares of 10 cents each after the consolidation.  DP
World reported a better-than-expected 13 percent increase in
full-year profit to $374.8 million, helped by a rebound in
global trade and improved profit margins.  Volumes handled at 23 terminals DP World consolidates for
accounting purpose grew 8.5 percent in the first quarter to 6.8
million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, from the year-
earlier period, according to the statement. Volumes at five
terminals in  Australia  were not included as DP World sold a 75
percent stake in its unit in the country for $1.5 billion.  The company’s 49 operational terminals posted 12 percent
growth in gross volumes to 12.6 million TEUs, helped by growth
in the United Arab Emirates,  Africa  and the Americas, according
to the statement.  "In 2010 the industry reported a sustained return to
container volume growth which has continued into the first
quarter of 2011," Chief Executive Officer Mohammed Sharaf said.
"Following this good start to the year we remain confident that
we should deliver a better performance in 2011 than in 2010."  The shares rose 1.6 percent to 69 cents at 11:50 a.m. in
Dubai today, valuing the company at $11.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
