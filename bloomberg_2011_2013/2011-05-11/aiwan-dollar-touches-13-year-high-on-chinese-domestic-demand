Taiwan’s dollar rose to a 13-year
high after  China , the island’s biggest export market, pledged to
boost domestic demand.  The local dollar gained for a third day as global funds
bought $171 million more local stocks than they sold today,
building on net purchases of $602 million in the last two days.
China said yesterday it will seek to boost  consumer spending  and
increase imports, according to a statement released following
the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue with U.S. officials.  “ Asia  will benefit if China imports more and the regional
currencies will rise if the Chinese government accelerates
appreciation,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. Breaking through NT$28.50 is
“a big psychological level,” he said.  Taiwan ’s currency advanced 0.3 percent to close at
NT$28.650 against the greenback, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
It touched NT$28.476, the strongest level since October 1997.  The currency was trading 0.7 percent stronger at NT$28.513
one minute before the end of trading and pared gains on
suspected intervention by the central bank, according to two
traders who declined to be identified as the monetary authority
doesn’t usually disclose such details.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was at 1.094 percent, compared with 1.092 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
