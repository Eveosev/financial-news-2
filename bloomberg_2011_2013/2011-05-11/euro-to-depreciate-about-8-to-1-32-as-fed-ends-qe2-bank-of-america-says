The euro will weaken about 8 percent
to $1.32 against the dollar by the end of June as the  Federal
Reserve  ends its bond-purchase program, according to Bank of
America Corp.  The euro has gained about 7 percent against the dollar this
year, boosted partly by the  European Central Bank , which raised
borrowing costs and signaled more rate increases may follow. In
contrast, the Fed held borrowing costs at a record low, and is
partway through a plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries through
June as part of a program to spur the recovery, known as
quantitative easing.  “The end of quantitative easing is not fully priced in,”
David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in  New York , said by phone. “This is
bearish for the euro. The end of quantitative easing is going to
make it less necessary for the ECB to raise rates. It is going
to lead to a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices in
general, and that will take some pressure off the ECB.”  The euro declined to $1.4383 as of 8:57 a.m. in  London ,
from $1.4409 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
