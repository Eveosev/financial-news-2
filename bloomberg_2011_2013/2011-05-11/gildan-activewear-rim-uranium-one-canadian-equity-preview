points, or 1.6 percent, to 13,419.74. It had risen as much as

still remains elevated above the central bank’s target,” said

Management team that oversees C$1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).

tightening, decreasing the demand for commodities.”  The index has retreated 3.8 percent this month, the most
among developed-market stock benchmarks, and 0.2 percent this
