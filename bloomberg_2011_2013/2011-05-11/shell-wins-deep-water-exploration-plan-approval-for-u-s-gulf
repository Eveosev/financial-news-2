Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  won U.S.
approval for a second Gulf of Mexico deep-water exploration
plan, making it the only company to pass environmental reviews
introduced after the  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill last year.  Shell, based in  The Hague , won approval from the  Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement  to drill
five exploratory wells in waters as deep as 7,259 feet (2,213
meters), 72 miles off the Louisiana coast, the regulator, known
as BOEMRE, said today in an e-mailed statement.  “BOEMRE has approved only two deep-water exploration plans
since the lifting of the moratorium, and Shell is pleased to
have received both,”  Marvin Odum , the chief of Shell’s U.S.
operations, said in an e-mailed statement today. “This approval
is further evidence of Shell’s expertise and confidence in the
offshore and should be strongly considered as Shell moves
forward with additional exploration.”  The U.S. increased scrutiny of environmental impacts from
oil exploration after BP’s well exploded on April 20, 2010, and
gushed for 87 days. Shell won approval on March 21 for the first
post-spill exploration plan, for drilling in the Gulf 130 miles
from the Louisiana shore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
