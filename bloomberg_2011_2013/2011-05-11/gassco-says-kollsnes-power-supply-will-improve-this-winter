Gassco AS,  Norway ’s natural-gas
pipeline operator, said power supplies to gas-export plants will
be more reliable this winter following talks with the power-grid
operator and Statoil ASA, the country’s biggest gas producer.  Snow, ice and fog have affected power transmission cables,
cutting electricity to gas-export plants, mainly the Kollsnes
plant, Thor Otto Lohne, executive vice president at Gassco, said
in an interview in Amsterdam today. Kollsnes, Norway’s largest
gas-export plant, can send as much as 143 million cubic meters a
day via pipelines to markets in the U.K. and mainland Europe.  “We have been speaking to the operator of the grid
together with Statoil and, based on that, agreed on
improvements,” Lohne said. “The expectation is that things
will be improved” by the coming winter, he said.  Norway is the biggest foreign gas supplier to the U.K. and
the second-largest to  Europe . Gassco said yesterday that the
startup of Kollsnes following planned maintenance was delayed
until May 15 because of “upstream maintenance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
