Sugar output in  China , the world’s
second-biggest consumer after  India , crept up only 1.4 percent
in the first four months from a year ago ahead of the peak
consumption season, spurring expectations of increased imports.  Output in the first four months gained to 7.82 million
tons, according to the nation’s statistics bureau today. March
production was 519,000 tons, down from 1.99 million tons the
previous month, data showed.  Buyers in China may take advantage of a slump in prices
that has seen sugar plunge about 40 percent since reaching a
three-decade high on Feb. 2. Production may be 12.5 million tons
of sugar in the year from Oct. 1, while demand may total 15
million, according to Paul Deane, a senior agricultural
economist at ANZ in  Melbourne .  “The local market price is more than 1,000 yuan a ton
higher than the overseas market, so imports are viable and we
will see more shipments to come starting in May,” said Gao
Wang, analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Co.
Purchases may still reach 1.9 million tons this year, said Gao.  Total sugar output in the country, including the white
sugar processed from imported raw sugar and domestically-
produced canes and beets, were about 10.98 million tons between
October and April, falling for the third year and lagging the
consumption estimate at more than 13 million tons, he said.  Prices Jump  Raw sugar for July delivery on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York 
jumped 4.3 percent to 21.87 cents per pound yesterday on
expectations of higher Chinese imports. White sugar for
September delivery on Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange gained for
the third day to 6,637 yuan ($1,022) a ton.  China’s purchases may rise 35 percent to 2.7 million tons
in the year ending September 2012, the ANZ’s Deane said in a May
9 interview.  About 1.16 million tons of sugar was sold to the domestic
market from China’s state reserves between August and February
to cool prices, Deane said in a report last month.  China will be “happy” to see more imports after buying a
“substantial” amount to help curb inflation as output declines
for a third year, Liu Xiaonan, deputy head of the economy at the
National Development and Reform Commission, said April 25.  Global sugar output may exceed demand for a second year
after farmers boosted planting as futures surged, pushing prices
lower, Standard Chartered Bank said.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Thomas Kutty Abraham  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
