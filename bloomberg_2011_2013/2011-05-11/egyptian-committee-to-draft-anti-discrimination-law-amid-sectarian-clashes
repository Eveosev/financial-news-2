Egypt ’s government asked a committee
to draft an anti-discrimination law and study another regulating
the building of houses of worship.  The committee formed to “confront the attempts at
sectarian sedition” should finish its work within 30 days, the
Cabinet said in a statement. “The Egyptian government stresses
its commitment to firmly stand against inciting hatred,
sectarianism and discrimination,” it said.  The move comes days after clashes between Muslims and
Christians left 12 people killed and hundreds injured. Many of
Egypt’s Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the
population, complain of discrimination, including difficulties
getting permits to build churches.  To contact the reporters on this story:
