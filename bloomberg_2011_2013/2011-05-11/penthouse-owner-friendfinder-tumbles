FriendFinder Networks Inc., the
publisher of Penthouse magazine, plunged as much as 22 percent
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after selling shares at the low
end of the range in its initial public offering.  The  Boca Raton , Florida-based operator of websites
including AdultFriendFinder.com and Cams.com tumbled $2.23 to
$7.77 as of 12:35 p.m.  New York  time. FriendFinder raised $50
million in its IPO yesterday, selling 5 million shares at $10
each after offering them for as much as $12 apiece.  FriendFinderâ€™s IPO follows an attempt last year to raise as
much as $240 million and plans in 2008 for an offering of as
much as $460 million, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filings show. The company is using proceeds to repay debt,
according to the prospectus.  The company, which had outstanding debt of $542.5 million
as of April 15, had accumulated net losses of $210 million in
the five years through 2010, the prospectus showed. Net revenue
for the year ended Dec. 31 was $346 million, while the net loss
was $43.2 million, according to the filing.  Imperial Capital Group Inc. of  Los Angeles  and  Ladenburg
Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (LTS)  of Miami led the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
