Canada’s dollar snapped three days of
gains against the greenback as crude oil slid after a report
showed U.S. inventories rose to a two-year high and stocks fell,
sapping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, weakened a day after
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the government wants to avoid
extreme currency fluctuations. Two-year  government bonds  rose
after an auction of the debt.  “The primary driver for the decline in the Canadian dollar
is the midmorning selloff in oil,” said  George Davis , Toronto-
based chief technical analyst for fixed-income and currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada. “That points to a risk-off
environment, which tends to be negative for the Canadian
dollar.”  The loonie depreciated 0.5 percent to 96.19 cents versus
the greenback at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.68 cents yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0396. The currency touched 94.46
cents on April 29, the strongest level since November 2007.  Crude oil for June delivery fell 5.1 percent to $98.60 a
barrel. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.1 percent. The
S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 1.6 percent.  Supplies of crude in America,  Canada ’s biggest trading
partner, jumped by 3.78 million barrels to 370.3 million in the
week ended May 6, the U.S. Energy Department said. The median
forecast of 16 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for
inventories to climb by 1.5 million barrels. The increase puts
supplies at the highest level since May 8, 2009.  Loonie Versus Euro  The loonie advanced 1 percent to C$1.3652 against the euro
on speculation  Greece  may restructure its debt while Canada’s
economy grows stronger. The Canadian currency touched C$1.3636,
the strongest level since April 1.  “In the context of trouble in the euro region, we’re
seeing flows into Canada,” said Rahim Madhavji, president at
Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange Inc. in Toronto. “Canada has
what everyone wants. It has a sound and growing economy and
fiscal prudence.”  Canadian employers added a net 58,300 jobs in April after a
decrease of 1,500 in the previous month,  Statistics Canada 
reported last week. The median forecast of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 20,000. The jobless
rate unexpectedly dropped to 7.6 percent.  The nation reported a fourth straight  trade surplus  in
March, the longest stretch since November 2008 and a sign that
exporters are recovering from the global recession.  Trade Surplus  The surplus widened to C$627 million ($658 million),
Statistics Canada said today, larger than the C$400 million
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 21 economists. The
agency also raised the combined total surplus for the prior two
months by C$1.33 billion.  The  Conservative Party  will use its election victory last
week to ensure the nation erases its  budget deficit  in three
years, Flaherty said yesterday at the Bloomberg Canada Economic
Summit in Toronto.  While Flaherty said a strengthening currency is a
reflection of confidence in the Canadian economy, he added that
the government wants to avoid “jerky” movements in the
Canadian dollar and said the government wouldn’t intervene in
 currency markets  without an extreme cause. Flaherty also said he
doesn’t want to see increasing “weakness” in the  U.S. dollar .  A gain today in two-year Canadian government bonds pushed
the yield down three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
1.69 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent security maturing in
March 2013 increased 5 cents to C$100.10.  Canada sold C$3.5 billion ($3.7 billion) of two-year debt,
drawing an average yield of 1.873 percent. The government
received bids of C$8.8 billion for the 2 percent securities
maturing in August 2013, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website.  To contact the reporter for this story:
