NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, Ukraine’s
state-run energy company, said it cut its first-quarter loss in
half from a year earlier after the government raised natural gas
prices for households.  The net loss under Ukrainian accounting standards fell to
1.29 billion hryvnia ($162 million) from 2.56 billion hryvnia,
the Kiev, Ukraine-based company said in a  statement  on the
website of the Ukrainian Stocks and Securities Commission today.  Ukraine’s government raised the natural gas price for
households by 50 percent in August to comply with demands from
the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
