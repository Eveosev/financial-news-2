Sugar fell the most in a week on
signs of rising supply in  Thailand  and India, the world’s
largest grower after  Brazil . Cocoa gained, and coffee retreated.  Output in India’s Maharashtra state, the nation’s biggest
producer, will reach a record 9.15 million metric tons in the
year ending Sept. 30, a state agency said. The Thai cane crop
may climb to a record 94 million tons, with sugar supplies of
9.6 million tons, the  Office of the Cane & Sugar Board  said.  “The surge in output in  Asia  is negative for prices,”
said Jeff Bauml, a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, a broker in New York. “Also, there is an absence of
buyers.”  Raw sugar for July delivery dropped 0.69 cent, or 3.2
percent, to 21.18 cents a pound at 10:41 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . A close at that price would be the biggest
loss since May 4.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for August delivery fell
$16.10, or 2.6 percent, to $596.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Brazil is the largest exporter, followed by Thailand.  Cocoa futures for July delivery rose $20, or 0.6 percent,
to $3,125 a ton in New York. Arabica-coffee futures for July
delivery dropped 7.2 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.754 a pound on
ICE.  Cocoa advanced in London, while robusta coffee declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
