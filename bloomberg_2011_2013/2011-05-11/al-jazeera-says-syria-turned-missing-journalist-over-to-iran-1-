Al Jazeera reporter Dorothy Parvaz,
who went missing after arriving in Damascus on April 29, has
been deported to  Iran , the network said.  “We have received information that she is being held in
Tehran,” the Doha-based television network said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. “We are calling for information from the
Iranian authorities, access to Dorothy and for her immediate
release.”  Ramin Mehmanparast, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman,
couldn’t be reached for comment at his office after work hours
or on his cell phone. Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi 
called on  Syria ’s government to look into Parvaz’s case during a
May 2 visit to Qatar.  The information about the whereabouts of Parvaz, a U.S.,
Canadian and Iranian citizen, came from Syrian officials, who
previously told Al Jazeera they were holding her in Damascus and
that she would be released, according to the statement.  Al
Jazeera  said it has had no contact with Parvaz, 39, since she
left Qatar 12 days ago.  Most foreign journalists have been banned from Syria amid
spreading anti-government protests. The Syrian government has
restricted media access to protest flash points and made it more
difficult to get visas.  Parvaz, who joined Al Jazeera in 2010, graduated from the
University of British Columbia, obtained a masters from Arizona
University and received journalism fellowships from both Harvard
and  Cambridge University . She previously worked as a columnist
and feature writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, according
to Al Jazeera’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
