Brazil’s Justice Ministry has filed a
lawsuit against BR Distribuidora for raising fuel prices,  Valor
Economico  said, citing the government’s Diario Oficial da Union
publication.  BR Distribuidora, state-run  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s
gasoline station chain, hasn’t been notified of the lawsuit,
Valor said. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras didn’t immediately
reply to a telephone call and an e-mail seeking comments.  Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Sergio Gabrielli said May
2 that higher ethanol prices have caused gasoline prices to
rise, because ethanol is mixed with gasoline. The company’s
refineries haven’t increased fuel prices since mid-2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
