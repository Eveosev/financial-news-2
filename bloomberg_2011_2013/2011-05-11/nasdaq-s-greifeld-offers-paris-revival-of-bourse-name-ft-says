Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  Chief Executive
Officer Bob Greifeld said Nasdaq OMX would restore the name
“Paris Bourse” to the French stock exchange if it were
successful in its bid to buy  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , the Financial Times
reported, citing remarks by Greifeld.  The French authorities’ response to the offer was “more
nuanced” than expected, Greifeld said, according to the
Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
