Empresas Hites SA (HITES) , a Chilean
department store operator, fell the most in a week after posting
lower-than- expected first-quarter profit as the company
allocated funds to an executive compensation program.  Hites, the smallest retailer to be part of Chile’s IPSA
index, fell 1.5 percent to 703 pesos at 1:30 p.m. New York time.
The IPSA index retreated 0.4 percent to 4,839.06.  Hites posted net income of 514 million pesos ($1.1 million)
in the first quarter, compared to a net loss of 196 million
pesos a year earlier, according to a statement posted yesterday
on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “Profit was 19 percent below the estimates, mostly due to
an executive compensation program,” Banchile-Citi, the joint
research department of local lender Banco de  Chile  and Citigroup
Inc., said in an e-mailed note to clients, reiterating a
“hold” recommendation and a year-end price estimate of 825
pesos per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
