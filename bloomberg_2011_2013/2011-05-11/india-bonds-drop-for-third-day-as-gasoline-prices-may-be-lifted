India ’s government bonds dropped for
a third day on speculation gasoline prices will be increased,
spurring concern that inflation will accelerate and erode the
value of fixed-income securities.  Yields approached a 31-month high touched yesterday before
the sale of 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) of debt maturing
in 2018, 2021 and 2040 on May 13. Gasoline prices may be raised
by 2.5 rupees a liter, Bloomberg UTV reported yesterday, citing
oil ministry sources it didn’t identify.  “An increase in fuel prices is imminent and investors are
probably factoring that in,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income
trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The
continuation of debt supplies may also reduce appetite for
existing notes.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.29 percent, as of
9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 8.30 percent in intraday trading
yesterday, the highest level for a 10-year bond since October
2008. Yields may range between 8.25 percent and 8.50 percent
through the end of June, Verma said.  India, which imports more than 75 percent of its oil,
hasn’t raised gasoline prices since January. Crude prices have
advanced 13.7 percent this year to $103.94 a barrel in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
