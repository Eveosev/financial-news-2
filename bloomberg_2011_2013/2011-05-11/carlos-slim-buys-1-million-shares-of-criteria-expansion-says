Billionaire  Carlos Slim  acquired 1
million shares of Criteria CaixaCorp SA, the investment unit of
 Spain ’s largest savings bank, Expansion magazine  reported ,
without saying where it got the information.  The transaction is a “gesture of support” for the
investment firm as it is restructured and renamed CaixaBank,
Spain’s Expansion said, citing unnamed market sources. The
shares give the Mexican billionaire a 0.03 percent stake in the
company and are worth about 5 million euros ($7.2 million) at
market prices, Expansion said.  Arturo Elias , a spokesman for Slim, didn’t return an e-mail
message and couldn’t be reached by phone after normal business
hours today in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
