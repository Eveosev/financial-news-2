Carbacid Investments Ltd. (CBIL) , a Kenyan
carbon-dioxide maker, snapped two days of gains after one of its
key investors said it plans a “substantial’’ divestiture of its
stake in the company.  The shares fell 2 shillings, or 1.5 percent, to 128
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  Centum Investment Co., the biggest publicly traded
investment company in East Africa, plans a “substantial
divesture” of its 22 percent stake in Carbacid, Centum Chief
Executive Officer James Mworia said in an e-mailed statement
today. The sale is meant to raise funds for other investment
opportunities, Mworia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
