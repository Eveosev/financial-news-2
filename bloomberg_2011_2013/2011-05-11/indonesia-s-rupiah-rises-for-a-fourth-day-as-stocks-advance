Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
fourth day as regional stocks rallied on rising commodity prices
and after China pledged to increase imports. Benchmark bonds
gained.  The currency traded near a seven-year high as the MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares rose the most in more than
a week. The rupiah has strengthened 5.3 percent this year as
overseas investors bought $1.8 billion more local equities than
they sold. China said yesterday it will seek to boost  consumer
spending  and increase imports, according to a statement released
following the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue with U.S.
officials.  The stocks “gained on earnings and the commodities rally
and that’s helping to boost sentiment,” said Joanna Tan, a
Singapore-based regional economist at Forecast Singapore Pte.
“We also saw the euro strengthening, and that means a weaker
dollar, which leads to a stronger rupiah.”  The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 8,528 against the dollar as
of 4:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the strongest level since March 2004.  Overseas investors raised holdings of Indonesia’s debt by
13 percent this year to 220.8 trillion rupiah ($25.8 billion) as
of May 9, according to data from the Debt Management Office.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose today. The yield on the 8.25
percent note dropped one basis point or 0.01 percentage point to
7.72 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
