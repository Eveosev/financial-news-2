OAO Aeroflot plans to use an option
to buy eight Boeing 777 airliners at a 47 percent discount,
paying $1.16 billion rather than the catalog cost of $2.17
billion,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing unidentified people in
both companies.  The Russian company plans to purchase two 777-300ER and six
777-200ER planes, the newspaper said, adding that the aircraft
will be supplied between 2013 and 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
