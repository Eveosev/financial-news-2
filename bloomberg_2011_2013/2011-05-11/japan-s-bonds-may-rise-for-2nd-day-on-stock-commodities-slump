Japan ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
second day, sending yields to the lowest this year, as local
stocks mirrored a slump in U.S. shares and commodities fell,
boosting demand for safer assets.  Investor appetite for bonds was supported after U.S.
Treasuries rose yesterday on increased demand at a $24 billion
auction. Today’s sale of 2.2 trillion yen ($27.1 billion) of 10-
year bonds drew bids worth 2.73 times the amount on offer,
compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.97 times at
the previous offering.  “A risk-averse mood is dominant in the markets, as you see
in the sharp decline in U.S. yields and stock losses, giving
some support to Japanese bonds,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist
in  Tokyo  at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about
$331 billion in investments.  The benchmark 10-year yield earlier reached 1.11 percent,
the lowest since Dec. 30., and was at 1.120 percent as of 3:07
p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer
debt broker. The 1.3 percent security due March 2021 increased
0.045 yen to 101.595 yen. Sumitomo’s Sera expects the rate may
drop to as low as 1.1 percent next week.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery added 0.03 to
140.73 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Twenty-
year yields fell as much as three basis points to 1.885 percent,
the lowest since Jan. 4, and thirty-year yields slipped 1.5
basis points to 2.01 percent.  Ten-year Treasury yields dropped five basis points to 3.16
percent yesterday.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average sank 1.5 percent, the most in
a month, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.1 percent
yesterday and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price
Index slid 3 percent.  Auction Results  The lowest price at today’s debt auction was 99.72 yen,
matching the median forecast of 11 traders surveyed by Bloomberg
News. That compared with 99.95 yen at the previous auction in
April. The 1.1 percent coupon offered on the new securities was
the least since the November sale.  “The auction results were in line with what the market had
expected,” said Reiko Tokukatsu, a senior fixed-income
strategist at Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. “There wasn’t any
surprise.”  China  bought the most Japanese long-term bonds since at
least 2005 and sold stocks in March as the smaller nation’s
record earthquake spurred demand for safer assets.  China  purchased  a net 234.5 billion yen in long-term bonds
in March, the biggest amount since January 2005, according to
data released today in Tokyo by Japan’s Ministry of Finance.
China sold a net 100 million yen in Japanese stocks and a net
415.7 billion yen of short-term debt, the figures showed.  “It’s possible China expects a low-rate policy after
Japan’s quake and is buying longer-maturity debt for  capital
gains ,” said Makoto Noji, a senior bond and currency strategist
in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one of the 24 primary
dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “This seems to
be part of China’s move to diversify foreign reserves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
