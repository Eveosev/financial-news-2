Synergy Classic Ltd. raised its offer
for a 40.2% stake in the AIM-listed, Moscow regional real-estate
developer RGI International Ltd. to $228 million,  Vedomosti 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Synergy and an unidentified Moscow developer offered DES
Commercial Ltd. about $150 million for 27 percent of RGI with a
one-year option for an additional 13 percent for about $78
million, the newspaper said.  DES rejected an initial offer by Synergy last month for
$208 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
