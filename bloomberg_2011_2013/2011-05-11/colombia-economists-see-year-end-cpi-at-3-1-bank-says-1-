Colombia inflation is likely to end
the year at 3.1 percent, according to a central bank  survey  of
39 economists.  Economists expect the benchmark lending rate to increase to
4.5 percent by year-end from 3.75 percent currently, according
to the average estimate in the survey.  Consumer prices in April climbed 2.84 percent from the same
month a year earlier, the governmentâ€™s statistics agency said
last week. The central bank forecasts inflation to end the year
at the mid-point between 2 percent and 4 percent.  The peso declined 0.8 percent to 1802.00 per dollar at 1:12
p.m. New York time from 1787.10 yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
