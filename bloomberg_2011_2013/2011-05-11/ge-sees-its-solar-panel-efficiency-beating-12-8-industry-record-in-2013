General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
supplier of  wind turbines  in the U.S., expects to exceed the
12.8 percent solar-efficiency record for thin-film modules when
its first commercial-scale panel factory opens in 2013.  Improving solar-panel efficiency, or the amount of sunlight
converted to electricity, would help reduce costs to about 10
cents to 15 cents a kilowatt-hour without subsidies, making it
more competitive with fossil fuels, according to  Victor Abate ,
who oversees solar, wind and renewable energy at Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE.  “Speed is the key here,” Abate said today at a conference
in  New York . The 12.8 percent efficiency that GE reached for its
cadmium telluride panels last year is an industry record for
thin-film technology, and “we’ll be higher than that” when the
factory opens. “Fourteen percent to 15 percent is in the
cards.”  GE plans to select a site for the factory in the second
quarter and to announce the location in the third quarter, he
said. It is considering Colorado and New York, where the company
already employs hundreds of engineers.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s biggest supplier of thin-film
modules, also uses cadmium telluride and increased its
efficiency to 11.7 percent in the first quarter from 11.1
percent a year earlier. The most common solar panels, mostly
made in China, use a thicker layer of silicon and have
efficiency ratings in the high teens.  GE slipped 20 cents to $20.10 at 12:26 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. First Solar, based in Tempe,
Arizona, fell $1.61, or 2.1 percent, to $126.44 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
