Gene Monahan will retire as the  New
York Yankees ’ trainer after this season, his 49th with the Major
League Baseball franchise.  Monahan began work with the Yankees as a spring-training
bat boy and clubhouse attendant, and has been their head trainer
for 39 years, the longest such tenure in the major leagues.  Monahan, 66, missed spring training and part of the regular
season a year ago with what the Yankees described at the time
only as a “significant illness.” He told ESPN.com that he was
being treated for throat and neck cancer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
