The  International Monetary Fund 
agreed to disburse $13.1 million to  Haiti  after reviewing the
country’s progress in implementing policies attached to a $60-
million loan.  “The Haitian economy is recovering, and just over a year
after the devastating earthquake, essential state functions have
been reinstated and prudent macroeconomic policies have helped
support growth and contain inflation to single-digit levels, IMF
Deputy Managing Director Naoyuki Shinohara said in an e-mailed
statement.  The Washington-based IMF last year canceled Haiti’s
outstanding debt and approved a new loan to support the
country’s effort to rebuild its economy after a January
earthquake that killed 300,000 people in the Western
hemisphere’s poorest nation.  Shinohara said the economic outlook is favorable if
authorities and international financial contributors make
‘‘concerted efforts to accelerate the reconstruction and
facilitate the transition from disaster recovery to policies
aimed at ensuring high and sustained growth and poverty
reduction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
