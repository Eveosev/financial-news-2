China ’s stocks fell for the first
time in three days after inflation exceeded government targets
last month, signaling higher  interest rates  that may slow the
world’s second-biggest economy.  Jiangxi Copper Co. led declines for copper producers on
speculation further monetary tightening will curb demand for
industrial metals. SAIC Motor Corp., the nation’s biggest
automaker, dropped more than 2 percent after China’s car sales
decelerated in April. Huaxia Bank Co., partly owned by Deutsche
Bank AG, and China Merchants Bank Co. slid at least 0.9 percent
after the nation’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent.  “The higher-than-expected inflation fueled investors’
concern over inflation and more tightening measures,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in  Shanghai 
“The economy has shown signs of a slowdown and inflationary
pressure isn’t easing at all. That makes it a bad scenario for
the market.”  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 7.2 points, or 0.3
percent, to 2,883.42 at the 3 p.m. close. The CSI 300 Index
declined 0.3 percent to 3,145.08. The Shanghai Composite has
declined 5.7 percent from a five-month high on April 18 amid
concern the government will add to 10 increases in lenders’
reserve-ratio requirements and four increments in interest rates
since early last year to cool inflation. The losses pared the
gauge’s advance this year to 2.7 percent.  China’s April consumer prices exceeded the government’s
full-year target of 4 percent for a fourth straight month. The
gain was more than the 5.2 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 30 economists and compared with a 5.4
percent increase in March.  ‘Pressing Problem’  Huaxia Bank dropped 1.1 percent to 12.18 yuan. China
Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-largest lender, lost 0.9
percent to 14.03 yuan. China’s new local-currency lending
was 739.6 billion yuan last month, a report from the central
bank showed today. The number posted on the central bank’s
website compared with the median 700 billion yuan forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  The statistics bureau said today in Beijing that producer
prices increased 6.8 percent, retail sales rose 17.1 percent in
April and industrial production gained 13.4 percent. Fixed-asset
investment grew 25.4 percent in the first four months of 2011
from a year earlier, today’s report showed.  The government is seeking to control consumer prices that
rose to the highest in three years in March without stifling
growth. Inflation is “the most pressing problem” facing China,
Vice Premier Wang Qishan said at talks in  Washington  this week
where the U.S. pressed for faster gains in the yuan. Economists
predict one more interest-rate increase this year, according to
the median forecast from a Bloomberg survey.  Rate Outlook  China may raise rates “soon’” to control inflation that
will range between 5 percent and 6 percent until July or August,
 Stephen Green , head of Greater China research at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  Jiangxi Copper, the biggest copper producer, slumped 1.3
percent to 33.79 yuan.  Yunnan Copper Industry Co. (000878)  declined 1.3
percent to 22.92 yuan.  The nation’s passenger-car sales slowed in April from the
previous month as the government raised fuel prices and  Japan ’s
record earthquake slowed deliveries. Deliveries of cars
including multipurpose and sport-utility vehicles to dealerships
rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.14 million units, the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in a
statement yesterday. Sales climbed 6.5 percent in March.  SAIC Motor fell 1.8 percent to 16.75 yuan. Baoshan Iron &
Steel Co., the supplier of half of China’s market for automotive
steel, lost 0.4 percent to 6.88 yuan.  A gauge of consumer staples in the CSI 300 rose 0.3
percent. Kweichow Moutai surged 0.9 percent to 185.27 yuan.
Rival Wuliangye Yibin Co. added 1 percent to 33.20 yuan.  Yuan Gains  Today’s inflation figures may buttress the case made by U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  in annual bilateral talks
in Washington this week that China needs a stronger yuan to
contain prices and spur domestic demand.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.06 percent
to 6.3438 per dollar as of 10:17 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the yuan
will strengthen 2.3 percent from the onshore spot rate.  China Southern Airlines Co. the biggest domestic carrier,
gained 1.8 percent to 8.69 yuan.  Air China Ltd. (601111)  added 0.2
percent to 10.88 yuan.  A stronger yuan pares the value of dollar-denominated debt
accumulated by buying planes. Every 1 percent yuan appreciation
will add 600 million yuan ($92 million) to Air China’s earnings,
Rao Xinyu, head of  investor relations , said last month, while
China Southern said on March 29 every 1 percent gain in the yuan
adds 400 million yuan to earnings.  --Irene Shen, Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
