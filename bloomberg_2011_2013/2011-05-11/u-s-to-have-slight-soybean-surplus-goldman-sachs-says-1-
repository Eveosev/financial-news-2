U.S. soybean inventories will be in a
“slight surplus” in the 2010-11 crop year on weaker Chinese
imports of the oilseed, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said as it
raised stockpile estimates.  Increased competition from  South America  will “limit the
U.S. inventory drawdown,” analysts Damien Courvalin and  Allison Nathan  said in a report today. Brazil is the world’s second-
biggest soybean exporter after the U.S., and Argentina ranks
third. The analysts also said the acreage planted with the
oilseed will shrink this year.  “We acknowledge, however, that a longer slowdown in
Chinese imports than we expect and corn-to-soybean acreage
shifts present downside risk to our forecast,” they said.  Soybeans will trade at $15 a bushel in three months’ time,
Goldman Sachs said. The oilseed for July delivery was at $13.385
at 9:03 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade. The bank
forecast a price of $15.75 in both six and 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
