Smartfact Partners, a Paris-based
consulting company, denied a report that it’s advising Redcats
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Michel Noir on a management buyout
of the  PPR (PP)  SA unit.  “There’s no truth” to an article in Challenges magazine
today that Noir is working with Smartfact on a transaction,
Smartfact’s Benoit Ficheur said in a phone interview.  PPR, which is based in Paris, plans to dispose of online
retailer Redcats in addition to the Fnac electronics and media
chain to focus on luxury goods and sports as well as lifestyle
clothing and accessories. Charlotte Judet, a spokeswoman for
PPR, declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
