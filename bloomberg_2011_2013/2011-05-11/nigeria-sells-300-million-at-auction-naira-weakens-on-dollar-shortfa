Nigeria  sold $300 million at a
foreign-exchange auction today, less than the $332.8 million
demanded by lenders, according to the Abuja-based  Central Bank
of Nigeria .  Dollars were sold for between 153.31 naira and 153.71 naira
each, the bank said on its website today. The marginal rate,
which is also used as the prevailing exchange rate, was 153.38
naira compared with 153.18 naira at its previous auction held on
May 9.  It was the fourth successive auction at which the central
bank was unable to meet demand by lenders on behalf of their
customers. The naira weakened 0.5 percent to 157.05 to a dollar
today in the interbank market from 156.25 naira yesterday.  Nigeria’s central bank has been defending the currency of
 Africa ’s top oil producer, attempting to keep it within a 3
percentage point band above or below 150 per dollar at the
central bank’s twice-weekly auctions, in a bid to curb
inflation. The marginal rate at today’s foreign-exchange auction
represented a 2.4 percent devaluation from the target 150 naira
rate.  “It is the demand that is not met at the central bank
auction that is putting pressure on the  interbank market ,”
 Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Financial Derivatives Co., a brokerage, said by phone today.
Increased foreign exchange supply by the central bank at the
next auction next week may ease the pressure on the interbank
market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
