Poland ’s WIG20 Index lost 16.56, or
0.6 percent, to 2,852.76 at 2:23 p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the

185.8 zloty as the price of the metal declined.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)   increased for a fourth day, adding
0.35 zloty, or 0.8 percent, to 46.79 zloty. Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner said first-quarter profit rose to 635.2
million zloty ($233 million) from 22.9 million zloty a year

clothing retailer reported first-quarter net income of 14.1
million zloty, compared with a net loss of 4.78 million zloty a
year earlier. That beat the 3.85 million-zloty mean estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. (KBM PW) climbed 5.7
percent to 33.6 zloty as Slovenia’s second-biggest bank started
trading on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Nova Kreditna last month

stock’s debut at 31.78 zloty a share.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, fell

biggest insurer announced a plan to cut 1,212 jobs, or 9.4
percent of its workforce, this year.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)   advanced 0.11 zloty, or
1.8 percent, to 6.33 zloty, its fourth day of gains. Poland’s
second-largest power utility said first-quarter net income rose
