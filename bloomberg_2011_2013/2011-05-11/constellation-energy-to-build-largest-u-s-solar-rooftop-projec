Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG) ,
which agreed to be bought by Exelon Corp., is building the
largest U.S. rooftop solar-energy project, at a Toys “R” Us
Inc. distribution center in  New Jersey .  Constellation will use 37,000 solar panels from  Energy
Conversion Devices Inc. (ENER)  for the 5.38-megawatt project, Paramus,
New Jersey-based Toys “R” Us said today in a statement. The
system is expected to meet about 72 percent of the Flanders
center’s power needs.  The rooftop system would be the largest at a single
building when complete, overtaking  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) ’s 4.8-megawatt
array that’s being built on top of  Glimcher Realty Trust (GRT) ’s
Jersey Gardens mall, according to the Solar Energy Industry
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
