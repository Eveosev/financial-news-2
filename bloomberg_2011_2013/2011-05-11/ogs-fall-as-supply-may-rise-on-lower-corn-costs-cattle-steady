Hog futures fell on speculation that
supplies may increase after corn prices plunged, curbing feed
costs for producers. Cattle were little changed.  Corn futures tumbled the most in eight weeks after the
government forecast higher U.S. inventories than analysts
expected. The drop in the grain, the main ingredient in
livestock feed, prompted speculation that producers may expand
herds, increasing meat supplies, said Doug Houghton, an analyst
at Brock Associates in  Milwaukee .  Hog futures were “definitely pressured by the sharp drop
in corn prices,” Houghton said. The slump “eased concerns
about the high feed costs,” he said.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.25 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at 93.225 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price has increased 9.3 percent in the
past year.  Corn prices have surged 80 percent in the past 12 months.
Supplies are still “very tight,” Houghton said, and wet
weather from  Ohio  to  North Dakota  has delayed planting this
year.  Cattle futures for June delivery declined 0.125 cent to
$1.0905 a pound. The commodity has climbed 14 percent in the
past year on rising export demand for beef.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.65 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to $1.33025 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
