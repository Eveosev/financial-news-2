New York ’s Metropolitan Museum of Art
has agreed to take over the Madison Avenue home of the Whitney
Museum of American Art, a building designed by Marcel Breuer.  Terms of the agreement in principle -- the second announced
between New York museums in two days -- weren’t disclosed.  Yesterday, the Museum of  Modern Art  agreed to buy the
headquarters of the American Folk Art Museum, which is in
default on bond payments.  The Met-Whitney deal is a collaboration rather than a
purchase. The Met plans to present exhibitions and programming
at the Whitney building for eight years beginning in 2015, when
the Whitney is scheduled to open a new home in downtown
 Manhattan .  To contact the reporters on this story:
