Russian stocks slid to their lowest
in almost a week as commodities dropped on concern accelerating
global inflation may lead to bigger interest-rate increases and
a U.S. report showed an unexpected gain in oil inventories.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks dropped 1.4 percent to
1,654.78 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier
gain of as much as 0.9 percent. OAO Lukoil and OAO Rosneft,
 Russia ’s two largest oil producers, fell 1.6 percent and 1.5
percent, respectively. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the country’s
biggest mining company, slumped 3.1 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index lost 1 percent to 1,908.46.  Crude for June delivery sank as much as 2.9 percent to
$100.92 a barrel while copper retreated for the first time in
three days in  New York .  China  said its inflation rate remained
higher than 5 percent in April, signaling that further monetary
tightening may be needed to cool the fastest-growing Major
economy.  “Market participants are still concerned over persistent
liquidity curbs and slowing growth in China,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , wrote in a e-
mailed report to clients.  Stocks extended declines after a U.S. government report
showed a bigger-than-forecast increase in inventories.  Supplies jumped 3.78 million barrels to 370.3 million in
the week ended May 6, the Energy Department said today in a
weekly report. Oil inventories were forecast to climb by 1.5
million barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey. The increase puts supplies at the
highest level since May 8, 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
