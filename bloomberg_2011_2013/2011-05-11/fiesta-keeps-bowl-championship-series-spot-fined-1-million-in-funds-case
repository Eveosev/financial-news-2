College football’s  Fiesta Bowl  will
be allowed to remain part of the Bowl Championship Series and
will be fined $1 million after an investigation into campaign
contributions and executive compensation.  By remaining in the BCS, schools competing in the Fiesta
Bowl will be eligible to be part of the system that helps
determine college football’s national champion.  In addition to the fine, which will be distributed among
Arizona-based youth charities, the BCS presidential oversight
committee said today in a statement that bowl officials must
take steps to strengthen supervision to avoid future problems.  “We have learned some painful lessons and have already
implemented many of the changes that will prevent this type of
malfeasance from happening in the future,” Duane Woods,
chairman of the Fiesta Bowl, said in a statement. “We commit
ourselves to very high standards of honesty, integrity and
disclosure.”  The Arizona Republic reported in December 2009 that current
and former bowl employees said they were encouraged to make
contributions to certain politicians and then were reimbursed
those funds.  In March, Fiesta Bowl President and Chief Executive Officer
John Junker was fired after failing to cooperate with an
independent  investigation .  The Fiesta Bowl, founded in 1971, is a non-profit
organization that annually hosts college football’s Fiesta Bowl
game, as well as the Insight Bowl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
