Hong Kong  will sell three land
parcels in an auction at 2:30 p.m. today that comes after home
sales in April fell to the lowest volume in two years following
government measures to stem surging prices.  The most expensive site, on Stubbs Road,  Hong Kong Island ,
is designated for housing and is expected to fetch almost HK$4.4
billion ($566 million), based on the median estimate of five
surveyors and analysts polled by Bloomberg News. A site in the
Kowloon Tong area may fetch HK$500 million, and a Yuen Long
district parcel may sell for HK$410 million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
