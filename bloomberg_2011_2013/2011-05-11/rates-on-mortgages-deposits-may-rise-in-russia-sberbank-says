Mortgage rates  in Russia are as low
as they’re going to go and will rise as the central bank
increases the refinancing rate in reponse to inflation, OAO
Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  said on state
television.  “We see a turn in the central bank’s refinancing rate and
a decrease in market liquidity, Gref told state television
Rossiya 24. Mosprime, Russia’s benchmark interbank rate, ‘‘rose
significantly in the last two weeks,” and rates on both
mortgage loans and deposits are likely to rise in the near
future, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
