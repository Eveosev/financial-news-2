SkiStar AB (SKISB) , the Nordic region’s
biggest ski-resort operator, said it is in talks with Andermatt
Swiss Alps AG on developing two Swiss ski resorts as it seeks to
expand outside the Nordic market for the first time.  The total cost to modernize and connect the two Andermatt
and Sedrun ski areas is about 1 billion kronor ($161 million)
and the companies are still negotiating how big SkiStar’s
investment and ownership stake will be, the Stockholm-based
company’s chief financial officer, Magnus Sjoholm, said today by
phone.  The companies signed a letter of intent "regarding mutual
negotiations," they said today in a joint statement.  SkiStar owns three resorts in  Sweden  and two in Norway and
feels comfortable with its size in the Nordic market, Sjoholm
said. Andermatt, part of  Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , plans
to add six new hotels and 490 apartments in the connected
Andermatt and Sedrun area. The plan requires agreements with
current shareholders, creditors and local authorities.  “We hope to have reached an agreement after the summer,
and if it happens earlier that’s even better,” Sjoholm said.
“We’ve received a lot of proposals and when this one turned up
it sounded very exciting. It’s the first time we’ve taken
anything this far.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
