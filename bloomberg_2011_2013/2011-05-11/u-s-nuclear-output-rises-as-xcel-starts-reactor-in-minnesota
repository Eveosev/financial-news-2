U.S. nuclear-power production rose
2.5 percent as  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  switched on the Prairie Island 2
reactor in Minnesota, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 1,822 megawatts from
yesterday to 75,582 megawatts, or 74 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-six of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Xcel’s 545-megawatt Prairie Island 2 reactor is expected to
hit full power today after tripping offline on May 9 because of
a thunderstorm, Patti Nystuen, a spokeswoman for the plant, said
in an e-mail.  A storm caused a disturbance on the region’s transmission
grid that triggered the plant’s protective relays, which prevent
damage to power systems, Nystuen said.  The unit was operating at 100 percent of capacity before
the storm while the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1, another
reactor at the site, was shut for refueling on April 29, Nystuen
said.  The plant is located about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
southeast of Minneapolis, where Xcel is based.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  aborted the startup of the 685-megawatt
Pilgrim 1 reactor in  Massachusetts  when the unit unexpectedly
tripped offline after reaching four percent of capacity. The
cause is under investigation, the NRC said.  The plant, located on the Atlantic coast 4 miles east of
Plymouth, was returning from a refueling outage that began on
April 18.  New York  Reactor  Entergy boosted the 852-megawatt FitzPatrick plant in New
York to 100 percent of capacity from 50 percent yesterday. The
plant is located 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  raised output from the
1,130-megawatt Salem 2 reactor in  New Jersey  to 100 percent of
capacity from 83 percent yesterday.  Another unit at the site, the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 18 miles
south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  The  Nebraska  Public Power District increased power from the
830-megawatt Cooper reactor in Nebraska to 68 percent of
capacity from 47 percent yesterday. It returned from a refueling
and maintenance outage that began March 14.  The unit is near Brownville on the Missouri River 64 miles
south of Omaha. Nebraska Public Power is based in Columbus,
Nebraska.  South Texas 1  South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Co. boosted the
1,410-megawatt South Texas 1 reactor to 100 percent of capacity
from 80 percent yesterday. It is ramping up after a maintenance
and refueling outage that began April 4.  South Texas 2, another 1,410-megawatt unit at the plant  80
miles southwest of Houston, was operating at full power.  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  increased output from the
1,335-megawatt Palo Verde 2 reactor to full power from 85
percent of capacity yesterday. The unit was shut for refueling
and maintenance on April 4.  Units 1 and 3, which have the same capacities as Unit 2,
are operating at full power. The plant is located about 45 miles
west of Phoenix.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 2
reactor in  Florida  to 67 percent of capacity from 60 percent
yesterday.  Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie
1, was operating at 93 percent of capacity. The station is
located about 45 miles north of Palm Beach.  Vermont Yankee  Entergy increased power from the 620-megawatt  Vermont 
Yankee plant to full power from 87 percent of capacity
yesterday. The unit was at 100 percent on May 9.  The plant is located in Vernon, in the southeast corner of
Vermont, 80 miles northwest of  Boston .  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
