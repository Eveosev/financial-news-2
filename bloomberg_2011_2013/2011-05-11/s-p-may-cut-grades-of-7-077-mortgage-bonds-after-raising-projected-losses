Standard & Poor’s  may downgrade 7,077
classes of U.S. home-loan securities, after updating its loss
projections for deals issued during 2005, 2006 and 2007.  The review covers bonds from 1,384 securitizations of
prime, subprime and Alt-A mortgages, the New York-based ratings
company said today in a statement.  “We expect to review these transactions and resolve the
CreditWatch placements over the next several months,” said S&P,
which didn’t provide the amount of debt affected.  Most so-called non-agency mortgage securities issued during
the period have already lost their original investment-grade
ratings. About 90 percent of subprime-mortgage bonds granted AAA
grades when created in 2006 and 2007 were later cut to junk
status, a Senate investigative panel said in a report last
month, which said inflated grades contributed to the worst
financial crisis since the 1930s.  Downgrades can boost the capital needs of banks holding the
bonds and force some investors to sell debt. While diminished,
the dynamic can damage the market, with recent cuts by Moody’s
Investors Service on older subprime bonds with higher ratings
leading to sales, said Karlis Ulmanis a bond manager at
Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont Capital Management, which
oversees about $27 billion.  ‘Forced to Sell’  “As many of these fell below investment grade, investors
were forced to sell them as they fell outside their investment
guidelines,” said Ulmanis, who holds more than $100 million of
subprime bonds and added some securities as a result of the
sales.  Non-agency mortgage securities lack guarantees from
government-supported  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  or federal
agency Ginnie Mae. Subprime loans went to the least creditworthy
borrowers; Alt-A loans, a step up, were often granted to
homeowners who failed to document their incomes. Prime non-
agency bonds typically packaged “jumbo” loans larger than
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance.  S&P released its updated non-agency loss projections in a
March 25 report. For 2007 subprime bonds, expected loan losses
rose to 48.5 percent of original balances, from 43.2 percent in
a 2010 report. For Alt-A securities of that vintage, expected
loan losses, climbed to 36 percent from 31.3 percent. For 2007
prime debt, expected loan losses rose to 11.8 percent, from 9.8
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
