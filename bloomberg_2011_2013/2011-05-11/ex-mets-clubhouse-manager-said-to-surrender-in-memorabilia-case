Former New York Mets clubhouse
manager Charlie Samuels was charged with criminal possession of
almost $2.3 million worth of Mets memorabilia, including
autographed jerseys, bats and baseballs.  Samuels, who spent 27 seasons with the Major League
Baseball team, is also accused of embezzling $24,955 from the
Mets by inflating expense claims for meals provided to umpires,
and with failing to report or pay taxes on $203,789 in income
from gratuities and dues from Mets players and others in 2008
and 2009, Queens District Attorney  Richard Brown  said in a
statement. Samuels was fired in November for “conduct in
violation of club policies,” the team said at the time.  “The autographed sports memorabilia and collectibles
industry has become a multibillion industry and this case
exposes its darker side -- the enthusiast who does not collect
for personal enjoyment but rather stockpiles hundreds of pieces
of sports memorabilia as a long-term investment,” Brown said in
a statement.  Samuels was arraigned today before Queens state Supreme
Court Justice Fernando M. Camacho, Brown said. He is charged
with criminal possession of stolen property, grand larceny,
falsifying business records and criminal  tax fraud , among other
crimes. If convicted of the top charge, he faces as long as 25
years in prison.  Samuels was released on $75,000 bail. His next court date
is June 17.  Jerseys, Bats  The $2.3 million in Mets jerseys, bats, helmets and other
equipment Samuels is charged with criminally possessing was
recovered in November from the basement of a Madison,
 Connecticut , house belonging to a friend of Samuels, Brown said.  Samuels also padded expenses when he signed off on meal
charges submitted to him by the umpire room manager, Brown said,
by listing additional food expenses on catering forms when he
submitted his clubhouse expenses. As a result, Samuels
fraudulently received $24,955 in reimbursement between 2007 and
2010, Brown said in his statement.  Samuels also under-reported dues and gratuities he received
from ball players and others by $203,789 in 2008 and 2009 to
avoid tax liability of about $23,859 for those years, the
statement said. Samuels’ company, Chazmule Inc., also under-
reported its gross income on New York City tax returns by
$87,859 in 2008 and $103,450 in 2009 to avoid tax liabilities of
$6,947 and $8,587 respectively.  “I haven’t had a chance to review the indictment,”
Michael Bachner, an attorney for Samuels, said in a telephone
interview, declining to comment.  “We cooperated fully with the NYPD and the Queens District
Attorney’s office in their lengthy and thorough criminal
investigation,” Jay Horwitz, a Mets spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. “As this is a pending criminal matter, we
will have no further comment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
