Three of 37 companies awarded
licenses to build solar power plants in  India ’s first auction
have secured funding ahead of a July deadline, an industry group
said.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner,  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s largest maker of sports-utility vehicles,
and  Maharashtra Seamless Ltd. (MHS) , the pipe-making unit of the  D.P.
Jindal Group , have achieved financial closure, the Gurgaon-based
 Forum for Advancement of Solar Thermal  said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The group cited an update given at a meeting last week
between the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy  and the
licensees.  India awarded 37 licenses for 620 megawatts of capacity in
December. The winners have been given six months to tie up
financing after signing power purchase agreements with the
state-run power trader NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd., or NVVN,
according to the auction rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
