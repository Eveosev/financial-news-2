Cash premiums for soybeans shipped in
May to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as floods on the lower Mississippi River curbed barge
transportation. The corn basis was steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 60 cents to 70 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 58 cents to 68 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis was 54 cents to 57 cents a
bushel, compared with 55 cents to 56 cents yesterday.  “With the river basically being shut down for all
practical purposes, supplies are getting a little tighter down
there,” said Troy Lust, a commercial grain broker for INTL
FCStone Inc. in West Des Moines,  Iowa .  Soybean futures for July delivery slid 6.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $13.3175 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has gained 38 percent in the
past year.  Corn futures for July delivery tumbled by the CBOT limit of
30 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.7725 a bushel, after the USDA
boosted its estimate for U.S. inventories. The most-active
contract is up 80 percent in the past 12 months.  The  Mississippi River  crested at 47.87 feet yesterday in
Memphis, just below the 1937 record of 48.7 feet, according to
the National Weather Service. The bulge of water caused by the
convergence of the swollen Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Cairo,
 Illinois , is moving slowly downstream toward New Orleans and the
 Gulf of Mexico , which it will reach in about two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
