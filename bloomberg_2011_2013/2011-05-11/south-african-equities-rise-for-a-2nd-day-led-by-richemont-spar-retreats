The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
fell, slipping 34.21, or 0.1 percent, to 32,051.35 at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today:  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up 10 percent of the index, fell 4.99 rand, or 1.5
percent, to 335 rand, taking its drop this year to 2.3 percent.
The prices of commodities including platinum and copper
retreated for the first time in three days as reports on
inflation from  London  to Beijing boosted expectations of higher
 interest rates .  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL)  , the continent’s
largest steelmaker, dropped 2.49 rand, or 3 percent, to 79.61
rand, the lowest close since Jan. 10. First-quarter profit fell
to 184 million rand ($27.3 million) from 745 million rand a year
earlier, it said in a regulatory filing.  Rival  Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium Ltd. (EHS)   slid
1.75 rand, or 3.2 percent, to 52.25 rand, the first decrease in
five days.  Chrometco Ltd. (CMO)  , a ferrochrome development and
exploration company, retreated to the lowest since Feb. 9,
losing 4 cents, or 12.1 percent, to 29 cents. The company
revalued its Rooderand chrome mineral assets and its
attributable monetary value is “substantially lower” than its
inferred resources, it said in a regulatory filing after the
market closed yesterday.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR SJ), the world’s biggest
watchmaker, rose to the highest on record, adding 1.26 rand, or
3 percent, to 43.62 rand, after Chinese export data reassured
investors that global growth remains on track.  Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA SJ), a coal miner, climbed 10
cents, or 1.1 percent, to 9.20 rand, a fourth day of gains,
after saying production of the fuel increased to 1.11 million
metric tons of run-of-mine coal during the three months to March
31.  Datatec Ltd. (DTC)  , a computer-networking company,
surged 2.01 rand, or 5.6 percent, to 37.81 rand, the highest
close since April 1. The company said it expects to report
revenue of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion for the 2012
financial year, with further expansion of operating margins.
Profit after tax is seen at about $84 million, the company said
in a stock exchange statement today.  The  Spar Group Ltd. (SPP)  , the South African food and
liquor retailer, slumped the most in almost two months,
retreating 2.50 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 93.50 rand. Trading
conditions will remain difficult for the remainder of its fiscal
year, it said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
