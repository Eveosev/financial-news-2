The U.S. may require annual fuel-
efficiency improvements of 2 percent to 7 percent from 2017 to
2025 for cars and light trucks, according to the  National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration .  The agency said in a May 10 Federal Register  notice  it will
evaluate the costs and environmental effects of boosting  fuel
efficiency  in the proposed rule it’s scheduled to publish in
September.  Automakers must have a fleet-wide average of 34.1 miles per
gallon, according to the existing fuel-economy rule that applies
through model-year 2016 vehicles. NHTSA is developing the next
rule with the Environmental Protection Agency and  California ’s
Air Resources Board.  The U.S. said last year automakers selling cars in the U.S.
may be required to almost double fuel economy to as much as 62
miles per gallon by 2025 models with annual fuel-economy
increases of as much as 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
