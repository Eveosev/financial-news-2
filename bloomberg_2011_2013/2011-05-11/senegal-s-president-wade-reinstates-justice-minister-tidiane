Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
reinstated Justice Minister Cheikh Tidiane Sy six days after he
resigned, and named new heads to four other ministries.  Sy resigned on May 5 after magistrates started a go-slow to
support demands for more independence from the executive branch.
In a statement posted on its website today, the government gave
no reason for his return to office.  The former minister for Senegalese living abroad, Sada
Ndiaye, moved to the Ministry of Employment, according to the
statement. The other ministries that received new heads were the
Culture Ministry and Ministry for Families.  To contact the reporter on this story:
