Spain â€™s Industry Ministry may lower
the carbon emissions limit above which car registration tax is
payable,  El Pais  reported today, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter.  A draft law on efficiency and renewables includes a
proposal that only cars emitting less than 100 grams of carbon
dioxide per kilometer should be exempt from the tax, the
newspaper said. The present 120-gram maximum means 37 percent of
cars sold are exempt, El Pais said.  If the limit were to be set at 110 grams, 10 percent of
cars would be exempt, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
