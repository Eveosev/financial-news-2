Maja Goettig, chief economist at Bank
BPH SA in Warsaw, comments on the Polish central bank’s decision
today to raise the benchmark seven-day interest rate by a
quarter-point to 4.25 percent.  “This was very unexpected. The Monetary Policy Council
probably raised rates because they were scared of possible
second-round effects after a rise in inflation.  “Investments rebounded strongly in the first quarter and
together with the inflation rate, which is expected to rise even
higher, the central bank must have felt it had to act.  “Today’s increase may mean we’re going to see a bigger
rise in rates this year than expected. I was looking for two
more hikes by the end of this year, but now I’m thinking it
could be more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
