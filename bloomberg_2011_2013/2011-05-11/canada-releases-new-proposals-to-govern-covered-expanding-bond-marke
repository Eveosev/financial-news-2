The Canadian government has proposed
legislation for the country’s covered  bond market  to increase
disclosure for investors while setting minimum standards in the
C$30 billion ($31 billion) market.  The proposals include a framework for bond issuance and
establishing an agency that would oversee the rules, the
Department of Finance said today in a discussion  paper  on its
website. The Canadian government pledged to set up legislation
governing the covered bond market in its 2010 budget.  The government is proposing that borrowers set up a
separate special purpose vehicle to hold the assets that back
the covered bonds. The assets would be sold by the issuing
company to the separate entity, according to the proposed
legislation.  Canadian banks have issued more than C$30 billion in
covered bonds since 2007, tapping a market that dates back 230
years in  Europe . In comparison, the outstanding stock of Canada
Mortgage Bonds is about C$170 billion.  Comments on Canada’s proposals should be received by June
10, the finance department said.  Covered bonds are typically backed by mortgages or public-
sector loans and the collateral underlying the debt remains with
the borrower, which also guarantees the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
