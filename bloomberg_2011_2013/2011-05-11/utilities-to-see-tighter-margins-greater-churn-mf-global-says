Rising commodity prices and
environmental costs are likely to increase competition among
U.K. energy suppliers, trim profits and drive up domestic gas
and electricity prices, according to MF Global.  “Environmental and transmission costs continue to
increase,” MF Global analyst Ashley Thomas said by e-mail
today. “It’s likely to result in higher customer churn and
pressure on supply margins.”  Domestic  gas prices  may rise as much as 15 percent in the
second half of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, the Bank of
England said in a  report  today. The cost of electricity is
likely to increase by about 10 percent, according to the bank.  The cost of gas and power to be delivered later this year
is about 25 percent higher than last year,  Centrica Plc (CNA)  said May
9. Warmer temperatures and energy efficiency measures trimmed
electricity consumption in the first four months of the year by
4 percent, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
