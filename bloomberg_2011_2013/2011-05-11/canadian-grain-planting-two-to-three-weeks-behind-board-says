Grain planting in  Canada  is still two
to three weeks behind normal as fields remain muddy after
excessive precipitation, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  As much as 5.5 centimeters (2.2 inches) of rain fell in
parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba last week, the board said
today in a  statement .  Some “isolated” planting is occurring in all provinces,
while “most areas are still too wet for widespread seeding,”
the agency said. Some river levels also are beginning to drop,
while the Assiniboine, Qu’Appelle and Souris rivers are
flooding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
