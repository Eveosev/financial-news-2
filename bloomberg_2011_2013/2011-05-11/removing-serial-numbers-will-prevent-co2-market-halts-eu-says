The  European Union proposal  to make
confidential the serial numbers of carbon dioxide permits will
help prevent further disruption to the  spot market , the European
Commission said.  “Given that stolen allowances remain valid compliance
instruments and that in principle most registries don’t even
allow users to select specific serial numbers when making
transfer requests, there is no imperative for the market to see
the serial numbers,” the Brussels-based commission, regulator
of the market, said today in an e-mailed response to questions.  A further element of the commission’s proposal is a so-
called ownership-transfer rule, “which creates certainty for
recipients of allowances in registry accounts that the
allowances cannot be taken away in case it turns out later that
they have at some stage been involved in fraudulent
transactions,” the commission said. That doesn’t remove “the
possibility of legal claims for compensation,” it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
