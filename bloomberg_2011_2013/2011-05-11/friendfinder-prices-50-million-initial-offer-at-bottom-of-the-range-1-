FriendFinder Networks Inc., the
publisher of Penthouse magazine, raised $50 million in an
initial public offering after selling shares at the bottom of
its price range.  The operator of websites including AdultFriendFinder.com
and Cams.com sold five million shares at $10 apiece, according
to a company statement today. FriendFinder, which is based in
 Boca Raton , Florida, had offered shares at $10 to $12 each,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  FriendFinder will use the proceeds to pay down debt, it
said in the statement. The company postponed an IPO last year
that sought to raise as much as $240 million and in 2008 had
announced plans for an offering of up to $460 million, SEC
filings show.  Imperial Capital Group Inc. of  Los Angeles  and  Ladenburg
Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (LTS)  of Miami managed the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
