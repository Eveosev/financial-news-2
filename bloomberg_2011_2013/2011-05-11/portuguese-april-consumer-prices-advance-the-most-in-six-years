Portugal ’s consumer price index rose
4 percent in April from a year earlier, the most in at least six
years and up from 3.9 percent the prior month.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
rose 0.6 percent from March, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement.  Using the institute’s own methods, consumer prices rose 4.1
percent from a year earlier and 0.4 percent from March.
Excluding energy and unprocessed food, prices rose 2.6 percent
from a year earlier, compared with a 2.4 percent increase in
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
