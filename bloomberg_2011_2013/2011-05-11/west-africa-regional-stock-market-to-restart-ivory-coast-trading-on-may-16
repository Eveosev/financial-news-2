The West African regional stock
market will resume trading in Abidjan,  Ivory Coast ’s commercial
capital, on May 16, after the country’s violent post-election
crisis eased.  Trading on the exchange, which relocated to Bamako, Mali in
February, has picked up since the security situation improved in
Abidjan and banks in the city reopened their branches,
Abdelkader N’Diaye, information systems director of the Bourse
Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres, said by phone today.  Security forces loyal to ex-President Laurent Gbagbo seized
the BRVM’s offices and trading on the exchange was halted from
Feb. 11 until it reopened in Bamako March 1. Activity on the
bourse more than halved as bank branches closed in  Ivory Coast 
over insecurity.  Gbagbo, who refused to cede power to his rival  Alassane Ouattara  after losing a disputed November presidential election,
was captured in Abidjan April 11. Lenders have reopened their
branches over the past week as the security situation calmed.  The BRVM’s composite index of 38 companies declined 0.3
percent to 153.06 today, according to a statement on the
bourse’s website. Companies from francophone West African
nations and Guinea-Bissau trade their shares on the BRVM.  Senegal’s  Sonatel (SNTS)  SA, a telecommunications company, is the
biggest by market value. Eight banks, including Lome-based
 Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETIT) , are listed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
