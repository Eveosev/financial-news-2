Malaysia ’s ringgit rose, approaching
a 13-year high, on speculation the central bank will further
raise  interest rates  and favor currency appreciation to help
fight inflation. Government bonds declined.  Bank Negara Malaysia boosted its overnight policy rate to 3
percent from 2.75 percent on May 5, the first increase since
July, saying the local economy faces higher inflationary
pressure in the second half of this year. A stronger currency
would help reduce the cost of raw-materials imports after Prime
Minister Najib Razak cut sugar subsidies this month to help trim
the  budget deficit . Crude oil has gained 7.4 percent this week
in  New York  following a 15 percent plunge last week.  “There’s room for a stronger currency and rate increases
in Malaysia and across the region,” said Hasdi Mamat, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bank of Muamalat Malaysia Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “Inflation is still an issue if the rebound in
commodities is sustained.”  The ringgit advanced 0.3 percent to 2.9820 per dollar as of
4 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has appreciated 2.8 percent so far in 2011 and
touched 2.9598 on May 2, the strongest level since September
1997.  Gains in the ringgit were limited after a government report
today showed industrial production slowed in March. Output rose
2.4 percent from a year earlier following a 5.2 percent advance
in February. Economists predicted a 3 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Three-year notes fell for a second day, pushing yields to
near a one-week high before a state debt auction tomorrow.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014
increased 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.3
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.04, or
40 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.4.  The treasury will sell an additional 3.5 billion ringgit
($1.2 billion) of September 2017 bonds tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
