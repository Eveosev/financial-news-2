A candidate for  Thailand ’s main
opposition party linked to ex-leader  Thaksin Shinawatra  was shot
and wounded yesterday after a royal decree took effect to
dissolve Parliament and hold an election on July 3.  Pracha Prasopdee, a lawmaker with the Pheu Thai party,
survived the attack on his car last night after being shot once
in the back, police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri said by phone.
Police are investigating the shooting, he said.  “Pracha by nature is not scared about these incidents,”
Anudit Nakornthob, a lawmaker with Pheu Thai, said by phone.
“He will continue running in the election.”  The shooting comes after Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva 
on May 8 called for peace in announcing an election following
three years of political violence that claimed about 100 lives.
Parties linked to Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and
lives overseas after fleeing a jail sentence, have won the past
four nationwide votes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
