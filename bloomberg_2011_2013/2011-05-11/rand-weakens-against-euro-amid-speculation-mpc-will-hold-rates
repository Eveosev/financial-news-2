The rand weakened against the euro
and dollar for a third day on speculation  South Africa  will lag
behind the  European Central Bank  in raising interest rates,
eroding the currency’s yield advantage.  South  Africa ’s currency lost 0.9 percent to 6.8304 per
dollar at 4:43 p.m. in Johannesburg, its weakest intraday level
since April 21, and depreciated 0.3 percent to 9.7454 per euro.  The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will tomorrow
hold its benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent, according to
all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Manufacturing growth
slowed in March from a seven-month high in February, adding to
speculation the central bank won’t raise rates in 2011 as it
aims to aid a recovery in Africa’s biggest economy.  “The rand has weakened further today on increased
expectations that the  Reserve Bank  will keep interest rates
flat,” Shireen Darmalingam, an analyst at Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in a research note. “Today’s data
does not bode well for South Africa from a GDP differential
perspective, which could prompt further rand weakness in the
near term.”  Growth in factory output, which accounts for 15 percent of
the economy, eased to an annual 4.6 percent in March from a
revised 5.7 percent in February, Statistics South Africa said on
its website today. The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was 3.7 percent. Output rose a seasonally adjusted
1.6 percent in the month.  “The rand’s carry-trade appeal could diminish this week if
the Reserve Bank delivers a dovish policy statement and keeps
the repo rate at 5.5 percent,”  Standard Bank ’s  Michael Keenan 
wrote in an earlier research note.  Carry Trade  In the carry trade, investors borrow in currencies of
countries with low interest rates and invest the proceeds in
high-yield currencies. The ECB last month raised its benchmark
rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 percent and said it would
monitor inflation closely in coming months.  Bonds declined, snapping a three-day advance. The 13.5
percent notes due 2015 fell 19 cents to 121.39 rand, driving the
yield four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, higher to
7.60 percent. The 10.5 percent securities due 2026 slipped 10
cents to 116.65 rand, boosting the yield one basis point to 8.55
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
