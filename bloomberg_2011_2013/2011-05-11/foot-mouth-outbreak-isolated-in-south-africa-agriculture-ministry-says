South Africa ’s Agriculture Ministry
said the virus involved in the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak
in the KwaZulu-Natal province has been isolated.  The virus was isolated from samples collected from one dip
tank in the province and a feedlot in Gauteng province, the
minstry said in an e-mailed statement from  Pretoria  today.  “This revelation puts to rest speculation on the origin of
the infection and also points out that the infection did not
originate from any neighbouring country,” according to the
statement. More than 93,000 cattle have been vaccinated and the
disease is under control, with a second round of vaccinations
under way, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
