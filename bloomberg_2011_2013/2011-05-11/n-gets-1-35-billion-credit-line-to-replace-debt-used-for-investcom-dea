MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africaâ€™s largest
mobile-phone company, obtained a $1.35 billion credit line to
replace loans used for its 2006 acquisition of Investcom LLC.  The three-year revolving credit was increased from $1
billion after lenders offered more than the company sought,
according to a statement from  Barclays Capital , which
coordinated the financing. The deal was joined by 14 banks in
syndication.  Johannesburg-based MTN bought Lebanese phone group
Investcom for $5.5 billion, using $3.5 billion of debt. The
loans paid a margin of 75 basis points and 90 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate and mature in July,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
