French first lady Carla Bruni- Sarkozy, the 43-year-old wife of President  Nicolas Sarkozy ,
again fended off questions on whether she’s pregnant.  “You are doing your job in asking, and I’m doing my job in
not responding,” she said today in an  interview  with Paris-
based RTL Radio. “I try to protect my private life as best I
can. I think people understand.”  She declined to answer a similar question in an interview
in the Le Parisien newspaper earlier this month. Speculation
that Bruni-Sarkozy is pregnant was first reported in celebrity
magazine “Closer.”  If true, Italian-born Bruni-Sarkozy’s baby would be the
first for a French incumbent head of state since Empress Eugenie
gave birth to Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte at the Palais des
Tuileries in Paris 155 years ago. Sarkozy may seek a second term
in the May 2012 presidential election.  Carlo Bruni, using her maiden name, appears in Woody Allen’s latest film, “Midnight in Paris,” which opens tonight
at the  Cannes Film Festival . She told RTL that she declined an
invitation to attend the festival for “private and professional
reasons.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
