Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
1.5 percent to 862,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Output was the lowest since the week ended April 15.
Stockpiles rose 3.4 percent to 20.4 million barrels, the
department said in a report released in  Washington , enough to
supply the market for 22.9 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
slumped 3.9 percent to 4.87 million barrels a day in the
steepest weekly decline since Dec. 31. Refiners receive a 45-
cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the
motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery tumbled 7.5 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $2.50 a gallon at 10:35 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 5.1 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
