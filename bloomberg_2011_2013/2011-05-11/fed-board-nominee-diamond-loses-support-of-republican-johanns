Peter Diamond , the Nobel Prize-
winning economist who’s failed to win lawmakers’ approval to be
a Federal Reserve governor, lost the support of a Republican
senator who backed his nomination last year.  Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns, who voted twice in the
Banking Committee to back Diamond, said in a statement on his
website today that “with our country spending its way into a
crisis, I can no longer support a nominee so vocally in favor of
more spending, more stimulus, and more quantitative easing.”  The switch may further dim Diamond’s chances at the seat as
the Banking Committee prepares for a third vote tomorrow on
Diamond. Johanns was one of three Republicans, among 10 on the
banking panel last year, to vote for Diamond. The other two,
Utah’s  Robert Bennett  and New Hampshire’s  Judd Gregg , are no
longer in the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
