European Union emission allowances
declined as German power for 2012 erased its gains, curbing the
incentive to sell electricity forward.  EU carbon permits for December fell 0.5 percent to 16.87
euros ($24.20) a metric ton on Londonâ€™s ICE Futures Europe
exchange as of 2 p.m.  German power for 2012 fell 5 cents to 59 euros a megawatt-
hour after rising as high as 59.35 euros earlier today,
according to prices from brokers compiled by Bloomberg.
Northwest Europe coal for next year fell 15 cents to $128.85 a
ton, tracking declines for  Brent crude .  To contact the reporter on this story:
