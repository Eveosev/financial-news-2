U.S. corn reserves before the
2012 harvest may rebound from a 15-year low after higher
prices spur farmers to boost acres, the government said.
Soybean and wheat inventories may fall next year.  Unsold supplies of U.S. corn will rise 23 percent to
900 million bushels (22.85 million metric tons) by Aug. 31,
2012, from a revised 730 million projected for this year,
the lowest since 1996, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. The average estimate of 30 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was 822 million bushels.  The USDA “needs to encourage the producers out there
to fight all the battles they can to get this stuff
planted,” said  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst for North
American Risk Management Services Inc. in Chicago. “We
need every bushel” to meet rising demand, he said.  Corn prices surged 91 percent on the Chicago Board of
Trade in the year ended yesterday, reaching a 31-month high
of $7.8875 a bushel on April 11. Yesterday, futures for
July delivery were little changed at $7.0725 a bushel.  Larger corn inventories may lead to lower costs for
companies including hog-processor  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  and
poultry-producer Sanderson Farms Inc. Ethanol makers such
as Archer Daniels Midland Co. may also see lower expenses.
The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer and exporter of
corn.  Increased Acreage  In a survey released in March, U.S. farmers indicated
they planned to sow 92.178 million acres with corn this
year, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier. That crop will be
harvested in the marketing year beginning Sept. 1.  Average yields may fall to 158.7 bushels an acre from
an estimated 152.8 bushels for last year’s crop, boosting
production to 13.505 billion bushels, compared with 12.447
billion collected a year earlier, the USDA said. Wet
weather from Ohio to  North Dakota  has delayed planting this
year.  “There’s worry about the northern Plains because it’s
wet there, and in the eastern Corn Belt,” said  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “It makes you really wonder how close to trend-line
yields we can get.”  Soybean Supplies  U.S. soybean supplies will total 160 million bushels
by Aug. 31, 2012, or 5.9 percent less than the revised 170
million projected for this year, the USDA said.  “ China  has had a serious slowdown in imports this
year,” spurring a gain in U.S. reserves, said  Rich Nelson ,
the director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois . Buyers are favoring  Brazil , the biggest exporter
after the U.S., because the South American nation may
harvest a record crop, he said.  The soybean crop that U.S. farmers will begin
collecting in September, for the 2011-2012 marketing year,
will total 3.285 million bushels, down 1.3 percent from the
previous harvest, the USDA said.  Wheat Inventories  Unsold supplies of U.S. wheat as of May 31, 2012, will
be 702 million bushels, 16 percent lower than a year
earlier, the USDA said. The U.S. may produce 2.043 billion
bushels for the crop year starting June 1, down 7.5 percent
from 2.208 billion in the current year.  Drought in the southern and central U.S. Great Plains
is paring production even after acres increased, Nelson
said. “We’re seeing continuous declines each week” in the
quality of the crop, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion
in 2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government
figures show. Wheat ranked fourth at $13 billion, behind
hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
