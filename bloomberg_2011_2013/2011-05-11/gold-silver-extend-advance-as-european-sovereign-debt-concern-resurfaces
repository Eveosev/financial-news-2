Gold may gain for a fourth day in  New
York  as concerns about inflation and  Europe ’s debt woes spur
demand for precious metals as a protection of wealth.  China ’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier and have exceeded the government’s target each
month this year, data showed today. The euro fell against the
dollar amid speculation European leaders are slowing the drive
to grant  Greece  additional aid, fueling concern the nation may
be forced to restructure its debt.  “We still have unresolved issues with the euro zone,”
said Bernard Sin, the head of currency and metal trading at MKS
Finance SA, a bullion refiner in Geneva. “In the long term, it
may be sensible to hedge against inflation with gold. Physical
demand is extremely good” from  India , he said.  Gold for June delivery fell 50 cents to $1,516.40 an ounce
by 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices reached a record
$1,577.40 on May 2 before slumping 4.2 percent last week.
Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,516.20 in
London.  Bullion rose to $1,524.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,513.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Spot
prices have advanced in the past 10 years, the longest run of
gains since at least 1920 in London.  China’s inflation was more than the 5.2 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 30 economists and compared
with a 5.4 percent increase in March. The government aims to
limit inflation to 4 percent this year, and has raised  interest
rates  four times since October to cool growth. Inflation in
 Germany  accelerated more than initially estimated in April, data
showed today.  ‘Appetite’ for Gold  “Signs of continued pressures might see the market’s
preoccupation with rising global inflation resurface, and
consequently see some inflation-hedge demand,” Marc Ground, an
analyst at Standard Bank Plc, wrote in a report. “With the
resurfacing of euro-zone sovereign-debt concerns, we expect to
see continued appetite for gold and silver.”  Standard & Poor’s this week downgraded Greece’s credit
rating for the fourth time since April 2010, signaling that the
region’s debt crisis is escalating. European leaders slowed the
country’s drive for extra aid, saying the government in  Athens 
must first make good on pledges to overhaul an economy mired in
a three-year recession.  UBS AG’s gold sales to India so far this year are more than
10 percent higher than in the same period last year, London-
based analyst  Edel Tully  said today in a report. India is the
biggest buyer of bullion.  Silver Prices  Silver for July delivery declined 0.6 percent to $38.25 an
ounce on the Comex, after climbing the previous two days.  Silver futures slumped 27 percent last week, the worst
weekly drop since at least 1975, as investors sold commodities
from oil to copper and exchange owner  CME Group Inc. (CME)  increased
the cost of making new speculative positions. Prices slid as
much as 34 percent since reaching a 31-year high of $49.845 an
ounce on April 25. A  bear market  is defined by some investors as
a decline of 20 percent or more.  Silver assets held in exchange traded products rebounded
from a six-month low, gaining 208.03 metric tons, or 1.5
percent, to 14,399.24 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Assets dropped 7.6 percent in the six days through May 9. Gold
ETP holdings fell 4.49 tons, or 0.2 percent, to 2,050.15 tons
yesterday, data showed.  Palladium for June delivery was down 1 percent at $725.60
an ounce. Platinum for July delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$1,791.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
