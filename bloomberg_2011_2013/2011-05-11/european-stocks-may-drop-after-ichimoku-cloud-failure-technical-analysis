Gains in European stocks may stall
after equity index futures failed to break out of a pattern
known as the ichimoku cloud, according to a technical analyst at
Market Securities in Geneva.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June gained
0.6 percent to 2,922 as of 2:10 p.m. in  London . The contract
must close above 2,925 for two consecutive days to confirm an
exit from the cloud, an area plotted from the midpoints of
historic highs and lows, Jean-Charles Gand said in e-mailed
comments today.  The Euro Stoxx 50 has climbed 8.5 percent from this year’s
low on March 16 as companies reported results that topped
analysts’ estimates and the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its
pledge to keep  interest rates  low for an extended period. The
rally trims the drop since Feb. 18 to 3.7 percent. The failure
to breach the cloud pattern casts doubt on the momentum behind
the gains, according to Gand.  “Prices stayed beneath the validation line yesterday,” he
said. “It’s premature to say the correction is over.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Ichimoku analysis was developed by
a Japanese journalist in the 1940s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
