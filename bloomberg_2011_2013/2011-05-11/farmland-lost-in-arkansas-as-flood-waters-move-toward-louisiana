More than 1 million acres (405,000
hectares) of  Arkansas  farmland is under water as floods caused
damage that the state expects will top $500 million, while
further upstream farmers in Missouri are trying to replant corn.  In Arkansas, about 300,000 acres, and about $300 million of
the losses, are in rice fields, the state Farm Bureau Federation
said in a  statement  on its website. In  Louisiana , officials say
3 million acres may be inundated, much of it non-farmland. In
Missouri, where at least 130,000 acres were flooded, some
farmers are trying to get back into their fields, said Dan
Gieseke, the state’s farm-loan chief.  “The river’s going down, and it’s drying out in some
places” in the southeast, Gieseke said. An official damage
estimate may not be available until after May 20, he said.  Damage estimates for Arkansas, the biggest rice-growing
state, don’t include costs to repair farmland and equipment as
well as lost crops. Those losses could add up to tens of
millions of dollars, the Farm Bureau said. Farmers were expected
to plant 1.3 million acres of rice this year, the organization
said. Cotton losses may total $66 million, it said.  Flooding along the  Mississippi River  has caused damage from
 Illinois  to Louisiana and disrupted inland shipping of raw
materials to export terminals in the  Gulf of Mexico . The river
drains 41 percent of the continental U.S. and is the third-
largest watershed in the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
