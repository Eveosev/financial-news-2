AS Silvano Fashion Group, the second-
largest listed Baltic clothing company, said first-quarter
profit more than doubled mainly on rising demand in Russia and
Belarus.  Net profit increased to 5.1 million euros ($7.3 million)
from 2.5 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company
said in a regulatory statement late yesterday. Revenue rose 27
percent to 25.5 million euros.  The Russian market, which provided 59 percent of revenue,
is “doing very well,” while the Belarusian market was very
strong in the first quarter, the company said.  The company added that there nonetheless were
“difficulties related to the forex market” in Belarus from
March 16 after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the
country’s debt. The situation is expected to stabilize in the
second quarter, Silvano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
