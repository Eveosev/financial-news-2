Kenyaâ€™s Rural Electrification
Authority needs 28 billion shillings ($328.4 million) to connect
7,000 public buildings to the national electricity grid over the
next two years, the  Daily Nation  reported.  The state-run agency plans to provide power to 22 percent
of all buildings including hospitals, schools and trading
centers in rural areas by next year and 100 percent by 2013, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing Zachary Ayieko, chief
executive officer of the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
