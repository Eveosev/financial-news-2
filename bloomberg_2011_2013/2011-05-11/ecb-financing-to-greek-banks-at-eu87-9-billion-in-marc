Greek banks’ reliance on European
Central Bank liquidity dropped for a third straight month in
March, the country’s central bank said.  Lenders borrowed a total of 87.9 billion euros ($125.7
billion) in the ECB’s refinancing operations, compared with 90.4
billion euros in February, according to a statement posted by
the Athens-based  Bank of Greece (TELL)  on its website today.  “It’s a positive trend,” Deutsche Bank AG analyst
Dimitris Giannoulis said by telephone today. “Total exposure is
falling and this seems to be on Greek banks deleveraging loans
and also substituting collateral with state-guarantees, which
would be liable to a smaller haircut.”  Greek banks have been hurt by concerns over their high
holdings of Greek  government bonds  and speculation the country
may have to restructure its debt. In May last year, Greece
agreed to austerity measures in exchange for a 110 billion-euro
bailout from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund .  The ECB is trying to convince politicians that Greece can’t
be allowed to restructure their debts, a move that Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi says could see part of the
Greek banking system collapse.  Greece ’s government and central bank, to help restore
funding, will extend 30 billion euros in additional state
guarantees, which will be contingent on banks detailing how they
will wean themselves off ECB money. ECB funding to Greek banks
is down 9.8 billion euros since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
