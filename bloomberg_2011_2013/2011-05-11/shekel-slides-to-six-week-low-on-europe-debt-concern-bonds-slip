The shekel fell to the lowest level
in almost six weeks as investors sought the safety of the dollar
on speculation  Greece  may be forced to restructure debt amid
uncertainty about Europe’s willingness to offer more aid.  Greece needs to stay the budget-cutting course to win an
increase in the 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) lifeline granted
a year ago, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said yesterday.
Greece’s unions kept ferries docked at ports, grounded flights
and shut hospitals and schools today in renewed protests against
Prime Minister George Papandreou’s plans to sell state assets
and usher in more spending cuts.  “The strength in the greenback and weakness in the euro is
pushing down most emerging-market currencies, including the
shekel, on risk aversion,”  Jonathan Katz , a Jerusalem-based
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc., said by telephone.  The shekel weakened as much as 1.1 percent to 3.4887 per
dollar, the lowest since March 31, and was down 0.8 percent at
3.4810 at 4:52 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The yield on the 5 percent
Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 gained one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 5.23 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close.
The extra yield investors demand to hold the 5 percent note
instead of similar-maturity Treasuries, which reached a 2011
high of 237.1 basis points on May 6, rose one basis point to
228.3 today.  “The wide spread with the U.S. is being maintained as the
central bank is expected continue tightening  interest rates  to
contain inflation,” Katz said.  Consumer prices in April likely increased 0.8 percent from
the previous month, according to the median estimate of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, after rising 0.2 percent in
March. Annual inflation may slow to 4.2 percent from 4.3
percent, according to the median of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  will
release the data May 15.  The Bank of  Israel  has increased interest rates by 2.5
percentage points since August 2009 in an attempt to rein in
inflation, which is above the government’s 1 percent to 3
percent target range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
