Japanese and Australian stock futures
declined as commodities tumbled amid concern that accelerating
global inflation may curb economic growth.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,  Japan ’s
biggest commodities trader, fell 1.4 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No.
1 oil producer and the world’s largest mining company, sank 2
percent after the  crude oil  and metal prices sank. ADRs of  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 electronics exporter, slid 0.6 percent
after the yen strengthened against the euro, cutting the
earnings outlook for exporters.  “The inflation concern is causing investors to avoid risk
assets,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million
in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “That is the
underlying reason for a slump in the commodity market and the
weaker euro.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,775 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,860
in  Osaka , Japan. The futures were bid in the pre-market at 9,780
in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index lost 0.2 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent today. In New York, the index slumped 1.1 percent to
1,342.08 yesterday, its biggest decline since March 16, as
commodities tumbled amid a strengthening dollar and inflation
concerns.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 5.5 percent to settle
at $98.21 a barrel yesterday in  New York  after an Energy
Department report showed that U.S. supplies surged and fuel
demand slipped.  Copper yesterday fell to the lowest price in five months
after China reported inflation remains above the government’s
target, signaling further monetary-policy tightening that may
curb metal demand. Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent from a year
earlier and banks extended 740 billion yuan ($114 billion) of
local-currency loans, according to reports yesterday from the
statistics bureau and central bank.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum lost 1.9 percent yesterday, its first drop
in four days.  Euro Falls  The euro fell against most major counterparts as
speculation European leaders are slowing the drive to grant
 Greece  additional aid fueled concern the nation may have to
restructure debt.  The European currency depreciated to as low as 114.57 yen
today in  Tokyo , the weakest level since March 28. A weaker euro
cuts the value of European income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.6 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 70 of the 1,022 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 497 companies
in the MSCI index that have reported results for the latest
quarter, 192 have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 198 have
missed them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
