Croatian tourist arrivals fell an
annual 4.7 percent in March to 202,780, the Zagreb-based
 statistics office  said today in a statement on its website.  Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic
product in the Adriatic Sea nation. It boosts consumption,
creates jobs and is vital to the government’s effort to narrow
its budget gap, forecast at 4.2 percent for 2011.  “This season we can expect the return of growth in
tourism, as positive trends in the  euro zone  reflect in the
Croatian economy,” said Zdeslav Santic, chief analyst at
 Societe Generale  - Splitska Banka d.d., before the data release.  Revenue from tourism may grow as much as 6 percent this
year, Santic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
