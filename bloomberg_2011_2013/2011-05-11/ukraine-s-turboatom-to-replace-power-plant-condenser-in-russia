VAT  Turboatom (TATM) , Ukraine’s biggest
turbine maker, will supply a condenser to a nuclear power plant
in  Russia  to replace an old one.  Kharkiv-based Turboatom will replace a condenser at the
Balakovskaya power plant to increase its capacity and extend its
working lifespan, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The new condenser is to be supplied by July 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
