Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) ,  Brazil ’s
biggest health insurer by market value, jumped the most in seven
months after posting better-than-forecast earnings.  Shares advanced 5.2 percent to 19.50 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the biggest-one-day gain since Oct. 13. The company said first-quarter adjusted
net income increased 10 percent from a year ago to 89 million
reais ($55 million), exceeding the average estimate for profit
of 73 million reais among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Amil reported a “very strong” improvement in its medical
loss ratio, the percentage of premium revenue spent on health
care, Credit Suisse Group AG said. MLR was 68 percent in the
first-quarter, down from 71 percent a year earlier, according to
the filing.  The decline “reflects management’s efficiency on
controlling costs and its ability to fully perform the turn-around at Medial, which has been a concern among some
investors,” analysts Natalia Lacava and Luiz Otavio Campos
wrote in a note to clients.  Amil acquired Medial Saude SA in 2009. Medial was then the
country’s third-biggest health care insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
