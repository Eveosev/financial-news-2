What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said domestic inventories will be larger than
analysts expected, said Jason Britt, the president of brokerage
Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  after the government reported
that U.S. stockpiles next year may be bigger than analysts
expected as exports slow, Britt said.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on the prospect of larger grain supplies, Britt said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.3 cent a
pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down $3 per 2,000
pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
