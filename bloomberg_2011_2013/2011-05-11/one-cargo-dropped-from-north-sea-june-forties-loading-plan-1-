One cargo of benchmark North Sea
Forties crude, for June 11 to June 13 loading, was dropped from
the export program, according to a revised shipping schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The shipments will total 23 cargoes instead of the original
24, the plan showed. Forties is one of four North Sea crude
grades used to price more than half of global oil. The other
blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  A total of six cargoes have been dropped from loading
schedules over the past month, with one for April, four for May
and one for June, shipping plans showed.  The 220,000-barrel-a-day Buzzard field, the biggest blend
in the Forties crude stream, is running at a reduced rate of
about 50 percent because of problems with the cooling system
after resuming operations May 7, Pierre Alvarez, a Calgary-based
spokesman for operator Nexen Inc., said May 9.  “We are going to be running at about half production level
between now and sometime in early June,” Frank Chapman, Chief
Executive Officer of BG Group Plc, said yesterday on a
conference call. BG, the U.K.’s third-largest oil and gas
company, has a 21.7 percent share of the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
