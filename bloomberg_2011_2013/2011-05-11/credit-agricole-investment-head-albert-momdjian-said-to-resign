Albert Momdjian,  Credit Agricole â€™s
head of  investment banking  for the Middle East and North Africa,
plans to leave the bank, two people familiar with the matter
said.  Momdjian resigned today and will remain in the Middle East,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the matter is private.  Momdjian declined to comment when called today. A
spokeswoman for Credit Agricole also declined to comment.  Momdjian was head of investment banking for Credit Agricole
since 2006 when the bank was known as Calyon. He also worked for
Merrill Lynch International and Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
