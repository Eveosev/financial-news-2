Inflation in  Germany ,  Europe ’s
largest economy, accelerated more than initially estimated in
April after energy costs surged.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, jumped to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent in March,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. That’s an
upward revision from the first estimate of 2.6 percent on April
27. From March, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent, more than the
0.2 percent initially reported.  The price of crude oil rose above $113 a barrel in April,
helping to drive euro-area inflation to 2.8 percent. The
 European Central Bank , which aims to keep inflation just below 2
percent, last month raised its benchmark interest rate for the
first time in almost three years. With economic growth gathering
speed, the ECB is concerned workers will demand compensation for
higher food and energy costs, entrenching faster inflation.  “All the signs are that inflation risks are increasing,”
 Joerg Kraemer , chief economist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt ,
told Bloomberg Television. “It’s a clear signal for the ECB to
deliver a series of rate hikes.”  Wholesale prices rose 0.2 percent in April from March and
9.2 percent from a year earlier, the statistics office said in a
separate release. Energy costs were the main driver of consumer-
price inflation, with light heating oil up 26.7 percent in the
year and fuel 12 percent more expensive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
