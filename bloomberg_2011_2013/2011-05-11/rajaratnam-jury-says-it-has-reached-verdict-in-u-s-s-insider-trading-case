The jury weighing criminal insider-
trading charges against Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam in  Manhattan  federal court said it has reached a
verdict.  The eight women and four men of the jury are to deliver
their verdict in Manhattan federal within the hour, according to
a courtroom deputy.  Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested in October 2009 in the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors, relying in part on wiretaps of the defendantâ€™s
phone calls, said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders about 15 stocks.  Rajaratnam, who said he based the trades on research, was
tried on five counts of conspiracy and nine counts of securities
fraud. He faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of
the most serious charges. The trial began March 8.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
