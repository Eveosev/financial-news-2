Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s second-
biggest bank, may say first-quarter profit fell 2 percent as
lower income from lending and trading more than offset a decline
of provisions for bad loans.  Net income probably declined to 672 million euros ($965
million) from 688 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 571 million euros to 943 million euros.  “In our view, focus will be on the retail division, which
is Intesa’s driver of growth,” Francesca Tondi, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley, wrote in a May 10 report. “We expect lower
provisions consistent with the guided moderate asset quality
normalization,” she said.  Chief Executive Officer  Corrado Passera  plans to raise as
much as 5 billion euros by selling new shares to boost capital
before the implementation of stricter capital rules. The stock
sale is part of Intesa’s new business plan, which targets net
income of 4.2 billion euros by 2013 and 5.6 billion euros in
2015.  Net trading may show a decline to 183 million euros in the
quarter from 218 million euros, while net commissions probably
rose 2 percent to 1.44 billion euros. Loan-loss provisions may
have declined 7 percent to 700 million euros, according to the
estimates.  The Milan-based bank is scheduled to publish earnings May
13. The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and the
year-earlier results, with figures in millions of euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
