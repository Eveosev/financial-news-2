The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ compliance with record production cuts
dropped in April as output rose from  Saudi Arabia  and Nigeria.  Daily production from the 11 OPEC members that are bound by
quotas was 26.33 million barrels a day last month, the group’s
Vienna-based secretariat said today in its monthly oil market
report. That implies a compliance rate of 65 percent, according
to Bloomberg calculations. Supplies climbed from 26.29 million
barrels in March, when compliance was at 66 percent.  Output from  Libya  fell to 240,000 barrels a day in April
from 375,000 barrels a day the previous month amid continued
fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi and anti-
government rebels.  “Libya and Angola crude oil production experienced
declines of more than 100,000 barrels a day in April compared to
the previous month, while Saudi Arabia,  Nigeria , the United Arab
Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait output increased,” OPEC said.  The group’s total production increased to 28.99 million
barrels a day in April from 28.92 million the previous month.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except Iraq, which
is exempt from the quota system.  OPEC’s adherence to quotas fell to 37 percent, a two-year
low, in January as prices rose almost 7% and surged to more than
$100 a barrel, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Compliance percentages are based on combined output from
the 11 members that committed to reduce from a base production
rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels a day.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
