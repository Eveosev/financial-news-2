Shipping billionaire  John Fredriksen 
has no interest in buying A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S’s Maersk LNG
unit, said Tor Olav Troim, an ally of the Norway-born investor.  Maersk, owner of the world’s biggest container-shipping
line, said today it’s seeking potential buyers for Maersk LNG to
divert resources to other areas. The unit operates tankers that
haul liquefied natural gas. Troim, who spoke by phone today, and
Fredriksen both sit on the board of LNG shipper Golar LNG Energy
Ltd., the company’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
