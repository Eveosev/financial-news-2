Vestas Wind Systems A/S of Denmark
may announce today that it plans to build  wind turbines  at
Britain’s historic naval dockyard of Sheerness, on the Thames
estuary, the London-based Times reported.  The company’s plan depends on government help to upgrade
the site, and also on commitments by power utilities to install
thousands of turbines round the U.K. coast in the next two
decades, the newspaper said.  Sheerness is owned by the Peel Holdings group run by real-
estate tycoon  John Whittaker , the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
