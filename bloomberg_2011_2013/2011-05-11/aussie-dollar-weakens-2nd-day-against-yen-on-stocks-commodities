The Australian dollar fell against
most of its major counterparts after the nation’s employers
unexpectedly cut the number of workers in April.  The Aussie declined for a second day versus its U.S.
counterpart as investors lowered bets on central bank
interest-rate increases after unemployment climbed in some
states.  New Zealand ’s currency snapped two days of losses after
an index of manufacturing grew at a faster pace last month as
the economy rebounded from a February earthquake.  “Today’s data takes a bit of the shine and mystery off the
Aussie dollar,” said  Robert Rennie , chief currency strategist
at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney.  Australia’s currency fell 0.4 percent to $1.0657 at 11:33
a.m. in  New York , from $1.0700 yesterday, after touching
$1.0567, the lowest level since May 5. The Aussie weakened 0.8
percent to 86.05 yen, following yesterday’s 1.1 percent drop.
New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.9 percent to 79.59 U.S. cents and
advanced 0.5 percent to 64.25 yen.  The number of people employed in  Australia  decreased last
month by 22,100 after a revised 43,300 gain in March, the
statistics bureau said today. Economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast a 17,000 increase last month. The jobless rate
held at 4.9 percent.  Employment rose by 22,900 in Queensland and  Western
Australia , states that are the biggest participants in the
largest  mining-investment boom in the country’s history. The
number of jobs in New South  Wales  and Victoria, home to
Australia’s two biggest cities, dropped by 56,200, today’s
report showed.  New Zealand’s dollar was boosted after the Performance of
Manufacturing Index rose to 51.5 last month from 50.2 in March.
A reading above 50 indicates manufacturing is expanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
