China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose, extending yesterday’s rebound from a three-week low, on
speculation cash supplies will tighten as fewer central-bank
bills mature in the next two weeks.  Debt redemptions will amount to 88 billion yuan ($13.6
billion) next week, down from 197 billion yuan this week and an
average of 182 billion yuan in the last eight weeks, according
to Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at Societe
Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  “The reason is low PBOC bill redemptions ahead,” Chong
said. “Liquidity seems tight if you look at repo fixings. A
further hike in reserve-requirement ratios is still on the
cards.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was 2.7945 percent as of 11:36 a.m. in
 Shanghai , compared with 2.7888 percent yesterday, according to a
weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The May 9 closing level of 2.7605 percent was the lowest
since April 18.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, advanced to
3.4475 percent from 3.4400 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Consumer prices climbed 5.3 percent in April after
having risen 5.4 percent the previous month, the government
reported today.  The yield on the government’s 3.75 percent bond due March
2018 fell one basis point to 3.65 percent, the lowest level
since it was sold in March. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
