Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, slumped to the lowest in more
than two months after first-quarter profit dropped 47 percent.  The shares retreated 1.4 percent to 1.38 dirhams, the
lowest since Feb. 23, at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi.  Net income fell to 152 million dirhams ($41.4 million) from
287 million dirhams a year earlier after it “didn’t see taxes
coming” on operations in the U.K. North Sea, Taqa said in a
statement in Abu Dhabi. The U.K. raised the tax rate on oil
production profit to 62 percent from 50 percent in March to pay
for a  tax cut  on gasoline for consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
