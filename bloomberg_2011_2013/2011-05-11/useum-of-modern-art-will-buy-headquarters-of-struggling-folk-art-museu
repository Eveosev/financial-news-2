The Museum of  Modern Art  agreed
to buy the midtown  Manhattan  headquarters of the  American
Folk Art Museum , which is in default on the $31.9 million
it borrowed to construct the building a decade ago.  Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed in a press release
issued by the Folk Art Museum, which was founded in 1961
and will relocate to its 6,000-square-foot satellite
location opposite  Lincoln Center  on Manhattan’s Upper West
Side.  The Folk Art Museum headquarters building stands a
short distance west of MoMA, which said it will use the
30,000-square-foot space for exhibitions.  The Folk Art Museum has missed $3.7 million in
payments to a debt-service fund connected to bonds issued
for the new premises, according to a Jan. 5 filing to
bondholders.  Laura Parsons, president of the museum, described the
sale as a last resort, and said several board members wore
black last night as they convened to approve it.  “We are in mourning,” she said, adding that the
museum is looking at partnerships with cultural
institutions and traveling exhibitions.  Parsons said the museum will be debt-free following
the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
