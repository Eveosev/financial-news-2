Sportingbet Plc (SBT)  may sell about 125
million pounds ($206 million) of stock to fund a bid for
Australian betting company  Centrebet International Ltd. (CIL) , two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The company may announce the deal May 25 when it reports
third-quarter earnings, one of the people said, declining to be
identified as the talks are ongoing. The proposed share sale
would be equivalent to more than half Sportingbet’s market value
of 244 million pounds.  Centrebet rose the most in almost three years in Sydney
after it said it received a takeover bid. A deal would expand
Sportingbet’s presence in regulated gambling markets, increasing
appeal to investors, said  Simon Davies , an analyst with  Collins
Stewart  with a “buy” recommendation on Sportingbet.  “It’s a big ask,” Davies said in a telephone interview of
the share sale, which he estimated in a note would be for about
120 million pounds. “But strategically, it’s a deal that’s got
a lot of potential.”  The acquisition is dependent on Sportingbet raising money
through a share sale, the London-based company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today. Sportingbet may offer
about A$2 ($2.17) per share, it said, adding there is “no
certainty” a transaction would be completed.  Centrebet rose 13 percent to A$1.79 in Sydney trading after
the announcement. Sportingbet advanced 2.25 pence, or 4.9
percent, to 48.25 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
