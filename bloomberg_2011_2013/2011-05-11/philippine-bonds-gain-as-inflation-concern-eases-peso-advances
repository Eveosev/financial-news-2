Philippine  government bonds  rose,
driving down five-year yields by the most in three weeks, after
the wage board approved a pay increase for workers in  Manila 
that was less than the central bank had indicated.  The National Capital Region gave the all clear to raise
daily pay by 22 pesos, lower than the 25 pesos Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas included in its inflation outlook. Moody’s Investors
Service, which rates the  Philippines  three levels below
investment grade, may lift the debt rating “sooner rather than
later,” Assistant Vice President Christian de Guzman said on
April 28.  “Inflation concern is easing and confidence is rising on a
possible credit-rating upgrade that may come anytime soon,”
said Dave Estacio, a senior fixed-income trader at Manila-based
First Metro Investment Corp.  The yield on the 7 percent note due January 2016 dropped 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 5.15 percent, the
biggest decline since April 20, according to Tradition Financial
Services prices as of 11:36 a.m. The peso rose 0.2 percent to
42.860 per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The Philippines is “confident” it will win a higher  credit
rating  soon, President  Benigno Aquino ’s spokeswoman Abigail
Valte, said in a phone interview today.  “Hopefully, we will see an improvement soon to enable us
wider access to outside markets,” Valte said.  The government reported a budget deficit of 26.2 billion
pesos ($611 million) for the first quarter on April 27, less
than the official target of 112 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter for this story:
