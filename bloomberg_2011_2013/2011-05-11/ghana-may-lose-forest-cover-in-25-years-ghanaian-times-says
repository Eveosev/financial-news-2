Ghana stands to lose all its native
forests in 25 years if it doesn’t reduce its current clearance
rate of 65,000 hectares per annum, the Ghanaian Times reported.  The West African nation’s forest cover has declined to 1.8
million hectares (4.4 million acres) from 8 million hectares in
1990, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Samuel Afari
Dartey, chief executive of the Forestry Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
