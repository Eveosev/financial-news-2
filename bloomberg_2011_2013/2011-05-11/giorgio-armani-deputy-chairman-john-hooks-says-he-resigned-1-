Giorgio Armani SpA Deputy Chairman
John Hooks said he’s resigned from the Italian fashion house,
citing the need for a break after 11 years at the company.  The executive, who is credited with leading the Milan-based
company’s international expansion, is looking at a number of new
projects, he said today by e-mail.  Armani made changes to its top management in September
2009, naming Livio Proli as general manager and giving his
predecessor Gianni Gerbotto responsibility for the company’s
financial management and investments. Hooks was made deputy
chairman, having previously served as deputy general manager.  Amee Boyle, a spokeswoman for Armani, didn’t immediately
return calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  Armani had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 218 million euros ($312 million) in 2009 and
revenue of 1.52 billion euros, the last published figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
