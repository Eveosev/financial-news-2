France , the world’s second-largest
wheat exporter, raised its forecast for record sales outside the
European Union on demand from north Africa.  French wheat exports outside the EU will be 12.8 million
metric tons in the 12 months to June, 50,000 tons more than last
month’s forecast, crops office FranceAgriMer said in a report
today. The estimate for total wheat exports was raised to 19.39
million tons from 19.26 million tons, it said.  An index of world food prices tracked by the  United
Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization rose to 232.1 points
in April from 231 in March, having fallen from a record 237.2
points in February. Milling wheat futures on NYSE Liffe for
November delivery have risen 2 percent this year.  Countries in the Middle East and  Africa  have been
importing grain at an accelerated pace to control rising food
prices that toppled leaders in  Egypt  and Tunisia this year. Food
is the most important factor in emerging-market inflation,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Algeria , northern Africa’s second-largest grain buyer
after Egypt, purchased 2.95 million tons of wheat of all origins
between Dec. 16 and Jan. 26, probably a record for a five-week
period, FranceAgriMer said in February.  Soft-wheat stockpiles at the end of June will be 2.2
million tons, down from last month’s estimate of 2.28 million
tons, FranceAgriMer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
