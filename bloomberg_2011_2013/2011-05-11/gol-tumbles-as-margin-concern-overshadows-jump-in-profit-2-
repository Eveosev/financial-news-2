Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s largest carrier, fell the most in 11 weeks in Sao Paulo
on concern a fourfold jump in profit is unsustainable as higher
oil prices and a stronger currency squeeze margins.  The stock sank the most since Feb. 23, losing 4.2 percent
to 20.99 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York time close.  Net income adjusted for some items increased to 110.5
million reais ($68.3 million) in the first quarter from 23.9
million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based airline said
late yesterday in a  regulatory filing . Increasing fuel costs and
the appreciation of the real spurred Gol to cut the forecast for
its 2011 margin on earnings before interest and taxes to a range
of 6.5 percent to 10 percent, from 11.5 percent to 14 percent
previously, the filing said.  “We are adopting a more conservative view,” Sara Delfim,
an analyst at Bank of America Corp. in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a
note to clients today. “The spike in fuel costs hit the company
only in March, which should negatively affect” second-quarter
earnings, Delfim wrote.  Total operating expenses increased 11 percent in the
quarter to 1.7 billion reais because of higher fuel costs and an
8.8 percent pay increase for workers, according to the
statement. Staff threatened to strike at the end of 2010. The
airline incurred a 120 million real, one-time charge related to
the implementation of new revenue accounting. Gol’s net income
without adjustments was 31.9 million reais.  Fuel Hedging  Gol increased its hedge against fuel price volatility to 40
percent of its fuel consumption over the next 12 months from 20
percent, Chief Financial Officer Leonardo Pereira said today on
a conference call with journalists. The company also decided to
adopt “triggers” to increase the hedge on fuel if necessary,
he said. Gol raised its estimate for the average oil price to
$100 to $115 a barrel from $82 to $93 a barrel, according to its
earnings statement.  Net sales rose 9.6 percent to 1.9 billion reais. Demand for
Gol’s flights in  Brazil , measured by total revenue per seat
flown a kilometer, grew 9 percent between January and March as
higher salaries and growth in  Latin America ’s largest economy
drove more people to fly, Gol said. Across the industry, demand
grew 17 percent, according to Brazil’s  civil aviation agency .
The economy grew 7.5 percent in 2010, the fastest expansion in
more than two decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
