Switzerland  sent a group of experts
to Cairo to help Egyptian authorities secure the return of funds
amassed by former President  Hosni Mubarak  and his associates.  The experts are helping Egyptian judicial officials
determine whether any of the 410 million Swiss francs ($465
million) of funds frozen in Swiss banks were obtained illegally,
the Foreign Ministry in Bern said today in an e-mailed
 statement .  On Feb. 11, the Swiss government froze all Mubarak money
held in the country to prevent the funds from being spirited
away and hidden. It imposed a similar freeze on any holdings of
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  shortly afterward. The Swiss
experts held talks today and yesterday focusing on the technical
aspects of judicial cooperation between the two countries, the
ministry said.  “Switzerland hopes to be able to quickly return to the
Egyptian people all frozen assets” proved to be illegal, the
ministry said. “It is now up to the Egyptian authorities to
determine, through criminal proceedings, whether these assets
were illegally acquired.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
