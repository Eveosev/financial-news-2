The one-year tax holiday for
repatriating overseas profits sought by U.S. multinational
companies would cost taxpayers $78.7 billion over the next
decade, according to an estimate from the congressional  Joint
Committee on Taxation .  Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas released
the estimate today as Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas
Republican, introduced a bill that would allow companies to
repatriate profits earned overseas at a 5.25 percent rate,
instead of the 35 percent statutory U.S. corporate tax rate.  “This latest ploy by large multinational corporations and
their Republican allies to avoid paying their fair share for our
national security and economic well-being carries a hefty price
tag -- nearly $80 billion,” Doggett said in a statement. “This
means we will have to borrow more from foreign creditors or
shift a greater burden to American small businesses and working
families.”  Companies including  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ,
 Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG) , and Apple Inc. have been lobbying
Congress for the tax break, maintaining that it would unlock
about $1 trillion in overseas profits that can’t be brought home
without prohibitive taxes.  The estimate released by Doggett considers a general
repatriation holiday and not the legislation introduced by
Brady.  To contact the reporters on this story:
