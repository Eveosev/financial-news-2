New-home sales will remain weak into
2012, said Bill Wheat, chief financial officer of  D.R. Horton 
Inc., one of three U.S. homebuilders to predict a delayed
recovery today.  “We don’t see the economic drivers to change in 2011,”
Wheat, whose Fort Worth, Texas-based company is the second-
largest homebuilder by revenue, said at a  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
conference in New York today. “We feel it could still be a
struggle in 2012.”  Homebuilders are fighting to compete with lower-priced
existing homes as a glut of foreclosures drives down values. New
houses sold at an annual pace of 300,000 in March, up from a
nearly 50-year-low pace of 270,000 in February, the Commerce
Department reported April 25.  The number of visitors and serious shoppers at homebuilder
sales offices “weakened sequentially” in April from the
previous month, Adam Rudiger an analyst with Wells Fargo
Securities, wrote in a May 9 report based on a survey of 150
sales managers in 20 markets.  Five years into the housing slump, unemployment at 9
percent and a drumbeat of negative news continue to discourage
buyers, Douglas C. Yearley Jr., chief executive officer of  Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL) , said at the Wells Fargo conference.  Home prices 
may fall as much as 9 percent in 2011, Zillow Inc. said in a May
9 report.  “People are still scared,” said Yearley, whose Horsham,
Pennsylvania-based company is the largest U.S. luxury-home
builder. “We’re just disappointed that demand hasn’t come back
better at this point.”  Jeffrey Mezger, CEO of Los Angeles-based  KB Home (KBH) , speaking
at the conference today, said he expects sales to “bump along
for the next 18 months.”  The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilder Index of
12 companies declined 1.5 percent as of 3:18 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
