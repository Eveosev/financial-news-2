Raiffeisen Bank International AG,
eastern  Europe ’s third-biggest lender, and the  World Bank  agreed
to guarantee as much as $140 million of financing for Ukrainian
farmers.  VAT Raiffeisen Bank Aval, Vienna-based Raiffeisen’s
Ukrainian unit, and the local subsidiary of the  International
Finance Corp.  each will provide guarantees for as much as $70
million, according to a joint statement handed out in Kiev
today. The IFC is the World Bank’s private-sector lending arm.  The guarantees will be provided to German chemical and drug
manufacturer Bayer AG, which will supply grain-protection
products to farmers in Ukraine, the statement shows. The plan is
intended to devise “a mechanism so that risks are divided
between participants,” Olena Voloshyna, the IFC’s head of
operations in Ukraine, said at a press conference in Kiev.  Risks, including weather and limits on grain exports, are
“very numerous” in Ukraine’s agriculture industry, Oleksiy
Mityagin, deputy chief executive officer of TOV Bayer, said at
the press conference. TOV Bayer is Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer’s Ukrainian division.  Farmers will use promissory notes to pay for the crop-
protection products, said Arthur Iliyav, deputy chairman of
 Raiffeisen Bank Aval (BAVL) ’s board. The project has a three-year term,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
