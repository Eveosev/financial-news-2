Ethanol futures tumbled the most in
eight weeks in  Chicago  after separate government reports showed
ample supplies of the fuel, oil, gasoline and corn.  The grain-based gasoline supplement plunged after the
Energy Department said gasoline stocks increased 1.28 million
barrels to 205.8 million and the Agriculture Department said
corn inventories may climb to 900 million bushels in 2012 from a
15-year low of 730 million this year.  “What, a sell-off?” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest
in Chicago. “We had a grain report that came out this morning
that put a shock to the market, then we had good inventories for
energy and everything just bought the farm."  Denatured ethanol for June delivery plummeted 9.4 cents, or
3.7 percent, to $2.481 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 4.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 8 cents,
or 3 percent, to $2.595 a gallon and on the West Coast the
biofuel fell 7.5 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.70, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slipped 6 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$2.505 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive declined 2.5
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.75.  Prices also slipped after the Energy Department reported
stockpiles of the fuel climbed to 20.4 million barrels, a four-
week high, and production dipped to 862,000 barrels a day.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $5.67 to settle at $98.21
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 29
percent from a year ago.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 25.69 cents, or 7.6
percent, to settle at $3.1228 a gallon in New York. Ethanol is
blended with the motor fuel to augment supply and meet federal
mandates.  Corn futures for July delivery slid the exchange-limit of
30 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.7725 a bushel in Chicago. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
