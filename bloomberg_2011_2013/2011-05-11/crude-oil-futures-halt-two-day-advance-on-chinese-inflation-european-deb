Oil fell for the first time in three
days in  New York  on concern that  China  will boost interest rates
to tame inflation and on signs that U.S. crude supplies are
increasing.  Gasoline dropped as much as 4.7 percent on speculation that
a 9 percent rally in the past two days was excessive. The fuel
had advanced on concern that flooding on the  Mississippi River 
will disrupt U.S. supplies. Yesterday the industry-funded
 American Petroleum Institute  said crude inventories jumped last
week. The Energy Department will release its data today.
Consumer price rises in China exceeded the government’s target
last month, data from the statistics bureau in Beijing showed.  “The API report took the wind out of the market’s sails,”
said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“The latest U.S. demand data has been weaker than normal for
the time of year, but the fact prices have not fallen further is
a sign of strength, and we could see Brent return to $120.”  Crude for June delivery declined as much as $1.62, or 1.6
percent, to $102.26 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $102.27 at 1:22 p.m. London time. Yesterday the
contract rose 1.3 percent to settle at $103.88, the highest
since May 4. Prices are up 34 percent in the past year.  Brent crude for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was $1.02 lower at $116.61 a barrel.
Yesterday, it gained 1.5 percent to $117.63, the highest
settlement since May 4.  North Sea  Brent crude ’s premium to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened for a fourth day. The spread between
the two front-month contracts increased to $14.34 a barrel from
$13.75 at settlement yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  OPEC Report  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said  oil
prices  are more in line with market conditions after last week’s
14.7 percent collapse, and maintained its 2011 demand forecast.  The world will need an average of 29.87 million barrels of
crude a day from OPEC’s 12 members this year, about 400,000 a
day more than last year because of “roaring” economic growth
in China, the group said in its monthly market report today.  China’s consumer prices climbed 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier, according to the statistics bureau in Beijing.
That’s higher than the government’s 4 percent full-year target
and above the 5.2 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  The country’s central bank will increase  interest rates 
once more this year, adding to four since mid-October, another
Bloomberg News survey showed. Officials have boosted banks’
reserve requirements and reined in credit growth from record
levels in 2009 and 2010.  U.S. crude stockpiles climbed 2.95 million barrels last
week to 367.2 million, the API said. The Energy Department’s
weekly report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in Washington
may show supplies rose 1.5 million barrels, based on the
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
