The U.S. government’s monthly budget
deficit narrowed to $40.5 billion in April from a year earlier
as  tax revenue  climbed.  Last month’s figure compares with a shortfall of $82.7
billion in April 2010, according to the Treasury Department’s
monthly budget statement, released today in Washington.  The White House and Congress are struggling to rein in the
budget deficit and agree to terms to raise a legal limit on the
national debt. Without an increase in the debt cap, the
Treasury’s borrowing authority will probably run out in early
August, according to official estimates.  “We have seen income tax increases start to trend higher,”
said Sean Incremona, a senior economist at 4Cast Inc in  New
York . “There is an underlying positive trend.”  Incremona
forecast a deficit of $41 billion.  This year’s federal budget deficit is projected to reach
$1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of gross domestic product,
according to the  Congressional Budget Office . During fiscal
2009, the government, under the administration of President
 George W. Bush , reported the previous record deficit of $1.4
trillion.  For the fiscal year to date, the deficit totaled $869.9
billion, compared with $799.7 billion in the same period last
year. The fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.  Record Surplus  During fiscal 2010, the government reported a shortfall of
$1.3 trillion, the second-largest on record. By comparison, the
budget reached a record surplus of almost $237 billion in fiscal
2000, highlighting the deterioration in the nation’s finances.  A survey of 25 economists by Bloomberg News projected the
deficit would shrink to $41 billion in April. Forecasts ranged
from $35 billion to $80 billion.  The non-partisan CBO, in a forecast issued May 9, estimated
the March deficit would total $41 billion.  “Through April, individual income tax receipts were $130
billion (or 26 percent) more than those during the same period
last year -- the result of increased amounts withheld from
paychecks and strong growth in payments accompanying 2010 tax
returns,” the agency said in a statement.  The Treasury’s report showed that  government spending  rose
0.6 percent in April to $330 billion, and revenue increased 18
percent to $289.5 billion.  Incomes Taxes  Individual income tax receipts rose 26 percent to $631.2
billion in the fiscal year to date. Corporate income taxes
climbed 3.9 percent.  This week, the Treasury is selling $72 billion of long-term
debt, and officials said they anticipate auction sizes will
“remain steady” throughout the quarter as negotiations
continue on the debt limit.  The Treasury can borrow until Aug. 2 after reaching the
$14.3-trillion limit because of stronger-than-expected tax
receipts and by taking “extraordinary measures” such as
suspending the sale of bonds to finance state and local
infrastructure projects, Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner 
said in a letter to congressional leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
