Kenya received fewer bids for the
364-day bills it offered at a sale, with yields rising.  The East African nationâ€™s central bank accepted 3.4 billion
shillings of the 4.3 billion shillings of bids it received for 5
billion shillings of securities it offered, it said in a
statement today from the capital, Nairobi. The weighted average
yield of accepted bids climbed to 6.772 percent from 4.998
percent, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
