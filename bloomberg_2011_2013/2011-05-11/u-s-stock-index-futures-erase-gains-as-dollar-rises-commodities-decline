U.S. stock futures erased early gains
as gauges of commodity prices extended losses and the dollar
strengthened versus the euro amid concern  Greece  will be forced
to restructure its debt.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring in June
were little changed at 1,353.90 at 8:02 a.m. New York time after
rising 0.3 percent earlier. The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent
to $1.4362. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities lost 0.5
percent.  The euro slipped against most peers on speculation European
leaders are slowing the drive to grant Greece additional aid,
fueling concern over a potential debt restructuring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
