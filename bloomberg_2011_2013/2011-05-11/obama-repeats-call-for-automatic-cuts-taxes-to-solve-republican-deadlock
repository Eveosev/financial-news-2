President  Barack Obama  said the
deadlock with congressional Republicans over taxes may require
creating a mechanism he’s proposed for automatic spending cuts
and tax increases to resolve the long-term debt and deficits.  “I think that what we’re going to end up having to do,
probably, is to set some targets” that would trigger deficit-
reducing measures, Obama said at a town hall meeting in
Washington today sponsored by  CBS News . “That will give
incentive for us to negotiate and figure something out.”  Obama outlined such a “failsafe” trigger in a speech on
the budget he gave last month in which he laid out his deficit-
cutting plan. The administration is in the midst of negotiations
with congressional Republicans on trimming the nation’s
cumulative deficit over the next 10 to 12 years.  The president on April 13 proposed $4 trillion in
cumulative deficit reductions over 12 years through a
combination of spending cuts and tax increases, setting the
stage for a fight with congressional Republicans over the
nation’s priorities. Republicans have called for reducing the
deficit through spending cuts and are resisting any move that
would raise taxes.  The town hall was recorded earlier and CBS released
excerpts of Obama’s remarks, which are scheduled for broadcast
tonight and tomorrow on the network’s evening news program.  Obama met today with Senate Democrats on the fiscal
negotiations and plans to meet with Senate Republicans tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
