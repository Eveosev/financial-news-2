Silver, which plunged 27 percent last
week, still is poised to climb to the “very important” price
of $50 an ounce by the end of the year, according to  technical
analysis  by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “You’re still in an uptrend, despite the sharp sell-off”
as shown by an intermediate-term trend from the lows on Aug. 24
and Jan. 28, Mary Ann Bartels, the head of U.S. technical and
market analysis at Merrill in  New York , said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “The uptrend was not broken.”  Last week, silver futures plunged the most since at least
1983 after the Comex exchange in New York boosted margin costs
by 84 percent. The price rebounded 9.1 percent in the past two
days. On April 25, the metal reached $49.845, the highest since
the Hunt Brothers tried to corner the market in 1980. In that
year, the commodity climbed to a record $50.35.  Futures will face so-called resistance around $45 before
topping $50, a “very important number” that “called the end
of the  bull market  in commodities, with the Hunt Brothers
getting squeezed out of silver” in 1980, Bartels said.  The metal may rise to $80 in three to five years, she said.
In February, Bartels correctly predicted the silver rally in
March and April.  Yesterday, silver futures for July delivery rose $1.37, or
3.7 percent, to $38.486 on the Comex. The price jumped 5.2
percent on May 9.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
