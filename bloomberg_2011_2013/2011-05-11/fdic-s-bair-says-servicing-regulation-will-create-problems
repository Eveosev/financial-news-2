Future regulation of U.S. mortgage
servicing in the wake of soaring foreclosures stemming from the
credit crisis may increase costs and slow economic recovery,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman  Sheila Bair  said.  Bair, who has fought to include servicing standards in
Dodd-Frank Act rules requiring lenders to retain part of the
risk when they sell loans to investors, expressed concern about
the possible consequences today during a discussion at an FDIC
community-banking conference in  Washington .  “I can see lots of regulation coming on servicing,” Bair
said. “This is going to create more problems doing mortgages
and I worry about that. It is more about the economy now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
