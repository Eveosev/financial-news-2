Greek police arrested two people and
detained another 24 in an anti-immigration protest organized by
right-wing political group  Chrysi Avgi , or Golden Dawn, in
central Athens late yesterday after a Greek man was murdered.  One man was arrested for smashing the windows of an
immigrants store and another, who was carrying a collapsible
baton, for violation of weapons laws, a  police  spokeswoman, who
declined to be identified in line with policy, said by
telephone. No injuries were reported, she said.  Protestors attacked and broke into immigrantsâ€™ homes and
smashed store windows in the central Athens Victoria Square from
7 p.m., Athens-based  Kathimerini  reported, without citing
anyone.  The rally was sparked by the murder of a 44-year old Greek
man, Manolis Kantari, the spokeswoman said. Kantaris was
preparing to take his wife to the hospital for the birth of
their second child when three unknown assailants stabbed him to
death and stole his camera, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story
