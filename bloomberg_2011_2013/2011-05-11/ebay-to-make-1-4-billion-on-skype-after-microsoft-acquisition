EBay Inc. (EBAY)  said it will reap more than
a 50 percent return from the company’s $2.6 billion investment
in Skype Technologies SA six years ago, following  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s agreement yesterday to buy the Web calling service.  “With this sale, we have realized a total return of $1.4
billion on our original investment in Skype,” John Pluhowski, a
spokesman for  San Jose , California-based EBay, said in an e-
mail.  Microsoft agreed to buy Skype, the world’s most popular
Web-calling service, for $8.5 billion from investors led by
private equity firm Silver Lake to attract users and narrow
Google Inc.’s lead in Web advertising. Before the offer, Skype
had announced plans to pursue an initial public offering.  This marks the second time that Skype, founded in  Estonia 
in 2003, will be part of a corporate parent. EBay in 2005 outbid
Google and Yahoo! Inc. for the money-losing startup. EBay, the
world’s largest online marketplace, had said then that Skype
could spur sales by letting buyers and sellers on its main
auction site talk for free with a mouse click. That never panned
out and two years later EBay wrote down the value of Skype by
$900 million.  EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe in 2009 sold 70
percent of the calling service to investors in a deal that
valued Skype at $2.75 billion. Silver Lake, Skype’s largest
owner, then brokered the deal with Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
