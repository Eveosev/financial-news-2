Andrew Bynum  was suspended five games
without pay at the start of next season for his flagrant foul on
 J.J. Barea  in the last game of the Los Angeles Lakers’ National
Basketball Association playoff against the Dallas Mavericks.  Bynum, 23, also was fined $25,000 for removing his Lakers
jersey as he left the court after being ejected. The Lakers were
losing 100-68 at the time and went on to a 122-86 defeat that
swept the two-time defending champions out of the playoffs.  The 7-foot Bynum elbowed the 6-foot Barea in the ribs,
knocking him to the floor, as the Dallas player went up for a
layup in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals at American
Airlines Center in Dallas.  Bynum publicly apologized to Barea yesterday, a few hours
before the punishment was announced by NBA Executive Vice
President  Stu Jackson .  “I want to apologize for my actions at the start of the
fourth quarter in Dallas in Game 4,” Bynum said in a statement
to reporters at the start of a news conference. “They don’t
represent me, my upbringing, this franchise or any of the Laker
fans.”  The oft-injured Bynum will be suspended for the first five
games of the 2011-12 NBA regular season for which he is eligible
and physically able to play, Jackson said in a statement
released by the NBA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
