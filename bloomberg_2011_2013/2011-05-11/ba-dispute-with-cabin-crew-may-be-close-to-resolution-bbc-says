British Airways may be close to
resolving the dispute with some of its cabin crew that has
triggered 22 days of strikes over the past two years, the  BBC 
reported, without attribution.  Unite union representatives are “content” with the
results of negotiations with BA and an offer will be put to
members on May 12, the  BBC  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
