The U.S. is concerned by reports that
Somalia barred more than 40 lawmakers from flying abroad, saying
it demonstrated the government’s recent bid to suppress
“peaceful political discussion” and silence critics.  Most of the politicians were due to attend a meeting in
Nairobi, the capital of neighboring  Kenya , on how to organize
elections in Somalia when the interim government’s term expires
this year, the  U.S. Embassy  in Kenya said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Other lawmakers planned to visit  Ethiopia 
for a separate event or leave the Horn of African nation for
personal reasons.  Security personnel in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital,
threatened lawmakers with weapons and assaulted at least three
politicians in a May 9 incident, according to the statement.  “The transitional federal government reportedly blocked
the parliamentarians’ travel because it opposed their
participation in the workshop,” the embassy said.  The  United Nations  on April 13 called on Somalia’s interim
administration to hold elections before its term was scheduled
to end in August. In March, the government extended its mandate
by a year until August 2012, arguing it was justified in light
of recent gains in the fight against Islamic insurgents.  South and central Somalia are under siege by al Qaeda-
linked insurgents, while the government, backed by about 9,000
African Union peacekeeping forces, has control over swathes of
Mogadishu. Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central government
since the ouster of Mohamed Siad Barre 20 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
