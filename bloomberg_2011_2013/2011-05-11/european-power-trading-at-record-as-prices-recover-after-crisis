Electricity trading in western
 Europe ’s seven biggest markets rose to a record for a sixth year
in 2010 as prices recovered and banks and utilities including
 Barclays Capital  and  E.ON AG (EOAN)  bought and sold the commodity.  Volumes in Germany, the Nordic region, Britain,  France , the
Netherlands,  Spain  and  Italy  increased 9 percent to 10,865
terawatt-hours from 9,929 terawatt-hours in 2008, London-based
consultant  Prospex Research Ltd.  said in a report published
today. They have advanced 25 percent since 2006, the data show.  European power prices advanced as the global economy
recovered after its worst recession since World War II, boosting
demand for electricity and increasing fuel prices. Wholesale
electricity gained as much as 52 percent in the Nordic region
and by 1 percent in Italy, Prospex said.  “In 2010, the trading business once again showed that
turmoil in the European and global economies and international
finance is no obstacle to further growth,” the report said.  Volumes in  Germany , Europe’s biggest power market,
increased by 14 percent last year, trading at a rate of about
9.4 times annual consumption, Prospex said. German demand was
about 550 terawatt-hours in 2010. Prospex declined to specify
volumes for individual markets. E.ON, Germany’s biggest utility,
boosted its European power trading by 19 percent last year to
1,472 terawatt-hours, it said on March 9.  The German next-year contract, a regional benchmark, rose
18 percent in 2010, compared with a drop of 22 percent in 2009,
according to broker prices on Bloomberg.  Trading in Spain and Italy advanced the most, rising 26
percent and 24 percent, respectively. Trading was 1.8 times
demand in Spain and 1.2 times demand in Italy.  “Both markets have lagged their northern European peers in
volume terms but they are catching up,” Prospex said.  Trading outside organized exchanges, the so-called over-
the-counter market, accounted for 73 percent of transactions
last year, down from 82 percent as reported by Prospex in its
2009 survey. Brokers including  ICAP Plc (IAP) ,  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) , Tullet
Prebon Plc, Spectron Group Ltd. and Tradition Financial Services
compete for over-the-counter trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
