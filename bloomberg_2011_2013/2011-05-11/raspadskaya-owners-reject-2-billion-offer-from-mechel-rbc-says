Majority owners of OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , a
Russian producer of coal for steelmaking, rejected an offer for
their collective 80 percent stake from OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , RBC Daily
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Mechel’s $2 billion offer is less than one-third of the
price that the owners, including Evraz Group SA’s billionaire
shareholder Roman Abramovich, are seeking, the Moscow-based
newspaper reported today.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
