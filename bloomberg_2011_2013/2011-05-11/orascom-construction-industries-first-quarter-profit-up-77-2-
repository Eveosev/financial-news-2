(Corrects Gavilon investment income in 8th paragraph.)  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , the
biggest publicly traded builder in the Middle East, said first-
quarter profit jumped 77 percent, boosted by higher fertilizer
sales at its OCI Nitrogen unit.  Net income rose to $206.1 million from $116.5 million a
year earlier, the Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Sales increased 28 percent to $1.26 billion.  “We expect fertilizer prices to remain firm,”  Nassef Sawiris , chairman and chief executive officer of  Orascom
Construction , said in the statement. “Rising coal prices in
 China  have pushed Chinese production cash costs higher which in
turn have raised the global floor of urea prices.”  Orascom’s fertilizer group sold 1.1 million tons of
nitrogen-based fertilizers in the first quarter compared with
0.47 million tons a year earlier, the company said. Netback
ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate prices increased 22 percent
and 38 percent respectively, Orascom said.  The financial contribution of OCI Nitrogen, previously
called Royal DSM, wasn’t included in first-quarter financial
results last year because of the timing of the closing of the
unit’s purchase, the company said.  Orascom’s expansion of a calcium ammonium nitrate line in
the Netherlands is expected to be in full production during
2012, adding about 300,000 tons, or 25 percent, of additional
capacity, according to the statement. Sofert  Algeria , the
Algerian unit, was 96.4 percent completed at the end of March,
with commercial production due to start in the fourth quarter.  Greenfield Operations  “We are analyzing some greenfield operations in emerging
markets at the moment,” Sawiris said in a telephone interview
today.  First-quarter income from Orascom’s investment in Gavilon
rose to $25.5 million from $14.1 million in the fourth quarter,
the company said. Orascom bought a 20 percent stake in Gavilon
for $340 million in July 2008 to bolster its fertilizer and
agricultural supply business.  Orascom’s construction group secured $330 million of
construction work in the quarter and is the preferred bidder for
as much as $1 billion of projects.  “Despite political unrest in our key regional markets
during the quarter, we feel confident that infrastructure
spending will continue to accelerate in order to stimulate these
markets’ economies and create immediate employment,” Sawiris
said.  Shares of Orascom rose 2.1 percent to 246 Egyptian pounds
as of 11:21 a.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 50.9 billion
pounds ($8.57 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
