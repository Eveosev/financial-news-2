Cyprus’s  Ministry of Finance 
maintained its 1.5 percent growth forecast for the island’s
economy this year, while cutting its estimate for 2012 to 2.5
percent from 3 percent.  The budget deficit will narrow this year to 4 percent of
gross domestic product, from 5.3 percent in 2010, and is likely
to decline to 2.6 percent next year, the ministry said in a
 statement  on its website in which it presents its medium-term
budgetary strategy. The previous 2011 deficit forecast stood at
4.5 percent.  The island’s public debt will probably peak next year at 62
percent of economic output, compared with 61.6 percent in 2011
and 60.9 percent in 2010, according to the statement.  Consumer prices, which rose 2.6 percent in 2010, will go up
3.4 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the
statement. Unemployment is forecast to fall from 6 percent in
2010 to 5.8 percent this year and 5.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
