Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the country’s
biggest phone network, had a wider-than-estimated first-quarter
loss after the company booked 184.1 million euros ($113.4
million) in one-time expenses to cut more than 500 workers.  The net loss was 79.2 million euros compared with profit of
91.2 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-based company said
today in a  statement . That exceeded the 53.1 million-euro
average loss estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales declined 0.7 percent to 1.12 billion euros, compared with
the 1.11 billion-euro estimate of 12 analysts.  “Over the next years, personnel-related costs will be
reduced,” Chief Financial Officer Hans Tschuden said in a
separate statement. Spending related to workforce reductions in
years to come will be reflected in quarterly results.  The former Austrian phone monopoly runs mobile networks in
seven eastern European countries and has been trying in its home
market to staunch fixed-line losses and drop long-time workers
to boost profitability.  Telekom Austria  bid 1.1 billion euros on
May 4 to buy Serbia’s state telephone company, an offer that the
Balkan nation’s government rejected as inadequate.  Telekom  Austria  reiterated that 2011 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will total as much
as 1.6 billion euros. The company is targeting sales of up to
4.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
