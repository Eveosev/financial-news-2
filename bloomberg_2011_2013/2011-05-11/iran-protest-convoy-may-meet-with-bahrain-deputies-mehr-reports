Iranian lawmakers, physicians, nurses
and athletes will join a humanitarian aid convoy in support of
Bahraini protesters,  Mehr  reported.  The group aims to hold talks with members of Bahrain’s
parliament and meet with the families of Bahrainis killed in
anti-government protests if the government allows it to enter
the island nation, the state-run  news agency  said yesterday.  Mehdi Eghrarian, head of the Islamic Revolution Supporters
Society, said yesterday that a convoy of humanitarian aid ships
will leave the southern port city of Bushehr on May 16 as part
of Iran’s effort to condemn “crimes” against the Bahraini
people by their government and that of neighboring  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
