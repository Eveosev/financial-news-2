U.S. home insurers paid 5.3 percent
more for the average dog-bite claim last year, the biggest jump
since 2007, as medical expenses and jury awards increased, a
trade group said.  The average cost per claim climbed to $26,166 last year
from $24,840 in 2009, the  Insurance Information Institute  said
today in a  statement . The injuries cost $412.6 million in 2010,
little changed from the previous year, as total claims declined
4.9 percent, the New York-based group said.  Dog bites accounted for more than a third of homeowners’
insurance-liability claims in 2010, the institute said. The
average cost per dog-bite claim has surged 37 percent since
2003, when the cost was $19,162, and the total value of claims
has risen 27 percent in that span, the group said. The number of
claims declined last year to 15,770.  The jump in expense per claim “can be attributed to
increased medical costs, as well as the size of settlements,
judgments and jury awards,” Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for
the institute, said in the statement.  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and  Allstate
Corp. (ALL)  are the largest U.S. home insurers.  “A lot of the dogs that have a problem are not neutered or
not trained well,” Sandra DeFeo, executive director at the
 Humane Society of New York , said in a telephone interview. “The
thing that worries us is that someone is going to be afraid of
dogs for the rest of their life.”  Each year , 800,000 Americans, half of them children, seek
medical attention for dog bites, according to the  Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention  in Atlanta. Of those injured,
about 16 die, according to the CDC.  Most residential insurance policies provide $100,000 to
$300,000 in liability coverage for dog bites, the institute
said. A homeowner responsible for an injury may be required to
reimburse the victim for medical costs and lost wages, the group
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
