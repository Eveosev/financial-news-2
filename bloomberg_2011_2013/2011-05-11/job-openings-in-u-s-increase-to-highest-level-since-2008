Job openings in the U.S. increased in
March to the highest level in more than two years, an indication
employers are becoming more optimistic about bringing on new
workers.  The number of positions waiting to be filled rose by 99,000
to 3.12 million, the most since September 2008, the Labor
Department said today in a statement posted on its website. The
number of people hired also climbed and the number of workers
fired was little changed.  Payrolls rose in April, extending the longest string of
monthly gains since 2006-2007, Labor Department data showed last
week. Accelerating job gains are needed to boost  consumer
spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the world’s
largest economy.  “Firms remain optimistic and expansion-minded,”  Aaron Smith , a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West
Chester , Pennsylvania, said before the report. “Although the
labor market is gaining momentum, recovery will take awhile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
