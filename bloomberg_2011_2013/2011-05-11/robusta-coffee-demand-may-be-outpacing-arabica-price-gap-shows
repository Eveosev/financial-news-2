Robusta coffee may be more in demand
than arabica beans after a 14 percent drop in the price
difference between the two varieties over the past week.  Arabica coffee traded in  New York  was $1.62 a pound more
expensive than the robusta variety traded on NYSE Liffe in
London at 3:05 p.m. London time. The premium was $1.89 on May 2,
the highest since at least 2008, data on Bloomberg show.  “London is finding more scale buying, helping the
arbitrage to firm,”  Rodrigo Costa , vice president of
institutional sales at Newedge in New York, wrote in a report e-
mailed yesterday. “It also could be read as a signal that
commercial interest is more focused on the robusta at this
point.”  Arabica coffee buyers are “probably” waiting for Brazil,
the world’s largest producer of coffee and also top producer of
the variety, to start selling beans as the country’s crop is
beginning, Costa said.  Brazil ’s robusta beans are known as
conillons.  “Harvest in Brazil is in full swing for the conillons, and
for the arabica some contributors have said that they are buying
new-crop already,” Costa said.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in  Latin America  and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are also harvested in Asia and parts
of Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
