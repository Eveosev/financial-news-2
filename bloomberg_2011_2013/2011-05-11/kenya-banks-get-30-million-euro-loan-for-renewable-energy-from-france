France ’s development bank agreed to
provide a 30 million-euro ($43 million) line of credit to two
Kenyan banks for lending to businesses that want to invest in
 renewable energy  projects.  Agence Francaise de Developpement’s funds will be available
through CF Stanbic Holdings Ltd. and the Co-operative Bank of
Kenya, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers said in a
 statement  on its website.  The agency has provided similar funding to Uganda and
Tanzania for investment in renewable energy under its “regional
technical assistance program,” according to the statement.  The money will be made available to small hydro, wind,
biomass, cogeneration and solar power projects as well as
energy-efficiency initiatives, especially in the agribusiness
and hospitality industries, it said.  Separately, a grant of 2.6 million euros was awarded to the
 Kenya  Association of Manufacturers on April 27 for a two-year
program aimed at financing clean energy projects. The French
agency contributed 600,000 euros and the  EU-Africa
Infrastructure Trust Fund  a total of 2 million euros, the
manufacturing organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
