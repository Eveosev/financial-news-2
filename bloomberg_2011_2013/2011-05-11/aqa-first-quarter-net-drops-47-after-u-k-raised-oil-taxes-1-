Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, said first-quarter profit
dropped 47 percent after it “didn’t see taxes coming’” on its
operations in the U.K. North Sea.  Net income dropped to 152 million dirhams ($41.4 million)
from 287 million dirhams a year earlier, Taqa said today in a
statement distributed in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United
Arab Emirates. The U.K. raised the  tax rate  on oil production
profit to 62 percent from 50 percent in March to pay for a tax
cut on gasoline for consumers.  “We were certainly surprised” by the taxes and are
lobbying for them to be lowered, Chief Financial Officer Doug Fraser said on a conference call. The tax will continue to hit
earnings although it should be mitigated by higher  oil prices ,
he said.  Taqa benefited from a 20 percent gain in oil prices to an
average of $94.60 a barrel for benchmark U.S. crude futures
during the first three months from $78.88 a barrel in the same
period of 2010. The company reported a 15 percent increase in
sales to 5.51 billion dirhams.  Quarterly costs also rose from rising depreciation,
depletion and amortization at Taqa North in  Canada  and Taqa
Bratani in the North Sea, as well as foreign exchange losses as
the  U.S. dollar , to which the U.A.E. dirham is pegged, dropped
against global currencies.  ‘On the Lookout’  Taqa owns stakes in businesses that generate power or
produce oil and natural gas in the Middle East,  North America ,
the North Sea and  India . It expects to pump 135,000 to 146,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2011, mainly in North
America, General Manager Carl Sheldon said in March.  The company plans to invest about $2 billion this year and
again next year, and it won’t need to refinance until October
2012, Fraser said. It’s “on the lookout” to buy or build power
and water plants in the Middle East, Ghana and India and seeks
to expand its North American oil and gas business, he said.  Taqa intends to sell another $200 million of non-core
assets in North America this year, Fraser said. It has already
sold assets of that value in the region, he said.  Abu Dhabi  Water and Electricity Authority owns 51 percent
of Taqa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
