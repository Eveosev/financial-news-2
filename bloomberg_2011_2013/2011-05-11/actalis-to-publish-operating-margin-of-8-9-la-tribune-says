Groupe Lactalis will show an
operating margin of between 8 percent and 9 percent in the
financial prospectus for its acquisition of  Parmalat SpA (PLT) , French
daily newspaper La Tribune reported.  The Italian stock regulator will make the prospectus public
in the next five days, the newspaper reported. Parmalat could
still ask for the offer price to be raised, from 2.60 euros a
share to 2.80 euros, which Lactalis Chairman Emmanuel Besnier
seems ready to do, La Tribune said, without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
