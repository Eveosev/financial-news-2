Turkish reports of sex videos
allegedly involving Nationalist Action Party politicians have
led to the resignation of two more of the party’s candidates
before the June 12 general elections,  Aksam  newspaper reported.  Party vice president Bulent Didinmez and former Istanbul
party provincial leader Ihsan Barutcu joined Recai Yildirim and
Metin Cobanoglu as the latest MHP politicians to resign after
sex videos were released on the internet, Aksam reported.  In his resignation statement, Didinmez said he has never
committed a crime and is only responsible to his family, the
newspaper said. The MHP’s press office said it had no immediate
comment on the resignations when reached by telephone by
Bloomberg.  The men are already on the electoral list and cannot be
replaced, Aksam said. Turkey’s information technology agency is
seeking to shut down access to sites containing the videos,
Aksam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
