Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , the renewable
energy unit of  Italy ’s biggest utility, will spend 2011
evaluating possible buyouts of companies in which it owns a
minority stake.  “We have a merger and acquisition activity that is fully
concentrated on rationalizing a lot of companies in which we
have minority stakes,” Chief Executive Officer Francesco Starace said in an interview in Rome. “This will keep us busy
throughout 2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
