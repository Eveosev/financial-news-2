(Corrects nationality of bank in last sentence.)  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , sued by the trustee
liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm, renewed its effort to
persuade a district court judge to take its case by saying the
racketeering laws invoked by the trustee may not apply outside
the U.S., according to a court filing. A district judge has said
he would consider whether trustee  Irving Picard  had grounds to
sue the Italian bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
