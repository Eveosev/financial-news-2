Mauritius’s stock index climbed to
the highest since at least 1989, led by  Mauritius Commercial
Bank (MCB)  and  Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL)  on investor expectations of
improved company earnings.  The 37-member SEMDEX index advanced 0.9 percent to 2,105.62
at the 1:30 close in  Port Louis . MCB, as the lender is known,
soared to the highest level since 2008. Naiade rallied to the
strongest since October 2010.  “Stocks are rising today on anticipation of improved
interim earnings announcements from large and mid-cap
companies,” Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at Axys
Stockbroking Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Listed companies in Mauritius have until May 13 to release
quarterly earnings for the period ending March 31. The Indian
Ocean island nation’s largest lender by market value, MCB gained
1.1 percent, or 2 rupees, to 185 rupees. Naiade, the third-
largest leisure operator by market value, advanced 8.1 percent,
or 2.5 rupees, to 33.5 rupees.  Ireland Blyth Ltd. (IBL) , Mauritius’s second-largest diversified
company, surged 5.1 percent, or 4 rupees, to 82 rupees, the
highest closing level since 1005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
