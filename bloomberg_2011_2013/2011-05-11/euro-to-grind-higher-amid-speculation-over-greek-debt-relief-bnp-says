The euro will “grind higher”
against the dollar in volatile trading as policy makers discuss
extending aid to debt-wracked  Greece , BNP Paribas SA said.  The common currency has slipped 3.4 percent against the
dollar this month amid concern that the nation may need to
restructure its debt. Speculation that European leaders may
expand the Greek aid program today pushed the nation’s two-year
note yields lower for a second day.  “While we see headlines driving up intra-day volatility in
euro through the balance of the week, the underlying path should
be one towards a more stable arrangement for Greece and an
eventual rebound in the euro,” analysts led by Ray Attrill,
senior currency strategist in  New York , wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “We are neutral/bullish euro-dollar, looking to
grind higher on anticipation of a ‘market-friendly’ outcome to
the Greek debt drama.”  A “bigger push higher” will have to wait until after
European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels next week,
Attrill wrote.  The euro weakened 0.8 percent to $1.4293 at 3:44 p.m. in
 London , from $1.4409 yesterday. It slipped 0.4 percent against
the Japanese currency, to 116.04 yen. The Greek two-year yield
fell five basis points to 25.13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
