Raffles Hotels & Resorts  plans to
open a luxury hotel in Istanbul’s Zorlu Center, a residential,
retail and office complex that’s under construction.  Zorlu Holding AS, owner of the complex, will invest about
$175 million in the hotel, Chairman Ahmet Nazif Zorlu said at a
press conference today. Raffles will manage the 180-room hotel
for 30 years, Chairman John Johnston said at the briefing.  The Zorlu Center project in Istanbul’s business district
will cost a total of $2.5 billion, Zorlu said. Zorlu bought the
site from the government’s asset sale agency for $800 million in
2007. Singapore-based Raffles also plans to manage hotels in  New
York ,  London , Shanghai, Tokyo and  Hong Kong , Johnston said.  Zorlu Holding started to build a $500 million office
project in Istanbul’s Levent district, Mesut Pektas, head of
Zorlu’s real estate unit, said on the sidelines of the briefing.
Zorlu will also start a shopping mall project of as much as $250
million in the Aegean city of Izmir next year, Pektas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
