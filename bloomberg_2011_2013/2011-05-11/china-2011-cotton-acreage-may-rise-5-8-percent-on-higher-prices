China , the world’s largest cotton
user, may increase planted acreage by 5.8 percent this year amid
higher prices, according to a statement on the  China National
Cotton Exchange ’s website.  The country may plant a total 81.5 million mu (5.43 million
hectare) of cotton in 2011, up 4.48 million mu from a year ago,
according to a survey in April of 13 major cotton-producing
provinces, the exchange said. The survey result was 0.4
percentage higher than last month’s.  Most farmers completed planting by the end of April, except
for very few summer-cotton varieties, it said.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
