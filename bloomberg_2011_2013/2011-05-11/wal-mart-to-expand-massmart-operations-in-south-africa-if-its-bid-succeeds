Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said it wants to expand the operations of
South Africa’s  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  once it has acquiried the
company.  “The whole point of entering South Africa is that we want
to grow the business and expand it to people who don’t have the
opportunity right now,” Andy Bond, Wal-Mart’s executive vice-
president responsible for the U.K. and Africa, said at antitrust
hearings in Pretoria, South Africa today.  Wal-Mart offered to buy 51 percent of Massmart, South
Africa’s largest food and general goods wholesaler, for 16.5
billion rand ($2.44 billion). The transaction has been opposed
by the South African government and labour unions over concerns
that the purchase may result in job losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
