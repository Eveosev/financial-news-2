OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s largest oil
company, said an oil pipeline that exploded in Yemen in March
can’t be repaired because of instability in the country.  “The situation in the area where the damage has been
incurred is not stable and until it is stable then clearly we’re
not going to go out there and fix it,” OMV Chief Financial
Officer David Davies said on a conference call with analysts
today. There is “no sign of it being repaired,” he said.  OMV, based in Vienna, halted crude oil production in the
Middle Eastern country after an explosion damaged the state-
owned pipeline in mid-March. The company said today it doesn’t
expect to resume production there this year.  The pipeline, which connects the Marib fields to the Ras
Isa export terminal, has halted 110,000 barrels a day of light
sweet crude oil production, Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays
Plc said today in a note. About 80 to 90 percent of  Yemen ’s
260,000 barrel-a-day output is idled also because of oil worker
strikes in the Masila area, she said.  OMV’s share of production at the Habban field averaged
6,600 barrels a day last year. It operates the field with a 44
percent stake. OMV has been active in Yemen since 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
