Banks considered too big to fail that
take the most risks are getting better credit ratings because of
presumed taxpayer bailouts, said Heinrich Haasis, president of
 Germany ’s savings banks association.  “Good ratings are awarded when the institutions are so
large and risky that you can expect the backing of the public
hand,” Haasis said in an e-mailed statement today. “That sends
the wrong message after the financial crisis.”  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday said it will reassess
past assumptions about government support for Germany’s state-
owned banks known as Landesbanken. That review could trigger
negative outlooks or downgrades for those lenders, the credit
ratings company said.  “I am optimistic that we’ve seen the proof that the owners
support the Landesbanken and that ratings will reflect this
accordingly,” Christian Brand, the head of the Association of
German Public Sector Banks, said at a press conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
