Brazil  is unwilling to sell bonds on
the international market at a yield that is higher than what it
paid in its last debt sale, Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin
said.  The Treasury last tapped the international market in
October, when it sold 1.1 billion reais ($684 million) of bonds
maturing in 2028 to yield 8.85 percent. The yield rose 3 basis
points to 9.15 percent at 9:31 a.m. New York time.  “It is very unlikely,” Augustin said in an interview late
yesterday in Brasilia when asked whether the Treasury could
issue foreign bonds with a higher yield.  Augustin said in a Jan. 21 interview that the government
plans to sell real-denominated securities as part of an effort
to stem a 44 percent rally in the currency since the beginning
of 2009. He said the government would either re-open its
existing real bonds, or sell new debt overseas maturing in 10
and 30 years. The government also included the outstanding real
notes in its buyback program to improve liquidity, according to
the 2011 financing  plan .  To contact the reporters on this story:
