Norway ’s central bank will start a
series of interest rate increases this week as policy makers try
to steer accelerating economic growth, DnB NOR ASA said.  Norway’s biggest bank raised its growth forecasts for 2011
and 2012 and now sees the mainland economy, which excludes oil
and shipping, expanding 3.1 percent this year and 3.9 percent in
2012, according to a report released in Oslo today. The bank had
forecast 2.4 percent growth for 2011 and 3 percent for 2012, in
a January report.  Norges Bank will probably raise the benchmark interest rate
at its May 12 meeting and continue tightening in September,
December and February, DnB NOR said. The rate will reach 4.75
percent by 2014, it predicts.  “Higher wage and cost growth at home leads to increased
price growth and will trigger more frequent rate increases going
forward,” DnB NOR said in the report.  Norges Bank  has signaled it will start raising its
overnight deposit rate either in May or June after shelving a
tightening cycle a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
