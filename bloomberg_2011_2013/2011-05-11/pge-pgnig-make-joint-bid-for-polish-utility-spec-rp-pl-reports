PGE, Poland’s biggest utility, and
Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA, the gas company
known as PGNiG, have made a joint bid to the city of Warsaw to
buy heat distributor SPEC SA, Rzeczpospolita reported on its
Rp.pl website, without saying where it got the information.  The two state-controlled companies are now conducting due
diligence on the municipally-owned utility, whose book value is
1.5 billion zloty ($549.8 million), the newspaper reported. PGE
and PGNiG have agreed to take equal shares in SPEC and Treasury
Minister Aleksander Grad, who oversees state assets, approves of
the companies’ decision to make a combined bid, Rp.pl reported,
citing “unofficial” information.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
