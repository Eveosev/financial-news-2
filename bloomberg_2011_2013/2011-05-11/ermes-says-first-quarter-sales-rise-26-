Hermes International (RMS)  SCA, the French
maker of Birkin handbags and silk scarves, reported first-
quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates as wealthy consumers
purchased more luxury watches and fragrances.  Revenue increased 26 percent to 637.1 million euros ($918
million) from 507.7 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-
based company said today in a statement. The average estimate of
three analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 590.3 million euros.
Excluding currency swings, sales climbed 21 percent.  “You can’t really ask for more,”  Antoine Belge , an
analyst at HSBC in Paris, said in a phone interview. He has a
“neutral” recommendation on the shares.  Worldwide sales of  luxury goods  may rise 8 percent this
year, matching 2010’s pace, as demand strengthens in the U.S.
and  Europe  and emerging-market shoppers splurge on costly
handbags and other items, Bain & Co. said this month.  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , which owns a 20.2 percent stake in
Hermes, posted a 17 percent gain in first-quarter revenue.  Hermes rose as much as 1.8 percent in Paris trading to the
highest in almost five months. The shares were up 1.50 euros, or
0.9 percent, to 163.20 euros as of 9:18 a.m.  Hermes forecasts full-year consolidated revenue growth of 8
percent to 10 percent at constant exchange rates. This “may now
seem conservative in view of the stellar start to the year,”
Pierre Lamelin, an analyst at CA Cheuvreux, wrote in a research
report. He rates Hermes shares “underperform.”  Uncertain Outlook  The outlook for 2011 “is clouded by geopolitical and
economic uncertainties, and more specifically by trends in the
Japanese market,” Hermes said in the statement. “As a result,
it is difficult to make any projections.”  Excluding currency swings, revenue jumped 27 percent in the
Asia-Pacific region outside  Japan , where sales rose 0.3 percent.
Favorable conditions in Japan at the start of the year reversed
after the March 11 earthquake, the luxury-goods maker said.
Hermes gets 16 percent of sales from the country.  Revenue increased 20 percent in Europe and 33 percent in
the Americas at constant exchange rates, Hermes said.  Excluding currency shifts, sales of  leather goods  increased
17 percent in the quarter, while revenue from silk ties and
scarves gained 26 percent. Apparel sales and fashion accessories
climbed 21 percent on the same basis.  Watch revenue rose 34 percent at constant exchange.
Hermes’s full-year sales growth from timepieces may be reduced
by the situation in Japan, the head of the company’s watch unit
said in a March interview.  Perfume sales advanced 33 percent on the same basis, while
tableware sales increased 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
