Sina Corp., owner of China’s third-
most visited website, posted first-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as the company increased spending to develop
its microblogging service.  Net income fell to $15 million, or 23 cents a share, from
$24.4 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier, Sina said in a
statement today. That compared with the $15.4 million average of
eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 18
percent to $100.2 million.  Sina is raising spending on its Twitter-like Weibo
microblogging site to fend off competition from rivals including
 Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  The service won’t contribute
“meaningfully” to Sina’s earnings until next year, according
to CLSA Ltd. analyst Jialong Shi.  “The spending on the microblogging service will affect
Sina’s margins this year,” Shi said before the earnings
announcement.  Sina fell 29 cents to $119.80 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading today before the announcement. The stock has surged 74
percent this year, making it the best performer in the Morgan
Stanley Internet Index.  Operating expenses rose 25 percent to $41.8 million, Sina
said.  Second-quarter sales, excluding deferred license revenue,
may be $112 million to $115 million, Sina said in the statement.
Analysts on average were predicting sales of $118.6 million,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  Sina’s website draws fewer visitors than that of Baidu Inc.
 China ’s biggest search-engine operator, and Tencent’s QQ.com,
according to  China Websites Ranking , a site run by the Internet
Society of China that compiles Web traffic information.  -- Mark Lee . Editors: Chua Kong Ho, Vipin Nair  To contact the reporter on this story:
