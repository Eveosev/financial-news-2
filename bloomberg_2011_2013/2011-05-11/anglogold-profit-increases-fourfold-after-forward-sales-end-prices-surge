AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s
third-largest gold miner, said first-quarter profit jumped more
than fourfold as it ended forward sales of the precious metal
and prices advanced to a record.  Profit attributable to shareholders rose to $241 million,
or 62 cents a share, from $56 million, or 15 cents, in the prior
quarter, Johannesburg-based AngloGold said today in a statement.
Adjusted profit excluding one-time items was 53 cents.  AngloGold and Barrick Gold Corp., the largest producer,
have canceled forward sales to benefit from prices that climbed
to a record $1,437.40 an ounce last quarter. AngloGold spent
about $6 billion last year eliminating contracts that had bound
it to sell production below market rates.  Output fell 9.5 percent to 1.039 million ounces in the
first quarter, while costs increased 5 percent to $706 an ounce,
according to the statement. The company is targeting production
of 1.09 million ounces at a cost of $760 an ounce in the second
quarter.  Analysts who track South African mining companies measure
performance over consecutive quarters rather than year-on-year.  AngloGold fell as much as 1 percent to 308.01 rand in
Johannesburg trading, and was at 309.10 rand as of 9:18 a.m.
local time.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  is the world’s second-largest gold
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
