Asian stocks rose, with a regional
benchmark index climbing for a third straight day, after oil and

increased 1.7 percent in Sydney.  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  gained 2.5 percent,

 Japan ’s second-largest tiremaker, jumped 4.9 percent in Tokyo
after boosting its profit forecast. Toyota Motor Corp. and rival

reflecting concerns about monetary tightening and a slowdown in
economic indicators,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based
strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “Sentiment is now shifting because of
the strengthening earnings environment and the positive
prospects for corporate activity.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent, the most in
more than a week, to 138.64 as of 7:11 p.m. in  Tokyo . About

monetary tightening. Energy, materials and consumer stocks led

and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s purchase of Skype Technologies SA
bolstered optimism that earnings and takeovers will keep fueling
the rally.  Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S. milk processor, raised its
full-year earnings forecast and posted first-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Microsoft agreed to buy Skype Technologies SA for $8.5
billion, using a growing cash pile to gain the world’s most
popular Web-calling service and help it catch up in online and
mobile advertising, according to a statement yesterday.  Yen Pause  “The global economy is on a track to recovery,” said

the exporters and related stocks, is taking a pause. That will
likely boost the stock market.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 1.3 percent to $103.88 a

compared with a 5.4 percent increase in March. Producer prices
jumped 6.8 percent, the  statistics bureau  said today in Beijing.  The government aims for full-year inflation of 4 percent as
