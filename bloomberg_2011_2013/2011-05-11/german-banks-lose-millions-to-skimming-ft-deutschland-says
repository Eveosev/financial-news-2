German banks lost 60 million euros
($86 million) last year as a result of “skimming” attacks on
automated teller machines,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing a Federal Criminal Police Office report.  More than 3000 ATMs were manipulated, forcing  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  to exchange 1,200 machines, FTD said. Banks belonging to Cash
Group exchanged 2,500 machines, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
