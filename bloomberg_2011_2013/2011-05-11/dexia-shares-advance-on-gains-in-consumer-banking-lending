Dexia SA (DEXB) , the lender to local
governments that was rescued by France and  Belgium  in 2008, rose
as much as 5.3 percent in Brussels trading after reporting
increased earnings from consumer banking and municipal lending.  Dexia climbed as much as 14 cents to 2.72 euros, its
biggest gain since Feb. 16, and traded up 4.2 percent at 2.70
euros by 10:26 a.m., giving the Paris- and Brussels-based bank a
market value of about 5 billion euros ($7.2 billion).  Pretax profit at Dexia’s main unit, which includes retail
banking and municipal lending, more than doubled to 421 million
euros in the first quarter, the bank said in a statement today.
Profit from  consumer-banking  networks in Belgium, Luxembourg and
 Turkey  rose 51 percent to 251 million euros, while revenue in
Belgium gained 12 percent on increased deposits.  “The core division surprised in a positive way,” said
 Albert Ploegh , an analyst at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam who has a
“hold” rating on the stock.  Dexia’s first-quarter net income fell 68 percent to 69
million euros as losses from risky assets, including a 102
billion-euro bond portfolio, increased.  The company held 3.47 billion euros of Greek sovereign debt
and 1.83 billion euros of Portuguese sovereign debt at the end
of March, the company said on its website. The bank has no gross
exposure to Irish government debt.  Dexia isn’t considering the possibility of a restructuring
of  Greece ’s sovereign debt, Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani told journalists on a telephone conference call. He
added that the bank’s capital level would allow it to absorb
“hypothetical” net losses of about 800 million euros to 900
million euros in the event of a so-called haircut of about 30
percent of Greek debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
