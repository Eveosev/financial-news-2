Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said it has installed a
3,600-foot (1,097-meter) segment of its Line 6B under the St.
Clair river in Michigan.  “All that’s left to do now is tie that line in, which we
expect to do in mid-June” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Daniel said in a conference call today. The company tunneled
under the river and pulled the pipe segment through to replace
an older river crossing.  Integrity work on the line, which can carry up to 190,000
barrels of oil products a day, was completed in the first
quarter, Daniel said. The work was ordered by U.S.
transportation officials after the line ruptured last July,
spilling oil into a creek near Marshall,  Michigan .  The company was given 180 days by the Department of
Transportation’s Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration to complete internal inspections and excavations
along the line to ensure it can be operated safely after the
spill, which was estimated at 19,000 barrels. The line, which
runs between Griffith,  Indiana , and Sarnia, Ontario, was
restarted in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
