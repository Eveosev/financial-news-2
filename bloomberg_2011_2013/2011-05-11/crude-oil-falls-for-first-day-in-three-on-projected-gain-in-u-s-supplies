Oil fell below $100 a barrel in  New
York  and gasoline tumbled the most in more than two years after
an Energy Department report showed that U.S. supplies surged and
fuel demand slipped.  Crude dropped 5.5 percent after the department said
stockpiles jumped 3.78 million barrels to 370.3 million last
week. Gasoline inventories unexpectedly increased 1.28 million
barrels to 205.8 million, the first gain in 12 weeks. Total fuel
consumption declined 0.9 percent to 18.2 million barrels a day,
the lowest level since June 2009.  “We have a tremendous glut,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “The rally
in commodities appears to be over. We’re going to see prices
work their way lower in coming weeks.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell $5.67 to settle at $98.21
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 29
percent from a year ago.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 25.69 cents, or 7.6
percent, to settle at $3.1228 a gallon in New York. It was the
biggest single-session decrease since Feb. 17, 2009.  Volume for gasoline was a record 243,397 contracts in
electronic trading today on the exchange, according to Alexandra
Siff, a spokeswoman for exchange owner CME Group Inc.  CME Group Inc. suspended trading of gasoline, crude and
heating oil on the Nymex for five minutes starting at 12:06
p.m., said Laurie Bischel, a spokeswoman for the exchange in
 Chicago . Trading was stopped after June-delivery gasoline fell
25 cents, the daily limit. Limits were widened to 50 cents a
gallon for gasoline and heating oil and $20 a barrel for crude.  Investors ‘Whipsawed’  “Investors have been whipsawed over the last week,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of the Villanova, Pennsylvania-based
Schork Group Inc. “The market will remain extremely volatile.”  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.1
cents to $3.962 a gallon yesterday, the first increase in six
days, AAA said on its website. The price climbed to $3.985 on
May 4, the highest since July 24, 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped 11 percent last week, the most since 2008, as slower
growth in U.S. services and fewer German manufacturing orders
stoked concern the economic recovery is faltering. Oil fell 15
percent last week following the death of  Osama bin Laden . The
index was down 3.9 percent to 681 at 3:24 p.m.  Two-Year High  Crude stockpiles climbed more than twice as much as
projected last week to the highest level since May 2009,
according to the department. Gasoline inventories increased the
most since the first week of February.  Supplies of crude were forecast to advance 1.5 million
barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline stockpiles were projected to
fall 750,000 barrels.  Gasoline inventories on the East Coast, known as PADD 1,
surged 3.51 million barrels to 51.5 million in the seven days
ended May 6, the first gain in 11 weeks. Supplies rebounded from
the lowest level since October 2008.  “The numbers were pretty bearish, especially for
gasoline,” Schork said. “Gasoline supplies increased on the
East Coast for the first time in more than two months. They had
been getting dangerously low.”  Consumption of the motor fuel dropped 1.3 percent to 8.83
million a day last week, the lowest level since the seven days
ended February 11, the report showed.  ‘Winter Doldrums’  “Normally, demand rises at this time of year ahead of the
summer driving season,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “Instead we’re looking at
the levels associated with the winter doldrums. This is in part
a response to high gasoline prices.”  U.S. gasoline consumption peaks between the Memorial Day
holiday in late May and Labor Day in early September, when
Americans traditionally take vacations.  Refineries operated at 81.7 percent of capacity, 1.1
percentage points lower than the prior week. That’s down from 88
percent of capacity a year earlier. A 0.3 percentage-point
increase was forecast.  Futures also dropped as the dollar climbed against the
euro, reducing the appeal of commodities to investors. The euro
slipped on speculation European leaders are slowing the drive to
grant  Greece  additional aid, bolstering concern the nation will
have to restructure its debt.  The dollar rose 1.4 percent against the euro to $1.4211
after increasing to $1.4172 earlier today.  Prices also declined on concern that  China  will further
tighten monetary policy to cool price increases, reducing
economic growth in the world’s biggest energy consuming country.  Crude has climbed as much as 26 percent this year as unrest
spread in the Middle East and North Africa. Oil is up 7.5
percent this year as of the close of trading today.  Rebel Advance  Libyan rebels advanced west toward the strategic oil town
of Brega today. About 1.3 million barrels a day has been lost
from  Libya , holder of  Africa ’s largest reserves, in an armed
uprising against Muammar Qaddafi’s four-decade rule.  “There are two big factors that will dictate where  oil
prices  go,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at
Deutsche Bank AG in  Washington . “On the one hand, there are
worries about the economy and what that will mean for demand,
and on the other, there are issues like Libya and what they’ll
mean for supply.”  Brent crude  for June settlement slipped $5.06, or 4.3
percent, to end the session at $112.57 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 905,935
contracts as of 3:23 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 819.7
yesterday, 12 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.65 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
