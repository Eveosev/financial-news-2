Ghana ’s inflation slowed for the
second consecutive month in April as the impact of a 30 percent
increase in gasoline prices in January eased and the cedi
stabilized.  The inflation rate fell to 9 percent from 9.1 percent in
March,  Grace Bediako , a statistician at the  Ghana  Statistical
Service, told reporters today in the capital, Accra.  “I see the gasoline price effects easing further,”
Collins Appiah, head of asset management at Accra-based  NDK
Financial Services Ltd ., said by phone on May 9.  The increase in gasoline prices on Jan. 4 by Ghana’s
National Petroleum Authority pushed inflation up to 9.1 percent
in January from 8.6 percent the month before. Price-growth had
slowed in the previous 18 months from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009.  The recent strength in the cedi has also helped slow
inflation. After weakening as much as 5.7 percent against the
dollar in the first five weeks of 2011, the currency has
stabilized and is now down only 1.5 percent in the year, easing
pressure on import costs.  Slowing inflation enabled the central bank to cut its key
interest rate by 4.5 percentage points in the 12 months though
July 2010, when it reduced the rate to 13.5 percent. The rate
was maintained for the third consecutive meeting at 13.5 percent
on Feb. 18.  “The central bank will want to maintain the status quo,”
Lisa Lewin, head of sub-Saharan Africa analysis at London-based
Business Monitor International, said in an e-mailed comment
yesterday. “Inflation has been relatively low and stable over
the past several months.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
