Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
plans to subdue riots in the country through an amendment to the
constitution which would deny arrested protesters bail for six
months, Daily Monitor reported.  The Ugandan leader will propose the bill once a new
parliament starts work on May 19, the Kampala-based newspaper
reported, citing Museveni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
