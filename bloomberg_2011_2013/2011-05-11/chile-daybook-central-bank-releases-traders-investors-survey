6 p.m. ahead of tomorrow’s monetary policy meeting.  ECONOMY:

increases in May after raising lending costs by a half-point in
the past two months, according to a monthly central bank survey
of economists. Policy makers will raise the benchmark rate this
week to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent, according to the median
estimate of 65 economists in the bank’s survey.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index rose 0.7 percent to 4,857.58.

after surging 20 percent on May 6, the day after its initial
public offering, Chile’s first IPO this year.
*Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA fell 1.2 percent to 878.54
pesos. Environmental groups and Chilean legislators have filed
court injunctions to block the company’s HidroAysen project,
which had its environmental impact study approved this week.

13,455 pesos.  Latin America ’s largest airline by market value
reported a 28 percent increase in passenger traffic in April,
