Luxembourg has put on hold plans to
sell the government’s first Islamic bonds, Central Bank Governor
Yves Mersch said.  “As of late, Luxembourg has had less need to issue,”
Mersch told reporters at the Islamic Financial Services Board
Summit in Luxembourg City today. “This might have influenced
the decision to put the project on hold.”  Mersch in May 2010 said the country was considering selling
Islamic bonds, without providing further details. Earlier this
year the U.K.,  Europe ’s largest market for Shariah-compliant
financial products and services, canceled what would have been
the first sale of Islamic bonds by a Western federal government.  Luxembourg is rated ‘Aaa’ by Moody’s Investors Service and
‘AAA’ at  Standard & Poor’s , the highest investment grades. The
nation has 4 billion euro worth of  government bonds  outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The German state of Saxony-Anhalt became the first European
borrower to sell bonds adhering to Islamic law in August 2004
with 100 million euros ($144 million) of five-year sukuk,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
