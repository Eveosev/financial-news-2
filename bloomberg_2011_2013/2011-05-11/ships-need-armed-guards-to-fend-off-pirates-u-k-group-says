Merchant vessels need armed guards to
stop Somali pirates from disrupting world trade, a group
representing the U.K. shipping industry said, reversing a
previous policy that cautioned against the practice.  “The threat is constantly increasing, and we need to look
at new alternatives,” Jonathan Roberts, a London-based
spokesman for the  Chamber of Shipping , said by phone today. The
group had previously expressed “real caution” about using
armed guards on board vessels, he said.  National governments should be allowed to grant licenses
for private companies who provide armed guards, the chamber,
whose members have more than 900 ships, said in a  statement  on
its website today. The practice should be employed only when
vessels are unable to secure naval protection, said Roberts.  Last year was a record for acts of Somali piracy, with 49
ships hijacked and more than 1,000 hostages taken, of whom 700
are still being held, the statement shows.  The chamber speaks for 139 members from oil producer BP
Plc’s  shipping  arm to P&O Ferries Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
