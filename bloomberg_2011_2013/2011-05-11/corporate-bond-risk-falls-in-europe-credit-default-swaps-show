The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 4 basis
points to 352, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improved perceptions
of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis points to 95.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers dropped 3 basis points to 132 and
the subordinated index was down 6 at 227.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
