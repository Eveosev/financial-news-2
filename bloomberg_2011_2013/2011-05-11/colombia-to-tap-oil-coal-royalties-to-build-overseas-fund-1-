Colombia  plans to save between $1.5
billion and $2 billion of oil and coal royalties per year in an
overseas fund to help prevent gains in the peso, Finance
Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told reporters in  Washington .  Colombia has struggled to ease gains in the peso, which has
strengthened almost 23 percent over the past two years, the most
after  Brazil  among Latin Americaâ€™s six major currencies. The
government and the central bank have sought to curb the peso
without resorting to  capital controls .  As part of a slew of measures to prevent the currency from
strengthening further, the government has held some dividends
from state oil company Ecopetrol SA overseas and has reduced
incentives for private companies to borrow abroad. The central
bank plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until at least
June 17. The bank in February had extended the dollar purchase
program it had initiated last September.  The peso slid 1.4 percent to 1,811.75 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:18 p.m. New York time. Earlier it touched 1,802.50, its
weakest since April 19.  Colombia plans to spend $50 billion in infrastructure
projects over the next eight to 10 years, with $35 billion of
that coming from royalties and another $8 billion from the sale
of a 10 percent stake in Ecopetrol, Echeverry said. The
remainder would be funded from the budget, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
