Nigeria’s Senate voted unanimously
today to pass a bill creating a sovereign wealth fund for
 Africa ’s top oil producer with seed capital of $1 billion.  The legislation creates the Nigeria Sovereign Investment
Authority, which will be split into the Nigeria Infrastructure
Fund, the Future Generations Fund and the Stabilization Fund,
according to a draft of the bill obtained by Bloomberg. Each
component will represent at least 20 percent of the total.  The fund will help the country save more of its oil revenue
and will also help to funnel money into infrastructure projects
in Africa’s most populous nation, according to David Mark,
president of the Senate. The West African country relies on
crude exports for about 95 percent of its foreign currency
earnings. It’s the only member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries without a sovereign fund, according to the
Information Ministry.  The sovereign fund, to be based in the capital, Abuja, will
have a governing board headed by the president. Other members
include governors of the 36 states, the ministers of finance,
justice and planning, the governor of the central bank and the
chief economic adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
