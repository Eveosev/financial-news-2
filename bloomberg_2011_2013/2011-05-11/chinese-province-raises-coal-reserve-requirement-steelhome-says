China ’s Shandong province doubled the
minimum requirement for power-coal reserves to 30 days’ use from
15 days,  SteelHome Daily News  reported, citing Shi Yuming, an
official with the provincial government.  The increase was ordered as a precautionary measure,
SteelHome cited the official as saying, without elaborating.
Shandong depends on coal to meet more than 70 percent of its
energy needs, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
