BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA Chairman Michel Pebereau, who built Europe’s largest lender by assets out of a
French state-owned bank, said he will retire this year.  Pebereau, 69, will be succeeded as chairman by Baudouin Prot, currently chief executive officer, on Dec. 1, he told
shareholders gathered in Paris today for their annual general
meeting. Jean-Laurent Bonnafe, chief operating officer since
2008, will become CEO of the Paris-based lender, Pebereau said.  “I have great confidence in the team which these two high-
quality business leaders will build together,” Pebereau said.  Pebereau, who became head of Banque Nationale de Paris SA
in 1993 as the lender was sold to the public, shook up the
French banking industry with a $38 billion unsolicited bid for
Paribas SA and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA in 1999 to block a friendly
merger between them. BNP won Paribas while Societe Generale, led
at the time by  Daniel Bouton , evaded Pebereau’s grasp.  “For these last 18 years, the adventure that began as BNP
and continued as BNP Paribas has been crowned with a success
that we would not have dared to hope for,” Pebereau said.  Prot, who turns 60 later this month, graduated from French
business school HEC in 1972 and from Ecole Nationale
d’Administration in 1976. He worked as an auditor at the  Finance
Ministry  from 1976 to 1980 and held positions within the
Industry Ministry from 1980 to 1983. Prot joined BNP in 1983.  Dodged Crisis  Prot won a seven-month battle to acquire Fortis assets in
 Belgium  and Luxembourg in 2009. Under his tenure, BNP Paribas
dodged most of the fallout from the U.S. subprime crisis.  Bonnafe, 49, has a track-record of making acquisitions
work. Since 2009, he has overseen the integration of the
businesses the French bank bought two years ago from Fortis,
once Belgium’s largest financial-services company. From 1999 to
2000, he helped Prot and Pebereau as BNP absorbed Paribas and in
2006 Bonnafe was dispatched to  Rome  to head the acquisition of
 Italy ’s Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA.  Bonnafe headed BNP Paribas’s French retail-banking unit
from 2002 to 2008 and became COO in 2008, in charge of all
consumer-banking operations.  ‘Setting Standard’  Bonnafe, an engineer who graduated from Ecole Polytechnique
and Ecole des Mines in Paris, started his career at the Industry
Ministry in 1986 and was an adviser to Foreign Trade Minister
Bruno Durieux in 1992 and 1993. He joined BNP in 1993. Unlike
Pebereau and Prot, Bonnafe didn’t attend Ecole Nationale
D’Administration, whose graduates include former French
Presidents  Jacques Chirac  and Valery Giscard d’Estaing.  “Pebereau is putting in his successors little by little
and is going to hand the bank over to those who helped him build
it,” said Anis Bouayad, founder of Paris-based advisory firm
Strategie.Alliance. “Things are going well in terms of
profitability, management and governance. This is a company that
is setting the standard.”  BNP Paribas last week reported a 15 percent increase in
first-quarter profit to 2.62 billion euros ($3.76 billion),
beating analysts’ estimates. Societe Generale,  France ’s second-
largest bank, said on May 5 that net income fell 14 percent in
the period, hurt by a charge tied to its own debt and provisions
resulting from political turmoil in  Egypt .  Outperforming Rival  BNP Paribas shares have risen 7 percent in 2011, outpacing
the 2 percent increase of the 48-company Bloomberg  Europe  Banks
and Financial Services Index. The stock has outperformed that of
smaller French rival Societe Generale every year since the
financial crisis began in 2007.  Pebereau started work in 1967 as a Finance Ministry auditor
and held different advisory positions to then-Finance Minister
Giscard d’Estaing 1970 to 1974. After working as chief of staff
for Finance Minister Rene Monory from 1978 to 1980, he aimed to
become treasury director.  The election of a Socialist government in 1981 changed his
plans. A year later he quit the civil service to become managing
director of state-owned Credit Commercial de France SA, then
France’s sixth-largest bank. He became CCF’s chairman in 1987.  To contact the reporter on this story:
