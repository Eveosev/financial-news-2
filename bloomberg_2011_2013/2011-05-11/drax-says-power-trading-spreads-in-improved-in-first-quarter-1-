Drax Group Plc (DRX) , owner of the U.K.’s
largest coal-fired power plant, said margins from electricity
sales including the cost of buying carbon dioxide permits
climbed in the first quarter.  The company said it had sold 22.6 terrawatts of power for
delivery in 2011 as of May 3, of which 17.7 megawatts was sold
at an average price of 55.3 pounds ($90.51). The coal plant has
sold a total of 11.5 terrawatts of power for 2012 and 3.2
terrawatts for 2013.  “We have taken advantage of better dark-green spreads to
strengthen our contracted position,” the Selby, England-based
utility said in a statement today. The dark-green spread is the
gross margin for selling a unit of electricity minus costs
including carbon emission allowances and coal.  Drax, the owner of Western Europe’s largest coal-fired
power plant, is covered under the European Union’s emissions
trading program. It has an annual cap of 9.5 million tons of CO2
in the years through 2012 and must buy permits to cover any
excess. The utility will have to purchase allowances to cover
all of its emissions from 2013.  The utility has hedged 23.8 terrawatt-hours of carbon
emissions allowances in 2011, including its free allowances, and
12.9 terrawatt-hours through 2012. Commodity markets “remain
volatile and we are therefore cautious,” Drax said. First-half
results through June 30 will be announced Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
