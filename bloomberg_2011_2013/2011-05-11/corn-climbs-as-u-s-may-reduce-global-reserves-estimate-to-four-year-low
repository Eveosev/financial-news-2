Corn rose in  Chicago  on speculation
the U.S. may forecast global stockpiles before this year’s
harvest at the lowest level in four years. Wheat climbed for a
fourth day.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  may forecast global corn
reserves before the Northern Hemisphere harvest at 122.5 million
metric tons, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 14
analysts. The USDA is set to release the estimate at 8:30 a.m.
in  Washington . Last year inventories were 145.8 million tons.  “There’s buying in the corn market ahead of the USDA
report on concern over dwindling global stockpiles,” said
Toshimitsu Kawanabe, an analyst at broker Central Shoji Co.  Corn for July delivery gained 4 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.1125 a bushel at 11 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The grain jumped 89 percent in the past year on harvest
disruptions and increased demand.  Corn planting in the U.S. is advancing at half of last
year’s pace because of excess rain, government data show. About
40 percent of the crop was planted as of May 8, up from 13
percent a week earlier, the USDA said May 9. Still, the pace of
sowing was behind last year’s 80 percent and the previous five-
year average of 59 percent.  Wheat for July delivery climbed 2.75 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $8.015 a bushel. The grain advanced as wet weather in  Canada 
and the U.S. northern Plains slows planting of spring varieties
and dry weather in southern states from  Kansas  through Texas
curbs production.  Worst Since 1996  The Canadian Wheat Board said fields are so muddy that only
3 percent of grain has been sown, compared with 40 percent
normally. Drought has left the Kansas wheat crop in the worst
shape since 1996, and dry spells are threatening crops in
 France , Western Australia and China.  Texas crop output has “pretty much shut down” because of
drought conditions in the state, according to an agricultural
program at  Texas A&M University . As much as 60 percent of the
state’s wheat crop won’t be harvested, Travis Miller, a program
leader with the university’s AgriLife Extension Service, said
yesterday.  The global wheat inventory will likely be 182.1 million
tons before the start of the Northern Hemisphere harvest, below
the USDA’s estimate of 182.83 million tons last month, according
to the average estimate of the 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News last week.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris lost 1 euro, or 0.4 percent, to 227.75 euros ($327.80) a
ton.  Soybeans for July delivery slipped 1 cent, or 0.1 percent,
to $13.37 a bushel in Chicago after three days of gains. The
oilseed, used to make livestock feed and cooking oil, rose 39
percent in the past year on record purchases by  China , the
world’s biggest soybean importer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
