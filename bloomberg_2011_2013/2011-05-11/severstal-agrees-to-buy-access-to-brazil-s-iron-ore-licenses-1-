OAO Severstal, the largest steelmaker
in  Russia , agreed to buy 25 percent of a company that owns iron-
ore exploration licenses in Brazil as the producer seeks higher
profits by diversifying into mining and emerging markets.  Severstal, based in Cherepovets, Russia, has an option to
buy another 50 percent of SPG Mineracao, owner of licenses in
the northern Amapa state, after agreeing to pay $49 million for
a quarter stake, the steelmaker said in a statement today.  “The acquisition in Brazil fits Severstal’s general drift
towards emerging markets and mining, which currently offer a
higher profit margin than steelmaking,” Dmitry Smolin, an
analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by phone.  Severstal controls an iron ore project in Liberia and mines
gold in Guinea and  Burkina Faso . Last year, it bought a stake in
a Philippine nickel project and agreed to build a joint venture
steel mill in India with production capacity of 5 million metric
tons a year in cooperation with state-run  NMDC Ltd. (NMDC)   Severstal sold three of its five  steel mills  in the U.S. in
March following losses. The company is seeking to become one of
the world’s five most-profitable steelmakers, billionaire Chief
Executive Officer Alexey Mordashov said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
