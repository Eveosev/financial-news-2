Phillip Morris CR, the Czech unit of
the world’s largest cigarette maker, plans to return to normal
dividend payment after an extra profit payout this year, Finance
Director Daniel Gordon said.  “Going forward, you should assume that we resume normal
payout, which previously has been 100 percent of net income,”
Chief Finance Officer Daniel Gordon said in a conference call
with analysts today. The company decided to pay an extra 2010
dividend because of a better excise-tax outlook for the next
four years in the  Czech Republic  and  Slovakia , he added.  Philip Morris shareholders approved a dividend payment of
1,260 koruna a share ($75) on April 29. The payout came from 884
koruna per share in unconsolidated net income and 376 koruna per
share in retained earnings accumulated over 10 years, Gordon
said.  The growing illicit tobacco trade remains a concern in
Slovakia, where illegal sales increased from around 1 percent of
the market in 2009 to 3 percent last year, Gordon said. The
share in the Czech Republic remained “stable” at 10 percent,
he added.  The company, which raised prices in the first quarter,
considers it’s still too early to evaluate the impact on
earnings, Gordon said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
