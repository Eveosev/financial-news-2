AS Baltika needs to raise 13 million
euros ($18.7 million) in a share issue instead of the planned
3.15 million euros, the fifth-biggest owner of the Estonian
clothing company said in an interview with  Aeripaeev .  The Tallinn-based company also needs to replace Chief
Executive Meelis Milder, introduce an option plan as incentive
for staff and reduce the number of brands and stores, Sven-Erik
Sohlberg, a Swedish businessman, was cited as saying by the
newspaper. Sohlberg owns about 7 percent of shares in Baltika.  Baltika shareholders are due to decide on the share issue
proposal at a general meeting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
