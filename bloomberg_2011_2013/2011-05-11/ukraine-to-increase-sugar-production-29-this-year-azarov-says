Ukraine will probably increase sugar
output 29 percent this year on a larger harvest.  “We expect 2 million tons of beet sugar output if weather
is favorable,” Ukrainian Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said
today, opening a weekly government meeting in Kiev. Sugar
stockpiles came to 690,000 metric tons as of May 1, he said.  Sugar beet planting advanced 12 percent as of yesterday to
540,000 hectares (1.3 million acres), the Agriculture Ministry
said in a statement. The Ukrtsukor sugar producers’ group
expects planting to expand to 570,000 hectares this year from
502,000 hectares last year. Production of the sweetener was
1.545 million tons last year, according to Ukrtsukor.  Ukraine has started processing imported raw sugar,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said at the government
meeting today.  Refineries will process 266,000 tons of raw sugar this year
“if needed,” according to the country’s quota under the  World
Trade Organization  this year, the minister said.  Domestic sugar consumption is about 1.8 million tons,
according to the Economy Ministry estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
