Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero called a meeting of union leaders to discuss
proposed changes to wage-bargaining rules after negotiations
with business leaders dragged on beyond a March deadline.  Zapatero will meet in  Madrid  tomorrow with Candido Mendez
and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, the leaders of Spain’s two biggest
union federations, and Juan Rossell, who heads the CEOE business
lobby, according to a statement on the government’s website.
Zapatero canceled a trip to  Norway  that was scheduled for
tomorrow, said an official at his office who declined to be
named in line with policy.  Spain is overhauling labor and pension rules and
implementing the deepest budget cuts in three decades in an
attempt to shield its economy from the sovereign-debt crisis. In
January Zapatero set a deadline of March 18 for unions and
employers to reach a deal on changes to wage-bargaining rules as
the government aims to make it easier for Spanish companies to
compete abroad.  Spanish labor costs have risen an average 4.2 percent a
year since the start of the euro currency. Wages continued to
increase even as the country slid into the deepest recession in
six decades as most wage deals are linked to inflation. European
Central Bank Executive Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo
said on April 26 that  Spain ’s wage-bargaining rules are hard to
explain “without blushing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
