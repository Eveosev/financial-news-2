Tamoil SA is in the process of
starting its Collombey oil refinery,  Switzerland ’s second-
largest, following maintenance that began at the end of March.  “The refinery is progressively starting the units after
annual maintenance,” the Geneva-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. “As of week 21, the whole refinery will be
operating normally.” Week 21 starts on May 23.  Processing units were progressively halted from March 29
and work was expected to last from three to five weeks, Tamoil
said at the time. Maintenance was brought forward from June
because of low profits from turning crude into fuels, the
refiner said on March 25.  The 50,000 barrel-a-day Collombey refinery near Geneva
accounts for 42 percent of fuels produced in the country.
Petroplus Holdings AG’s Cressier plant can process 68,000
barrels of oil daily.  Tamoil is a unit of Oilinvest (Netherlands) BV Group, which
is owned by the  Libyan Investment Authority , a sovereign fund
that oversees the nation’s assets abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
