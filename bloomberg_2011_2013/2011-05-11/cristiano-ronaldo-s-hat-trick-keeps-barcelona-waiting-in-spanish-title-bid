Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick
as Real Madrid beat Getafe 4-0 to leave Barcelona needing to
avoid defeat today to clinch the Spanish soccer title.  Ronaldo followed his four goals against Sevilla on May 7 to
lift his season tally to a league-best 36 goals.Karim Benzema
also scored for Real last night at the Santiago Bernabeu.  If Real had failed to win, archrival Barcelona would have
been guaranteed its 21st league title. Josep Guardiola’s players
need one point from their final three games to secure a third
straight La Liga championship. Their first opportunity is at
13th-place Levante today.  In  France , Lille moved seven points clear atop Ligue 1
after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Saint-Etienne. Defending
champion Marseille can cut the gap to four points with three
games remaining if it beats Brest today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
