Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  is preparing to
start an ethylene unit at its Terneuzen chemicals site in the
Netherlands following a halt in March for planned maintenance.  “We are not yet back online and are in the process of
restarting,” Sue Breach, a U.K.-based company spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Cracker 1, along with other chemical processing units at
the facility, was shut in mid-March for the work and was
scheduled to be started at the beginning of May.  The cracker is one of three on site with capacity to
produce 580,000 metric tons of ethylene a year. Dow’s Terneuzen
site has a total capacity of 1.81 million tons a year, according
to the  Association  of Petrochemicals Producers in  Europe .
Ethylene is used to make plastics.  The crackers are flexible, able to use naphtha and liquid
petroleum gas as feedstock, according to Dow’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
