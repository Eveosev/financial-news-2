European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn comments on the economic outlook
in the EU and the aid program for Greece. Rehn spoke to the
European Parliament today in Strasbourg,  France .  On the European economy:  “ Europe ’s economic outlook today is quite dualistic. On
the one hand, the recovery in the real economy has taken hold
and is becoming more solid and self-sustaining. On the other
hand, it is uneven and we still face turbulence in the financial
markets, especially in the sovereign-debt markets. Thus a key
task of the EU’s economic policy now is to contain the
sovereign-debt crisis and thus to protect the ongoing recovery
in the real economy of Europe.”  On the Greek adjustment effort under the aid program:  “Greece has to seriously reinforce the implementation of
the economic reforms and achieve a breakthrough in the
privatization program and then ensure its full implementation.”  “It is absolutely necessary and urgent that the domestic
disputes are put aside and a cross-party support achieved for
the recovery of  Greece .”  “It is really an illusion to think there were any real
alternatives to the economic-reform program. This is therefore a
real test of credibility of the Greek political forces, both
government and opposition, and ultimately of the will of the
Greek people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
