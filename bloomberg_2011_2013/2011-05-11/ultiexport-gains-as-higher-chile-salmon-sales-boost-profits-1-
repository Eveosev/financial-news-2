Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  advanced in
Santiago, reversing an earlier decline, after reporting a 72
percent increase in first-quarter profit as salmon sales rose.  Multiexport, based in the southern Chilean city of Puerto
Montt, climbed 2.1 percent to 232.74 pesos after earlier sliding
as much as 1.3 percent.  Chile’s largest publicly traded salmon farmer posted net
income of $9.67 million, up from $5.61 million in the same three
months of last year, it wrote in a statement published today on
the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “On an operating level, Multiexport showed very good
margins,” said Alfredo Parra, an analyst at Euroamerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA. “The company also benefited from an
increase in the price of Atlantic salmon. Looking forward, the
trend looks positive.”  Sales increased to $77.1 million from $49.2 million.
 Chile ’s salmon industry is recovering from a 2007 virus outbreak
that decimated production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
