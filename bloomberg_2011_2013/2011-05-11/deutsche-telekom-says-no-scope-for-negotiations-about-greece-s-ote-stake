Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  said there is
“no scope for negotiations” if the Greek government chooses to
use an option to sell another 10 percent stake in Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA to the German company.  “If the Greek government wants to sell us the stake, it
will do so,” said Andreas Leigers, a Deutsche Telekom
spokesman, after Financial Times Deutschland reported the
company is trying to postpone the purchase. The phone operator
is standing by its obligations in the shareholders’ agreement,
Leigers said, adding that there are no plans to buy additional
shares in the company, also known as OTE, in the market.  Greece said Apr. 15 that it wants to sell its 20 percent
OTE stake this year as part of a 50 billion-euro ($72.1 billion)
asset sale plan to cut the highest debt ratio in the European
Union. It has the right to sell 10 percent to Deutsche Telekom
at 15 percent above the average market price of the past 20 days
by the end of 2011, Leigers said.  Deutsche Telekom’s management and supervisory board will
travel to  Greece  at the end of May, Leigers said. The visit will
involve a meeting with local executives.  Deutsche Telekom, with a 30 percent stake, fully
consolidates OTE, determines its management, and has the right
of first refusal for the remainder of the government holding.
The stock rose 2.1 percent to 7.15 euros as of 11:45 a.m. in
Athens trading today, valuing the government’s stake at about
700 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
