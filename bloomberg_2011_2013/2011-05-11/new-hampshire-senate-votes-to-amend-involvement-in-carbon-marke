The New Hampshire Senate voted to
amend, rather than repeal, the state’s participation in the
 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , a cap-and-trade program for
carbon dioxide emissions from  power plants .  The state’s House of Representatives approved in March a
bill to exit the 10-state program.  Under the amended bill approved today by a vote of 16 to
eight, the state’s would replace an emission reduction fund with
an energy efficiency fund and would increase energy-efficiency
rebates. The bill would also allow the state to withdraw from
the initiative if another state with at least 10 percent of the
total electricity production under RGGI exits the program.  The RGGI carbon-trading program regulates pollution from
 Maryland  to  Maine . Power-plant operators must buy allowances to
account for the carbon dioxide released from their smokestacks.
Since 2008, the states have raised more than $860 million by
selling the allowances in quarterly auctions, according to the
program’s website.  New Hampshire house Republicans said the program is a tax
that increases electricity prices. Governor  John Lynch , a
Democrat, had threatened to veto the cap-and-trade repeal bill
if it passed the Senate. The amended bill now goes back to the
house for a vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
