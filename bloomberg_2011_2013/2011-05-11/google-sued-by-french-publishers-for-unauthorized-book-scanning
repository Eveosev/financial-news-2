Google Inc. (GOOG)  was sued for 9.8 million
euros ($14 million) by three French publishers who said the
search-engine company scanned books without permission.  Editions Albin Michel SA, Editions Gallimard SA and
Flammarion claimed Google has scanned 9,797 copyright-protected
works for its digital library. The publishers are seeking
compensation of 10,000 euros per book, Google said today.  “We have been working with French publishers for some time
to find ways to increase audiences and revenue opportunities for
publishers, authors and booksellers,” Google said in an e-
mailed statement. Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California ,
said it believes the Google Books project complies with French
law and international copyright rules.  Google reached an agreement six months ago with  Lagardere
SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Livre publishing to allow the scanning of out-of-
print French books. A Paris court said in December 2009 that
Google’s book project had violated French copyrights and ordered
the company to stop scanning works without permission. The
company has appealed.  Calls to the publishers for comment on the suit weren’t
immediately returned.  Trade publication  Livres Hebdo   reported  the claim earlier
today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
