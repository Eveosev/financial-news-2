Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
today met with the owners of the country’s league soccer clubs
and the board of  Ekstraklasa  SA, the company that manages the
game’s top division, after hooligans vandalized a stadium.  “The government has to ensure the security of citizens,
wherever they are,” Tusk said after the meeting with the owners
and presidents of 16 clubs in Warsaw. “There are sufficient
legal instruments to deal with this issue already enshrined in
law -- what’s necessary is the will to put them into practice.”  More than 20 soccer fans have been arrested since hooligans
ran onto the pitch near the end of the final of the Polish Cup
between Lech Poznan and Legia Warszawa in the central-Polish
town of Bydgoszcz last week, while others demolished seats in
the stands.  “We don’t conceal the fact that what’s been happening is
hurting the professional game and we need to take action,”
Ekstraklasa spokesman Adrian Skubis said today on television
station Polsat.  Poland is set to co-host next year’s European Championships
with neighboring Ukraine, and the event may in jeopardy unless
the hooliganism is brought under control, Turk said.  “The Euro 2012 will be under threat if we aren’t able to
ensure fans’ safety,” he said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
