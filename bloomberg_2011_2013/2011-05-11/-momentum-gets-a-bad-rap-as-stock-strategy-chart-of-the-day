U.S. stock investors ought to take a
closer look at buying the best-performing shares and selling
laggards, according to Myles Zyblock, chief institutional
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  “Momentum gets a bad rap,” Zyblock wrote today in a
report. The strategy has been more rewarding historically than
tracking the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or favoring shares of
companies with the fastest sales and earnings growth or the
lowest prices relative to asset values, the report said.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, a momentum index
compiled by  Dartmouth College ’s Kenneth R. French generated
higher total returns than the  S&P 500  each decade since the
1930s, based on annual averages.  French’s indicator rose at an average rate of 13.1 percent
annually since 1930, surpassing the S&P 500’s 9.4 percent pace,
according to the report. The momentum gauge also outperformed
French’s indexes for growth and value stocks, which rose an
average of 8.9 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively.  Combining momentum with  value investing  may be the most
lucrative approach for investors, Zyblock wrote. He recommended
a 36 percent weighting in AQR Capital Management LLC’s Momentum
Index, a gauge revised less often than French’s indicator, with
the rest tied to the Russell 1000 Value Index.  “Momentum offers a powerful complement to value” for
investors looking to diversify, the report said. The strategy
not only produces higher returns than  growth stocks , but also
tends to perform well when growth is in favor, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
