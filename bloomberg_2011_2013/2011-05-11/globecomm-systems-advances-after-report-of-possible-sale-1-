Globecomm Systems Inc. (GCOM) , a provider of
satellite-communications services, rose the most in almost eight
months following a report that the company may be considering a
sale.  Globecomm, based in Hauppauge,  New York , has hired  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  to advise on a possible sale,  DealReporter  said,
citing two unidentified sources. A potential deal could value
the company at $22 per share, according to DealReporter.
Globecomm doesn’t comment on rumors, according to Matthew Byron,
a senior vice president.  Baltimore-based investment firm NSB Advisors LLC, which
owns about 40 percent of the company, may prevent a deal if it
perceives an offer price to be too low, the publication said,
citing one of the sources.  Harris Corp. (HRS) , a Melbourne, Florida-
based provider of information technology services to the
government, may be a potential acquirer, DealReporter said.  Jim Burke, a spokesman for Harris Corp., said the company
doesn’t comment on rumors or speculation. William Nicklin, a
portfolio manager at NSB Advisors, didn’t return calls seeking
comment.  Globecomm rose $1.38, or 10 percent, to $14.67 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the most since
Sept. 13. The shares have gained 47 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
