France’s wheat crop,  Europe ’s
largest, is in a “danger zone” as drought reduces the
potential harvest, the country’s crops office FranceAgriMer said
today.  The crop has entered a “critical stage,” and weather in
the next two weeks will be decisive for yields, Christian
Vanier, FranceAgriMer’s industry coordinator for cereals, said
in a presentation in Montreuil-sous-Bois, near Paris.  “We won’t have a very good year,” Vanier said, adding it
will be an average year. “There is a real deterioration of the
crop conditions.”  France just had its second-hottest April since 1900 and one
of the driest since 1953, according to the Agriculture Ministry.
Wheat production will fall from last year because of the
drought, Michel Portier, general director of Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel, said in an interview on May 6.  The country produced 35.6 million metric tons of soft wheat
last year and 2.53 million tons of durum wheat, ranking  France 
as the world’s fifth-largest wheat grower after  China ,  India ,
the U.S. and  Russia . Five-year average soft-wheat production was
34.6 million tons.  “For now we can’t translate the worries into yield
losses,” Vanier said. “Nevertheless, there is water stress in
combination with an advanced stage of vegetative development.
We’re in a danger zone.”  Critical Stage  Wheat in some regions of France has entered the so-called
grain-filling stage, and without rain the grains will fail to
gain volume, Vanier said.  “With every day that passes without rain, we get closer to
an irreversible stage,” Remi Haquin, a cereals specialist at
FranceAgriMer, said in today’s meeting. After a “good” post-
winter start, the situation has deteriorated in the past three
weeks, he said.  Haquin, who grows grain, oilseeds and sugar beets on a 350-
hectare (865-acre) farm north of Paris, said his wheat
development is about two weeks early and is shorter than usual
with fewer grain heads this year.  French wheat exports may decline in the 2011-12 crop year
on lower availability, Haquin said. Record exports are forecast
to reduce the country’s wheat stocks to a seven-year low.  FranceAgriMer lifted its forecast for wheat exports outside
the European Union to 12.8 million metric tons in the 12 months
to June, 50,000 tons more than last month’s forecast. The
estimate for total wheat exports was raised to 19.39 million
tons from 19.36 million tons, it said.  Food Prices  Soft-wheat stockpiles at the end of June will be 2.2
million tons, down from last month’s estimate of 2.28 million
tons, FranceAgriMer said.  An index of world food prices tracked by the  United
Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization  rose to 232.1 points
in April from 231 in March, having fallen from a record 237.2
points in February. Milling wheat futures on NYSE Liffe for
November delivery have risen 2 percent this year.  Countries in the Middle East and  Africa  have been importing
grain at an accelerated pace to control rising food prices that
toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia  this year. Food is the most
important factor in emerging-market inflation, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Algeria , northern Africa’s second-largest grain buyer after
Egypt, purchased 2.95 million tons of wheat of all origins
between Dec. 16 and Jan. 26, probably a record for a five-week
period, FranceAgriMer said in February.  Wheat Exports  Wheat loadings for export outside the EU stood at 11.5
million tons at the end of April, compared with 8.3 million tons
at the same time a year earlier, according to Michel Ferret,
FranceAgriMer’s head of research. That included 3.3 million tons
of wheat for Algeria, 2.55 million tons for  Morocco  and 2.4
million tons for  Egypt , he said.  The crops office raised its outlook for barley exports to
5.73 million tons from 5.53 million tons a month ago, and
compared with 5.21 million tons a year earlier. French barley
stocks at the end of June are forecast to be 1.63 million tons,
down from 1.93 million tons expected a month ago, and from 3.14
million tons at the end of 2009-2010.  The outlook for French corn stocks at the end of June was
raised to 2.79 million tons from 2.51 million tons last month,
and compared with 2.37 million tons at the end of 2009-2010.  FranceAgriMer lifted its estimate of wheat planting for
this year’s harvest to 5.02 million hectares from 5 million
hectares, and up from 4.92 million hectares harvested a year
ago.  Barley planting will slip 2.3 percent to 1.55 million
hectares, according to the crops office. French corn planting is
forecast to slip to 1.52 million hectares from 1.54 million
hectares in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
