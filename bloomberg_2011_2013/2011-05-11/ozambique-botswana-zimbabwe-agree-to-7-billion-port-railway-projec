Mozambique , Zimbabwe and Botswana
signed a memorandum of understanding for a $7 billion port and
rail project, Paulo Zucula, the Mozambican transport minister,
said.  The countries agreed to build a new deepwater port in
southern Mozambique and a rail system linking the three southern
African countries, Zucula said in a mobile-phone text message
from Maputo, Mozambique’s capital.  Funders, who he didn’t identify, back the project that will
start next year and take a decade to complete, Zucula said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
