U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  has designated the commander of a Pakistan-based
insurgent group as a terrorist and banned Americans from doing
business with him.  Badruddin Haqqani is the senior military commander for the
Haqqani Network, a Taliban-affiliated group that operates from
North Waziristan, a tribal area in Pakistan, and conducts
attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the State Department said
in a statement today in Washington. He is a son of the group’s
founder, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who had previously been designated
as a terrorist by the U.S.  The  United Nations  has also added Badruddin Haqqani to its
list of al-Qaeda and Taliban terrorists, a step that requires
all UN member states to implement an assets freeze, a travel
ban, and an arms embargo against him. The U.S. measure also
blocks all of his property interests subject to U.S.
jurisdiction.  Badruddin Haqqani took responsibility in November 2008 for
the kidnapping of New York Times reporter David Rohde. The
reporter escaped in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
