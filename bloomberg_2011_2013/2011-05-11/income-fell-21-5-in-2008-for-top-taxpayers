The 400 highest-earning U.S.
households reported a total of $108.2 billion in income for
2008, a 21.5 percent decline from a year earlier and the first
drop since 2002, according to  Internal Revenue Service  data.  The  figure  reflects the effect of the recession on the
wealthiest U.S. taxpayers, who earned an average of $270.5
million in 2008, the most recent figures available. President  Barack Obama  and Democratic leaders in Congress have proposed
increasing taxes on top earners to reduce the  U.S. budget
deficit . Republicans in Congress resist such plans.  The drop in income will do little to blunt those efforts.
Average income reported by the 400 highest-earning taxpayers was
more than five times higher in 2008 than it was in 1992,
according to the data. Even when held constant for inflation,
the income of those taxpayers rose almost four times during the
same period.  “Democrats are focused on the top 1 percent,” said David
Kautter, the managing director of the Kogod Tax Center at
American University in  Washington . “Your income went down but
you’re still in that top 1 percent.”  Recent polls suggest overwhelming public support for
raising the taxes of top earners. An April McClatchy-Marist poll
found 64 percent of respondents favor raising taxes for those
with income exceeding $250,000, with 33 percent opposed.  Earning Less  The wealthy aren’t the only U.S. taxpayers earning less as
a result of the recession. A separate IRS report in April said
adjusted gross income at all levels fell 6.9 percent in 2009
while unemployment compensation increased 91.5 percent.  Since 1992, there have been five instances of declining
income among the top earners. Besides the 2008 drop, income fell
1 percent between 1992 and 1993, 0.3 percent between 1993 and
1994, 24.6 percent between 2000 and 2001 and 20.6 percent
between 2001 and 2002.  Income at the top rose at a steep pace after President  George W. Bush  signed tax cut legislation in 2001 and 2003. The
top 400 earners more than doubled their income between 2002 and
2005, according to IRS data.  The Bush-era tax cuts were extended in December and most
are slated to expire at the end of 2012. Obama has said he won’t
extend them for individuals earning more than $200,000 a year
and married couples making more than $250,000.  Effective Tax Rates  More than one quarter of the top 400 taxpayers, or 112
filers, had an effective tax rate of between 15 percent and 20
percent, according to the IRS. Another 101 paid effective rates
between 10 percent and 15 percent, while 30 had effective rates
of zero to 10 percent. There were 59 taxpayers in the top
brackets from 30 percent to 35 percent.  The IRS data also illustrates the compensation breakdown of
the highest earners. Salaries and wages comprised more than a
quarter of their adjusted gross income in 1992 and just 8.18
percent in 2008.  During the same period,  capital gains  reported for this
group rose from 36 percent of adjusted gross income to 56.8
percent. Most of these gains are taxed at a 15 percent rate.
Obama’s deficit reduction panel last year recommended taxing
capital gains and dividends as ordinary income as a way to raise
revenue and cut income tax rates.  Capital gains income fell 32.8 percent between 2007 and
2008 to $61.5 billion.  The IRS data also shows a change in composition of the top
400 earners. Just four taxpayers, whom the IRS didn’t identify,
have been included in the top 400 each year since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
