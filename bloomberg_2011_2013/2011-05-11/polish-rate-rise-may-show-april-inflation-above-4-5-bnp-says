Poland’s decision to increase
 interest rates  today for the third time this year may indicate
the central bank sees consumer prices rising more quickly than
analysts estimate, BNP Paribas SA economist Michal Dybula said.  The Narodowy Bank Polski in Warsaw unexpectedly lifted its
benchmark seven-day interest rate to 4.25 percent from 4
percent. Annual inflation for April, which the Statistics Office
will report May 13, may have accelerated to 4.5 percent,
according to the median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “It’s possible that the council simply already has its own
forecasts showing inflation in April has accelerated even above
the market expectations,” Dybula said by phone.  Central bank Governor Marek Belka agreed last month with
the government to combat inflation by selling euros to
strengthen the zloty. Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said
April 21 the sales “may ease pressure to increase interest
rates.” Inflation soared to 4.3 percent in March from 3.6
percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
