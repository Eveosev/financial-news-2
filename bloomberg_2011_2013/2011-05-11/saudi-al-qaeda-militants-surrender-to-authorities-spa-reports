Three Saudi Arabian suspected al-
Qaeda militants have surrendered to authorities, the official
 Saudi Press Agency  said, citing an unidentified Interior
Ministry spokesman.  The three suspects contacted security authorities from
abroad and asked to return home, the Riyadh-based news service
said, without saying where they returned from or when.  The Interior Ministry under Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al
Saud has cracked down on al-Qaeda militants and their
supporters.  Saudi Arabia  has arrested 11,527 people since Sept.
11, 2001, for their alleged involvement in terrorism, the
ministry said on April 24.  Interior Ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki
said a Saudi al-Qaeda militant, who was on the kingdom’s most-
wanted list, turned himself in, SPA said on May 3.  Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed on May 2 by U.S.
forces in Abbottabad, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of
 Pakistan ’s capital. The U.S. had been hunting for the 54-year-
old bin Laden and his supporters in Afghanistan and Pakistan
since al-Qaeda attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
