A ship loaded with  cocoa beans  left
Ivory Coast’s port of San Pedro yesterday for the first time
since an export ban issued by President Alassane Ouattara was
lifted, according to the harbor.  San Pedro, in the western part of the world’s top cocoa
producer, didn’t export any of the beans or semi-finished
products during the month of April due to the halt, it said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Ouattara issued the ban in January in an attempt to starve
his political rival,  Laurent Gbagbo , of funds. It was lifted
following the April 11 capture of Gbagbo, who had refused to
cede the presidency to Ouattara following a disputed November
election.  Shipments of palm oil from  San Pedro  dropped 40 percent to
6,404 metric tons in April, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
