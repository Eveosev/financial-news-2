Pasquale Diana, a London-based
economist at Morgan Stanley, comments on Hungarian inflation and
 interest rates .  The inflation rate rose to 4.7 percent in April from 4.5
percent the previous month, the statistics office in Budapest
said today. The April figure matched the December rate, the
highest since June.  Diana made the comments in an e-mail to clients.  On the inflation figure:  “The reading was in line with our and consensus
expectations. The breakdown shows continued pressures from food
prices. On our ‘clean core’ measure, which strips out all food
prices from core, pressures were more benign.”  On the outlook for inflation:  “Market services prices, a key gauge of demand pressures,
look contained, but the overall breakdown suggests to us that
the inflation threat has not diminished. We think that the
National Bank of  Hungary  projection for disinflation in the
coming quarters is correct in terms of direction, but it is too
ambitious in terms of scope for inflation to fall. We forecast
inflation to average 4.6 percent this year (NBH: 4 percent) and
3.9 percent in 2012 (NBH: 3.4 percent).”  On the outlook for interest rates:  “We continue to believe that the next move in rates is
more likely to be up than down, though any hikes will probably
be delayed until late this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
