Total SA (FP) ’s oil production from Block
10 in Yemen has been hurt by an industrial strike at another
block operated by Nexen Inc.  “Our production has been affected on Block 10 given the
current conditions on Block 14,” Total spokeswoman Phenelope Semavoine said today by telephone. The Paris-based company is
operator of the Masila Basin and East Shabwa licenses on Block
10 with a 28.6 percent stake.  Nexen Inc. two days ago said production was temporarily
shut and operations suspended in Yemen due to a strike by
members of the Masila Labour Union. Nexen is operator of Block
14, also called the Masila project.  Total’s output in Yemen last year was 66,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day including production from  Yemen  LNG. Liquid
hydrocarbon output was 13,000 barrels a day from Block 10 and
Block 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
