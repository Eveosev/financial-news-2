Gasoline dropped after rising 9
percent this week on concern that flooding on the  Mississippi
River  may disrupt refinery operations.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 6.13 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $3.3184 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of
11:56 a.m. London time. The contract gained 29 cents in the past
two days.  “It looks a bit overcooked,” Torbjoern Kjus, an
Oslo-based oil-market analyst at DnB NOR ASA, Norway’s biggest
bank, said today by phone. The market has “priced in some risk
of the Mississippi flooding closing in some refining capacity,”
he said.  On the Mississippi between  New Orleans  and Baton Rouge,
there are 11 refineries with a combined capacity of 2.5 million
barrels a day, or 13 percent of U.S. output, according to  Andy
Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  “If a couple of them are flooded and lose power, then of
course we could go higher, definitely,” Kjus said.  The premium of June gasoline over crude on Nymex surged as
much as $4.97 to $40.11 a barrel yesterday, the largest since at
least 1990. It was at $36.38 a barrel today. The profit from
converting Louisiana Light Sweet crude into more valuable fuels
such as gasoline and diesel was $18.87 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
