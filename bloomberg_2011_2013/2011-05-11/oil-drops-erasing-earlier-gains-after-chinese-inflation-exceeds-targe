Oil dropped as much as 0.3 percent,
giving up earlier gains, after  China  reported inflation which
exceeded economist estimates and the government’s target. Crude
was down 26 cents at $103.62 a barrel at 12:43 p.m. Sydney time,
after earlier rising as high as $104.60.  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier, above the government’s full-year target for a
fourth straight month. The gain was more than the 5.2 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 30 economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
