(Corrects spelling of chairman’s name throughout in story
originally published May 11.)  Trade Bank of Iraq , established in
2003 to finance trade and help in the reconstruction of the
country, said profit rose 18 percent last year.  Net income climbed to $361 million, Hussein al-Uzri,
president and chairman said in an e-mailed statement today.
Operating income gained 18 percent to $400 million and assets
reached $15 billion, he said.  “Our business fundamentals are strong and our significant
participation in the Iraqi economy puts us in a unique position
to ride the wave of growth throughout the country,” al-Uzri
said. “In addition, our internal reforms have prepared us to
scale new heights.”  TBI opened five branches last year, bringing the total
number in  Iraq  to 14, al-Uzri said. The bank plans to open three
more in the country this year, including a branch at Baghdad
Airport, as well as international branches in  London  and  Beirut ,
he said.  The Investment and Treasury Department managed the growth
of TBI’s portfolio in 2010, diversifying into CBI Deposits,
Treasury bills and Iraq 2028 Eurobonds, according to the
statement. In addition, since August 2010, the bank has signed
one private equity deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
