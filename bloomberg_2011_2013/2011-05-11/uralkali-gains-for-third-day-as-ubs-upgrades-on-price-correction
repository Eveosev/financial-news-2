OAO Uralkali gained for a third day
as UBS AG raised  Russia ’s second-biggest potash producer to
“buy” from “neutral,” citing a drop in the shares this
quarter and saying it now expected the fertilizer ingredient’s
price to rise more than a previous estimate.  The stock climbed 0.8 percent to 221.4 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. Uralkali lost 6.6 percent this quarter
through yesterday.  UBS increased its 2011 potash price forecast 8 percent to
$465 per ton and 9 percent to $500 per ton for 2012, according
to a note e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
