India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day this week as overseas investors increased holdings of
local bonds to benefit from a widening yield advantage.  Funds based abroad added $716 million to investments in
rupee-denominated corporate and government debt last week, the
most since January, data published by the Securities & Exchange
Board of India show. The extra yield on India’s two-year notes
over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries widened to a record 7.54
percentage points this week after the central bank raised
borrowing costs on May 3 for the ninth time since March 2010.  “We still expect the rupee to appreciate from here and the
widening interest-rate differential is supporting that view,”
said Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-based strategist at Nomura Holdings
Inc. “Other fundamentals including economic growth and the
 trade balance  are supportive for the rupee too.”  The Indian currency rose 0.2 percent to 44.6950 per dollar
as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It is still the worst performer this month among
 Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies with a 1 percent loss. The
rupee will appreciate to 43.5 by Sept. 30, Nomura predicts.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.41 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.49
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
