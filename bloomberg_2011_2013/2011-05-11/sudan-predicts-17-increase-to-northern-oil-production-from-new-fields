Northern  Sudan  plans to boost oil
production by 20,000 barrels per day when newly discovered
fields come into operation by mid-2012, said Ali Ahmed Osman,
Sudan’s minister of state for oil.  The discoveries were in  Block 2  in Southern Kordofan, the
only oil-producing state in northern Sudan, Osman told reporters
today in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. “By the end of this
year, we will start tying in these fields,” Osman said.  The block is run by  Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Co. 
The company is owned by China National Petroleum Corp., which
has a 40 percent stake;  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd, or
Petronas, with a 30 percent stake;  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. Ltd., which has 25 percent; and Sudan’s state-owned oil
company,  Sudapet , which has a 5 percent stake.  The planned increase would add 17 percent to the north’s
current daily output, which Osman said is 115,000 barrels. The
rest of Sudan’s oil production of 490,000 barrels per day is
pumped in  Southern Sudan , which is scheduled to be declared
independent from Sudan on July 9.  In Block 6, stretching from Southern Kordofan into South
Darfur state, Northern Sudan plans to add another 40,000 barrels
per day by mid-2014 to the current production of 60,000 barrels
per day. The block is operated by  Petro Energy E&P , which is 95
percent owned by CNPC and 5 percent owned by Sudapet.  “The geological structure” shows it is probable that oil
will also be discovered in South  Darfur  state, Osman said.  The  Justice and Equality Movement , the largest rebel group
in the Darfur region, said they would attack companies if they
attempt to start oil exploration in the war-torn western area.  Sudan’s forces have been fighting rebels in Darfur since
2003, when insurgents took up arms, accusing the government of
neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the deaths of as
many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and starvation,
and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes, according to
United Nations estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
