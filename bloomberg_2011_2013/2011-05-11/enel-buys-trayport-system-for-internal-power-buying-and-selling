Enel Trade SpA, a unit of  Italy ’s
biggest power company, bought an internal energy trading system
from  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) ’s Trayport, the London-based technology
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Enel will use Trayport’s Internal Marketplace system to
trade between its group companies before entering the wholesale
markets. The internal buying and selling will reduce operative
risks and costs, maximize netting opportunities and simplify
traders’ execution, Leonardo Zannella, head of trading at Enel
Trade, said in the statement.  GFI, the New York-based inter-dealer broker of derivatives
and securities, bought Trayport in February 2008.  Brokers including ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc., Tullet Prebon
Plc, Spectron Group Ltd. and Tradition Financial Services
compete for over-the-counter trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
