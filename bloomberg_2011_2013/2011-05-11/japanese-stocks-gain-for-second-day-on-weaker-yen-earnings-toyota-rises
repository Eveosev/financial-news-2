Japanese stocks gained for a second
straight day after the yen weakened and companies said the
outlook for earnings has improved, boosting confidence about the
global economic recovery.  Honda Motor Co. and other automakers rose after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said the supply of parts is improving following
the March 11 earthquake.  NEC Corp. (6701) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 maker of
telecom equipment, jumped 4.7 percent after forecasting a return
to profit.  Orix Corp. (8591) , a financial-services company, rallied 4
percent after it said it expects a 15 percent increase in net
income.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., operator of the power plant
crippled by the temblor, soared 8.5 percent after saying it
accepted the government’s conditions for receiving support.  “People in the market see the global economy continuing to
grow mildly,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in
Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees about $104
billion. “Many companies assumed 80 yen per dollar for this
fiscal year, and any moves below that level will benefit
companies’ earnings.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,864.26
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix
increased 0.1 percent to 857.62, with about four shares
advancing for every three that fell.  The Topix has tumbled 7.9 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies from  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to  Canon Inc. (7751) 
In the period through yesterday’s close, the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index gained 4.8 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
advanced 1.8 percent.  Tepco Aid  Tokyo Electric, the operator of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant crippled by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami,
surged 8.5 percent to 525 yen after saying it accepted the
government’s six conditions for receiving  government aid .  Tepco, as the company is known, will be monitored by the
government as a condition for state financial aid to ensure full
compensation will be paid to those affected by the world’s worst
nuclear disaster in 25 years. Tepco said today it accepts the
conditions and won’t set a limit on compensation to victims.  The utility was the most active stock by value in Japan,
and had the largest gain in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  today.  Carmakers contributed the most to the Topix’s gain after
Goldman Sachs said parts supply problems are unlikely to keep
weighing on auto shares. “We maintain our outlook for a steady
recovery in global production by Japanese automakers each
quarter,” Goldman said in a report dated yesterday.  Weaker Yen  Honda Motor, which gets more than 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, advanced 2.1 percent to 3,130 yen, and Nissan Motor Co.
increased 2 percent to 784 yen.  “Production was halted everywhere right after the
earthquake, but more companies are resuming production with time.
That positive factor is overshadowing the negative factor that
there are still supply chain problems.”  The yen slid versus its major counterparts, dropping
against the euro for the first time in six days, as gains in
stocks and commodities damped demand for safer assets. The euro
rose versus the dollar after a spokesman for German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said restructuring of  Greece ’s debt isn’t being
considered.  Japan’s currency depreciated to as low as 116.90 against
the euro today in Tokyo, snapping a five-day gain. That compares
with 115 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. Against the
dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 81.09 from 80.49. A weaker
yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies
when repatriated.  Oil Prices Gain  “The yen’s appreciation, which was weighing on exporters
and related stocks, is taking a pause. That will likely boost
the stock market, said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in
Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. 1024  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s largest oil explorer, gained 1
percent to 584,000 yen and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the
No. 2, rose 1.7 percent to 3,935 yen after crude oil for June
delivery rose 1.3 percent to $103.88 a barrel yesterday in  New
York , the highest settlement since May 4.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,357.16 yesterday in New York, rising for a third day. Higher-
than-estimated profit forecasts by companies, including  Dean
Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S. milk processor, plus  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s purchase of Skype Technologies SA bolstered optimism
that earnings and takeovers will keep fueling the rally.  Earnings Outlook  In Japan, this week is the peak for earnings results, with
more than 60 percent of the Topix index’s 1,673 companies
scheduled to report.  NEC jumped 4.7 percent to 177 yen, the second-steepest gain
in the Nikkei 225. The company yesterday said it expects a
return to net income of 15 billion yen ($185 million) this
fiscal year from a year-earlier loss.  Orix rallied 4 percent to 8,020 yen after forecasting net
income will rise 15 percent to 77.5 billion yen this fiscal year.
Financial services companies had the biggest gain in the Topix
among its 33 industry groups.  Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. (5110) , Japan’s second-largest
tiremaker, gained 4.9 percent to 940 yen after boosting its
full-year net income forecast by 28 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
