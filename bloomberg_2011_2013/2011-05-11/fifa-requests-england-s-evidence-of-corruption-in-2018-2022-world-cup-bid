Soccer’s governing body asked England
officials for evidence backing allegations of corruption made
yesterday to U.K. Parliament in the bidding for 2018 and 2022
World Cups.  Former England Football Association chairman David Triesman
yesterday alleged that four FIFA executive board members sought
favors in exchange for their votes for the country to host the
2018  World Cup .  FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke today sent a letter to
the F.A. and the Sunday Times, which supplied allegations of
other corruption, asking for evidence, according to a FIFA
statement.  Speaking yesterday to a parliamentary committee looking
into the bidding process, Triesman alleged Jack Warner, a FIFA
vice president from  Trinidad & Tobago ,  Brazil ’s Ricardo
Teixeira, Paraguay’s Nicolas Leoz and  Thailand ’s Worawi Makudi
engaged in “improper and unethical” behavior before Russia was
chosen in December as host of the 2018 tournament.  Warner yesterday didn’t answer his mobile telephone. Calls
to the Thai soccer association after hours went unanswered.
Brazil’s soccer confederation, known as CBF, didn’t return a
voice-mail message seeking comment. Nicolas Leoz, the president
of the South American soccer confederation, known as Conmebol,
won’t comment, said the association spokesman Nestor Benitez.  The committee also received evidence from the Sunday Times
newspaper, which it published on Parliament’s website, that
Qatar paid $1.5 million to African soccer head Issa Hayatou of
Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of the  Ivory Coast  to vote for its
winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup, lawmaker Damian Collins
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
