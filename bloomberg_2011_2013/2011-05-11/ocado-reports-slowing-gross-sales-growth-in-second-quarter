Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K. online
grocer, reported slowing sales in the fiscal second quarter as
public holidays and capacity constraints held back growth.  The company said it expects gross sales to grow about 21
percent in the 24 weeks through May 15, according to a statement
ahead of its annual general meeting today. That’s slower than
the 25 percent sales growth reported in March for the first
quarter. The Hatfield, England-based retailer blamed “capacity
constraints and the higher incidence of holidays.”  Ocado, who sells mainly groceries from upscale chain
Waitrose Ltd., is growing sales as consumers move online and it
delivers into more areas such as south  Wales . The retailer has
added several executives in recent months including former Tesco
Plc executive Simon Belsham, who will oversee its non-food
business. The company said today that it has entered into a
lease on a warehouse close to Hatfield to help it develop its
non-food sales.  “Ocado continues to see strong demand and growth across
all areas of the business,” the company said today in the
statement. “The board is encouraged by the progress of the
business so far this year.”  The company reiterated that it is investing to alleviate
capacity constraints and to fulfill more customer orders at its
Hatfield center. Ocado expects to complete construction of
another center in Warwickshire,  England  by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
