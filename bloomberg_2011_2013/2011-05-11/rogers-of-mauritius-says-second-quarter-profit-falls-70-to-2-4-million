Rogers & Co., a Mauritian company
with interests in tourism, real estate and financial services,
said profit declined 70 percent in the second quarter through
March, as its loss from its hotel segment widened.  Net income dropped to 66 million rupees ($2.4 million) from
216.9 million rupees a year earlier, it said in a statement
published on the Port Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s
website today. Revenue advanced to 3.03 billion rupees from 2.32
billion rupees. The loss at its hotel unit increased to 74
million rupees from 28 million rupees a year earlier, while the
occupancy rate was constant at 78 percent, it said.  “Results were adversely impacted by the new villa rental
activity and additional depreciation associated with the recent
renovation and revaluation of the hotels,” the company said.  For the six months through March, revenue increased 22
percent to 5.83 billion rupees, and net income dropped 39
percent to 227.5 million rupees, it said.  “With all the hotels and retail outlets being fully
operational, the profit after tax of the group for the second
semester is likely to be better than that of last year,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
