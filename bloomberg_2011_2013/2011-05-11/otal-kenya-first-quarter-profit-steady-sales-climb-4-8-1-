Total Kenya Ltd. (TKNL) , the local unit of
 Total SA (FP) , said first-quarter profit was steady while sales rose.  Net income totaled 206.7 million shillings ($2 million) in
the three months through March, compared with 206.4 million
shillings a year earlier, Total Kenya said in a statement e-
mailed by the Nairobi Stock Exchange today. Sales climbed 4.8
percent to 22 billion shillings, it said.  Sales volumes dropped 19 percent in the quarter from a year
earlier as consumers reduced diesel consumption for electricity
generation and as Total closed outlets, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
