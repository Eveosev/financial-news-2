North Sea Flotta crude exports are
scheduled to decline to 1.3 million barrels in June from this
month’s 1.35 million barrels, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The plan comprises two cargoes of 650,000 barrels each.
That’s equivalent to 43,333 barrels a day compared with 43,548
barrels a day this month, the program showed.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
