Bourbon SA (GBB) , owner of the second-
biggest fleet of supply and crew ships for the oil industry,
surged after reporting a 24 percent increase in first-quarter
sales amid “slightly higher” daily rates.  The shares jumped as much as 7 percent in Paris trading,
the steepest intraday gain since October, and were at 34.415
euros as of 9:50 a.m. local time.  Revenue rose to 235.5 million euros ($338.9 million) from
190.2 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
in a statement. The company commissioned 56 new vessels during
the period, bringing its fleet to 418 at the end of March with
an average utilization rate of 83 percent compared with 81
percent in the previous quarter.  “North Sea activity is resuming with the approach of the
summer season and drilling authorizations have been granted in
the U.S. waters of the  Gulf of Mexico ,” according to the
statement. Oil companies’ exploration and development budgets
were revised upwards for the coming years.  Bourbon was hurt last year by an oversupply of vessels
providing services for offshore oil and natural gas projects as
energy companies curbed or delayed some investment. Bourbon
plans to spend $2 billion to almost double its fleet through
2015 when it will have 600 vessels, betting customers want to
hire the latest equipment.  The French company has forecast the expansion will lead to
average revenue growth of 17 percent a year in the offshore
division.  Bourbon expects a “steady upturn in utilization rates
during 2011 and the beginnings of a higher average daily rate
for its fleet in the second half of 2011,” the statement said.  Bourbon was founded in 1948 by sugar plantation-owning
families on Reunion, the French island east of Madagascar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
