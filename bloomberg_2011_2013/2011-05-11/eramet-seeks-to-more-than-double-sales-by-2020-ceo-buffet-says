Eramet (ERA)  SA, operator of the world’s
biggest ferronickel plant, may more than double its sales by
2020 by investing in new projects and making acquisitions, Chief
Executive Officer Patrick Buffet said.  Eramet, which had 3.6 billion euros ($5.15 billion) in
revenue last year, may team up with partners to invest as much
as 9 billion euros in new projects over the decade, Buffet told
reporters after a shareholders meeting in Paris today. The
company has earmarked 2 billion euros to 3 billion euros for
acquisitions in the period.  The Paris-based company, which also mines manganese and
produces specialty alloys, is raising output to meet increasing
demand from steelmakers, plane manufacturers and tool producers
as growth in  China  boosts transport and infrastructure spending.
It has a net cash position of 1.3 billion euros and a credit
line of 800 million euros, Buffet said.  Eramet fell as much as 0.7 percent to 246.40 euros in Paris
trading, and was at 246.75 euros as of 4:40 p.m. local time,
valuing the company at 6.54 billion euros.  The company, 36.9 percent owned by the Duval family, 25.7
percent by French nuclear company  Areva SA (CEI) , 12.8 percent by
Carlo Tassara  France  and 4 percent by the French island of  New
Caledonia , would benefit from a bigger free float, making it
eligible for France’s CAC 40 benchmark stock index, Buffet said.  “We have family offices knocking at our door who would
like to join our capital,” Buffet said, without being specific.  Doniambo Investment  Eramet operates New Caledonia’s Doniambo ferronickel plant,
the world’s largest, and has spent 900 million euros over 10
years to boost output at the smelter, Buffet said in November.  The company expects to make a decision on a proposed nickel
project at Weda Bay,  Indonesia , at the end of 2012 with partners
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and PT Aneka Tambang, he said today. The plant
may have a capacity to process 35,000 tons of nickel a year in a
first phase, and a further 30,000 tons six years later, he said.  Eramet is also working on a process to develop the Mabounie
deposit in Gabon, which includes the rare-earth minerals
tantalum and niobium. A pilot plant may start in 2015, with the
final project probably beginning in 2018 or 2020, Buffet said.  Buffet plans “selective” acquisitions to boost Eramet’s
manganese and nickel operations, broaden its range of metals for
steelmakers, develop its recycling division, set up bases in
low-cost areas and produce “special metals with high growth
potential,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
