Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN)  Chief Executive
Officer Phil Wright said the company has “good” interest from
potential bidders in its stake in the Tenke Fungurume copper and
cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Lundin hasn’t talked to  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the majority owner of Tenke, about the sale of the stake,
Wright said today on a conference call.  The Tenke stake is of interest to “tier-one” buyers,
Wright said. Lundin will provide an update this month on its
strategic review, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
