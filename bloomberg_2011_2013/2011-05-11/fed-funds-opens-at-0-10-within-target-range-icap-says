Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.10 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.10 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.09 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.09 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasury notes due from
November 2016 to May 2018 today as part of its plan to purchase
$600 billion more Treasuries through June and reinvest its
maturing mortgage holdings. The Fed expects to reinvest
$250 billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed
debt and agency securities into Treasuries during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase $6 billion to
$8 billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  The New York Fed will also release its monthly schedule for
its Treasury purchases through mid-June and from its mortgage
holdings reinvestment plan. The announcement is scheduled for 2
p.m. New York time.  The New York Fed will likely announce combined purchases of
about $95 billion to be sold during that period, according to
Wrightson ICAP, a research unit of ICAP specializing in U.S.
government finance.  Today’s schedule should be the last for a full monthly
period, with the June purchases announcement expected to come on
June 10 and to cover the 20 remaining business days of that
month, according to Wrightson. The Fed is scheduled to complete
its $600 billion in Treasury purchases by the end of June. It
will continue thereafter to reinvest the proceeds from its
maturing debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
