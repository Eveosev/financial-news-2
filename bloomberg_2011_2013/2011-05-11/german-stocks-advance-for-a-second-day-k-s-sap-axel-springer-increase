German stocks closed little changed
as a decline in BASF SE shares offset gains at EON AG and  Axel
Springer AG. (SPR)   BASF, the world’s biggest chemical maker, sank 2.2 percent.
Axel Springer advanced 2.6 percent as  Europe ’s largest newspaper
publisher said profit rose 6.5 percent. EON, Germany’s biggest
utility, climbed after reporting results that were in line with
expectations.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  slipped 6.47, or 0.1 percent, to
7,495.05 at the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt . The broader HDAX
Index also lost 0.1 percent.  “There remains the potential for some positive
surprises,” said Lothar Mentel, who oversees about $3.2 billion
as the London-based chief investment officer at Octopus
Investments Ltd. “With equity valuations still at relatively
low levels, with price-to-earnings around the 11/12 mark,
there’s still plenty of value to be had at these levels. Despite
the downbeat outlook, we are happy to maintain our overweight
equities position.”  The DAX is trading at about 11.3 times its companies’
estimated earnings, compared with an average valuation of 12.5
over the past five years, according to Bloomberg data.  European Earnings  Profits have grown 9.8 percent on average for the 1,215
western European companies that have reported results since
April 11, Bloomberg data show. Earnings have missed estimates by
an average of about 3.8 percent, the data show.  A report today showed German inflation accelerated more
than initially estimated in April after energy costs surged. The
inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, jumped to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent in March, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.  BASF slid 2.2 percent to 64.87 euros, the lowest level in
three weeks.  Axel Springer  rallied 2.6 percent to 110.80 euros as first-
quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed to 126.9 million euros ($181 million) from
119.2 million euros a year earlier. Analysts had predicted 129
million euros in Ebitda, the average of nine estimates. Sales
gained 11 percent to 736.7 million euros, beating estimates.  EON climbed 0.7 percent to 21.45 euros.  “The trend of the recent share-price outperformance of the
German utilities will continue,” Peter Crampton, an analyst at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London, wrote in a report
today. These results are “not a significant event,” he wrote,
saying investors were instead focusing on changes to nuclear
power policy in  Germany .  Kloeckner, SAP  Kloeckner & Co. sank 7.7 percent to 23.60 euros after
saying it plans a capital increase of as much as 50 percent in
“the summer” to finance growth. The company reported a surge
in first-quarter profit to 44 million euros from 2 million euros
a year earlier.  SAP AG (SAP)  climbed 0.8 percent to 44.62 euros as JPMorgan Chase
& Co. said there may be 20 percent possible upside to the
shares.  Freenet AG (FNTN)  advanced 5.1 percent to 9.10 euros. The first-
quarter group result from continued operations rose to 25.9
million euros from 16 million euros in the year-ago quarter, the
internet and telecommunications services provider said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
