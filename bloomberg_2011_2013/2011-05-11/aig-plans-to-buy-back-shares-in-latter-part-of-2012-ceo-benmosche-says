American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer that announced a share sale today,
told investors it plans to buy back stock as soon as next year.  “We anticipate later in 2012, possibly the earliest, and
2013 we’ll start to do some  capital management , which would be
clearly to deal with the dilution,” Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Benmosche  said today at the company’s annual meeting in
 New York . “We’ll begin to buy back some of those shares.”  Benmosche may raise more than $2 billion by selling 100
million new shares. The offering is being carried out with the
U.S. Treasury Department’s sale of 200 million existing AIG
shares. AIG is seeking to demonstrate its ability to raise funds
from private investors as the U.S. cuts its 92 percent stake in
the New York-based firm.  The transaction will lower Treasury’s stake to about 77
percent. Repurchases won’t start until the U.S. is repaid for
bailing out AIG, Chairman  Steve Miller  said.  “That will have to occur before we can start returning
money to shareholders in the form of share buybacks or
dividends,” Miller said at the meeting. “Like it or not, it’s
a policy I understand and respect.”  AIG advanced 96 cents to $30.58 at 12:28 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has dropped 37
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
