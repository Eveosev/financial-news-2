Ukraine’s winter rapeseed is growing
more slowly than last year as it was damaged by winter frosts,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Winter rapeseed is between 60 to 80 centimeters (24 to 32
inches) high, compared with the usual range of 100 to 130
centimeters, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mailed
statement, citing the Institute of Southern Farming. Plants are
thin and overgrown with weeds, UkrAgroConsult said, adding that
the yield potential is low.  Ukraine must reseed between 10 and 12 percent of its winter
rapeseed crop, the Agriculture Ministry said April 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
