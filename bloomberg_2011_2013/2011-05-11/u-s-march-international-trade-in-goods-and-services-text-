The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for March released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total March exports of $172.7 billion and
imports of $220.8 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $48.2 billion, up from $45.4 billion in
February, revised.  March exports were $7.7 billion more
than February exports of $165.0 billion.  March imports
were $10.4 billion more than February imports of $210.4
billion.  In March, the goods deficit increased $3.0 billion from
February to $62.1 billion, and the services surplus
increased $0.3 billion to $13.9 billion.  Exports of goods
increased $7.1 billion to $124.9 billion, and imports of
goods increased $10.1 billion to $187.0 billion.  Exports
of services increased $0.5 billion to $47.7 billion, and
imports of services increased $0.3 billion to $33.8
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $8.7 billion from
March 2010 to  March 2011.  Exports were up $22.4 billion,
or 14.9 percent, and imports were up $31.1 billion, or
16.4 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The February to March increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($2.5 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines
($1.6 billion); capital goods ($1.0 billion); other goods
($0.8 billion);   consumer goods  ($0.7 billion); and foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.6 billion).  The February to March increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($7.7 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines
($2.1 billion); capital goods ($1.6 billion); and other
goods ($0.6 billion). A decrease occurred in consumer
goods ($2.0 billion). Foods, feeds, and beverages were
virtually unchanged.  The March 2010 to March 2011 increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($9.9 billion); capital goods ($4.0 billion); foods,
feeds, and beverages ($2.4 billion); automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($2.4 billion); and consumer goods
($0.7 billion). A decrease occurred in other goods ($0.5
billion).  The March 2010 to March 2011 increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($13.8 billion); capital goods ($6.8 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($4.0 billion); consumer
goods ($3.0 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.2
billion); and other goods ($0.3 billion).  Services  Services exports increased $0.5 billion from February to
March.  The increase was more than accounted for by
increases in other private services (which includes items
such as business, professional, and technical services,
insurance services, and financial services), other
transportation (which includes freight and port services),
passenger fares, and transfers under U.S. military agency
sales contracts.  A decrease in royalties and license fees
was partly offsetting.  Changes in the other categories of
services exports were small.  Services imports increased $0.3 billion from
February to March.  The increase was mostly accounted for
by increases in other transportation and other private
services.  Changes in the other categories of services
imports were small.  The March 2010 to March 2011 increase in exports of
services was $2.7 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($1.8 billion), travel ($0.4
billion), and passenger fares ($0.3 billion).  Within
other private services, the largest increases were in
financial services and business, professional, and
technical services.  The March 2010 to March 2011 increase in imports of
services was $1.6 billion.  The largest increases were in
other private services ($1.0 billion) and other

services, the largest increases were in insurance services
and business, professional, and technical services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in March, exports of goods and
