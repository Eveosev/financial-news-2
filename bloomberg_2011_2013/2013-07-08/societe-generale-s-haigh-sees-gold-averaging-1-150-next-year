Gold will probably extend its decline
through 2014, even as the commodity super cycle that’s brought
longer-than-average rising prices may persist for a further two
decades, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  Bullion may average $1,150 an ounce next year, said the
head of commodities research,  Michael Haigh , who in April
correctly predicted the metal’s rout. That would be the lowest
annual average since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gold is heading for its first yearly loss since 2000 as
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value after
the U.S. Federal Reserve said it may slow asset purchases this
year if the economy continues to improve. While Societe Generale
is bearish on bullion, it expects the decade-long  bull market  in
commodities to extend for a further 15 to 20 years, driven by
rapid urbanization and growing population in countries including
China and  India , said Haigh.  “It would take something dreadful to happen to make the
super cycle suddenly end,” said Haigh, citing risks including a
sharp slowdown in  China , a scenario the bank doesn’t expect.
“If you believe that the third super cycle is a function of
population and urbanization, you’re looking at another 15 to 20
years. But it’s not going to be an upward price for all.”  Super Cycle  The previous generation-long cycles ran from 1870 to 1913
and from the end of World War II to the early 1970s, Haigh said.
The third super cycle began around 2000, he said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. forecast the
end of the cycle after prices that more than doubled in 10 years
spurred expansions at mines, farms and oil fields. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Spot  Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials lost 2 percent this
year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 5.1
percent.  Hedge funds  cut combined bullish  bets  across 18 U.S.
commodity futures by 58 percent from a 16-month high in
September as gold, metals and grains trade in bear markets.  Gold slid 23 percent last quarter, entering a bear market
in April. The precious metal traded at $1,221.65 at 3:06 p.m. in
Singapore today and has averaged $1,511 this year.  “Prices are going to generally drop down throughout the
year,” Haigh said at a media briefing in Singapore today.
Producers may increase hedging, he said. “They’ll start selling
into the market, which puts more downward pressure on  gold
prices .”  Gold Selloff  Goldman says bullion will reach $1,050 by the end of 2014
and Credit Suisse Group AG anticipates $1,150 in about 12 months.
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , the most-accurate gold forecaster tracked by
Bloomberg over the past two years, predicts $1,000 in three
months. Banks from Morgan Stanley to BNP Paribas SA to UBS AG
cut their forecasts last month.  Investors sold 622.3 metric tons as of July 5 from
exchange-traded products this year,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Haigh uses an algorithm called the Principal Component
Analysis model to help him predict prices.  A “hard-landing” in China to end the commodity super
cycle would mean growth in gross domestic product decelerating
to an annual 3 to 4 percent, he said. That has a probability of
just 20 percent, he said.  China’s GDP may have expanded 7.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, according to the median  estimate  of
31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of a July 15 release by
the statistics bureau. That would be the  slowest  pace since the
three months through September 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
