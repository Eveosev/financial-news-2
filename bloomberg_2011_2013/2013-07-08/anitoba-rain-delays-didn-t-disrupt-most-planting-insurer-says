Unusually wet weather that delayed
wheat and canola planting in Manitoba in May probably didn’t
prevent farmers from getting most of their crops sown, according
to the Canadian province’s farm insurer.  “It’s still a little early to tell, but it doesn’t look
like a significant year for acres that went unseeded,” David
Koroscil, the manager of insurance projects for the Manitoba
Agricultural Services Corp., said in a telephone interview from
Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. “Even though seeding was delayed
this year and producers got out a lot later than normal, they
made up ground in a short period of time.”  MASC , a government-owned company that provides
agricultural-risk management and financial services to the
province’s farmers, will release its estimate of unseeded acres
next week, Koroscil said.  Heavy rain delayed seeding on some southern Manitoba farms
and caused “extensive  flooding ” in some areas, the province
said. Many areas received additional  moisture  in June, which the
agriculture ministry said may impact  crops  after as much as 200
millimeters (8 inches) fell in the southwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
