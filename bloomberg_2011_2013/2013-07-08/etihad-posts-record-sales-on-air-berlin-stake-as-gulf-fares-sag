Etihad Airways, the third-biggest
Gulf carrier, said stakes in  Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  and  Virgin Australia (VAH) 
Holdings Ltd. helped lift second-quarter sales to a record $1.33
billion even as competition squeezed fares in its own markets.  Three-month revenue rose 7 percent, with the contribution
from code-share and equity alliance partners jumping 25 percent
to $184 million, accounting for one-fifth of total passenger
sales, the Abu Dhabi-based company said today in a statement.  The biggest outside contribution came from Air Berlin, in
which Etihad owns a 29 percent stake as part of a plan that’s
also seen it take holdings in Virgin  Australia ,  Aer Lingus Group
Plc (AERL)  and Aer Seychelles Ltd. Conditions in key long-haul markets
remain tough amid sluggish European growth and capacity hikes at
larger rivals including Emirates and Qatar Airways Ltd.  The revenue gain was achieved “despite the continuation of
unsteady economic and geopolitical factors, with air-fare yields
slightly lower for the quarter, compressed by strong competitive
capacity growth and resultant price competition,” Chief
Executive Officer James Hogan said in the statement.  Etihad’s network of equity partners, unusual among modern
airlines as major carriers focus more on global alliances and
joint ventures, is likely to be expanded after it last month
signed a plan to invest in  Serbia ’s JAT Airways and as it awaits
regulatory approval to buy 24 percent of  India ’s  Jet Airways. (JETIN)   Clearance has already been secured in Australia to lift the
10 percent Virgin Australia holding to 19.9 percent.  Etihad’s load factor -- a measure of seat occupancy --
slipped 0.3 points in the quarter to 77.3 percent, while the
amount of cargo flown gained 26 percent to almost 113,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
