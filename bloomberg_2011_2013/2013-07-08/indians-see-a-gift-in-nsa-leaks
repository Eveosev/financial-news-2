A month after the first revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, the affair continues to resonate around the world. To the list of 38 countries whose diplomatic missions in the U.S. were, according to documents leaked by Snowden,  targeted for surveillance  by the NSA, one can now add a second list, almost as long. These are the countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America that in the last week have received requests from Snowden  for asylum  and that risk running afoul of the U.S. government. India is on both lists, and the response of its government to both developments has been as insipid as a random sample of Internet debris. Last week, India's Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that its mission in Moscow had received a  letter from Snowden , and that his request for asylum had been turned down. There was nothing very surprising about this, as India has no clear policy on asylum-seekers and, other than the  Dalai Lama , currently hosts no prominent political fugitives. What was most upsetting to many Indians, however, was their government's passivity and lack of indignation when it came to taking a stance on this latest episode of -- to borrow the title of  Tim Weiner's recent article  -- "A Long History of Untruthiness by U.S. Intelligence." Over the past month, many Indians have come to see Snowden as a hero who has forced all democracies to reassess the trade-offs between national security and individual liberty, and supplied a revealing glimpse of a dystopian future in which Big Brother is always watching. In answering the call of his conscience, Snowden has given his countrymen the means with which to press their government for an intelligence service more circumscribed in its reach and capabilities and more accountable to the institutions of democracy. This is something that the other countries of the world -- even American allies  outraged  by the revelations -- wouldn't have been able to accomplish.  Agreed, there's an irony in Snowden seeking asylum in countries with a much worse record on freedom of speech and individual liberty than the government with which he has broken. But that irony is leveled out by that of the U.S. administration  declaring that  his motives are suspect because of "the protectors he has potentially chosen: China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, and Ecuador," even as it continues to look past human-rights abuses perpetrated by some of those countries. When it comes to the view that espionage is a reality of the modern state system and that the surveillance that Snowden exposed is " a universally practiced tool of the trade ," many would side rather with the argument made by  David Bromwich  in the London Review of Books last week, measuring allegedly desirable ends against first principles: Many of the moral issues raised by the Snowden revelations were summarized by the Indian political scientist  Pratap Bhanu Mehta  in an essay in the Financial Times: Last week, India's foreign minister, Salman Khurshid, was roundly criticized for his view of the Snowden affair.  Khurshid said  that he had raised the matter  with  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and had come to an understanding that the secret surveillance was "only computer analysis of patterns of calls and emails that are being sent. It is not actually snooping on specifically on content of anybody's message or conversation." Khurshid was berated by the academic Vijay Prashad,  who wrote  in the Hindu: Indeed, it was curious that Khurshid would so blithely buy the U.S. position on the matter. In response, the sociologist Shiv Visvanathan raised a pertinent question  in a column : "Did our government submit because it too is assembling equivalent systems of surveillance to watch our own people?" This year, India has rolled out its own wide-ranging surveillance program, the ominously titled  Central Monitoring System , which will allow government to bypass both parliament and courts in monitoring telephone and Internet usage. The Snowden affair has given Indians a taste of what could go wrong when their own government has access to vast troves of information about their lives. A couple of decades into the digital age, it's clear we need a new kind of global contract about the limits of cyber surveillance (whether by the big Internet-based companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., or by governments) and about the rights of powerful states to exercise new forms of the double-standard that Bhanu Mehta calls geographical morality. Thinking about these issues in the Economic Times, Pranesh Prakash, one of India's most sage voices on Internet issues,  wrote : The Snowden revelations have been deeply embarrassing for the U.S., but good for the world -- and probably the U.S., too, in the long run -- because, as the Guardian's editor Alan Rusbridger points out in this  Bloomberg interview , the disclosures clearly serve the public interest, showing Americans that they are not far from a surveillance system "that has no happy precedents in history." In India, a country that knows that its whistle-blowers will routinely be persecuted or  killed in cold blood , there's plenty of respect for the gumption of Edward Snowden.
