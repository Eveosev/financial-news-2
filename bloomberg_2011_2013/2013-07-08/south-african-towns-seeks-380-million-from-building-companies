South African towns are seeking
reimbursement of as much as 3.9 billion rand ($380 million) from
construction companies for overcharging on stadium and road
contracts for the 2010 Soccer World Cup.  “We plan to claim as much as we can from the construction
companies,” Lance Joel, chief of operations at Pretoria-based
 South African Local Government Association , said in a mobile-phone interview today. “It is fair.”  Salga, as the association is known, plans to hold meetings
with the companies from this week to reach an out-of-court
agreement, according to Joel. The Competition Commission has
already fined 15 companies a combined 1.46 billion rand for
collusion over prices for projects including those commissioned
for the World Cup.  The new claims relate to the 13-billion rand worth of
contracts awarded to build six stadiums, roads and related
infrastructure. The contracts were awarded from 2006 to end of
2009, according to the association.  “Overcharge on these contracts range from 10 percent to 30
percent,” Joel said. “The association will not be adding
penalty interests.”  Aveng Ltd. (AEG) , the country’s biggest construction company by
market value, was fined 306.6 billion rand by the Competition
Commission for price-fixing and collusion, according to a June
24 statement.  Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR)  agreed to pay 309
million rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
