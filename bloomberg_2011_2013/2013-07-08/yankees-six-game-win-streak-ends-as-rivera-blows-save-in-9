Mariano Rivera allowed a two-run home
run in the ninth inning as the  New York Yankees  had their
season-high six-game winning streak snapped with a 2-1 loss to
the  Baltimore Orioles .  It was the second blown save this year for Rivera, who had
converted 41 consecutive save opportunities at Yankee Stadium
since the start of the 2011 Major League Baseball season.  The Orioles, after two straight one-run losses, trailed 1-0
entering the ninth inning when Nick Markakis had a one-out
single and  Adam Jones  followed with a two-run homer off Rivera,
who was denied his 30th save of the season.  The only other home run Rivera had allowed this season was
to Evan Longoria of the Tampa Bay Rays on April 23.  The New York Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 as
starting pitcher Jeremy Hefner allowed one run over seven
innings. Hefner has won his past three decisions and has a 1.64
earned run average since June 4.  The Los Angeles Angels won for the 10th time in their past
12 games, beating the Boston Red Sox 3-0 as Mike Trout and Hank Conger hit home runs. Jered Weaver and three Angels relievers
combined on the five-hit shutout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
