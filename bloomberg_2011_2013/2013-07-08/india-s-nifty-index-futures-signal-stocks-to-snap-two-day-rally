Indian stocks declined for the first
time in three days as stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs data
fueled concern the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its stimulus
program and the rupee weakened to a record.  The S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 0.9 percent to 19,324.77 at the
close in Mumbai. The measure’s 30-day volatility held near a
one-year high.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s
largest refining complex, lost 1.5 percent.  Housing Development
Finance Corp. (HDFC)  sank the most in five weeks. The rupee slid to an
unprecedented 61.2125 per dollar.  The Sensex has dropped 3.7 percent since May 22 when Fed
Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said the central bank will slow stimulus
if the  U.S. economy  improves. That spurred investors to sell
emerging markets’ assets, including Indian equities. A weaker
currency raises India’s cost of imported oil, likely paring the
central bank’s scope to pare  interest rates  at its meeting on
July 30. Crude in New York traded near a 14-month high.  “The environment for emerging markets, including India, is
difficult at the moment given the rising U.S. yields and
strengthening dollar,” Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment
officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai, said in an
interview today. “Chances of a rate cut later this month are
zero due to the continuous fall in the rupee. Rising oil prices
have only added to India’s woes.”  Data on July 5 showed U.S. payrolls rose 195,000 in June,
beating the 165,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Global equities have lost more than $3.7 trillion in value and
U.S. Treasury yields have climbed to an almost two-year high
since May 22. Foreign funds withdrew a net $1.76 billion from
 Indian (SENSEX)  stocks in June, the most since August 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They sold $3 million of shares on
July 5, the data show.  Reliance, ONGC  Reliance Industries lost 1.5 percent to 866.95 rupees. The
stock had increased 11 percent over the past two weeks.  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  tumbled 3.9 percent to 303.85 rupees, its
lowest close since June 24.  Housing Development plunged 3.1 percent to 824.05 rupees,
the most since May 31.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest
lender, retreated 2.2 percent to 1,027.95 rupees, while larger
rival  State Bank of India  lost 1.1 percent to 1,873.2 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s largest producer of
tractors, lost 2.5 percent to 947.7 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ,
the nation’s biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
tumbled 2.8 percent to 287.8 rupees, the most since June 26.  JLR factories in U.K. may have to stop production within
weeks after delivery workers from DHL who work at three of the
carmaker’s main plants voted to strike over pay. The company
asked the workers to “return to the negotiating table,” Ken
McConomy, spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover, said yesterday.  RCOM Spinoff  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the mobile phone operator
controlled by billionaire  Anil Ambani , jumped 7 percent to 145.2
rupees, the highest in more than two years, after the company
said it plans to spin off its real estate business. The stock,
which is not part of the Sensex, has doubled this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India left its key rate unchanged on
June 17, ending three straight cuts. While official data June 14
showed wholesale-price inflation slowed to a 43-month low in
May, a separate gauge of consumer prices rose 9.31 percent, the
fastest after Argentina in the Group of 20 nations. India buys
about 80 percent of its crude from overseas.  Deutsche Bank AG cut its year-end Sensex target to 21,000
from 22,500, citing prospects for tapering of Fed’s bond-buying
program, a slowdown in China and a weak rupee. A reversal in
inflation, elevated interest rates and the current-account gap
has been delayed by “the generic risk-off sentiment enveloping
emerging markets,” analysts Abhay Laijawala and Abhishek Saraf
wrote in a report today.  WTI, Brent  Crude gained, with West Texas Intermediate trading near the
highest price in 14 months, as protests in Egypt fanned concern
that Middle East oil supply may be disrupted.  Brent crude , the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s oil, rose 0.2 percent to
$107.96 a barrel.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major trading partners, rose to the highest level since July
2010. The rupee fell 0.6 percent to 60.6150 at the close.  The Sensex  trades at  12.9 times projected 12-month
earnings. While that’s down from a 3 1/2-month high of 13.7
reached May 17, it’s still at a 36 percent premium to the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s multiple of 9.5.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
fell 1 percent to 5,811.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
