Yacktman Asset Management, the money
manager founded by Donald Yacktman, said it’s supporting a
proposal by Carl Icahn that would scuttle the planned leveraged
buyout of  Dell Inc. (DELL)  by its founder,  Michael Dell .  The proposal by Icahn gives shareholders the option to sell
or stay invested, and a change in the board of directors may
benefit shareholder value, Yacktman said today in an e-mailed
statement. The offer by Michael Dell is “inadequate,” the
company wrote. Yacktman Asset Management, based in Austin,
Texas, held 0.85 percent of Dell as of March 31, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
