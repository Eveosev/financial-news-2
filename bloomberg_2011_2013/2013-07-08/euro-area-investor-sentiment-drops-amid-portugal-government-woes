Euro-area investor confidence
unexpectedly deteriorated in July after political turmoil in
 Portugal  sparked renewed tensions in financial markets, the
Sentix research institute said.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro region fell to
minus 12.6 from minus 11.6 in June, the Limburg, Germany-based
institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists had
predicted an increase to minus 11.4, according to the median of
18 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . A gauge of economic
expectations remained unchanged at 7.3, while a measure of
current conditions dropped to minus 30.5 from minus 28.8.  The resignation of two Portuguese ministers over austerity
measures opened a political rift in the debt-strapped country,
pushing the yield on the nation’s 10-year bonds above 8 percent
last week for the first time since November. That followed a
market selloff on speculation the  Federal Reserve  is preparing
to scale back its bond-buying program, a step European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  countered by committing to keep
euro-area  interest rates  low for an extended period of time.  While Portugal’s government crisis weighed on confidence
this month, institutional investors’ expectations was bolstered
by Draghi’s “energetic performance” last week, said  Sebastian Wanke , an economist at Sentix. “Monetary policy is providing a
positive impetus again, while euro-area governments have weighed
on economic sentiment.”  Confidence in Germany rose to 18.4 in July from 16.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
