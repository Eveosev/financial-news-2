Russia , once the world’s biggest
wheat importer, has the potential to as much as double its grain
harvest, according to billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s Kuban
Agricultural Holding.  Russia could reap 150 million to 170 million metric tons of
grain, compared with 85 million to 90 million tons in recent
seasons, if it puts into use 25 million hectares (61.8 million
acres) of idle agricultural land and utilizes better
technologies and fertilizers, said Andrey Oleynik, managing
director of agribusiness at parent company Basic Element. The
country has 115 million hectares of agricultural land, he said,
an area bigger than  Colombia .  “There is big potential for development and increasing
profits in Russia’s agriculture,” Oleynik said. “Profitability
in the sector may be easily raised to 15 percent from the
current 6 to 10 percent by applying technologies and better
management.”  Russia was the biggest wheat importer in the 1992-93 season
following the collapse of the  Soviet Union , according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The country boosted private
investment in grain production and became the world’s fifth
biggest  wheat exporter  in the season that ended June 30,
according to the USDA. Land availability and wages averaging
12,000 rubles ($360) a month in the sector make agriculture an
attractive investment and allow room for further growth,
according to Oleynik.  Basic Element manages assets owned by Deripaska including
En+ Group, which controls a 48 percent stake in United Co.
Rusal, the world’s biggest producer of aluminum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
