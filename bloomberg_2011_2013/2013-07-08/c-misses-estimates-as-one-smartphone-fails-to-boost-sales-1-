HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese smartphone
maker, posted second-quarter profit that missed analyst
estimates as the release of its flagship One handset failed to
reverse a slide in sales. Shares dropped.  Net income fell to NT$1.25 billion ($42 million) in the
three months ended June, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said
July 5. That’s down 83 percent from a year earlier and trails
the NT$2.17 billion average of 19 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Taiwan’s largest smartphone maker, which has seen its stock
slump 80 percent in the past two years, released the HTC One
into the U.S. in April, the same month  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) 
put its flagship Galaxy S4 on sale. New marketing plans and
executive changes may help the company rebuild its brand after
its global ranking fell to ninth behind Chinese handset makers
 ZTE Corp. (000063)  and Huawei Technologies Co.  The stock dropped as much as 5.4 percent to NT$192 in
Taipei today, the lowest since November 2005, and was 4.4
percent lower as of 9:18 a.m. Taiwan’s benchmark Taiex index
lost 0.3 percent.  Revenue for the quarter fell to NT$70.7 billion compared
with the NT$72.8 billion average of 21 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company had forecast sales of about
NT$70 billion.  HTC lost the early momentum of unveiling its HTC One in
 February  prior to Samsung’s Galaxy S4 as a shortage of camera
components forced it to delay shipments. A smaller version of
the flagship will be released this quarter, Bloomberg News
reported last month.  HTC fell to ninth in the global smartphone market during
the first quarter, with 2.4 percent share, according to data
from Bloomberg Industries and IDC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
