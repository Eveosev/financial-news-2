Cytokinetics Inc. (CYTK)  is evaluating the
costs and timing of a clinical trial for its amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis treatment after some patients were given a placebo by
mistake. The shares fell as much as 8.8 percent.  Fifty-eight patients slated to receive the drug, called
tirasemtiv, were instead given the placebo due to a computer
programming error, the South San Francisco, California-based
company said in a statement today. The error has been fixed and
the trial is continuing, Cytokinetics said. No participants
assigned to the control group were given the treatment.  Tirasemtiv treats amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known
as ALS or  Lou Gehrig ’s disease, a fatal breakdown of the central
nervous system with no known cure. The trial, designed to enroll
as many as 500 patients, was in the second of three stages
usually required to win marketing approval in the U.S.  “Cytokinetics is in communication with regulatory
authorities regarding how best to respond to the error in drug
assignment in order to preserve the intended scientific value”
of the trial, the company said. Enrollment could be expanded and
Cytokinetics may also need to make revisions to the timing of
results and projected costs, according to the statement.  Cytokinetics shares, which have more than tripled this
year, dropped 6.5 percent to $11.98 at 9:37 a.m.  New York  time,
after declining to $11.68. The shares had surged this year as
the company announced partnerships with drugmakers  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) 
and  Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503)   To contact the reporter on this story:
