Spanish soccer champion Barcelona
reached a preliminary agreement to trade striker  David Villa  to
 Atletico Madrid .  The fee would be a minimum of 2.1 million euros ($2.7
million) and increase to 5.1 million euros if he stays three
seasons at Atletico, Barcelona said in an e-mail.  The Catalan club will get half of any transfer fee if
Atletico trades the 31-year-old striker, the statement added.
Earlier today, the  Daily Mirror reported  that English Premier
League club Tottenham had reached a preliminary accord with
Barcelona to sign Villa for 8.6 million pounds ($12.9 million).  Villa joined Barcelona from Valencia in 2010, after helping
Spain win the World Cup with five goals. He scored in
Barcelonaâ€™s 2011 Champions League final win against Manchester
United, although he was sidelined for most of the following
season because of injury and struggled to win back his place.  To contact the reporters on this story:
