Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s second-biggest private-equity firm, said the funds from which it can
collect a slice of profits appreciated 3 percent in the second
quarter and 9 percent in the year’s first half.  Carry funds that invest in buyouts gained 5 percent in the
quarter and 15 percent in 2013, Washington-based Carlyle said
today in an e-mailed statement. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
of large U.S. companies rose 2.4 percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index fell 1.2 percent in the quarter.  The firm, which oversaw $176 billion across 114 funds and
76 funds-of-funds as of March 31, is set to report full earnings
for the second quarter next month. Carlyle held its  initial
public offering  last year and has disclosed preliminary fund
performance before its scheduled earnings reports to allow
stockholders to see the figures when its fund investors
typically do.  Most of Carlyle’s strategies posted gains for the quarter.
Carry funds in Carlyle’s real estate unit were unchanged and
those investing in energy declined 3 percent. The firm’s Global
Market Strategies funds appreciated 8 percent. GMS carry funds,
which invest in distressed companies and lend to middle-sized
companies as well as energy and power projects, advanced 22
percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
