The  San Diego  County Water Authority
and the City of San Diego are considering building a 500-megawatt hydroelectric power plant to offset shuttered nuclear
power capacity.  The proposed project would increase the amount of water in
the San Vicente Reservoir and would be completed after more than
five years, the public agency said today in a  statement .  The new plant would help make up for the capacity lost when
 Edison International (EIX) ’s Southern California Edison decided to
permanently close the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station that
closed in January 2012, Frank Belock, a deputy general manager
at the Water Authority said today in an interview.  It would be the Water Authority’s second plant to pump
water up into the reservoir from a smaller one below, mainly at
night when power rates are low, he said.  The Water Authority has put out a request for proposals to
do an economic and financial study that should cost less than
$150,000 and determine the project’s cost and the best ownership
structure.  Since it’s primarily a power project outside of its water
expertise, “we’re open to all considerations,” Belock said,
including as a public-private partnerships with energy
companies.  The Water Authority’s first plant is a 40 megawatt pumped-storage project that connects Hodges Reservoir with Olivenhain
Reservoir. Most of the state’s hydroelectric facilities are
located in the northern half of the state, according to a
California Energy Commission  map .  To contact the reporter on this story:
