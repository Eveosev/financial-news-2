TransAlta Corp. (TA) , the worst-performing
power generation stock in  North America  the past year, is
betting a spinoff of its wind and hydroelectric power plants
will increase the company’s value and help reverse two years of
losses.  Canada ’s largest publicly traded electricity generator
gained 9.7 percent since the company said on June 26 it plans an
initial public offering of some renewable energy assets.
TransAlta has expanded its wind and hydro power capacity to
about 25 percent from 15 percent in 2008 with developments in
eastern Canada and parts of the U.S., even as power prices in
its main markets of  Alberta  and  Washington  State declined.  “Investors are willing to pay more for renewables,”
Jeremy Rosenfield, an analyst at Dejardins Capital Markets in
 Montreal , said by phone July 4.  The spinoff could help boost TransAlta’s shares to C$15.50
from C$14.54 at 4:05 p.m. in Toronto today, said Benjamin Pham,
a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a June 27 note. TransAlta’s
renewable portfolio has been undervalued for years, he said.  “The structure of the spinoff is designed to permit
TransAlta to retain control of its renewable energy fleet while
unlocking value to the benefit of shareholders and to accelerate
development and acquisition opportunities,” he said.  TransAlta is expected to raise C$200 million ($190 million)
to C$250 million in the IPO when it closes in August, the
company said in a statement. It will retain an 80 percent to 85
percent stake in the unit.  Benefits Shareholders  “TransAlta Renewables provides us with another effective
source of capital for funding growth in renewables which will
benefit the shareholders of both companies,” Chief Executive
Officer Dawn Farrell said in the statement. Farrell was
unavailable for an interview, Stacey Hatcher, a spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  TransAlta has struggled with its aging fleet of coal power
stations in Alberta as well as a coal facility in Centralia,
Washington, a state which aims to phase out generation as the
U.S. toughens regulations to reduce  greenhouse gases .  The company reported a first-quarter loss of C$11 million
after two consecutive years of losses. It’s forecast to post a
profit before extraordinary items of C$38.2 million for 2013,
according to the average of three analysts  compiled  by
Bloomberg. Calgary-based TransAlta has lost 18 percent in the
past 12 months, the  most  among 15 North American peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wind Energy  TransAlta has been shifting towards renewables and is now
Canada’s largest  wind energy  producer, Farrell said in the June
statement. Last year it generated 4.8 megawatt-hours of
renewable electricity, mainly from wind and hydro power. The
company owns or operates 28 hydro facilities and 16 wind farms,
along with a geothermal plant in  California , according to its
website.  The world needs to invest $6.35 trillion in clean energy
power and infrastructure between 2010 and 2020 to meet growing
power needs and reduce  carbon emissions , according to the
 International Energy Agency . Canada has spurred growth of low-emission generation, including in Ontario, where the provincial
government uses feed-in tariffs, or above-market rates, to lure
renewable power generation.  TransAlta shares have trailed the 2.3 percent gain this
year for  Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQN)  and a 1.2 percent
decline for Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP and is less
than half the price of its 2008 peak of C$37.38.  ‘Decent News’  “The stock shouldn’t have gone down as much as it did,”
Juan Plessis, a Vancouver-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity
Corp. said by phone on July 5. He has a “buy” rating on the
stock and a price target of C$18. “TransAlta isn’t a utility
and should be compared with other independent power producers
like Brookfield Renewables.”  TransAlta’s price-to-earnings ratio of 20 trails
competitors, including Algonquin Power’s 33 and Brookfield
Renewables at 60, according to Bloomberg data.  The renewables spinoff is “relatively decent news and you
get a bit of money in the door,” said  John Stephenson , a senior
vice president and portfolio manager at First Asset Investment
Management Inc. He helps oversee about C$2.7 billion.
“TransAlta’s problems are pretty systemic. There’s a low price
for electricity and no reason to be bullish on electricity
prices in the near term.” He doesn’t own TransAlta shares.  TransAlta’s renewable energy assets will likely help boost
the share price following the spinoff, said Robert Mark, analyst
at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which
oversees C$2.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
