Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)  advanced
the most in seven months after the company’s board recommended
distributing a first-half  dividend  of 6 riyals per share.  Safco, as the fertilizer maker is known, gained 4.4 percent
to 153.5 riyals, the most since Dec. 8, at 2 p.m. in Riyadh. The
stock was the  biggest gainer  on the benchmark Tadawul All Share
Index, which was little changed. The shares have increased 0.8
percent this year compared with a 13 percent jump for the
benchmark gauge.  The company, which announced a cash and stock dividend in
the year-earlier period, will post a 3 percent decline in
second-quarter profit, according to the mean estimate of eight
analysts on Bloomberg. The price of urea, which is a source of
nitrogen used by farmers to boost crops, has declined 12 percent
this year.  “The dividend yield on the stock remains attractive,”
Ankit Gupta, Dubai-based equity analyst and assistant vice
president of research at NBK Capital, said in an e-mailed
comment. “However, the urea market fundamentals remain weak.”  Five analysts have a buy rating on Safco, while ten
recommend investors hold the stock and one advises investors to
sell, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
