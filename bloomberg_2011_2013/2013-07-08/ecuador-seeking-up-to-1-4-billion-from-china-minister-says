Ecuador , which defaulted on $3.2
billion of its international bonds four years ago, is seeking as
much as $1.4 billion in financing from  China  to fund this year’s
budget, Finance Minister Fausto Herrera said.  The first disbursement of the loan is expected next month,
Herrera told reporters in Quito today. The loan may be tied to
oil sales or granted directly, he said.  President Rafael Correa, who has relied on funding from
China, multilateral lenders, the state pension agency and
windfall oil profits to cover increased public spending since
taking power in 2007, needs the money to finance a 24 percent
increase in public spending this year. Economic growth in 2013
is forecast to slow to its lowest rate in three years as a rout
in  emerging markets  assets  sap dollars  from the economy.  The South American country, which received a separate $1.4
billion loan from China in February to help fund this year’s
estimated $5.05 billion spending gap, also plans to issue
foreign bonds by the first quarter of 2014 to finance next
year’s budget, Herrera said. That would be Ecuador’s first
international debt sale since 2005 and will “depend on
conditions,” he said.  With oil prices forecast by the government to decline to an
average $84.90 per barrel this year, 2013 growth is expected to
slow to 4 percent, according to the median estimate of six
economists surveyed by Bloomberg from June 21 to June 26. Gross
domestic product expanded 5 percent in 2012.  The February loan from China had an interest rate of 7
percent and a maturity of eight years, according to the Finance
Ministry. Herrera didn’t give details of the new loan today.  Yields on Ecuador’s 2015 dollar bonds have climbed 104
basis points, or 1.04 percentage points, to 7.99 percent in the
past month as global borrowing costs rise on speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve will wind down its record stimulus
measures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on the
notes were little changed today as of 9:55 a.m. in  Quito .  The country is rated B- by Fitch Ratings, six levels below
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
