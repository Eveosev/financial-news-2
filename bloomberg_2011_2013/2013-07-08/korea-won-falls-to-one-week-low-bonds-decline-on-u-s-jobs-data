South Korea ’s won fell to a one-week
low and government bonds declined after U.S. jobs data fanned
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will rein in monetary stimulus
that has spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength,
climbed to a three-year high after the U.S. added more jobs than
economists forecast in June, brightening the outlook for growth
in the world’s biggest economy. South Korea will strengthen
monitoring of the exchange rate and seek to counter volatility
when there are signs of “herd behavior,” Finance Minister Hyun
Oh Seok said July 5.  “The fear of an early stimulus exit by the Fed re-emerged
and authorities may intervene if the won falls too rapidly,”
said Choi Sung Hyun, a currency trader at  Woori Bank  in Seoul.
“The won may fall beyond 1,160 today, which would pressure
importers to buy the dollar before it strengthens further.”  The won slid 0.8 percent to 1,151.45 per dollar as of 9:55
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,152.69, the weakest level since June 27. The yield on
the 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 climbed 11 basis points to
3.09 percent, the biggest increase since July 1, prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. show.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 70 basis points,
or 0.7 percentage point, to 11.07 percent. That was the biggest
jump since June 20.  U.S. employers added 195,000 workers for the second month
in a row in June and wages increased, a Labor Department report
showed July 5. The  unemployment rate  held at 7.6 percent, close
to a four-year low.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. brought
forward their forecasts for the start date of when the Fed will
start tapering quantitative easing to September from December,
according to research notes on July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
