U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
has held four “lengthy and very candid” calls in the last week
with his Egyptian counterpart, Pentagon spokesman  George Little 
said.  Little declined to disclose the contents of Hagel’s
discussions with Defense Minister Abdelfatah Al-Seesi, who led
the ouster on July 3 of elected President Mohamed Mursi. The
most recent call was over the weekend, the spokesman said.  More than 50 Egyptians, most supporters of Mursi, were shot
dead today outside a heavily guarded military base, prompting
the Muslim Brotherhood that backed him to call for an uprising
against the army.  Citing the U.S. military’s “long-standing relationship
with”  Egypt , Little told reporters today at the Pentagon that
maintaining communications shows the Obama administration’s
support for steps “that reduce provocations, reduce violence.”  Joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises planned for later
this year remain on schedule, Little said. The exercises were
canceled in 2011 after the revolution that toppled  Hosni Mubarak .  The U.S. provides about $1.5 billion a year in aid to
Egypt, $1.3 billion of it in military aid. The administration
has avoided calling Mursi’s ouster a coup, which under the law
would require cutting off the assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
