China  banned its fishing fleet from
working in waters off  North Korea ’s east coast after the
totalitarian regime demanded Chinese vessels buy fuel from North
Korean suppliers.  The North decreed late last month that Chinese ships, which
previously made their own fueling arrangements, had to abide by
the rule, China’s  Agriculture Ministry  said in a June 28
announcement that was posted to its website today.  “Fishing boat owners and and businesses believe that the
North Korean decision will have a serious effect on production
and operations and  job security , causing huge potential risks,”
the  ministry said .  The statement reflected Chinese concerns after North Korea
seized a Chinese fishing boat and its crew on May 5 and demanded
a 600,000 yuan ($97,800) ransom. The ship and crew were freed
later in May after Chinese diplomats negotiated their release,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The Agriculture Ministry said the situation in the area was
“highly sensitive and complex” because of its proximity to
South Korean, Japanese and Russian waters.  China is North Korea’s biggest  trading partner  and the two
have been allies for more than 60 years. Ties have been strained
this year after North Korea tested nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles, leading to tightened United Nations sanctions.  A year ago, a North Korean ship seized three Chinese
fishing boats with 29 crew and demanded 300,000  yuan  to free
each vessel, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported at
the time.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
