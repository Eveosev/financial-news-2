The Spanish government plans to merge
state-owned water operators including Acuaespana and Acuamed in
a single company prior to a total or partial sale, Expansion
said, citing unnamed people with knowledge of the matter.  The consultant PwC is in charge of designing the project
being managed by the  Environment Ministry , Expansion said. The
new company would have assets worth about 7 billion euros ($9
billion) and debt of 1.2 billion euros, according to the report.  Creating a single company would help improve contracts with
suppliers and homogenize water tariffs throughout  Spain ,
Expansion said in todayâ€™s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
