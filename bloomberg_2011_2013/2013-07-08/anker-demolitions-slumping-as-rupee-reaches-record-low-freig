The Indian rupee’s slump to a record
low is curbing tanker demolitions, prolonging a capacity glut
and the most unprofitable freight rates in at least 16 years.  Shipping companies sold 22 for demolition in the first
half, from 35 in 2012, according to  Clarkson (CKN)  Plc, the biggest
shipbroker. Indian yards, which break up the most tankers, buy
in dollars and sell scrap in rupees, which weakened 9.7 percent
against the U.S. currency this year, according to ACM Shipping
Group Plc, a shipbroker in  London . The largest tankers, yielding
about 37,500 metric tons of steel, fetched $14 million in May,
6.9 percent less than a year earlier, Clarkson data show.  Lower prices in  India  are being mirrored by competitors in
Pakistan, Bangladesh and China, deterring sales of obsolete
ships, according to Global Marketing Systems Inc., the largest
buyer. That’s prolonging the biggest capacity glut in
supertankers since 1985 at a time when seaborne crude imports by
 China  and the U.S., the two largest consumers, are declining.
Rates were unprofitable in all but four months since July 2010
and freight swaps anticipate at least two more years of losses.  “Weakness in the rupee hinders an already huge need to
scrap ships and return this market to a more balanced state,”
said Erik Folkeson, an analyst at Swedbank First Securities AS
in Oslo whose recommendations on the shares of shipping
companies returned 17 percent in the past two years. “A mix of
soft demand, high vessel deliveries and little scrapping is
devastating to the tanker market.”  Freight Swaps  Returns for very large crude carriers, the industry’s
biggest vessels, averaged $6,234 a day in the first half, the
worst for the period since at least 1997, Clarkson data show.
Frontline Ltd., the largest VLCC operator until last year, says
it needs $25,500 to break even. Rates won’t exceed that level
before 2016 at the earliest, according to freight-swaps data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of Frontline, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , slumped 32
percent to 12.55 kroner ($2.04) in Oslo this year. They  will
decline  another 32 percent to 8.51 kroner in 12 months,
according to the average of 14 analyst forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. The company, founded by billionaire  John Fredriksen ,
reported losses every year since 2011 and will stay unprofitable
through at least 2015, the analyst estimates show.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , based in  Tokyo , is the biggest
owner of VLCCs, which haul 2 million barrels of oil. Shares of
the company, whose fleet includes gas carriers and container
ships, climbed 58 percent to 401 yen ($3.97) this year. Mitsui
said in April it would return to profit as a weakening yen
boosts the value of repatriated dollar earnings.  Current Account  The rupee plunged after the shortfall in India’s current
account widened to a record 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product in the year ended March 31.  Foreign investment  in Indian
debt fell by $5.37 billion in June, the most since at least
2008, according to Securities and Exchange Board data.  The expansion of the fleet is slowing after a five-year
surge driven by freight rates that rose as high as $229,000 in
November 2007. The biggest VLCC-building program in four decades
is now ending, with outstanding orders for new vessels equal to
10 percent of existing capacity, according to IHS Fairplay, a
Redhill, England-based research company. The proportion was 48
percent five years ago.  Fleet capacity will expand 2 percent this year, compared
with 5.9 percent in 2012 and 7.8 percent in 2011, according to
London-based Clarkson, the world’s biggest shipbroker.  Financial Support  The supply of new ships may be curbed after  China Rongsheng
Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , China’s biggest ship yard
outside state control, said July 5 that it’s seeking financial
support after a plunge in orders. A third of the nation’s yards
may shut down in five years, the China Association of National
Shipbuilding Industry said.  The losses in shipping extend across other parts of the
merchant fleet, with the ClarkSea Index, a measure of returns
across the industry, averaging $9,139 a day in the second
quarter, Clarkson data show. It was the third-worst quarter in
the past two decades.  Some parts of the fleet are recovering as demand catches up
with capacity. Tankers hauling gasoline and diesel between
 Europe  and the U.S. are earning $13,744 a day, the most for this
time of year since at least 2009, according to data from the
 Baltic Exchange , a publisher of freight rates on more than 50
trade routes. Charter costs of $74.38 a ton for vessels carrying
liquefied petroleum gas are close to a record.  Investment Banking  The capacity glut in VLCCs is about 20 percent, the most
since 1985, according to estimates by Sverre Bjorn Svenning, an
analyst at the research unit of Astrup Fearnley Group, an Oslo-based shipping-services and  investment-banking  company.  Frontline said  May 30 it may need to raise cash to repay
$225 million of convertible bonds due in April 2015. The debt
may be converted into equity at $36.5567 until the due date,
compared with the company’s share price in  New York  of $2.01.
The notes trade at about 51 cents on the dollar, Exane Paris
prices on Bloomberg show.  India demolished 8.76 million tons of ships in 2011, with
tankers accounting for 21 percent of the total, according to
United Nations data. The remainder mostly comprised bulk
carriers,  container ships  and passenger vessels. China handled
6.35 million tons of scrapping, Bangladesh 5.96 million tons and
Pakistan 3.45 million tons.  “Demolition has been one of the big hopes as a catalyst
for the tanker market recovering,” said London-based Marc Pauchet, a senior analyst at ACM Shipping. “To have such a weak
rupee is profoundly unhelpful.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
