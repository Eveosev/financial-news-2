An Indian Coast Guard vessel has
joined operations to douse a blaze on the broken half of a
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  container ship being towed after the
vessel split into two in the Indian Ocean.  The world’s largest merchant fleet operator said the Indian
Coast Guard’s  Samudra Prahari , equipped with an external fire-fighting system,  reached  the stricken vessel today, according to
a statement on the Tokyo-based company’s website.  The salvage company  sought  help from the Indian Coast Guard
after the tug boat and two rescue boats were unable to douse a
fire that broke out on July 6, Mitsui O.S.K. said. About 1,700
containers were lost last month when the back half of the vessel
sank amid a storm.  Priyanka Saxena, a spokeswoman for the Indian Coast Guard,
didn’t immediately respond to three calls to her mobile phone
and an e-mail.  “We will make our best effort to contain the fire though
the weather is still not favorable to us,” Mitsui O.S.K. said
in the statement.  There were a total of 4,382 boxes on the MOL Comfort, which
was built five years ago. The vessel was carrying a crew of 26,
who were all rescued.  The containers had consumer goods and other merchandise
inside, the company said.  Mitsui O.S.K.  fell  2.2 percent to 401 yen at the close of
trading in  Tokyo . The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
