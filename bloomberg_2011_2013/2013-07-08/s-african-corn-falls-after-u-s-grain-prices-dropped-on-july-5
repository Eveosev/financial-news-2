South African corn futures declined
following U.S. prices that fell to $4.895 a bushel on July 5,
the lowest since October 2010.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 1.6 percent to 2,266 rand ($223) a metric ton by
the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
yellow variety, for delivery in September, decreased 1.5 percent
to 2,197 rand a ton.  Last week, prices for corn for December delivery on the
Chicago Board of Trade fell to a 32-month low on speculation
that warm weather will boost prospects for crops in the U.S.,
which is the world’s biggest producer of the grain. It was up 1
percent at $4.96 a bushel today.  “The U.S. December corn was down and once the selling
started in our market, it just continued, Pretoria-based Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed
response to queries.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow
corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December lost 0.4 percent to 3,431
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
