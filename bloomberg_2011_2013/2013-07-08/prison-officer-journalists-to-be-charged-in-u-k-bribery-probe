U.K. prosecutors said they would
charge a prison officer, three journalists and a member of the
public as part of an investigation into bribery of officials at
newspapers including  News Corp. (NWSA)  publications.  Journalists from  News Corp .,  Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI)  and
Northern & Shell Plc tabloids allegedly paid prison worker Scott
Chapman more than 35,000 pounds ($52,300) for stories through
his former partner Lynn Gaffney, the Crown Prosecution Service
said in a statement outlining its decision to bring charges.  Thomas Savage, an editor at Northern & Shell’s  Daily Star ,
is the first non-News Corp. journalist to be charged in the
bribery probe known as Operation Elveden. Lucy Panton, a former
editor at News Corp.’s now defunct News of the World paper, was
also charged, along with Chris Pharo, a senior editor at News
Corp.’s Sun tabloid, who allegedly authorized payments to
officials at secure hospitals, the police and armed forces, the
CPS said.  All five are accused of conspiracy to commit misconduct in
public office. News Corp. newspapers have been at the heart of
investigations into alleged bribery and phone hacking by
journalists that have led to lawsuits, criminal charges and the
closure of its News of the World tabloid.  The CPS said it didn’t have enough evidence to charge a
fourth journalist, from Trinity Mirror.  To contact the reporter on this story:
