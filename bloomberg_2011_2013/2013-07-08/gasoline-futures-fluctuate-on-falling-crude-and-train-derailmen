Gasoline fluctuated as crude oil fell
and on concern a key refinery that supplies the U.S. Northeast
may slow production after a train carrying crude oil to the
plant derailed.  Futures fell as much as 0.7 percent and rose as much as 0.6
percent. Crude futures sank as much as 1.1 percent. A train
carrying crude oil to Irving Oil Corp.’s 298,800-barrel-a-day
refinery in  New Brunswick ,  Canada , derailed and exploded in the
Quebec town of Lac-Megantic early Saturday, killing at least 5
people. The refinery can bring in as much as 200,000 barrels of
crude by rail every day.  “It’s not just the loss of oil, it’s the lost method of
transportation,” said Carl Larry, president of Houston-based
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC. “That’s a lot of oil they’re going
to be missing, unless they start bringing in Brent, which is
still more expensive, which means more costly gasoline for the
East Coast in the near term.”  August-delivery gasoline lost 0.61 cent to $2.8907 on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:06 a.m. Trading volume was 33
percent above the 100-day average. West Texas Intermediate crude
for August delivery fell 90 cents to $102.32 on the Nymex.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 64 cents to
$19.09 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 66 cents to
$14.61.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, were unchanged at $3.474
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery rose
1.8 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.9717 a gallon on volume that
was 32 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
rose 16 cents to $22.51 a barrel. Its  premium  to Brent gained 14
cents to $17.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
