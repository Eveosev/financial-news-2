Iran  is implementing hydropower
project water works abroad valued at $3.5 billion, Tehran Times
reported, citing Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Alireza Daemi.  Iran is also in talks on $2.7 billion of related deals,
Daemi was cited as saying by the paper without giving details
about the projects or location. Iranian companies have helped
work on water and power projects in about 40 countries, mostly
in Central Asia, the  Middle East , Latin America and Africa,
according to today’s Times, which didn’t give a timeline.  Sattar Mahmoudi, an advisor on water affairs to the energy
minister, said Iran is taking part in water installations in
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Afghanistan and Iraq. Iran
“plays an important role among regional nations in the water
sector, like the role  Germany  plays in Europe,” Mahmoudi said
July 2 in the Tehran-based Iran-Daily paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
