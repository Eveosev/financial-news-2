EON SE (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
has completed two solar plants totalling 20 megawatts in
 Arizona , the first it’s built in the U.S.  The larger of the two facilities built by EON’s renewables
unit, the 13-megawatt Valencia Solar project, came online last
month, the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement
today. Both solar farms have agreed to long-term contracts with
Tucson Electric Power Co.  “These are our maiden solar facilities in the U.S. and
signal EON’s commitment to solar development in the U.S.
market,” Christophe Jurczak, president of EON Climate &
Renewables Solar, said in the statement.  The 7-megawatt Tech Park Solar project was developed in
collaboration with the University of Arizona and Tuscon
Electric, according to the statement. Construction on both solar
farms began in the second half of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
