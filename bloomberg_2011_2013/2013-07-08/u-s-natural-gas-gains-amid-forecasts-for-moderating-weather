Natural gas futures posted the
biggest one-day gain in three weeks in  New York  on speculation
that hotter weather may spur demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas rose 3.4 percent, the most since June 17, as forecasts
showed above-normal temperatures from the Northeast into Central
and Western states through July 22, said MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas prices are down 16 percent from a
21-month high of $4.444 on May 1 as  stockpile gains  topped five-year averages for five straight weeks amid mild weather.  “We see the 11- to 15-day forecast keeping the heat in
place for most of July,” said Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “It really
is a weather-driven story with the expectation that the rise in
air-conditioning demand will bring the weekly storage injections
back in line with the five-year average levels.”  Natural gas for August delivery increased 12.4 cents to
$3.741 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price since June 21.
Trading volume was 30 percent below the 100-day at 2:38 p.m.
Prices have climbed 12 percent this year.  “Last week, the market stopped its downward trend, it held
support in the $3.50-$3.60 area,” said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America LLC in
Miami.  Pickens’s Outlook  Billionaire investor  T. Boone Pickens , chairman and chief
executive officer of BP Capital LLC in  Dallas , said in an
interview with CNBC that gas may reach $4.50 in a mild winter
while a cold winter may boost prices to $5.  The discount of August to October futures narrowed 0.5 cent
to 1.2 cents.  August $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 3.1 cents lower at 2.4 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,079 at 3:22 p.m. Puts accounted for
65 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in August was 30.55 percent at 3 p.m.
compared with 29.85 percent on July 5.  The high temperature in Dallas on July 12 may be 103
degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), 7 above normal, said
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Washington may
reach 99 degrees, 10 above normal, on July 19 and three days
later  Chicago  may climb to 93 degrees, 9 above average.  Tropical Storm  Tropical Storm Chantal, about 470 miles (760 kilometers)
east-southeast of Barbados with maximum wind speeds of 45 miles
per hour, is expected to strengthen over the next 48 hours, the
National Hurricane Center said at 2 p.m. East Coast time.  It appears the system will steer clear of rigs and
platforms in the  Gulf of Mexico  “and will likely just keep the
Southeast cooler than normal,” Viswanath said. Should the storm
move toward  Texas , causing electric power demand to drop,  gas
prices  would move lower again, she said.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  U.S. inventories  expanded by 72 billion cubic feet in the
week ended June 28 to 2.605 trillion, above the five-year
average gain of 71 billion, the EIA said on July 3. A  deficit  to
the five-year average narrowed to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent
the previous week. Supplies were 15.9 percent below  year-earlier
levels , compared with 17.1 percent a week earlier.  Gas Production  “We believe these larger injection levels reflect
stronger-than-expected production growth, in part because of de-bottlenecking in the Marcellus shale,” Damien Courvalin, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a
note to clients yesterday.  The bank cut its gas price forecast for the third quarter
to $3.85 per million Btu and for the fourth quarter to $4.25
from the previous projection of $4.50 for the second half of
2013, he said.  The EIA estimates that marketed production, which doesn’t
include amounts flared or used to pressure wells, will expand
1.2 percent this year to average a record 70.01 billion cubic
feet a day, the agency said in its June 11  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . Output will gain for the sixth consecutive year because
of new wells at the Marcellus shale deposit in the Northeast,
the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
