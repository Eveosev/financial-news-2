The Dollar Index may extend the
advance that took it to a three-year high, confirming a “deeper
rally phase” for the U.S. currency, if it breaks through key
technical levels, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A sustained break by the benchmark gauge above a resistance
level at 84.50 would clear the way for an advance to 84.90 to
84.95, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at
JPMorgan, wrote today in a client note. If the index increases
beyond that, it may rally to 86.07, a level not reached since
July 1, 2010. The Dollar Index touched 84.588 today, the highest
since July 6, 2010, after a report last week showed stronger-than-forecast employment gains.  “You have this bullish macro-fundamental backdrop for the
dollar, and certainly we’ve seen that in the price action,”
O’Connor said in a telephone interview. “But now we have these
next technical hurdles in play that I think we’ll still need to
break through to really confirm what we’re seeing.”  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, declined 0.2 percent to 84.268 today in New
York after touching 84.588. It reached a four-month low of
80.498 on June 19.  The 84.90-84.95 level is the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement from the Dollar Index’s 2010 high, according to
O’Connor. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
securities tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after
reaching a high or low.  Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
security currency or index.  The dollar surged after the Labor Department reported July
5 that U.S. payrolls added 195,000 workers in June for a second
month, spurring bets the Federal Reserve may begin dialing back
unprecedented monetary stimulus that tends to debase the
currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
