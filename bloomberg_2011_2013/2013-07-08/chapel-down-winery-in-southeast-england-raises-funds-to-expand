Chapel Down Group Plc (CDGP) , a winemaker
based in Tenterden, southeast of  London , raised 4.35 million
pounds ($6.5 million) through an institutional share placing on
the ISDX Growth Market to expand its winery and beer business.  The company owns two vineyards, one at its Tenterden
headquarters in Kent and the other at nearby Aylesford, with a
total 98 acres (40 hectares) planted.  Chapel Down makes predominantly sparkling wine from
Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes, as well as still wine, and
buys additional grapes from growers in Essex, Kent and Sussex.
The company has also added beer to its range and said in a
statement it intends to use the additional funds to plant more
vines and build a brewery.  “We want to be best placed to play a considerable role in
the potential consolidation of this industry in about two to
three years’ time,” Chapel Down Chief Executive Officer Frazer Thompson said in an investor  video  posted on its website.  The company also said John Dunsmore, formerly chief
executive officer of  C&C Group Plc (GCC) , maker of Magners cider, will
join its board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
