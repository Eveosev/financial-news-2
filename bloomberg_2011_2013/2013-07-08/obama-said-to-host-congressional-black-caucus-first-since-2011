President Barack Obama plans to meet
with the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House tomorrow
to discuss jobs and the economy, according to people familiar
with the matter.  The meeting, scheduled for the morning, will mark the first
formal gathering between Obama and the caucus since May 2011.  “The president knows many of these members but probably
could take better advantage of their policy experience and their
political contacts to help him push his second-term agenda,”
said Paul Brathwaite, a former executive director of the caucus
who helped organize a similar meeting with President  George W. Bush  in 2005.  Lawmakers, including CBC chairwoman Marcia Fudge, a
Democrat from Ohio, plan to press the president on what he’s
doing to lower black unemployment, according to one of the
people, who requested anonymity before a meeting announcement.
Black unemployment in June rose to 13.7 percent from 13.5
percent, according to the U.S. Labor Department.  While members of the caucus initially faulted Obama for not
appointing more minorities to his cabinet, they tempered their
criticism as the president filled out key posts. He has tapped
former  Charlotte  Mayor Anthony Foxx for transportation secretary
and Representative Mel Watt to lead the  Federal Housing Finance
Agency .  The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment. Obama last met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus
on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
