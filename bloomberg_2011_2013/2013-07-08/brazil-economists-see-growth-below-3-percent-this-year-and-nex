Brazil economists cut their growth
forecasts below 3 percent this year and next for the first time,
as inflation curbs purchasing power and confidence in the
world’s second-largest emerging market.  Brazil’s economy will expand 2.34 percent this year and
2.80 percent in 2014, compared with the previous week’s
forecasts of 2.40 percent and 3 percent, respectively, according
to a July 5 central bank survey of about 100 analysts published
today. It was the third straight week analysts cut growth
expectations for both years.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has pledged to
improve government services while maintaining fiscal austerity
and control of inflation, after more than a million protesters
took to the streets last month to oppose corruption and high
prices. Support for Rousseff’s government plunged by almost half
last month, according to Datafolha. The central bank this week
will increase the benchmark  interest rate  by 50 basis points to
8.50 percent, according to 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.62 percent at 9:01
local time. The real was little changed at 2.2515 per  U.S.
dollar .  Faster Inflation  Consumer prices rose 6.70  in June  from last year, the
fastest pace since October 2011, the national statistics agency
said on Friday. Central bankers, in their quarterly inflation
report released last month, said inflation will reach 6 percent
this year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 8
percent, up from a March forecast of 5.7 percent. Policy makers
target inflation at 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage
points.  Rousseff’s approval rating fell to 30 percent, down from 57
percent before protests began in early June and a high of 65
percent in March, according to a survey by Datafolha published
on June 29.  Brazil ’s industrial production in May dropped more than
forecast by 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and industry
confidence in June fell to its third-lowest level since 2009.
Gross domestic product  expanded  0.55 percent in the first
quarter, less than the 0.9 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Brazil’s gross domestic product last year expanded by 0.9
percent, the slowest pace since the economy contracted in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
