Thailand ’s baht declined to a 10-month low and government bonds fell after U.S. jobs data spurred
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will cut monetary stimulus,
reducing demand for emerging-market assets.  Global funds have  sold  $1.4 billion more Thai debt than
they bought since May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
first indicated that asset purchases could be pared if there’s a
sustained improvement in the labor market. U.S. companies took
on more workers than economists forecast last month, July 5 data
showed. The Bank of Thailand may leave its policy rate unchanged
at 2.5 percent July 10, according to 13 of 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. One predicts a 25-basis-point cut.  “It’s a reaction to the better-than-expected non-farm
payrolls and people are still withdrawing money from the
region,” said Pareena Phuangsiri, a Bangkok-based analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl. “Attention will also be on comments from the
Bank of Thailand. We expect them to stay pat because if they
move rates it will create more volatility.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 31.36 per dollar as of 9:16
a.m. in Bangkok after reaching 31.39 earlier, the weakest level
since Sept. 3, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, was little changed at 7.27 percent.  U.S. employers added 195,000 workers for the second month
in a row in June, a Labor Department report showed July 5. The
 unemployment rate  held at 7.6 percent, near a four-year low.  The yield on the 3.125 percent Thai notes due December 2015
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.93
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
