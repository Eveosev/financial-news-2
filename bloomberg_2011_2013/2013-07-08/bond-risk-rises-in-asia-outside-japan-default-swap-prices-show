The cost of insuring bonds against
non-payment in  Australia  and in Asia outside of Japan increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 157 basis
points as of 8:36 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The measure is set to rise for the first
time in three trading days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
135 as of 10:32 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The gauge, which fell 3.1 basis points last week, is on
track to close at its highest level since July 4, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index was little changed at 103.3
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. The benchmark is on track for its lowest close since July 2
after falling 6.3 basis points last week, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
