India , where flooding killed more
than 1,000 people last month, plans to increase spending on
flood forecasting and river management five-fold to 33.69
billion rupees ($555 million) over the next five years.  “We are revisiting our assessment of water resources and
basin-wise data across the nation,”  Rajesh Kumar , chairman of
the  Central Water Commission , said in an interview in New Delhi.
“Competing demands for water and climate-change concerns are
the triggers that are pushing us to improve our systems.”  The Central Water Commission, which collects India’s water
data and advises federal and state governments on dam,
irrigation and hydro projects, is investing in satellite-linked
sensors to improve flood forecasting, Kumar said. The agency
will more than double the current 445 stations that use sensors
to monitor river basins and coastal areas, Kumar said.  The commission was  criticized  for poor forecasting after
rains last month caused flash floods and landslides in the
northern Indian state of Uttarakhand that borders  China , killing
at least 1,000 people. About 10,000 more were stranded.  “ Climate-change  monitoring in the Himalayan areas and in
the northeastern states will be our priority,” Kumar said. The
agency has sought increased budgets to reassess water levels
across 20 major  river basins  in India, he said last week.  The south Asian nation that accounts for 4 percent of the
world’s water resources and 18 percent of its population needs
to update its two-decades-old hydrological data, Kumar said.
Climate change and increasing demand from people and industries
is expected to cut water availability by 28 percent in 2050 from
1,704 cubic meters in 2010, India’s farm ministry said.  In the five years that ended April 2012, India spent 6.45
billion rupees on flood forecasting and in the next five years
that end in 2017, 33.69 billion rupees in spending is planned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
