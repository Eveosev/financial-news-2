Former Zimbabwean Finance Minister
Simba Makoni said he’s backing Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai 
in his bid to defeat President  Robert Mugabe  in elections
scheduled for this month.  “The coming together of these parties has been
necessitated by shared commitment to bring to an end the current
hardships confronting Zimbabweans, due to the failed policies of
the past,” said Makoni, whose New Dawn party won 8 percent of
the vote in 2008. He spoke at a joint press conference with
Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change in
Harare, the capital.  The alliance follows a July 5 coalition between the
Zimbabwe African People’s Union, which draws its support mainly
in the western region of Matabeleland, and a separate faction of
the MDC led by Welshman Ncube.  Zimbabweans will vote in presidential and parliamentary
elections July 31 after the  Constitutional Court  turned down
applications, including one prompted by the  Southern African
Development Community , to delay the ballot.  The election will bring to an end a power-sharing agreement
brokered by SADC after the regional body said elections held in
March and June 2008 were marred by violence. That agreement made
Tsvangirai Prime Minister and allowed Mugabe to retain the
presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
