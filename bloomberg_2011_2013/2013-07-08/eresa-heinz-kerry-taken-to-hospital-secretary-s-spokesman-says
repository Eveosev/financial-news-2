(Corrects spelling of spokesman’s name in second
paragraph.)  Teresa Heinz Kerry was taken by
ambulance today to Nantucket Cottage Hospital in  Massachusetts ,
according to a spokesman for her husband, Secretary of State John Kerry.  “Once doctors had stabilized her condition, she was
transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in  Boston ,” the
spokesman, Glen Johnson, said in an e-mailed statement. He said
Secretary Kerry accompanied his wife throughout.  Johnson didn’t provide any information on her ailment or
condition, saying the family asked for privacy. The Associated
Press reported earlier that Heinz Kerry was in critical but
stable condition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
