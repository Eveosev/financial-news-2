Jones Group Inc. (JNY) , the owner of the
Jones New York and Nine West fashion brands, is weighing a sale
of all or part of the company, said people with knowledge of the
matter.  The retailer is working with  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to examine
options, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
process is confidential. If Jones doesn’t find a buyer for the
entire business, the company may sell some apparel brands, one
of the people said. DealReporter first reported the sale process
last week.  Chief Executive Officer Wesley Card has sought to turn
around New York-based Jones Group by emphasizing higher-priced
women’s apparel brands such as Rachel Roy and Stuart Weitzman,
and by reviving the Jones New York and Anne Klein department-store sportswear brands. The company, whose market value is
$1.26 billion, disclosed in April that it would shut 170 stores
and cut 8 percent of its workforce after first-quarter profit
trailed analysts’ estimates.  “Like most companies, Jones Group has ongoing
relationships with a wide range of advisers,” said Sharon Stern, a spokeswoman for Jones Group with Joele Frank Wilkinson
Brimmer Katcher. “As a matter of practice, the company does not
share the specifics of these relationships.” Robert Julavits, a
spokesman with Citigroup, declined to comment.  Jones Group shares  advanced  7.6 percent to $15.75 in New
York, the most in more than a year. The company generated more
than $1 billion in sales in the first quarter ended April 6,
according to a May 1 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
