The trial of the captain of the Costa Concordia’s cruise liner that shipwrecked off Tuscany last year
might be delayed because of a lawyers’ strike.  The trial, scheduled to begin tomorrow in Grosseto,  Italy ,
could be adjourned to July 17 if lawyers comply with a one-week
strike called by their lobby, according to a document posted on
the Grosseto court’s website.  The Costa Concordia, owned by  Carnival Corp (CCL) ’s Costa
Crociere SpA Italian unit, ran aground near the island of Giglio
hours after leaving a port close to Rome on Jan. 13, 2012,
killing 32 people. Its captain Francesco Schettino was indicted
on May 22 on charges including manslaughter and abandoning the
ship while many of the 4,200 passengers and crew were still
aboard.  Schettino, who has denied any wrongdoing, saying his
actions saved lives, faces up to 20 years in jail, according to
prosecutor Francesco Verusio.  The trial needs to ascertain the “real responsibilities,”
Schettino’s lawyer Francesco Pepe said today by phone. “The
captain certainly has his responsibilities but we want him to be
judged for them only.”  Five other defendants including Schettino’s first officer
Ciro Ambrosio, and Roberto Ferrarini, head of Costa Crociere’s
crisis unit at the time, have sought plea bargains for short
prison sentences. The Costa Concordia still lies on its side
outside Giglio harbor because a removal plan has fallen behind
schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
