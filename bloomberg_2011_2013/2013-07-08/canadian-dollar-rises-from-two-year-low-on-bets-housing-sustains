The Canadian dollar rose from its
lowest level in almost two years before a report tomorrow
forecast to show the pace of  home construction  in June stayed
above the year-to-date average for the second month in a row.  The currency strengthened against the majority of its most-traded counterparts along with those of its commodity-exporting
peers after Canadian building permits rose for a fifth straight
month. A report tomorrow will show work began on 188,000 homes
in June compared with 200,178 the month before, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 21 economists. This year  Canada  has  averaged 
179,400 new homes each month.  “The data itself is more of a reassurance of the theme of
a soft landing that we expect to see in the housing market,”
said Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion
Bank’s TD Securities, by phone from Toronto. “We’ll probably
see that filter into the housing-starts data.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, rose 0.2
percent to C$1.0559 per U.S. dollar at 10:58 a.m. in Toronto.
The loonie touched C$1.0609 per U.S. dollar July 5, the weakest
since October 2011. One loonie buys 94.71 U.S. cents.  Bonds Gain  Canada’s 10-year benchmark government  bonds  rose, with
yields falling six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
2.59 percent from 2.55 percent July 5, a two-year high. The 1.5
percent security maturing in June 2023 added 52 cents to
C$91.41.  The  Bank of Canada  will auction C$3.4 billion ($3.2
billion) of five-year notes with a coupon of 1.25 percent on
July 10.  Futures on crude oil, the nation’s largest export, fell 0.5
percent to C$102.76 per barrel and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of U.S. stocks gained 0.6 percent.  Canadian building permits’ surprise increase in May was the
fifth straight month of gains, the longest stretch in almost a
decade, led by a  jump  in multiple-unit housing work in Toronto
that has sparked warnings from policy makers about overbuilding.
The value of municipal permits rose 4.5 percent to C$7.32
billion, following a revised 11.2 percent rise in April,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  Statistics Canada  will report its home-price index data for
May July 11 while Ottawa-based Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp.
issues the housing-starts report tomorrow that is forecast to
exceed the annual average.  Housing Trend  “That would be a pretty good number,” said Don Mikolich,
executive director of foreign exchange sales in Toronto at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “A shovel in the ground for
tomorrow is probably the most important number.”  Bank of Canada officials have said there are signs of a
“constructive evolution” in household finances after a surge
in home starts and re-sales fueled by rising consumer debt.
About one in 10 Canadians households are highly indebted, with
borrowings exceeding 250 percent of gross income, the central
bank said last month.  The cost to insure against declines in the Canadian dollar
versus its U.S. peer rose for a second day from its lowest level
in two weeks. The three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal
rate reached 1.6350, after hitting 1.6125 July 4, its lowest
level since June 20. Risk reversals measure the premium on
options contracts to sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S.
contracts that do the opposite.  The Canadian dollar has risen 0.3 percent this year among
nine developed nations currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The yen has led decliners with a 9.3
percent drop and the  U.S. dollar  had biggest increase at 7.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
