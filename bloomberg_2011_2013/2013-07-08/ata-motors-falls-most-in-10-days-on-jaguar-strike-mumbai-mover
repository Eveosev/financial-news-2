  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  was poised for its
biggest decline in 10 days in Mumbai trading after its Jaguar
Land Rover Plc unit said delivery workers supplied by  Deutsche
Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL unit voted to strike over pay.  Tata Motors fell 2.7 percent to 288.20 rupees as of 2:23
p.m. in Mumbai, headed for the biggest drop since June 26.
 India ’s largest automaker has lost 7.9 percent this year, while
the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has declined 0.6 percent.  The strike at the luxury unit, which contributed 72 percent
of Tata Motors revenue in the year ended March 31, may slow the
company’s plan to revive  profit growth . Jaguar Land Rover may
consider replacing DHL as its delivery partner if the strike
continues, according to Umesh Karne, an analyst at Brics
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai.  “Deliveries may be impacted in the short-term because
logistics is a very major part of the sales,” said Karne, who
has a  buy  rating on the stock. “Jaguar Land Rover may consider
a new partner if the strike lasts longer than 15-20 days.”  Jaguar Land Rover asked the DHL staff to return to
negotiations, spokesman Ken McConomy said yesterday. The
striking workers are seeking pay similar to that of Jaguar Land
Rover employees, the Sunday Times reported.  DHL  didn’t immediately return calls to their office in
Bonn, seeking comment.  Deliveries at the luxury unit, which Tata Motors bought
from Ford Motor Co. in 2008, increased 19 percent to 116,340
vehicles in the three months ended March 31. In comparison,
sales at the local business plummeted 29 percent to 184,942
units, as customers in India held off purchases on expensive
loans and slowing economic growth.  The luxury unit based in Gaydon,  England  is turning to
 emerging markets  such as  China , Russia and South Africa to
pursue growth. Global retail sales in the year ended March 31
rose 23 percent to 374,669 vehicles, with those in China surging
73 percent to 77,075 units, according to company data. China was
the company’s largest market, it said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
