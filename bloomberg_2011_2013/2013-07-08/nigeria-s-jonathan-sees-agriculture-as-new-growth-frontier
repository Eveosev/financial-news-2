Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer,
is trying to reverse years of neglect of its farming industry
and push agriculture as its “new frontier for growth” because
it can no longer depend on oil to drive its economy.  “The transformation of agriculture in Nigeria is a
centerpiece of the economic transformation agenda of my
government,” President Goodluck Jonathan said today at a
conference in Abuja, the capital. “The recent discovery of
shale oil and gas means we can no longer depend solely on oil to
drive the economy.”  Oil has dominated the economy since the 1970s, now making
up 95 percent of export earnings and 80 percent of government
revenue. Agriculture has shrunk by more than 40 percent, making
Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160 million people
more vulnerable to oil price shocks.  The government plans to boost food supplies by 20 million
metric tons by 2015. While Nigeria grew enough food to feed
itself in the 1960s, it is now the world’s largest importer of
rice and sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest importer of wheat and
sugar.  Nigeria is targeting $10 billion of investment in farming
to boost food production by 2015, Agriculture Minister Akinwunmi Adesina said in a May 10 interview. Food production rose by
about 8 million tons in 2012, about 40 percent of a four-year
objective, according to the Agriculture Ministry.  “With abundant land and water resources, and an abundant
vibrant labor force, Nigeria has all it takes to use agriculture
as its new frontier for growth,” Jonathan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
