The Turkish lira rebounded from a
record low against dollar as the central bank offered $500
million at currency auctions and said it would start “strong”
monetary tightening.  The lira strengthened 0.8 percent to 1.9527 a dollar at
10:54 a.m. in Istanbul, paring the decline this year to 8.7
percent, the biggest depreciation among  emerging markets  in
 Europe . The currency had tumbled to as low as 1.9740 per dollar
earlier today. Yields on 10-year bonds dropped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.88 percent.  Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said “it’s essential
that extra monetary tightening be strong, effective and
temporary.” The duration will depend on developments in foreign
 currency markets , he said in an e-mailed statement today. The
central bank sold $2.9 billion of dollars since June 11,
including $250 million already auctioned today, to curb the
lira’s drop as anti-government protests roiled local markets and
 inflation  accelerated to the fastest pace since September.  “The central bank will hold aggressive foreign-exchange
sale auctions to stop the pressure on the lira,” Ali Cakiroglu,
an Istanbul-based strategist at HSBC Asset Management, wrote in
an e-mailed note.  The central bank, for the first time since June 21, didn’t
offer one-week  repurchase agreements  at its 4.5 percent policy
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
