Former National Football League
players Courtney Anderson, Larry Centers and others settled a
dispute with the organization over an arbitration decision that
bars them from seeking workers compensation in  California .  Dozens of players sued in federal court in  San Francisco 
seeking to overturn the arbitration order. The “cases fully
settled as to all plaintiffs except for plaintiff Sean Berton,”
according to a filing today after a 45-minute settlement
conference. The document didn’t provide details.  The players were required under a December arbitration
award to withdraw claims in California and banned from claiming
they are entitled to the benefits, according to the complaint
filed by Centers in February.  Greg Aiello , an NFL spokesman, had no immediate comment.
Margaret Prinzing and Roy LaFrancis, attorneys for the ex-players, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking
comment on today’s filing.  The cases are Centers v. National Football League
Management Council, 13-00882, and Anderson v. National Football
League Management Council, 12-06386, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
