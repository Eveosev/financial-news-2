Writers find inspiration in all places, and Norman Mailer found his inspiration in two: one, a loft-like, book-filled apartment in Brooklyn, and the second, a charming beachfront home in Provincetown, MA. Mailer and his sixth wife, artist Norris Church Mailer, purchased  627 Commercial St, Provincetown, MA 02657  in the mid-’80s to be a retreat for the family. Situated above the beach with views of Provincetown Harbor and Long Point, the shingled home held both an artist’s studio and writer’s nook in the attic rooms. It was here that both Mailers painted and wrote, respectively, as well as hosted weddings, reunions and vacations. Norman Mailer passed away in 2007, and his wife died in 2010. While there were attempts for a nonprofit to take over the residence, funds weren’t raised, and the Mailer family made the decision to sell the property. It’s now listed with  real estate agent Rose Kennedy  of Kinlin Grover Real Estate for $3.9 million. Son Michael Mailer  told The Cape Cod Times  he would ”like to see a big family move in there and make use of it. It’s sad, but it’s time. We have all moved on with our lives.” The Mailer home sprawls across 5,800 square feet with 5 bedrooms and 5 baths. The 1930-built home also has a 100-foot deck and access to the beach.
