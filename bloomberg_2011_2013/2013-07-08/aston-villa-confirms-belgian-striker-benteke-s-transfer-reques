Aston Villa said striker Christian Benteke has asked to leave.  The Belgian forward was Villa’s top scorer with 19 goals
last season. The annoucement follows speculation in U.K. media
that Chelsea is interested in recruiting the 22-year-old.  “Having received his transfer request, we have also
informed him that should we receive an offer within an
appropriate timeframe during pre-season which meets our
valuation we would act upon it,” Villa said in an e-mailed
statement. “But he will remain a Villa player should this not
happen.”  Benteke joined Villa from Genk in August 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
