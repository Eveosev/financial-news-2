Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, named former Ernst & Young LLP Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer James S. Turley and private-equity
executive Gary Reiner to the board of directors.  Turley and Reiner, an operating partner at General Atlantic
LLC, will also join the board of banking subsidiary Citibank NA,
the New York-based lender said today in a statement. Turley, 57,
will join the board’s audit committee, according to the
statement.  The appointments bring the number of directors to 13, the
minimum suggested in the firm’s corporate-governance guidelines.
Lawrence Ricciardi, who held executive roles at International
Business Machines Corp and RJR Nabisco Inc., retired from
Citigroup’s board in April after reaching the retirement age of
72, according to a March proxy filing. Alain Belda, the former
chairman and CEO of Alcoa Inc., and  Richard Parsons , Time Warner
Inc.’s former chairman and CEO, retired in April 2012.  “Both of these new directors will bring considerable
insight to the board as Citi continues to leverage its unmatched
global strengths,” Chairman  Michael O’Neill , 66, said in the
statement.  Turley joined Ernst & Young in 1977 and led the firm from
2001 until his recent retirement, according to the statement.  Reiner, 58, became operating partner at General Atlantic in
2010 and was previously senior vice president and chief
information officer of General Electric Co., according to the
statement. He also serves on the board of  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
