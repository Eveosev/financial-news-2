TPG Capital, the private-equity firm
started by  David Bonderman  and  Jim Coulter , is close to an
agreement to buy pharmacy-benefits manager Envision
Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc., according to a person with direct
knowledge of the transaction. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal may be announced as early as today, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the agreement
isn’t final. Envision, founded in 2001, has annual revenue of
more than $3.5 billion.  Pharmacy-benefits managers, known as PBMs, process
prescription-drug claims for health-plan customers and negotiate
discounts and rebates with drugmakers. The industry is
consolidating as PBMs compete to cut costs for their corporate
and government clients. Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest
U.S. PBM, bought Medco Health Solutions Inc. last year for $29.1
billion, which was followed by SXC Health Solutions Corp.’s $4.4
billion acquisition of Catalyst Health Solutions Inc.  Members of Envision’s management plan to keep a minority
stake in the Twinsburg, Ohio-based company, while founders James
Mindala, Kevin Nagle and Barry Katz will continue to run the
business, the person said.  Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for TPG at Owen Blicksilver
Public Relations Inc., declined to comment, as did Josh Paulen,
an Envision spokesman.  TPG, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, has announced deals valued
at about $5.3 billion in the past 12 months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That includes the $1.9 billion buyout of
Par Pharmaceutical Cos., a maker of generic drugs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
