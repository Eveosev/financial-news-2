Washington Post Co. (WPO)  said it will
invest in FaithStreet.com, a website that lets users find nearby
churches, providing an outlet for its On Faith site.  FaithStreet will publish the Washington-based company’s On
Faith blog on spirituality, according to a statement today that
didn’t give an investment amount. Sally Quinn will remain
founding editor of On Faith. Quinn is the wife of former
Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee.  “After six and a half years, we have found the perfect
partner for On Faith,” Quinn said in the statement. “The
founders of FaithStreet have exactly the same vision for the
expansion of On Faith that we have.”  Washington Post has been making investments outside media.
In October, the company agreed to acquire a majority interest in
Celtic Healthcare Inc., a provider of home-care and hospice
services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
