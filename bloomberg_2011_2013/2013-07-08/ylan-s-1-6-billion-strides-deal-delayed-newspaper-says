Mylan Inc. (MYL) ’s $1.6 billion acquisition
of a  Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR)  unit has been put on hold as Indian
regulators raise concern about foreign ownership of companies
that make cancer drugs, the Economic Times reported.  India ’s Foreign Investment Promotion Board deferred a
decision on the acquisition July 8, the newspaper said in a
 story  today on its website. Regulators worry Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based Mylan may steer oncology treatments made in
India to the U.S. market, making them less available at home,
the newspaper reported.  “We remain confident in our ability to complete the
transaction in the fourth quarter of this year,”  Nina Devlin , a
Mylan spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. She didn’t address a
question asking if the Economic Times report was accurate.  Mylan, the second-biggest company focused on generic drugs,
announced its purchase in February of Bangalore-based Strides’
Agila Specialties, which makes injectable cancer medicines.
While the deal probably will still go through, it may be
postponed and Mylan may need to offer other assurances, Douglas Tsao, a New York-based Barclays analyst told clients in a
research report.  “The deal could be delayed a few months past its expected
4Q close with Mylan ultimately needing to grant concessions
regarding supplying certain types of drugs and certain prices,”
Tsao said in the note today.  Mylan rose less than 1 percent to $30.90 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
