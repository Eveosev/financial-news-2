A group of 70 retailers, including
 Inditex SA (ITX)  and  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , and trade unions have agreed
to inspect their factories in Bangladesh within nine months as
part of a fire and building safety accord set up after the worst
industrial accident in the country’s history.  The implementation of the five-year agreement involves
comprehensive inspections to identify “grave hazards and need
for urgent repairs,” IndustriALL Global Union said in a
statement on its website. The deal will cover all factories
producing for the brands that have signed the agreement, opening
them all up for safety inspections and further measures.  “This historic, legally-binding accord will effect
tangible change on the ground and help make the Bangladeshi
garment industry safe and sustainable,” the organization’s
general secretary Jyrki Raina said in the statement.  During the past seven years, 1,800 Bangladeshi garment
workers have died in factory fires and building collapses,
according to IndustriALL. The Bangladeshi safety agreement was
first announced in May after the collapse of the Rana Plaza
factory in  Bangladesh  in April.  The organization has also commenced the hiring process for
the chief safety inspector and executive director positions,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
