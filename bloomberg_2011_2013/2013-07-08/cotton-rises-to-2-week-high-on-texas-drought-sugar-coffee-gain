Cotton futures rose to a two-week
high as dry weather compounds drought conditions in  Texas , the
largest grower in the U.S. Sugar, coffee and orange juice also
advanced, while cocoa fell.  West Texas, the biggest cotton-growing region, will be
hotter and drier than normal for the next two weeks, with
temperatures as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) on
July 12, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland . The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on June 12 cut its
domestic crop forecast by 3.6 percent to 13.5 million bales,
citing wider damage from a drought in Texas.  “Rain is elusive across areas of the Southwest,” where
soil moisture has evaporated,  Sharon Johnson , a senior market
specialist at Knight Futures in Roswell,  Georgia , said today in
an e-mailed report. “The U.S. crop will likely be smaller than
June projections by several hundred thousand bales, if not
closer to 1 million bales, unless Southwest precipitation
immediately improves, and by a considerable amount, the next
several weeks.”  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to 85.1 cents
a pound at 11:52 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after
touching 85.95 cents, the highest for a most-active contract
since June 20.  The USDA predicted last month that output would tumble 22
percent in 2014, compared with a year earlier. The U.S. is the
world’s largest exporter of the fiber. A bale weighs 480 pounds,
or 218 kilograms.  Sugar, Coffee  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to
16.31 cents a pound on ICE, heading for the first gain in eight
sessions. Earlier, the price touched 16.24 cents, the lowest for
a most-active contract since July 2, 2010. Last week, the
sweetener declined 3.9 percent.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery advanced 1.9
percent to $1.2355 a pound, heading for the biggest gain since
July 2.  Orange-juice  futures for September delivery were up 0.3
percent to $1.344 a pound, fluctuating between gains and losses,
after rallying in the previous six sessions.  Cocoa futures for September delivery dropped 1.3 percent to
$2,176 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
