Democratic Republic  of Congo Prime
Minister Matata Ponyo said the government has lowered its
inflation forecast for 2013, a goal it should achieve as long as
the state continues its record on managing the economy.  The inflation target was lowered to less than 1 percent by
the end of the year from 4 percent, Ponyo said, according to a
broadcast by Radio Okapi on July 6. The average inflation rate
in the first half of 2013 registered 0.4 percent, he said.  “If the same rigor continues, if the same governance
continues, we’ll have an inflation rate of less than 1 percent
at the end of December 2013,” Ponyo said.  The economy of Congo, the world’s 10th-largest producer of
copper, is expected to grow 8.2 percent this year from 7.2
percent last year, he said. The outlook is clouded by the
diversion of resources from investment projects to the state-security budget to fight rebels in the east, he said.  The  International Monetary Fund  projects the economy will
grow 8.3 percent this year while inflation will accelerate to
6.8 percent, according to its website. Congo adopted a new
calculation method for the consumer-price index last year.  The conflict began in eastern Congo in the aftermath of
neighboring  Rwanda ’s genocide in the mid-1990s. After a series
of wars officially ended in 2003, armed groups continued to
fight in the resource-rich region.  Congo is  ranked  160 out of 176 nations on Transparency
International’s index of perceptions of corruption in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
