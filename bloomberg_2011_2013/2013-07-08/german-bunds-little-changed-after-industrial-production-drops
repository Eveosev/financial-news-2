German 10-year  government bonds  were
little changed after a report showed  industrial production  in
Europeâ€™s largest economy contracted more than economists
predicted in May.  The yield on the bund was at 1.72 percent as of 11:03 a.m.
London time. Two-year yields were at 0.10 percent.  Production fell 1 percent from April, when it gained a
revised 2 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today.
Economists forecast a drop of 0.5 percent, according to the
median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
