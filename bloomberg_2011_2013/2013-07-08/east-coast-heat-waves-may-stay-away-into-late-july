There probably won’t be another round
of heat waves in the eastern U.S. and  Canada  for the next two
weeks, keeping spikes in energy demand to a minimum, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The Northeast may see temperatures 3 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 Celsius) above normal from today until July 22, while most
of the East stays seasonal, said Rogers, in Bethesda, Maryland.  The West may experience temperatures 3 to 5 degrees higher
than normal. That heat may seep into the Midwest from July 18 to
22, he said.  “Outside of some semi-persistent heat in the interior
West, the outlook for the rest of the U.S. and southern Canada
continues to look variable enough to prevent any sustained
strong heat patterns from dominating,” Rogers said.  High temperatures in the big cities of the East and Midwest
can push up natural gas demand as more people turn to air
conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  Yesterday’s high temperature in New York’s Central Park was
92, capping three days above 90, according to the  National
Weather Service  in Upton, New York. Three days of 90 or higher
is considered a heat wave by the weather service.  Consolidated Edison Co. (ED) , which provides electricity to
about 3 million customers in New York and Westchester County,
saw an all-time high for Sunday electricity use yesterday at 6
p.m., according to a company statement. The region used 11,241
megawatts, breaking the old mark of 10,866 megawatts set on Aug.
14, 2005.  The normal average reading for July 22 in  New York City  is
about 77 degrees, according to the weather service. In Boston,
it’s 74; Washington, 80; Chicago, 74;  Los Angeles , 79; and in
Houston, 85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
