Evotec AG (EVT)  rose the most in almost two
weeks after saying it received a payment of 1.5 million euros
($1.93 million) for achieving a research milestone under an
agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.  Evotec  increased  as much as 5.3 percent to 2.62 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since June 25, and was trading 3 percent
higher at 1:49 p.m. in  Frankfurt , giving the Hamburg-based
company a market value of 303.8 million euros.  A pain treatment that Evotec is working on for Boehringer
Ingelheim has reached the preclinical development phase, the
company said today in a statement. The milestone, reached in
June, represents an “important transition,” Chief Operating
Officer Mario Polywka said today in a statement.  Evotec has had a drug-discovery alliance with  Boehringer
Ingelheim  since 2004 and has produced 18 milestones so far, it
said today. The company has shifted its business focus to very
early-stage development, shuttling prospective treatments from
academic research to pharmaceutical companies, and drug-development services, away from finding and marketing its own
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
