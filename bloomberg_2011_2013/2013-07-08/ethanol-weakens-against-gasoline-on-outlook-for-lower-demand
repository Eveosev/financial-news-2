Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed as the motor fuel declined and amid speculation that
lower production rates will make it difficult to replenish
inventories of the additive.  The spread, or price difference, between the fuels shrank
by 3.11 cents to 47.37 cents a gallon as of 4:20 p.m.  New York 
time. Ethanol  output  last week fell 2.5 percent to 863,000
barrels a day, a five-week low, and inventories sank 5.2 percent
to 15.4 million barrels, the smallest stockpile in records going
back three years, Energy Information Administration data show.  “Stocks are way down and production is kind of range-bound
here and not shooting up,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten
Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 1.8 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.41 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 10 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery fell 1.31 cents to $2.8837 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Prices for the motor fuel dropped as crude oil declined
from a 14-month high as operations on the  Suez Canal  were
reported to be normal at a time of turmoil in  Egypt .  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. Last summer’s drought
eroded crops, pushed up costs to make the biofuel and depleted
stockpiles.  Corn Prices  Corn for September delivery climbed 7.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $5.3325 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol, based on September contracts for the fuel and
grain, was 32 cents, down from 33 cents on July 5, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Compliance with U.S. mandates to blend ethanol into
gasoline is tracked with certificates known as Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, that are attached to each
gallon of biofuel. Refiners can submit them to the government or
trade them.  Corn-based RINs rose 2 cents to $1.04, while  advanced RINs 
climbed 2 cents to $1.10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Babler said prices for the additive also gained after EIA
data showed no U.S. imports of the biofuel in the week ended
June 28, compared with 38,000 barrels a day the previous week.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 4 cents to $2.545 a
gallon in New York, 2.5 cents to $2.465 in  Chicago , 3 cents to
$2.50 on the  Gulf Coast  and $1.5 cents to $2.645 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
