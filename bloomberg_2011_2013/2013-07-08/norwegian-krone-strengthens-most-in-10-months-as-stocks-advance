Norway’s krone advanced by the most
in 10 months against the dollar as higher stocks in  Europe 
boosted demand for the currency amid bets its slide to an almost
three-year low was excessive.  The krone appreciated the most against the dollar among the
greenback’s 16 major counterparts. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 1.4 percent, giving investors the confidence to buy higher-yielding assets. The krone surged more than 1 percent against
the Swedish krona after a report showed  Sweden ’s manufacturing
slump deepened.  “The selling of the krone has been overdone, so in the
near term and next three months we expect a correction toward
more moderate levels,” said Ole Kjennerud, an economist at  DNB
ASA (DNB)  in Oslo. “It’s going to be volatile over the next week, but
the movement should go toward somewhat stronger krone.”  Norway’s currency climbed 1.8 percent to 6.1417 per dollar
at 4:35 p.m. London time, the biggest gain since Sept. 7. It
earlier depreciated to 6.2720 per dollar, the weakest since
Sept. 1, 2010. The krone gained 1.4 percent to 7.9063 per euro.  Sweden’s krona rose 0.4 percent to 6.7768 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
