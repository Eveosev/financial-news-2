Ewen McKenzie will be named as the
new Wallabies rugby coach tomorrow after the Australian Rugby
Union released Robbie Deans from his two-year contract six
months early, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  McKenzie, the director of coaching at the Queensland Reds
Super Rugby team, saw off the challenge of ACT Brumbies coach
Jake White for the national job, the newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Deans, a New Zealander who has coached  Australia  since 2008
with a 58 percent winning ratio, was informed of the decision by
ARU Chief Executive Officer Bill Pulver in Sydney today, the
newspaper added. The Wallabies lost to the British and Irish
Lions in their series decider two days ago.  Australia’s next Test match is against the All Blacks in
Sydney on Aug. 17 in the opening match of the southern
hemisphere’s Rugby Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
