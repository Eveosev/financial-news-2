(Corrects story published on July 8 to note in 28th
paragraph that the Philadelphia Orchestra music director in 2010
was Charles Dutoit. Adds spokesman comment in 29th paragraph.)  Reynold Levy made about $7,000 each
weekday as president of  Lincoln Center  for the  Performing Arts .  Glenn Lowry , director of the Museum of  Modern Art , earned
about the same, $1.8 million in 2011.  The senior  Carnegie Hall  stagehand’s reward for moving a
piano: that’s anyone’s guess, but his annual pay was $465,000.  As the pillars of New York culture attempted to rebound
from the financial crisis in 2011, so did compensation at the
top.  The city’s largest museums and performing-arts
organizations paid at least eight people more than $1 million
including retirement and other benefits, according to recently
released tax returns. (Not all 2012 returns were available.)  “The recession made good arts managers an even more
valuable commodity,” said  Melissa Berman , president of
 Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors , which advises donors. “I’m
not surprised that pay has begun to recover.”  Managing the arts became more difficult, Berman said, as
government and corporate funding dwindled and many individuals
emphasized causes they deem more immediate, such as hunger.  Levy has overseen more than $1 billion of fundraising and
the widely praised redevelopment of the Upper West Side campus,
which includes Lincoln Center Theater, the  Metropolitan Opera 
and  New York Philharmonic .  Levy, who is retiring at the end of this year, arrived at
Lincoln Center in 2002 after running the  International Rescue
Committee , which responds to humanitarian crises.  Surprise Successor  His successor, a surprise appointment to most arts
observers, is Jed Bernstein, a Broadway producer and former head
of what’s now the Broadway League, a trade association.
Bernstein is also producing director of the Bucks County
Playhouse, a 439-seat theater in eastern Pennsylvania.  “I’m declining to comment on Jed’s salary,” spokeswoman
Betsy Vorce said. Bernstein replaces Levy in January 2014.  While Lowry’s compensation increased by about 17 percent in
2011, it was below his almost $2 million in 2007-08. In the year
ending in June 2012, the midtown museum had its second-highest
attendance, 3.1 million visitors, lured by retrospectives of
Willem de Kooning and  Cindy Sherman .  Lowry’s pay exceeded that of  Thomas Campbell , who was named
to the position of Met director in September 2008 and earned
$1.1 million.  Outside Work  Ellen Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural
History, and  Metropolitan Museum  of Art President Emily Rafferty
were close behind Lowry, thanks to moonlighting and onetime
payouts.  Futter made $1.1 million, up about 6 percent, which she
supplemented with $449,000 for outside work as a corporate
director of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED)   Rafferty received $1.6 million: base pay of $656,000 and
the cash value of her pension after 35 years with the museum,
said a spokesman,  Harold Holzer .  The Other Met  Across Central Park, the Metropolitan Opera paid $1.5
million to music director  James Levine , who conducted 23
performances in the first five months of 2011. An injury then
kept him home, though he returned this May to conduct the Met
orchestra in a concert at Carnegie Hall.  Like most top sticks, Levine always enjoyed other gigs and
received $1.2 million for conducting the Boston Symphony in
2010, before resigning in September 2011.  Met Opera General Manager  Peter Gelb  made $1.4 million,
little changed from a year earlier. He now runs the only
fulltime opera company in this metropolis.  Its former neighbor at Lincoln Center, the New York City
Opera, now vagabonds among scattered venues, its once-robust
staffing and performance numbers a distant memory of greater
times. For the 2011-2012 season, ticket sales plunged by nearly
two-thirds to $1.1 million.  The company paid almost $1 of every $3 in ticket sales to
its general manager and artistic director,  George Steel , who
earned $340,000. He took a 10 percent compensation cut as the
opera’s expenses were halved.  Those Stagehands  The New York Philharmonic hasn’t yet filed its return
detailing 2011 pay, but awarded music director Alan Gilbert $1.6
million in 2010. Gilbert has shown a dramatic side with his
inventive semi-stagings of opera, most recently of
Dallapiccola’s “The Prisoner.” Perhaps he could step next door
to the Met and fill in for Levine?  At Carnegie Hall, Clive Gillinson, the executive and
artistic director, got $1.1 million in 2011, up 6 percent.  Dennis O’Connell, the prop manager, earned about $465,000.
He was the best-paid of the five-member stage crew, all of whom
pile up overtime.  In a sign that no one is immune from hard times, even the
stagehands haven’t entirely recovered. O’Connell’s pay was down
14 percent from 2007-2008, when he made $530,000.  Many Millions  Elsewhere in the nation, the top titans are not suffering.  Michael Kaiser, who resigns next year as president of the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, earned $1.4
million in 2010. He will continue dispensing advice around the
globe as leader of the center’s arts-management arm (though
things did not work out for one advisee, the New York City
Opera).  In Philadelphia: The fabulous Philadelphians, the first
major U.S. orchestra that spent an embarrassing residency in
Chapter 11, paid its president, Allison Vulgamore, $768,000 in
2010. The music director at the time, Charles Dutoit, earned
$1.5 million.  A spokesman, Katherine Blodgett, declined to disclose the
pay of its current chief conductor, Yannick Nezet-Seguin. She
said Vulgamore’s compensation included one-time payments related
to relocating from Atlanta (where the reward for running that
symphony topped $500,000).  In Chicago: Douglas Druick earned $415,000 for his first
half-year as director and president of the Art Institute of
Chicago. At the symphony, President Deborah Rutter made
$577,000. The senior Italian legend and music director, Riccardo
Muti, earned $1.2 million.  Renee Fleming  Over at the Lyric Opera, many are at work stirring the
creative pot. Sir  Andrew Davis , the music director, earned
$884,000 in 2011. General director Anthony Freud pocketed
$429,000 (including a $200,000 signing bonus for leaving the
Houston Grand Opera). Obviously, this sum does not represent his
full salary since Freud was still part-time for some of that
year. Creative consultant Renee Fleming received $497,000 for
sprinkling inspirational diva dust amongst the company in
various forums.  In Los Angeles: James Cuno, president and chief executive
of the J. Paul Getty Trust earned $1.1 million in 2012. The Los
Angeles County Museum of Art paid Chief Executive Michael Govan
$1.3 million. He has recently presented plans to blow up much of
his campus for a new look by Swiss ascetic Peter Zumthor.  Over at the smaller Museum of Contemporary Art,  Los
Angeles , director Jeffrey Deitch, who has had to battle an
uprising among his board, earned $916,000.  Dudamel, Borda  A short walk north, Gustavo Dudamel, the Venezuelan dynamo
who may eventually take over the Berlin Philharmonic, earned
just shy of $1 million in 2010 at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  Deborah Borda, the executive who discovered him and
transformed Walt Disney Concert Hall into a destination after
opening the Frank Gehry palace 10 years ago, earned $1.6
million.  But the top baton lives in San Francisco: Michael Tilson
Thomas, who earned $2.4 million as the symphony’s music director
in 2010, while also busy in other venues, like Miami.  His neighbor next door, opera manager David Gockley,
pulled in about as much as Gelb: $1.5 million for staging about
a third of the number of productions produced by the Met.  In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Michael Simpson
said Gockley’s pay included a $1 million bonus for luring him
from the Houston Grand Opera in 2005 and to compensate for
retirement benefits he forfeited.  After more than 30 years at Houston’s helm, he may also
have been ready for a change of scenery. Gockley turns 70 this
week.  Muse highlights include  John Mariani  on wine,  James S.
Russell  on architecture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
