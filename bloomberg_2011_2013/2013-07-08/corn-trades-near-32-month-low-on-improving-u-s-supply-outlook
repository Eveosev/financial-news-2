Wheat advanced on speculation that
this year’s 15 percent slump may lure importers after rains
delayed the harvest in the U.S., the world’s largest shipper.  Exporters in the U.S. sold 120,000 metric tons of soft red
winter wheat to  China  for delivery in the 12 months that end May
31, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said July 5. The agency
also announced a sale of 360,000 tons to China on July 3. About
43 percent of the winter-wheat crop was harvested as of June 30,
down from 73 percent a year earlier, and an average of 52
percent in the previous five years, the USDA said July 1. The
agency will update its weekly crop progress report today.  “Rains had delayed harvesting of winter wheat,” said
Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in  Singapore .
“This has an implication on the minor soybean crop that can be
immediately planted after the harvesting of winter-wheat.”  Wheat for September delivery gained 0.3 percent to $6.6175
a bushel by 6:24 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures
traded on volume that was 65 percent below the average for the
past 100 days for that time of day, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In Paris, milling wheat for November delivery fell
0.6 percent to 193.50 euros ($248.55) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$12.355 a bushel in Chicago. Corn for December delivery gained
0.6 percent to $4.94 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
