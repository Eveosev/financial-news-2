An air taxi that crashed at an  Alaska 
airport killed all 10 people aboard, the  Associated Press  said.  Nine passengers and the pilot died when the de Havilland
DHC-3 Otter crashed in Soldotna, about 75 miles southwest of
Anchorage, the AP reported, citing Clint Johnson, an
investigator with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.  The plane crashed at 11:20 a.m. local time yesterday, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement, without mentioning
casualties. Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the safety board,
couldn’t immediately be reached by phone.  The  agency  is dispatching a team to investigate the crash,
it said in the statement. The accident comes a day after a
Boeing Co. 777 jetliner operated by Asiana Airlines Inc. crashed
at San Francisco International Airport, killing two passengers
and injuring scores of others.  The aircraft was operated by Rediske Air, based in Nikiski,
Alaska, the AP said, citing the  Federal Aviation Administration .
The aircraft was engulfed in flames before firefighters could
reach it, the report said, citing an Alaska State Troopers
spokeswoman who couldn’t immediately be reached by phone.  The victims haven’t been identified, the AP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
