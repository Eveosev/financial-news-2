numbers this quarter, earnings growth globally should be
decent.”  The number of shares trading hands on FTSE 100-listed
companies was 18 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Earnings Valuations  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  is trading at 11.95 times projected earnings,
