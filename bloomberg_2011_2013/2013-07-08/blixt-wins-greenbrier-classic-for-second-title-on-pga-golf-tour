Jonas Blixt overcame a four-shot
final-round deficit to win the rain-delayed Greenbrier Classic
for his second title on golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour .  Blixt, a 29-year-old Swede, shot a 3-under-par 67 yesterday
at The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs,  West Virginia ,
finishing his rain-delayed round as darkness fell for a four-round total of 13-under-par 267.  Blixt received $1.13 million for the victory, which came
nine months after his win at the Frys.com Open.  Steven Bowditch, Matt Jones, Johnson Wagner and Jimmy
Walker tied for second at 11 under. Wagner, who led by two
strokes after three rounds, shot a final-round 73 and bogeyed
three of his final eight holes.  The PGA Tour now moves to the TPC Deere Run in Silvis,
 Illinois , for the John Deere Classic, the last event before the
British Open. The third of golf’s four annual major
championships is scheduled for July 18-21 at Muirfield Golf Club
near Edinburgh.  On the European Tour, Graeme McDowell won the Open de
 France  by four shots, shooting a final-round 4-under-par 67 at
Le Golf National in Paris to finish 9 under.  McDowell, who picked up 500,000 euros ($641,000) for the
victory, has won three of his past eight events dating back to
the PGA Tour’s RBC Heritage in April. The Northern Irishman also
missed five cuts for weekend play in that span.  To contact the reporter on this story:
