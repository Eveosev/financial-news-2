Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA,
Brazil’s biggest airline, rose the most in two weeks after
 Standard & Poor’s  took it off review for a possible credit
rating cut, saying  cash flow  will gradually improve this year.  Shares  gained  5.2 percent to 6.46 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day climb since June 25.
It was the best performer on the  Ibovespa (IBOV)  stock benchmark, which
dropped 0.3 percent.  S&P, which in August 2012 put Gol’s credit grade under
review for a possible reduction, affirmed the rating at B, five
levels below investment grade, according to a statement
distributed after the close of trading July 5. The move comes as
Gol is reducing domestic flights and cutting costs after posting
losses in seven of the past eight quarters.  “We believe domestic demand fundamentals remain positive
over the longer term, including favorable demographics and
improving income and employment levels in  Brazil ,” S&P analysts
led by Rafaela Vitoria wrote in the report. Improvements the
company is making should help lower the Sao Paulo-based
airline’s net-debt ratio to about 9 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, and
5.5 times in 2014, the analysts wrote.  Gol said on June 24 that it plans to cut domestic flights
by as much as 9 percent in 2013 to meet this year’s target for
an operating margin ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent. The
airline is expected to post Ebitda of 639.4 million reais
($282.4 million) this year, according to the average estimate of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, after a loss of 386 million
reais in 2012.  The air carrier’s shares have declined 50 percent this year
while the Ibovespa dropped 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
