A soccer referee was stoned to death
and quartered by an angry mob after stabbing and killing a
player in  Brazil , according to authorities.
　　The incident, on June 30, started when referee Otavio Jordao
da Silva, 20, sent off Josenir Abreu during an amateur game in
the state of Maranhao. They began to fight, and Silva stabbed
Abreu in the chest with a knife, the office for public
safety in Maranhao in northeastern Brazil, said in a statement.
　　Abreu’s friends and family rushed onto the field and “stoned
the referee to death and quartered his body,” according to the
statement, issued July 3. One man has been arrested and other
suspects have been identified, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
