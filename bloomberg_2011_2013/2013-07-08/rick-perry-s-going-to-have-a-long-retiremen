Soon-to-be-former Texas Governor Rick Perry's second act on the national stage will probably be a flop, given that he abandoned his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination last year after he bombed in the early contests following a series of gaffes. In  announcing today  that he wouldn't seek a fourth term as governor next year, Perry wouldn't rule out another presidential run in 2016. His supporters excuse away his performance in the 2012 race, saying he entered late, with little time to prepare. They say he would be more ready next time and, as always, could tap into a huge reservoir of campaign contributions. Still, the gaffes that became staples of late-night comedians -- he  once forgot  which three federal agencies he wanted to eliminate -- continue to resonate. Lots of failed presidential candidates have made successful subsequent runs for the nomination: Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole and Al Gore.  None, however, recovered from an exit as  embarrassing  as Perry's.  Moreover, even many movement conservatives no longer see him as their favorite Texas Republican; the longtime governor has been eclipsed by the conservative freshman Republican senator, Ted Cruz, who also is eyeing a presidential run.
