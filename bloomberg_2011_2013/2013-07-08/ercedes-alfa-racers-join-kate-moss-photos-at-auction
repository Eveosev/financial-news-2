A 1935 Alfa Romeo Grand Prix car driven by the racing star Tazio Nuvolari is estimated to raise as much as $10 million at a U.K. auction in September.  The supercharged 8C-35 was part of the “Scuderia  Ferrari (F) ,” a team founded by Enzo Ferrari that built and raced cars under the Alfa name from 1929 to 1939.  Bearing the Ferrari “prancing horse” logo on the hood, the plum-red racer has an estimate of 5.5 million pounds ($8.2 million) to about 6.5 million pounds in a Bonhams auction at the Goodwood Revival meeting in Sussex on Sept. 14.  “This is very special car,” said Angela Cherrett, a U.K. author of two books on classic Alfa Romeos. “I don’t think anyone else has got one with this history.”  The well-preserved Alfa competed in eight Grand Prix races before being driven to victory by Nuvolari in the 1936 Coppa Ciano in  Italy , Bonhams said in an e-mail.  Though single-seat racers are often deemed less desirable than two- and four-seat cars, certain historic models are prized by wealthy enthusiasts, dealers said.  The U.K.-based collector Anthony Mayman paid $2.85 million for the “Scuderia Ferrari” Alfa at a Bonhams auction in  Monaco  in 1989 -- at that time, an auction record for a Grand Prix car. It has since been raced by two further owners.  Bonhams will also auction a 1954 silver Mercedes W196 that the five-times world champion Juan Manuel Fangio drove to two Grand Prix victories. Owned by the emir of Qatar, it will be valued at 6 million pounds to 10 million pounds in the 20th-anniversary “Festival of Speed” auction at Goodwood on July 12.  Kate Moss  The U.K.-born model  Kate Moss  will be the subject of an entire auction for the first time.  Christie’s International will be selling more than 50 artworks of Moss in various media in  London  on Sept. 25.  Photographs, many in large formats, will predominate. The event, curated by the German collector Gert Elfering, is estimated to raise about 1 million pounds.  Featured artists will include Irving Penn, Mario Testino and  Annie Leibovitz . The Allen Jones 2013 dye-destruction print, “Kate Moss (Bronze Glitter),” is estimated to sell for between 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds. Jones, a veteran U.K. Pop artist best known for his 1969 suite of mannequin furniture, will be producing a specially commissioned painting and sculpture for the auction.  Warhol Silkscreen  An Andy Warhol silkscreen painting priced at 500,000 euros ($643,000) was among the most expensive confirmed sales at last week’s Masterpiece fair in London.  The 1974 Warhol portrait of Cardi Smith, wife of the art collector Hans Smith, was sold by  Dickinson , one of more than 160 dealers exhibiting in the fourth edition of the fair in Chelsea district of the U.K. capital.  About 34,000 visitors attended, a 20 percent increase on last year. Sarah Jessica Parker and  Anna Wintour  were among the celebrities spotted, the organizers said in a statement.  Though the event bills itself as the London version of Tefaf Maastricht,  Masterpiece  attracts fewer top-rank art dealers than Frieze Masters in October. It combines fine art, antiques and jewelry with luxury brands such as Maserati cars and  Vacheron Constantin  watches.  “Masterpiece touches an audience that doesn’t go to other fairs,” the London-based art adviser Tania Buckrell Pos said. “It’s more lifestyle-orientated and fun. Though it doesn’t have the finest examples by artists, I’m always successful finding nice things for clients.”  Jewelry dealers attracted some of the biggest spending. London-based  Symbolic & Chase  sold seven pieces, including a pair of pink sapphire and diamond fan earrings by the contemporary designer Sabba priced at about 250,000 pounds.  Muse highlights include  Warwick Thompson  on U.K. theater,  Jorg von Uthmann  on Paris arts and  Jeffrey Burke  on books.
