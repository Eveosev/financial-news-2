West Texas Intermediate crude may
fall below $100 a barrel after rising to a 14-month high,
according to a  technical analysis  by  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.  The 14-day relative-strength index of front-month oil
futures in  New York  topped 70 on July 5 for the first time since
Feb. 1 as prices advanced 6.9 percent last week, a sign that the
futures are poised to fall, Flynn said. WTI jumped 10 percent
from June 21 through July 5, up in eight of the nine trading
days.  “We have a minor bubble going on,” Flynn said.
“Technically speaking, we are overbought. We should get back
below $100 to the old trading range, from $90 to $100.”  WTI for August delivery rose $1.98, or 2 percent, to
$103.22 a barrel on July 5 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Front-month futures traded between $90 and $100 from April 25 to
July 2.  RSI readings above 70 suggest prices may decrease, while
figures below 30 could be buy signals. The RSI reached its high
for the year of 74.47 on Jan. 30, when crude settled at $97.94 a
barrel. The price subsequently tumbled 8 percent to $90.12 on
March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
