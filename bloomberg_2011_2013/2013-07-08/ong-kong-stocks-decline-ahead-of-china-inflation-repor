Hong Kong  stocks  fell for the first
time in three days, led by property developers, ahead of the
release of China’s inflation data tomorrow.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 1.9 percent to 20,463 as of 9:31
a.m. in Hong Kong, with all stocks on the 50-member gauge
declining. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , down more than
20 percent from the year’s high, retreated 2.5 percent to
8,975.09.  The  Hang Seng Index  last month posted its biggest quarterly
decline since 2011 as China’s money-market rates surged to
record amid and after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said policy makers may start tapering stimulus if the  U.S.
economy  shows sustained improvement.  China’s statistics bureau is scheduled to release June data
on inflation tomorrow. Consumer prices probably rose 2.5 percent
last month, compared with a 2.1 percent gain in May, according
to the median estimate of 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Investors will be watching the inflation data closely as growth
slows, although the central bank said last week it will pursue
prudent monetary policy.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, closed 25 percent below its Feb. 1 high on July 5,
with a 20 percent drop meeting some investors’ definition of a
 bear market . The measure trades at 1.11 times the value of net
assets, near levels not seen since the depths of the 2008 global
financial crisis.  Shares on the benchmark gauge traded at 9.9 times estimated
earnings on July 5, compared with multiples of 14.81 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.77 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, is
down more than 20 percent from its Feb. 1 high, meeting some
investors’ definition of a bear market.  The Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s broadest equity
measure, is down 8.5 percent this year through July 5, led by
material and energy companies. Only two of the 11 industry
groups, information technology and utilities, have gained this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
