Gold futures trading volume surged
during the first after-hours session on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange, adding to signs of robust demand for the precious
metal in China.  Volume for the contract for delivery in December reached
224,320 in the five-and-a-half hour session from 9 p.m. local
time on July 7. That compared with an average of 87,129 in June
during the regular four-hour trading day, according to data from
the  bourse .  Bullion has lost 27 percent this year amid speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will curb its asset-buying program as the
 U.S. economy  recovers. The rout strengthened demand for jewelry
and coins around the world and the second half of the year
usually sees gains in physical demand for wedding seasons and
religious festivals in  Asia , including India and China, the
biggest buyers.  “Individual Chinese investors are quite keen to invest in
gold despite the slump in prices,” Long Ling, an analyst at
Industrial Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai today.  China’s net gold imports from Hong Kong increased 40
percent in May from a month earlier as the metal’s deepening
slump continued to attract bargain hunters to bullion shops.  In addition to futures,  spot gold  is traded in China on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, while two asset managers are raising
money this month for the country’s first two exchange-traded
funds backed by bullion.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
