(Corrects price move in headline.)  German government bonds rose before a
report that economists said will show the country’s industrial
production declined, strengthening the case for the European
Central Bank to ease monetary policy.  The advance pushed benchmark 10-year  yields  down from the
highest since July 1. German industrial production fell 0.5
percent in May after increasing 1.8 percent in April, according
to the median of 38 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
 Germany  is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros ($5.13 billion) of
six-month bills today. Italian bonds also rose.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.70 percent at 7:45 a.m. London time. The
rate climbed to 1.74 percent on July 5, the most since July 1.
The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 gained 0.135, or 1.35
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.165. The  two-year  note
yield was at 0.10 percent.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped four basis points to
4.39 percent.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year through July 5, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
