German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble comments on the disbursement of the next international
aid installment to  Greece .  He spoke to reporters after a meeting of euro-region
finance ministers in Brussels today.  “We decided to have a political agreement on the basis of
the report that says Greece has made considerable progress in
its deficit reduction.”  “The economic development in Greece is within the foreseen
framework and Greece is even on the way to achieve a primary
surplus.”  “Greece has reduced its administration to some degree”
but encountered delays due to its government crisis.  “The next installment will be paid in three sub-tranches,
depending on the financing needs of Greece. The first tranche by
the end of July with 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion), then the
next tranche of 1.8 billion euros in August and the third
installment at the end of September or early October with
another 1 billion euros.”  Schaeuble said the disbursement of the sub-tranches is
linked to Greece meeting certain milestones in program
implementation.  “Greece is in many ways on the right track but has also
delayed the program in some areas,” including the establishment
of a working tax administration and the implementation of
personnel reforms.  “It’s good that we do this in a payment-versus-delivery,
step-by-step way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
