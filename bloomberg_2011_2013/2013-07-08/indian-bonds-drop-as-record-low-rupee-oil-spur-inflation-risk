The yield on Indian bonds maturing in
2022 rose the most this month on concern the rupee’s plunge to a
record and higher  oil prices  will stoke inflation, limiting the
central bank’s ability to lower  interest rates .  The rupee fell to an unprecedented 61.2125 per dollar today
after a U.S. jobs report showing companies hired more workers
than economists forecast added to the case for the  Federal
Reserve  to reduce monetary stimulus that has driven inflows to
 emerging markets . A weaker currency raises  India ’s cost of
imported goods and threatens to fuel consumer-price gains.  “The rate cut clearly seems to be off the table this
month,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “The rise in oil prices is also a worrying factor as
that, along with a weaker currency, will add further to
inflationary pressures.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 jumped
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.72 percent as
of 10:30 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the highest level since June 27. The yield on the
7.16 percent 10-year bonds rose eight basis points to 7.58
percent.  The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association
kept “no price band” for bond trading today, according to its
 website .  Swaps Rise  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the
repurchase  rate  at 7.25 percent at a review on June 17, citing
inflation risks.  Consumer prices  rose 9.31 percent in May from a
year earlier, while wholesale-price inflation, which is more
frequently used for policy decisions, touched 4.7 percent, the
least since October 2009.  A sustained 10 percent drop in the rupee adds 150 basis
points to 200 basis points to  wholesale-price  inflation,
according to a research note released last month by Standard
Chartered Plc.  India buys about 80 percent of its crude from overseas.
West Texas Intermediate traded near the highest level in 14
months. The rupee weakened as much as 1.6 percent, taking losses
this month to 2.7 percent, the most in  Asia .  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed seven
basis points to 7.57 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
