Indonesian bonds fell, pushing the
10-year yield to an April 2011 high, after a U.S. jobs report
bolstered the case for the  Federal Reserve  to cut stimulus that
has fueled fund flows to  emerging markets . Stocks dropped.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. brought
forward their forecasts for the start of Fed tapering to
September from December, after official data on July 5 showed
U.S. payrolls increased by 195,000 workers in June, exceeding
the 165,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Indonesia’s
 foreign-currency reserves  fell to $98.1 billion last month, the
lowest since January 2011, from $105.1 billion in May, according
to a central bank report released late on July 5.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 surged 40
basis points to 7.8 percent as of 10:09 a.m. in Jakarta, the
biggest increase since September 2011, according to prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association. It reached 7.87 percent
earlier, the highest level since April 2011.  “The jobs data increased concern over Fed tapering, but
nothing is certain as unemployment is still high,” said Dini Anggraeni, a fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in
Jakarta. “The forex reserves are a concern, as it reduces the
scope for the central bank to defend the currency.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month that $85
billion a month of debt buying may be tapered this year and
ended in 2014. He said he expects the U.S. jobless rate to be
about 7 percent when the Fed halts its stimulus, compared with
7.6 percent in June.  Rupiah, Stocks  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,951 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks. It traded at a 3.7 percent
premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which fell
0.1 percent to 10,324, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
42 basis points, or 0.42 percentage point, to 12.75 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  of shares fell 2.2 percent, the
second-biggest decliner among emerging Asian markets, as
speculation  Bank Indonesia  will raise  interest rates  hurt
banking and property stocks. The central bank will lift its
 reference rate  to 6.25 percent from 6 percent on July 11, which
would be the second increase in a row, according to seven of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One sees a 50 basis point rise,
while two forecast no change.  PT Bank Central Asia, the country’s biggest bank by market
value, and PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia both fell 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
