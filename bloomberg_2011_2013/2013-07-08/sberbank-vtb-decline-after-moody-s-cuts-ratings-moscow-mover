OAO Sberbank and VTB Group dropped
after Moody’s Investors Service reduced the debt ratings of
 Russia ’s biggest lenders.  VTB slid for the first day in three, losing 1 percent to
4.707 kopeks by 4:34 p.m. in Moscow. Sberbank sank 1 percent to
92.33 rubles.  Moody’s cut Sberbank’s rating to Baa1 from A3 and VTB’s to
Baa2 from Baa1. Russia’s vulnerability to a drop in  oil prices 
has “eroded” the government’s ability to support banks in the
event of a “systemic crisis,” according to the e-mailed note.
The Russian government’s financial position has “weakened”
compared with 2008, Moody’s said.  Sberbank’s ruble bonds due in January 2016 fell, lifting
the yield one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.12
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
