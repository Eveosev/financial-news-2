A Chinese insurance company has
agreed to buy the Lloyd’s of London building, home of the
Lloyd’s insurance market, for 260 million pounds ($388 million)
from a Commerz Real AG-managed fund.  The purchase is the first by a Chinese insurer in the U.K.,
London-based property broker  Savills Plc (SVS)  said in a statement
without naming the buyer. The building, designed by  Richard
Rogers  and purchased by Commerz Real for 231 million pounds in
2005, is leased to the Society of Lloyd’s until 2031.  Ping An Insurance Group Co. (2318) , China’s second-largest life
insurer, is buying the Lloyd’s building, Times of London
reported April 10. Two calls to Ping An spokesman Sheng Ruisheng’s office and mobile phone, were not immediately
answered.  An increasing number of Chinese companies are investing in
London as the city has emerged as a haven for foreign wealth
with the pound’s decline. Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese
developer controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin, announced last
month that it is investing 1 billion pounds in a London site to
build Western Europe’s tallest residential tower.  “The current liquidity and investor demand within the
London market presented an ideal time for us to seek an exit,”
Commerz Real management board member Roland Holschuh said in the
statement.  ABP (China) Holdings Group Ltd., a Beijing-based Chinese
developer, in May signed an agreement with London officials to
transform the 35-acre (14-hectare) site at Royal Albert Dock
into the capital’s third business district after the  City of
London  and  Canary Wharf .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
