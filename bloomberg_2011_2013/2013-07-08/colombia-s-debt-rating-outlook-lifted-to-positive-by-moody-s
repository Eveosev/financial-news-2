Colombian peso bonds gained after
Moody’s Investors Service lifted the country’s debt rating
outlook to positive on expectations that shrinking budget
deficits will drive down debt levels.  Yields on benchmark government peso bonds due in 2024
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.82
percent, the biggest decline since June 27. Moody’s, which
raised the outlook from stable, rates Colombia Baa3, the lowest
investment-grade level. In signaling an increase, Moody’s is
following Standard & Poor’s, which raised the Andean country’s
rating to BBB, or two levels above junk, in April.  Colombia’s budget deficit “has trended lower in recent
years,” Moody’s said in the statement. “Expectations of
continued improvements in the main debt metrics will support
further upgrades.”  Moody’s forecasts Colombia’s debt will fall to the
equivalent of 32 percent of gross domestic product this year
from 34.5 percent in 2009. The country earned an investment-grade rating in 2011 for the first time in a decade as improved
security bolstered economic growth and attracted record foreign
investment. Congress passed legislation, known as the fiscal
rule, that year allowing the government to save part of the
windfall revenue it receives from rising commodity prices.  “We expect that the government will continue to comply
with the targets set by its fiscal rule,” Moody’s said in the
statement. Colombia has set a central government deficit target
of 1 percent of GDP in 2022, down from 2.4 percent in 2012.  Fitch Ratings also has a positive outlook on its Colombia
rating of BBB-, the lowest investment-grade level.  Yields on the government’s dollar bonds due 2021 rose 20
basis points to 3.95 percent today. The peso, which closed
before Moody’s announcement, gained 0.1 percent to 1,925.83 per
U.S. dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
