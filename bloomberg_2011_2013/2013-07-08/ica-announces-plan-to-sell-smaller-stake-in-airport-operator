Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) , the Mexican
construction company seeking to raise cash to cut debt, said it
was restarting a plan to sell part of its stake in its airport
operator less than two weeks after postponing the transaction.  The builder said it would sell a 17 percent stake in  Grupo
Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB  while retaining control of
the airport unit known as OMA. ICA halted a plan to sell 24
percent of the OMA on June 25.  At current prices and including the overallotment option,
the revived share sale would raise about 2.88 billion pesos
($224 million) for Mexico City-based ICA. The company’s credit
rating was reduced by Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard &
Poor’s  in May due to falling revenue, rising debt and delays in
public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto. The
builder’s agreement to sell most of its housing unit to
Servicios Corporativos Javer SAPI was abandoned May 31.  ICA fell 4.9 percent to 23.75 pesos in Mexico City at the
close, before the statement it was renewing the OMA stake sale
process. The airport operator slid 0.8 percent to 41.68 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
