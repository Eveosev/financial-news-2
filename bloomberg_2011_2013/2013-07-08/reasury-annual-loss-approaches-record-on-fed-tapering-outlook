Treasuries rose for the first time in
three days amid speculation an increase in 10-year yields to the
highest in almost two years had been too rapid.  Yields surged on July 5 by the most since August 2011 after
data showing an increase in U.S. payrolls boosted speculation
the Federal Reserve will curb its bond-buying program later this
year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said 10-year yields will reach 4
percent by 2016. The Treasury plans to sell $66 billion of notes
and bonds this week.  “Investors saw the rise in yield as a buying
opportunity,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade directly with the Fed. “The selloff into this week was
too strong. The data was positive, but given the state of the
economy, we may have moved too fast.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  declined 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 2.64 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due May 2023 rose 26/32, or $8.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 92
11/32. The yield earlier climbed to 2.75 percent, the highest
level since August 2011.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index ended last week at 117.89,
the highest since December 2010. The one-year average is 63.6.  Relative Strength  “The initial selling pressure has run its course and we’re
in the process of defining a new, slightly higher yield range,”
said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We had a very solid
selloff on a shift in fundamental data. What we got was
confirmation that the Fed is now on course to start tapering in
September, and the market priced to that.”  The 10-year yield’s 14-day  relative strength index  fell to
67 after rising to 77 on July 5, above the 70 level some traders
see as a sign that a reversal is imminent.  U.S. government debt has lost 3.5 percent this year, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. The only bigger annual
decline was in 2009, when they dropped 3.7 percent, based on
data that go back to 1978.  “We are revising up our 10-year yield forecasts for the
U.S. by 25 basis points across the forecast horizon out to
end-2016,” Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets
research at Goldman Sachs in  London , wrote in a client note
dated yesterday. “We now see yields entering 2014 at 2.75-3
percent, roughly in line with the forwards and our model
estimates, and climbing to 4 percent by 2016.”  Fed Minutes  The Labor Department report on July 5 showed the U.S.
economy added 195,000 jobs in June, compared with the median
forecast of 165,000 in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Bernanke said last month that policy makers may
“moderate” their asset-purchase program this year and end it
in mid-2014 if economic growth meets their forecasts.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on borrowing costs. It purchased $1.46 billion
in securities today maturing between February 2036 and August
2042.  The Fed on July 10 will release minutes of its June 18-19
policy makers’ meeting.  “We will be able to get a feeling of how many members on
the committee were talking about tapering -- how many guys were
ready to pull the trigger,” said Charles Comiskey, head of
Treasury trading in New York at primary dealer  Bank of Nova
Scotia. (BNS)  “Things have changed somewhat because of the data we’ve
gotten since then.”  Treasury Auctions  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion of three-year
notes tomorrow, $21 billion of 10-year debt the following day
and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 11.  A previous auction of the three-year securities on June 11
drew a yield of 0.581 percent, the highest level at an auction
of the notes since July 2011. The current securities traded at
0.7 percent.  The biggest  investors  in Asia and Europe have decided to
keep their money in Treasuries even after the steepest two-month
loss for the securities erased $317 billion of market value.  Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees $32 billion,
added Treasuries due in 10 years or longer to its holdings in
the past month. HSBC Private Bank, with $480 billion in assets,
bought U.S. notes when 10-year yields rose to 2.5 percent.
Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, which manages about $1.3
trillion, is holding debt maturing in less than four years,
betting American interest rates will remain subdued.  After doubling holdings of Treasuries to $5.6 trillion in
the past five years, overseas investors are resisting the
market’s 3.2 percent slump in May and June and last month’s
record $79.8 billion of withdrawals from bond funds. Since the
Fed signaled it may slow the pace of asset purchases this year,
the world’s biggest and most actively traded debt market now
offers the highest yields relative to other developed nations in
three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
