Gold futures rose the most in a week
in  New York  on speculation that this year’s slump will spur
stronger physical demand. Platinum climbed as workers employed
by the world’s largest producer of the metal went on strike.  Gold fell a record 23 percent in the second quarter,
reaching $1,179.40 an ounce on June 28, the lowest since Aug. 2,
2010. Indian jewelry demand is set to pick up before the Diwali
festival, Catherine Raw, portfolio manager of BlackRock World
Mining Trust, said in an e-mailed statement today. The dollar
slid as much as 0.3 percent against a basket of six currencies.  “The drop below $1,200 has brought in some physical
buyers,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options
in  Port St. Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview. “The
weakness in the dollar is also supporting prices.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 1.8 percent to settle
at $1,234.90 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since July 1.  Bullion has slipped 26 percent this year, wiping about $62
billion from the value of gold-backed  exchange-traded products ,
after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank may slow its $85 billion of asset purchases this year. Data
released last week showed U.S. employers added more jobs in June
than economists estimated.  Silver futures for September delivery added 1.6 percent to
$19.038 an ounce in New York. Prices dropped 3.8 percent last
week. Trading was 48 percent lower than the 100-day average for
this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 2.7 percent to $1,362 an ounce.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  said about 5,600 workers went
on strike at two mines in  South Africa . Workers are protesting
the suspension of union officials and also want the company to
halt its job-cuts process.  Palladium futures for September delivery jumped 2.6 percent
to $695.40 an ounce, the biggest gain in a week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
