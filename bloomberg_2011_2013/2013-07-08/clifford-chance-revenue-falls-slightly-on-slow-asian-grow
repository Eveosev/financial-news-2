(Corrects to remove amount of revenue in second
paragraph.)  Clifford Chance  LLP, the highest-grossing U.K. law firm, said revenue fell slightly to 1.27
billion pounds ($1.9 billion) due to slower growth in Asia.  Asia-Pacific revenue dropped 3 percent in the financial
year that ended on April 30, David Childs, London-based Clifford
Chance’s managing partner, said in a conference call today. The
region accounted for 14 percent of the firm’s revenue, about the
same as last year.  “Given the difficult operating environment for many of our
clients and the depressed transactional markets, we are pleased
to have maintained revenues last year,” Childs said in a
statement. He said he is “optimistic that this will be a better
year than last year.”  Clifford Chance reported higher revenue than its top three
U.K. competitors, which announced earnings last week. Allen &
Overy LLP revenue increased less than 1 percent to 1.19 billion
pounds. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP’s earnings rose 7
percent to 1.22 billion pounds while Linklaters LLP said its
revenue rose by 1 percent to 1.19 billion pounds.  Clifford Chance will re-evaluate its revenue goal of 250
million pounds a year in  Asia  by 2014 after this year’s results,
Childs said.  Clifford Chance revenue increased 7 percent to 1.3 billion
pounds in the period that ended a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
