Tradition Financial Services Ltd., a
broker of over-the-counter physical and derivative products,
hired Tom Warwick to head its new agricultural commodities desk.  London-based TFS is starting the desk to broker deals in
grains and the so-called soft commodities including cocoa and
coffee, Mike Anderson, a managing director running the energy
and commodities desks at the company, said in an interview at
its office today. Warwick previously worked for companies
including Refco Inc., MF Global Holdings Ltd. and JB Drax Honore
(U.K.) Ltd.  “We will be dealing only with listed-derivatives for now
and will be strictly broking,” Warwick said in the same
interview. “There will be zero proprietary interest.”  TFS also hired Lee Hayward as a senior softs and
agricultural commodities broker, Anderson said. Hayward
previously worked for ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. and Man Group Plc.  Warwick and Hayward are joining the 600 to 700 brokers the
company has in the London office, Anderson said. TFS deals with
commodities including oil, power, gas, coal, emissions and
biofuels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
