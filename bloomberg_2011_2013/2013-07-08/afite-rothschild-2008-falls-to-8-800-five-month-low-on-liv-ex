A case of 2008 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, the most expensive of the Medoc first-growth wine
estates, sold for 5,900 pounds ($8,800) on the Liv-ex market, a
five-month low and down 13 percent from its peak for this year.  Today’s price was 59 percent below the record 14,450 pounds
at which it traded in February 2011, at the height of the bull
market for  Bordeaux , and is up 9 percent from the level to which
it fell in August 2012 after Chinese demand cooled.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a 3 percent decline since then. Restrained investor demand
for Bordeaux 2012 wine futures on sale over the past three
months has weighed on prices of the region’s earlier vintages.  The 2012 sales campaign “is what really damped the
recovery,” Chris Smith, investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in London, said in a phone interview. “It
stifled whatever interest there was.” The fund, invested in
Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  The 2008 Lafite ranks as the estate’s fifth highest-priced
wine of the past 10 years, lagging those from 2010, 2009, 2005
and 2003, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 98 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , matching the 2010 and ahead of the
two most recent years, according to the  eRoberParker.com 
website.  Cabernet Sauvignon  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has about 100 hectares (247
acres) planted to red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon typically
makes up between 80 percent and 95 percent of its wine, with
Merlot accounting for between 5 percent and 20 percent along
with smaller quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyard, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , is in Pauillac on the left bank of the Gironde estuary
and ranked among the top Bordeaux first-growth estates in the
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  Its vineyards date back at least to the seventeenth century
and the estate has been under the control of the Rothschild
family since being acquired by Baron James de Rothschild, then
head of its French branch, in August 1868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
