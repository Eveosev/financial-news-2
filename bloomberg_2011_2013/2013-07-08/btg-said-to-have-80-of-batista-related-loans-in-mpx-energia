Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11)  has about 80
percent of its loans tied to Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista 
in MPX Energia SA, which got a cash injection last week from
Germany’s EON SE, a person familiar with the matter said.  The loans made to companies linked to Batista by Sao Paulo-based BTG, Brazil’s fifth-largest bank by market value, total
about 650 million reais ($288 million), the person said, asking
not to be identified because the matter is private.  BTG is one of several Brazilian banks facing the prospect
of “sizable” losses if companies controlled by Batista
default, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report today. MPX
rose the most in five years last week after Germany’s EON SE
strengthened its control over the Brazilian thermal-power
utility and Batista quit as chairman.  Officials at BTG and MPX declined to comment on the loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
