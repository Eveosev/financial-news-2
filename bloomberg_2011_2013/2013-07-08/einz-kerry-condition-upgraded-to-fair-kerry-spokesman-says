Teresa Heinz Kerry’s condition has
been upgraded to fair as she remains hospitalized, according to
a spokesman for her husband, U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry .  “After conducting tests overnight and this morning,
doctors at  Massachusetts General Hospital  have upgraded Mrs.
Teresa Heinz Kerry’s condition from critical to fair,”  Glen
Johnson , the spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “She is
undergoing further evaluation, and Secretary of State John
Kerry, her son, and other family members remain with Mrs. Heinz
Kerry at the hospital in  Boston .”  Heinz Kerry, 74, suffered symptoms consistent with a
seizure yesterday in Nantucket,  Massachusetts , and was taken to
a hospital there, according to a person close to the Kerry
family who discussed the episode on condition of anonymity. Her
condition soon stabilized and she was later taken to
Massachusetts General in Boston, the person said.  A philanthropist who has focused on issues ranging from
childhood lead poisoning to women’s education, Heinz Kerry is
chairman of the Heinz Family Foundation and the  Heinz Endowments 
in Pittsburgh, according to her biography on the website of an
award that bears the Heinz name.  Born in  Mozambique  and fluent in five languages, she is
heiress to the H.J. Heinz ketchup fortune, estimated in 2004 at
$500 million. Her former husband, Pennsylvania Republican
Senator John Heinz, died in 1991. She married Kerry, then a
Democratic senator from Massachusetts, in 1995.  In an interview that aired in February 2010 on CNN’s
“Larry King Live” program, she and Kerry talked about her 2009
diagnosis with  breast cancer , and Kerry said “she knows more
about medicine than a lot of doctors.”  ‘Very Analytical’  Asked about the prospect of facing radiation treatment, she
said, “I wasn’t scared because I’m very analytical about things
like this, and I guess a little fatalistic.”  Kerry and Heinz Kerry have a home on Nantucket, an island
south of Cape Cod. The secretary of State traveled there July 3
for a Fourth of July holiday with his family after returning
from a trip to the Middle East and  Asia .  Heinz Kerry didn’t accompany the top U.S. diplomat on the
tour, his fifth trip in an attempt to revive long-stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.  Kerry’s respite on Nantucket created a stir when a CBS News
producer reported he was spotted on board a yacht on July 3,
amid a crisis that day as Egypt’s military ousted President
Mohamed Mursi. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki initially
said that “any report or tweet that he was on a boat is
completely inaccurate.”  Psaki later said in a statement that “while he was briefly
on his boat on Wednesday, Secretary Kerry worked around the
clock all day including participating in the president’s meeting
with his National Security Council” and making calls to
numerous leaders in the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
