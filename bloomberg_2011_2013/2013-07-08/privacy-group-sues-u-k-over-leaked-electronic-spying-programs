Privacy International sued the
British government in a bid to force a review of U.S.
surveillance programs exposed by whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  The U.K. government’s use of data collected from the U.S.
National Security Agency’s Prism program is illegal under the
European Human Rights Act, Privacy International, an advocacy
group, said in a statement. It is also challenging the U.K.’s
Tempora operation, which Privacy International said taps fiber-optic cables to gather data on individuals.  Snowden, a U.S. security contractor, leaked details of U.S.
National Security Agency programs that collect telephone and
Internet data. American prosecutors are seeking his return from
 Russia , where he sought asylum from theft and espionage charges.  “Secret law is not law,” said Eric King, head of research
at London-based Privacy International, which campaigns against
intrusion by governments and corporations. “The scope and scale
of this program, which monitors the entire British public and
much of the world, cannot be justified as necessary and
proportionate.”  A spokesman for the U.K. Home Office declined to
immediately comment. The advocacy group is challenging the
programs at the country’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
