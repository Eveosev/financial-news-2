U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
to the smallest discount to futures in almost three weeks on
speculation that a power failure at a  Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
refinery may boost exports.  The discount  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
on the Gulf Coast tightened 0.75 cent to 19.75 cents a gallon
versus  New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 1:58 p.m., the
lowest level since June 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  conventional 87-octane grade  gained 1 cent to a
discount of 13.75 cents.  The differentials shrank after PDVSA’s 355,000-barrel-a-day
Curacao plant was hit by the outage yesterday.  “We’re going to push out exports faster than the plant can
say they are back and ready to go,” said Carl Larry, president
of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “Until buyers can
say no, we’ll ship out more barrels.”  As more refined product is shipped to the Caribbean,
supplies on the Gulf Coast may tighten.  Stockpiles of motor fuel 
on the Gulf, known as PADD 3, were 77.9 million barrels in the
week ended June 28, according to data from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , climbed 16 cents to $13.68 a barrel. The same
spread based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil  advanced 26 cents to
$7.48 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
