Taiwan ’s bonds fell, with the  five-year  yield touching the highest level since July 2011, after a
U.S. jobs report spurred speculation the Federal Reserve will
begin cutting stimulus this year.  Employers in the world’s largest economy added 195,000
workers for a second straight month in June, according to data
released on July 5. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
was for a gain of 165,000. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
June 19 the central bank may reduce its bond buying in 2013 if
economic projections are met. Minutes of the Fed’s meeting last
month are due July 10.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.16 percent in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. It jumped to 1.21
percent earlier, the highest for a five-year  benchmark  since
July 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “People are now saying the Fed may actually start tapering
in September,” said Sam Chang, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Non-farm payroll is not the kind of
data the market can just digest in a day. Five-year yields may
go as high as 1.27 percent this week.”  Official data showed today Taiwan’s exports rose 8.6
percent in June from a year earlier, following a 0.9 percent
increase the previous month.  The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.4 percent to NT$30.342 against
its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show.  Implied Volatility  The local dollar was trading 0.3 percent stronger one
minute before the 4 p.m. close. The central bank has sold the
currency in the run-up to the close on most days in the past
year, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$30.165, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, increased 31 basis points to 4.98
percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
