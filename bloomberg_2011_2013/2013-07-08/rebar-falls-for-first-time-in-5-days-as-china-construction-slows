Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for the first time in five days amid a seasonal
slowing in Chinese construction and after a decline in local
stocks and commodities.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.3 percent to 3,575  yuan  ($582) a
metric ton and was at 3,609 yuan at 11:22 a.m. local time.
Futures climbed 2.4 percent last week.  Demand for the building material normally wanes in the
summer in  China  as high temperatures hamper construction, said
Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. The
recent price increase also led to more production among Chinese
 steel mills , he said.  “Both higher output and the traditional lean season for
rebar consumption will pressure the market this week,” Wang
said from Tianjin today.  Chinese stocks dropped the most in two weeks, led by
commodity and industrial companies. The nation’s money-market
cash squeeze is likely to reduce credit growth this year by 750
billion yuan ($122 billion), an amount equivalent to the size of
Vietnam’s economy, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in China
rose by 0.5 percent to $122.60 a dry ton on July 5, the highest
since May 23, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  The average  spot  price for rebar in China gained 0.6
percent to 3,406 yuan a ton on July 5, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
