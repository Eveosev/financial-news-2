Canacol Energy Ltd., (CNEC)  a Calgary-based
 oil company  that operates in  Colombia , rose to a two-week high
after saying output has grown 28 percent from the first-quarter
average, soaring past its full-year target.  The shares advanced 5.3 percent to 5,770 pesos at 11:32
a.m. in Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis since June
19. The company was the best performer on the Colcap index,
which declined 0.2 percent.  Production averaged about 9,832 barrels of oil equivalent
per day in the first week of July, up from 7,659 barrels a day
in the first calendar quarter, the company said today in
statement. Canacol surpassed the 7,500 to 8,500 barrels a day
target it had set for production this year as it added
production from its Labrador 3 well in central Colombia,
according to the company.  “People really like that their production is now up to
that level,”  Christopher Brown , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity
Corp., said in a telephone interview from Calgary. “If they can
maintain that through the third quarter, that would be great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
