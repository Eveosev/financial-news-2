Taiwan , which imports almost all of
its crude requirements, purchased more of the commodity last
month as manufacturing rebounded.  June shipments rose 12 percent from a year earlier to 27.4
million barrels, according to the  Finance Ministry  in Taipei.
The island’s oil-import bill climbed 3.7 percent to $2.81
billion, it said in a statement today.  The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to
49.5 last month, from 47.1 in May, according to a Markit
Economics survey released on July 1. This means fewer
manufacturers said conditions deteriorated.  Output from electricity and gas suppliers rose 21 percent
in May from a year earlier, Economic Affairs Ministry data
showed on June 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
