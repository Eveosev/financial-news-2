The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
said Gerald Lipkin, the chief executive of Valley National Bank
of Wayne,  New Jersey , was elected to the Fed district bank’s
nine-member board of directors.  Lipkin, a former chairman of the New Jersey Bankers
Association, will represent banks with capital and surplus of
$30 million to $1 billion, the New York Fed said in a press
release today.  The 12 regional Fed banks each have a nine-member board of
directors. Lipkin will be a Class A director, one of the three
elected by members of the Fed system to represent banks. The
boards are also composed of three Class B directors, who are
elected by banks and supposed to represent the public, and three
Class C directors, picked by the Fed’s board of governors in
Washington to represent the public.  Congress created the Fed almost a century ago with a mix of
public and private features, including regional banks with
private banking executives on their boards of directors.  The New York Fed’s board of directors has come under
scrutiny for its ties to  Wall Street . Last year,  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  was serving on the
board at the New York Fed when his bank announced a trading
loss. His term expired on Dec. 31, 2012.  Lipkin’s term expires on Dec. 31, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
