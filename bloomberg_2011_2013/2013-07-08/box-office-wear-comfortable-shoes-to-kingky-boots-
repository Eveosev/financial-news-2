Cinderella’s pumpkin burst last week, giving her show a rude dose of box-office reality.  In a generally down period for Broadway ticket sales and attendance, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical fairy tale suffered the biggest drop, $174,599, or 14 percent, from the week before, according to figures compiled by the trade group the  Broadway League .  There were also 1,301 fewer bottoms-in-seats at the Broadway Theatre, where the show is running.  The departures of  Tom Hanks  and Bette Midler, two of the season’s top box-office draws, had an impact as “Lucky Guy” and “I’ll Eat You Last” both ended their limited runs.  Total ticket sales fell $2,152,010, or 9 percent, from last week’s tally of $24,997,386. Attendance dropped 16,450, or 7 percent, according to the league, to a total of 208,177.  Summer theatergoers were as eager as ever to see the biggest hits.  “Kinky Boots” rose slightly and was doing standing-room-only business, as were “Matilda,” “Pippin” and “Motown: The Musical.”  Last-minute entry to “The Book of Mormon” still couldn’t be had and it remained Broadway’s most expensive ticket, with an average price of $192.47.  Cicely Tyson  Bucking that trend was the perennial hit “Wicked,” which saw a drop of $91,666, to a total of $1,893,488 -- still enough to make it a sellout. And “Once” fell $105,674 to a total of $739,280, or 73 percent of its potential.  Plays, as usual, had a tough go of it. Tony winner “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” took in $621,093 of its potential $765,960, $70,000 less than the previous week. “The Trip to Bountiful” dropped $45,000 and took in less than half its potential of $765,960, despite a memorable, Tony-winning performance by Cicely Tyson.  Nevertheless, the producers announced Monday that the good ship “Bountiful” had extended its run through Oct. 9.  Muse highlights include James Tarmy on  director Sam Gold  and Jeffrey Burke on  books .  To contact the reporter on this story: Jeremy Gerard in  New York  at  jgerard2@bloomberg.net .
