Copper fell for a third day as the
dollar climbed after better-than-expected U.S. employment data
increased bets that the  Federal Reserve  will slow record
monetary stimulus this year. Tin and zinc rose.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange lost as much as 0.6 percent at $6,747.25 a metric ton
and traded at $6,783.50 at 10:28 a.m. in Shanghai. On July 5,
the price slipped 2.3 percent to close at $6,789, the lowest
since June 28. The LME Index of six industrial metals slumped
2.6 percent on July 5, the most in two months. Tin rose 1.3
percent to $19,101 a ton today.  Employers added more jobs in June than forecast and the
jobless rate held at 7.6 percent, close to a four-year low, the
U.S. Labor Department reported on July 5. The Dollar Index, a
gauge of the greenback’s strength against six major currencies,
rose for a second day, reaching a three-year high of 84.588. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the central bank may
reduce its bond buying this year and end it in mid-2014 if
growth meets policy makers’ estimates.  “The good employment data fueled the expectation the U.S.
will exit the bond purchase as planned,” said Fang Junfeng, an
analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co. “That will be negative
for commodities priced in the dollar. Copper is more vulnerable
to further sell off than other metals like aluminum zinc, which
are already near production costs.”  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange decreased 1.1 percent to 48,660  yuan  ($7,927) a ton.
Metal for delivery in September on the Comex was little changed
at $3.0685 a pound.  On the LME, aluminum and nickel also increased.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
