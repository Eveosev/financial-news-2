Malaysia’s ringgit slid to a two-week
low and bonds fell after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data

stimulus that’s spurred inflows to  emerging markets .  Payrolls in the world’s largest economy rose by 195,000 for
a second month in June, exceeding the 165,000 median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey, a July 5 report showed.

central bank may reduce its bond buying this year if growth
meets projections. Minutes of the Fed’s meeting last month are
due July 10. Malaysian exports fell for a fourth month in May,
according to official data released July 5.  “It’s just purely the payroll numbers on Friday from the
U.S.” that’s driving the ringgit’s movements, said Sean Yokota,
head of Asia strategy in Singapore at Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken AB. “The minutes that are coming out are going to be the
main event.”  The ringgit weakened 0.6 percent to 3.2067 per dollar as of
9:18 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.2088, the lowest since June
25. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, jumped 17 basis points, or
0.17 percentage point, to 8.80 percent.  Malaysia ’s  overseas sales  fell 5.8 percent in May from a
year earlier, the biggest decline in three months, government
data showed July 5. The central bank imposed a maximum tenure
for mortgages and personal loans last week, joining neighbor
Singapore in implementing measures to limit risks stemming from
rising household debt  The yield on Malaysia’s 3.26 percent notes due March 2018
increased one basis point to 3.37 percent, according to data
