Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Ltd. (1171)  has
proposed privatizing its 78 percent-owned unit  Yancoal Australia
Ltd. (YAL)  and listing depository receipts on the Australian Stock
Exchange, the company said.  The Shandong-based miner will use its Hong Kong-traded
shares as underlying security for the depository receipts and
will offer 0.91 depository receipts for every Yancoal Australia
share it doesn’t already own, according to a  statement  to the
Hong Kong Exchange today.  “The proposed transaction, if implemented, will further
increase the company’s interest in the expandable operating
mines operated by Yancoal Australia and coal resources in
Australia,” Yanzhou Coal said in the statement.  Yanzhou Coal on May 19 said it hired Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG as joint global coordinators for a planned sale of
dollar-denominated subordinated securities, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
