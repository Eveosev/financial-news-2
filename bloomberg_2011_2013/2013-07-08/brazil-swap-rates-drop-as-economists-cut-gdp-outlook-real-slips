Brazil ’s swap rates fell to a three-week low after economists cut their growth forecasts, spurring
speculation that the central bank will limit the increase in
borrowing costs at a policy meeting this week.  Swap rates due January 2015 declined eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 9.59 percent at 10:20 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the lowest level since June 14 on a closing basis. The
real depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.2543 per  U.S. dollar .  About 100 economists in a central bank survey cut the
median forecast for 2013 growth to 2.34 percent from 2.40
percent a week earlier. The central bank will increase the
target lending rate by a half-percentage point to 8.50 percent
on July 10, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There is actually more room for downward adjustments in
coming weeks” to economic growth forecasts, Enestor Dos Santos,
economist at BBVA, said in a phone interview from  Madrid .
“We’re starting to see the impact of protests on consumption
and the negative impact of inflation.”  Demonstrations swelled last month to more than 1 million
people and spread from  Rio de Janeiro ,  Sao Paulo  and the
capital, Brasilia, to cities across the country. The protests
were sparked by an increase in bus fares and transformed into a
catch-all for discontent over poor public services, corruption
and inflation.  Consumer prices rose 0.23 percent in the month ended
yesterday, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.33 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
