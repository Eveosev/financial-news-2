A unit of  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the
biggest independent U.S. electricity producer, plans to raise as
much as $411 million through an initial public offering.  NRG Yield Inc. (NYLD) , a newly formed renewable-energy business,
is offering about 19.6 million shares for $19 to $21 each,
according to a filing today. It will be listed on the  New York 
Stock Exchange under the symbol NYLD. The price of the offering
is expected to be set July 17, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  NRG Yield will acquire and own a mix of solar, wind and
natural gas-fired generating assets and “pay a consistent and
growing cash dividend,” it said in a filing June 7 when it
announced the offering. NRG is expected to retain a majority
voting interest in the unit and a similar economic interest in
its assets.  Bank of America Corp. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  are leading the sale, NRG Yield said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
