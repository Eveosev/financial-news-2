CRT Capital Group LLC hired Sebastian Boulan and Greg Lantz from  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  for the event-driven
trading desk.  Boulan will be head of the equity-risk arbitrage desk, and
Lantz will be a managing director of equity-risk arbitrage
strategy, John Nielsen, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT Capital, said in a telephone interview. They will
start at CRT Capital on Sept. 1, Nielsen said.  The pair will report to Eric Shenker, CRT Capital’s head of
equity trading, who joined the company in March, Nielsen said.
Boulan worked as head of Morgan Stanley’s special situations
desk before joining BNP in May 2011, and Lantz worked at
Oppenheimer & Co.  Fabienne Alexis, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas, said that
Boulan and Lantz had left the Paris-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
