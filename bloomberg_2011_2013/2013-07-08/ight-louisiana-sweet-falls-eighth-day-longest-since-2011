Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark
light, sweet crude on the  Gulf Coast , weakened for the eighth
day in a row, the longest losing run to domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate since November 2011, as WTI gained on Brent.  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed by 21 cents to $4.29 a
barrel, based on ICE Futures  Europe  and New York Mercantile
Exchange settlement prices.  The Brent-WTI spread grew in recent years because of
booming domestic shale production that tripled inventories in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI futures. Since
Feb. 8, the spread narrowed from $23.18 as new pipelines drew
crude from Cushing. It fell below $5 this month after BP Plc’s
Whiting,  Indiana , refinery restarted its largest crude unit.  LLS, which competes with foreign oils priced against Brent,
fell 45 cents to a $5.85-a-barrel premium over WTI today, its
lowest level since Jan. 3, 2011.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium 
fell 75 cents to $5.35 a barrel.  Thunder Horse  weakened by 5 cents to $3.25 a barrel more
than WTI. Poseidon, a medium sour grade, weakened by 55 cents to
a $1.30 discount to WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium  fell by 15 cents to 20 cents a barrel
more than WTI. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon gained 15
cents to a discount of 75 cents to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
