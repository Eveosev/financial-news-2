Rubber climbed as  Japan ’s currency
declined to a five-week low against the dollar, boosting the
appeal of yen-denominated contracts, after a monthly U.S. jobs
report beat economists estimates.  Rubber for delivery in December advanced as much as 1.1
percent to 247.8 yen a kilogram ($2,444 a metric ton) and traded
at 246.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 9:50 a.m. The
most-active contract rallied 3.7 percent last week, the best
performance since the week through May 10.  The yen fell to 101.53 per dollar, the weakest level since
May 30. U.S. employers added 195,000 workers last month, a
report showed July 5, beating the increase of 165,000 predicted
by economists. The  Federal Reserve  has indicated an improving
job market could prompt a reduction in stimulus.  “Futures were supported by expectations that the yen will
weaken further as the Fed is likely to curtail its bond-buying
program this year,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Gains in futures were limited after International Monetary
Fund’s Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said the fund may cut
its global growth forecast because the expansion of emerging
market economies is slowing, raising demand concerns, he said.  The Washington-based fund predicted in April that the world
economy would expand 3.3 percent this year. The IMF is scheduled
to publish new forecasts later this week.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.9 percent to 17,780  yuan  ($2,801) a ton.
Natural-rubber inventories climbed 125 tons to 114,121 tons,
based on a survey of nine warehouses in  Shanghai , Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the exchange said July 5.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.2 percent to 82.45 baht
($2.63) a kilogram July 5, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
