Victor Cruz, the  New York Giants ’
season record-holder for receiving yards, has agreed to a $45.9
million, six-year contract with the National Football League
team, according to Fox Sports.  The deal between the 26-year-old Cruz and the Giants
includes the one-year, $2.88 million tender he signed last month
and $15.6 million in guaranteed money, Fox reported today citing
unidentified people familiar with the package.  Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon declined to comment in an e-mail.  Undrafted out of the  University of Massachusetts  and signed
by the Giants in 2010, Cruz had a team-leading 1,092 yards
receiving and 10 touchdown catches last season. That followed
his first full year, when he caught nine touchdown passes and
had 1,536 yards receiving, a franchise season record.  In those two seasons, only five wide receivers had more
catches than Cruz, a fan favorite in  New York . A native of
Paterson,  New Jersey , he had four catches for 25 yards and a
touchdown in the team’s 21-17 Super Bowl victory over the  New
England Patriots  following the 2011 season. He won fans with his
salsa dancing celebration following touchdown catches.  Today’s report comes three weeks after Cruz, a restricted
free-agent, told ESPN that he would sign a one-year tender -- a
mandatory offer under the NFL’s labor agreement -- with the team
while he pursued a long-term contract to remain in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
