The Iranian currency appreciated in
unregulated trading after the central bank canceled its fixed,
subsidized rate for the dollar.  The rial strengthened to 33,400 to the dollar at 11 a.m. in
Tehran from 33,850 on July 2, marking a 1.3 percent gain,
according to rates compiled by Daily Rates For Gold Coins and
Foreign Currencies, a Facebook page used by businessmen based in
 Iran  and abroad.  Iran’s currency has appreciated 8.5 percent since the day
before the June 14 presidential election that made Hassan Rohani
the country’s new head of state. Iran’s central bank posted an
official exchange rate of 24,777 rials a dollar on its  website 
today, replacing the fixed rate of 12,260 rials, which was
removed from the website last week. The central bank is
“officially adopting a single rate,” the Tehran-based  Etemaad 
newspaper reported yesterday, without saying where it got the
information.  Before this move, the government applied different exchange
rates depending on the type of business seeking currency.
Importers of essential goods like medicine were given access to
currency at lower rates than those bringing in less-essential
products. Ordinary Iranians purchase the dollar on the
unregulated market at more expensive rates.  Rohani, who will succeed President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  next
month, has said he seeks to revive Iran’s economy by improving
relations with the world and seeking relief from economic and
financial sanctions imposed over the country’s nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
