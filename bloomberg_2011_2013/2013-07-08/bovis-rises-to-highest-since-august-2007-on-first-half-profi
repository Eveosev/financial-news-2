Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS)  rose to the
highest in almost six years after the U.K. homebuilder said it
had a “significant improvement” in first-half profit as sales
volumes and prices beat the company’s expectations.  Bovis was up 55 pence, or 7.1 percent, to 830 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, the highest since July 2007. That
brought this year’s gain to about 44 percent.  “Trading in the first half of 2013 has been strong and the
group has achieved a 40 percent increase in private reservations
compared to the same period in 2012,”  Chief Executive Officer
David Ritchie said in a statement today.  The housing market has shown signs of a “strong”
improvement, helped by the government’s Help to Buy loan
program, Bovis said. In the six months ended June 30, Bovis
completed 963 homes compared with 944 a year earlier, the
Longfield, England-based company said. The average selling price
of a Bovis home increased 15 percent to 188,500 pounds
($281,000), according to the statement.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is using homebuilding to help
stimulate the economy, with the government in March announcing
that it would offer an equity loan of as much as 20 percent of
the value of a newly built home valued at 600,000 pounds or
less. The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme also
eased home lending as the government has tried to bolster
housing by simplifying planning laws.  The Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index has gained 37
percent this year, led by  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  with a 70 percent
advance. Bovis, which will report half-year results on Aug. 19,
has had the index’s fifth-best increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
