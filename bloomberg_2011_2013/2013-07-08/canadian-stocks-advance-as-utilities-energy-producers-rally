Canadian stocks rose, following a
gain last week, as  utility companies  and energy producers
advanced and investors waited for Alcoa Inc. to kick off the
corporate earnings season in the U.S.  Just Energy Group Inc. and ATCO Ltd. rose at least 1.8
percent, pacing gains among utility companies. Torex Gold
Resources Inc. and Novagold Resources Inc. jumped more than 3.9
percent as the precious metal climbed on speculation this year’s
slump will spur stronger physical demand. Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd. added 7.8 percent after its  copper mine  in
Mongolia was cleared to ship to China.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 75.80
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,210.71 at 10:28 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge rose 0.1 percent last week and is down 1.8 percent for
the year.  Investors awaited second-quarter results from Alcoa. The
largest U.S. producer of aluminum will unofficially start the
second-quarter earnings season after the market closes today,
when it becomes the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to report results.  Canadian building permits rose a fifth straight month in
May, a surprise gain that caps the longest stretch in almost a
decade, led by a jump in multiple-unit housing work in Toronto
that has sparked warnings from policy makers about overbuilding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
