Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo from Trinidad & Tobago, ship-tracking data
shows.  The Norman Lady, with a capacity of about 86,000 cubic
meters, is on its way to Recalada port near Buenos Aires,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The vessel loaded the supercooled gas at Atlantic LNG Co.’s
Point Fortin terminal and departed June 25, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
