Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560) ,  South Korea ’s
second-biggest carrier, slumped the most in almost 19 months in
 Seoul  trading after its worst plane crash in two decades.  The carrier  dropped 5.8 percent, the most since Dec. 19,
2011, to close at 4,825 won after falling to a three-year low.
The stock has declined 22 percent this year, compared with a 9
percent decline in the benchmark Kospi index.  Two people died and more than 300 escaped, some sliding
down emergency exits, before a fire swept through Asiana’s
Boeing Co. 777 plane while landing in  San Francisco  July 6. It
was the first fatal passenger crash by a South Korean airliner
since 1997.  “Investors are worried that the crash will hurt
earnings,” said Cho Byoung Hee, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities
Co. in Seoul. “It’s peak season for airlines now, and for this
to happen could affect its operations and increase costs.”  Pilots of the Asiana jet tried to abort a landing 1 1/2
seconds before it slammed into a rock berm short of the runway
at San Francisco, an accident investigator said.  The aircraft slowed so much on approach that a cockpit
warning of an impending aerodynamic stall sounded 4 seconds
before it crash-landed, U.S. Transportation Safety Board
Chairman  Deborah Hersman  said, describing data from flight
recorders in her first briefing since the accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
