Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  John Lechleiter  returned to his positions
full-time following surgery to repair a heart defect in May.  The procedure and recovery were successful and both
Lechleiter’s personal doctor and the company physician cleared
him for work, Indianapolis-based Lilly said in a statement
today. Lechleiter, 59, also resumed his position as president.  The May 13 surgery sought to repair a dilated aorta, which
hadn’t been causing any symptoms. The condition occurs when
there is a bulge or ballooning of the larger artery that carries
blood from the heart through the chest and abdomen, according to
the  National Institutes of Health . When announcing the procedure
on May 6, the company said that Lechleiter’s condition was found
during an unrelated test.  “I return to Lilly with renewed energy and enthusiasm,
along with a new perspective on health and wellness and the
critical importance of new medicines in advancing patient
care,” Lechleiter said in the statement.  Lilly rose 1.1 percent to $51.13 at the close in  New York .
The shares have increased 20 percent in the past 12 months.  Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice, who had been filling
in as acting CEO during Lechleiter’s medical leave, will
continue as CFO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
