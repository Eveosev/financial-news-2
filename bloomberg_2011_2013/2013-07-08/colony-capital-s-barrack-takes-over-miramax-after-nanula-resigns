Colony Capital LLC Chairman  Tom
Barrack  took over as chairman of his company’s Miramax film unit
following the resignation of Richard Nanula.  Nanula has also resigned from Colony. The changes are
effective immediately, Santa Monica, California-based Colony
Capital said today in an e-mailed statement.  Barrack is taking charge after the Los Angeles Times and
 Deadline.com  reported that the websites TheDirty.com and
GenesisOnline.com had posted images of Nanula having sex with an
adult-film star. Colony announced last month that Nanula had
taken a leave of absence for personal reasons.  Nanula didn’t respond today to telephone and e-mail
messages and the company’s statement didn’t give a reason for
his resignation.  Colony Capital bought Miramax from Walt Disney Co. in 2010
for more than $660 million. Miramax, which has focused on
licensing films from its 700-picture library to Web-based
distributors including  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , said in March that it was
working with  Martin Scorsese  to create a television series
inspired by the director’s “Gangs of New York” movie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
