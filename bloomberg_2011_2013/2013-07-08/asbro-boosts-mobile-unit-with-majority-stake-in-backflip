Hasbro Inc. (HAS) ,  the world’s second-largest toymaker, purchased a majority stake in  Backflip Studios
Inc.  for $112 million in cash as it attempts to capture a bigger
piece of the mobile-gaming market.  Hasbro acquired a 70 percent stake in Backflip Studios,
according to a statement from the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based
toy company. Closely held Backflip, founded in 2009, has
developed such mobile games as DragonVale and Paper Toss. Hasbro
didn’t disclose financial data for Backflip and said the
transaction would be “slightly accretive” to its 2013 results.  The toy industry has experienced slowing sales growth amid
the rising popularity of tablets among kids and teenagers. In
response, companies have made toys that integrate mobile
applications and handheld games based on popular brands. Hasbro
is looking for ways to boost revenue, which  declined  4.6 percent
to $4.01 billion last year.  “The acquisition of Backflip fits perfectly into our
strategy of extending our brands into all forms and formats,”
Brian Goldner, Chief Executive Officer of Hasbro, said in the
statement. “As mobile play continues its rapid growth,
Backflip’s leadership position, great games and established
network of users, makes Hasbro a more meaningful participant in
digital gaming.”  Hasbro rose 0.4 percent to $46.79 at 3:21 p.m. in New York.
The shares had gained 30 percent this year through July 5
compared to a 14 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Backflip is based in Boulder,  Colorado .  To contact the reporter on this story:
