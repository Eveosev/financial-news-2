United Inc. (2497) , a Japanese maker of
mobile applications whose shares have surged 23-fold this year,
may add languages to boost downloads of its  CocoPPa  app, which
lets users customize the home screens on their smartphones.  United may add Spanish and Portuguese versions of the
software as the company aims to increase downloads to 30 million
by March 31 from 10 million so far, Hiroki Teshima, a director
in charge of the app, said in an interview yesterday in  Tokyo .
The  shares  rose 5.3 percent, erasing earlier losses, to close at
a record 5,100 yen in Tokyo trading today.  CocoPPa, which provides access to shortcut icons for apps
and wallpapers submitted by other users, is already available in
English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean. United is considering
ways to monetize the app and studying how  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube
generates revenue through official channels and advertising,
Teshima said.  “We want to focus our efforts on working with other
parties” as the app gains recognition, he said.  Introduced in July 2012, CocoPPa targets young female users
and offers about 200,000 icons and wallpapers for free,
according to United. Users can replace existing app icons with
shortcuts featuring designs such as hearts and flowers in
various colors.  The app has users in 150 countries and has gotten 86
percent of its downloads from overseas, United said June 24.  United is the  best performer  among 182 stocks in the Tokyo
Stock Exchange’s Mothers section this year.  D.A. Consortium
Inc. (4281) , which  owns 45.5 percent  of United, gained 3.5 percent
today and has more than tripled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
