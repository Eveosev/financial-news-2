Wheat futures rose on demand by  China 
for exports from the U.S., the world’s largest shipper. Soybeans
and corn also advanced.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today that
exporters sold 840,000 metric tons of soft red winter wheat to
China for delivery before May 31. The agency on July 3 announced
a shipment of 360,000 tons. From June 1 to June 27, combined
 sales  and shipments were 1.83 million tons, five times more than
a year earlier.  “Confirmation of new Chinese business is a positive
factor,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The Chinese sales show that U.S. wheat is
competitive against other world supplies and suggest prices are
making a seasonal low.”  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for September
delivery gained 0.6 percent to $6.6425 a bushel at 10:56 a.m. On
July 2, the price touched $6.5225, the lowest since June 19,
2012.  Wheat imported under China’s government-issued low-tariff
quotas costs 2,100  yuan  ($343) a ton, compared with a domestic
price of 2,400 yuan, according to Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  “Imported grains are cheap, and some local crops like
wheat, which has had issues with quality, are struggling to
compete,”  Li Qiang , the chairman of Shanghai JC, said on July
5.  Wheat and soybeans rose on speculation that as much as 4
inches (10 centimeters) of rain in the past three days from
Arkansas to Ohio damaged the grain crop and reduced the number
of acres that farmers will plant with the oilseed, Grow said.  “It’s getting too late to double-crop soybeans,” Grow
said. “Farmers probably will plant fewer soybeans than they
intended because of the wheat-harvest delays.”  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 0.7 percent
to $12.3725 a bushel.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 1.4 percent to
$4.9825 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
