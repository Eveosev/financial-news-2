Europe ’s biggest oil companies have
withdrawn some staff from  Egypt  as supporters of ousted
President Mohamed Mursi clashed with the military.  BP Plc (BP/) ,  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  have removed non-essential
staff, officials at the companies said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
said today it temporarily relocated some workers and dependents
as violence in the country left at least 35 people dead.  “The main priority is the safety and security of our
personnel,” said  Mark Todd , a spokesman for BG Group. “Like
everybody else, we continue to monitor the situation.”  Oil and gas production hasn’t been affected by the unrest,
the companies said. Egypt produced 728,000 barrels of oil a day
last year and 60.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas,
according to statistics compiled by BP.  BG Group has removed about 100 people from the country,
including dependents of staff. BP has withdrawn about 60 people.  Mursi, who started his term a year ago, was deposed by the
military on July 3 in response to popular discontent with his
leadership. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets to demand
he step down, accusing him of betraying the 2011 revolution that
toppled  Hosni Mubarak  by grabbing power for the new president’s
Islamist backers and exacerbating Egypt’s economic plight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
