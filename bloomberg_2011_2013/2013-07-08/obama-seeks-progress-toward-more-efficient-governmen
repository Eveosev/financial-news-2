President  Barack Obama  said he’s
devoting part of his second term toward improving government
efficiency and is putting his new budget director, Sylvia Burwell, in charge of the effort.  “We’re operating under severe fiscal constraints,” Obama
said at the White House after a cabinet meeting today. “It
makes sense for us to be able to redesign government.”  The goal, he said, is “making sure that we’re delivering
services better, faster and more efficiently” while reducing
waste and saving taxpayers’ money.  In his first term, Obama said the government identified
more than $2.5 billion in savings by ending overlapping programs
and improving efficiency. Obama selected 18 Presidential
Innovation Fellows, many of them from  California ’s Silicon
Valley, to help streamline government operations though better
use of computer technology.  The result was improved use of government data and Internet
and mobile applications that, for example, allowed disaster
victims to sign up for government benefits more quickly. In
another area, technology experts created ways to open government
statistics for easier use by the public, according to the White
House.  Obama said today he’s naming a second class of 43 fellows
to help maintain momentum in the drive for government efficiency
as part of his second-term management agenda.  To contact the reporters on this story:
