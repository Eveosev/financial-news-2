Gunmen in  Nigeria  suspected to be
Islamist militants killed 48 students and seven teachers in four
separate attacks since June 16 on schools in the country’s
northeast, the  United Nations Children’s Fund  said.  Military authorities in Nigeria said 20 students and a
teacher were killed in the latest attack on July 6 on a
secondary school in the northeastern town of Mamudo.  “The deaths of students in yet another attack on a school
in northeast Nigeria should be condemned absolutely by all,”
Unicef, as the United Nations agency is known, said today in an
e-mailed statement. “There can be no justification for the
deliberate targeting of children and those who look after
them.”  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” razed 50 schools in the past year in the northeast,
Nigeria’s education ministry said on June 20. The group has also
carried out gun and bomb attacks in the country’s mainly Muslim
north and the capital, Abuja, in which thousands of people have
died since 2009.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and most populous
country of more than 160 million, is roughly split between
Muslims, who live predominantly in the north, and Christians,
who are mainly in the south. Boko Haram is fighting to impose
Shariah rule in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
