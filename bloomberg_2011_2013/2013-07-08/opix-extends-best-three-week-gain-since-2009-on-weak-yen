Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index extending its biggest three-week gain in four years, as
exporters advanced after the yen weakened past 101 per dollar on
better-than-forecast U.S. employment data.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the worldâ€™s largest carmaker, increased
1.3 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Topix. SoftBank
Corp. climbed 1.4 percent after the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission approved its takeover of Sprint Nextel Corp. Daiwa
House Industry Co. slumped 7 percent after the homebuilder said
it will sell shares.  The Topix rose 1.1 percent to 1,201.03 as of 9:19 a.m. in
Tokyo, with all but three of the 33 industry  groups  rising. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.2 percent to 14,478.32.  The Topix gained 4.8 percent last week, bringing its
increase over three weeks to more than 12 percent, the most
since April 2009. Shares rose amid a weakening yen and optimism
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through economic reforms
after winning upper-house elections on May 21. The gauge has
pared its decline from a May 22 high to 6 percent from as much
as 18 percent on June 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
