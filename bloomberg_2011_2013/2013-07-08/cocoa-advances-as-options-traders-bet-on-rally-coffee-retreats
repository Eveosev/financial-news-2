Cocoa resumed gains in  London  as
options traders boost bets on a price rally later this year,
adding to speculation the next crop in West Africa, the main
growing region, will be delayed. Coffee retreated.  The most active option for December gave holders the right
to buy futures for that month at 1,550 pounds ($2,310) a metric
tons, the so-called call options, NYSE Liffe data on Bloomberg
showed. The return of dry weather after a large mid-crop and a
lack of rains in April may make the harvest about a month later
than usual, according to Kevin Marcus, founder of the commodity
weather consulting company Marcus Weather in Passaic, New
Jersey.  “It looked like we were on the road for a downside until a
huge amount of December calls pushed the market back up fast and
strong,” Jerome Jourquin, head of agricultural commodity
derivatives at brokerage Aurel BGC in Paris, said by e-mail
today. “The 1,550 pounds a ton area on December may be
difficult to break to the upside as it’s a technical strong
resistance.”  Cocoa for September delivery advanced 0.5 percent to 1,533
pounds a ton by 10:46 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, after
sliding 0.4 percent in the past trading session. Cocoa for
September delivery gained 0.3 percent to $2,211 a ton on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. It fell 1.2 percent on July 5.  Farmers in leading grower Ivory Coast are harvesting the
mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests, and it’s estimated
to be 440,000 tons, the third-biggest ever, the London-based
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) estimates. The main crop
may be “a little bit late because of the strong mid-crop but
nothing of concern at this stage,”  Laurent Pipitone , head of
the economics and statistics unit at the ICCO in London, said by
phone last week.  Robusta coffee for September delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1,798 a ton in London. Arabica for delivery in September
retreated 0.6 percent to $1.205 a pound on ICE.  White sugar for October delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$473.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery in October
advanced 0.2 percent to 16.28 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
