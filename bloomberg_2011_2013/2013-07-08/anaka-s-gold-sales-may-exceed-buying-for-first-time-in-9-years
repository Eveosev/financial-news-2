Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,  Japan ’s
biggest bullion retailer, said sales to local investors may
exceed purchases this year for the first time since 2004 as
lower prices and the yen’s weakness spur buying interest.  “Japanese individuals are thinking of gold as an asset for
their investment portfolio as well as insurance for the
future,” said Kate Harada, general manager of the precious
metals department at Tanaka Kikinzoku, a unit of Tanaka Holdings
Co. “A growing number want to use gold partly to hedge against
their yen-based assets such as stocks and properties.”  The slump into a  bear market  in April spurred demand for
jewelry and coins around the world and the second half of the
year usually sees gains in physical demand for wedding seasons
and religious festivals in  Asia , including India and  China , the
biggest buyers. Gold in  London  slid 23 percent last quarter,
touching a 34-month low of $1,180.50 an ounce on June 28, after
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and
as the  Federal Reserve  said it may taper stimulus.  Gold bars of 500 grams are the most popular among
individual Japanese customers, Harada, who oversees Tanaka’s
sales of jewelry, bars and coins and physical trade, said on
July 5. Japan’s imports of gold more than doubled to 7,686
kilograms in January to May, from 2,994 kilograms a year earlier,
according to finance ministry data.  Abenomics  The yen has depreciated 14 percent against the dollar this
year following unprecedented monetary stimulus as part of Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to end deflation, dubbed Abenomics.
The Japanese currency touched 103.74 per dollar in May, the
weakest since October 2008.  Gold priced in yen fell 15 percent this year, compared to a
27 percent drop for gold in dollars. Gold futures on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange touched a record 5,081 yen a gram ($1,562 an
ounce) on Feb. 7 as the yen weakened. Futures for delivery in
June 2014 fell 1 percent to close at 3,970 yen.  Gold for immediate delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$1,220.70 an ounce at 3:48 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal retreated 23
percent in the second quarter.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said gold will reach $1,050 by the
end of 2014, Credit Suisse Group AG anticipates $1,150 in 12
months and  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  sees a drop to $1,000 in three months,
taking prices below a level some mines need to break even.  Tanaka has attracted increasingly younger customers in the
past three years after two decades of deflation deepened anxiety
about jobs and the country’s pension payouts, said Harada.
Tanaka manages eight shops directly and has 120 dealerships
nationwide.  Monthly trading volume for Tocom gold futures fell to 1.09
million contracts in June from 1.12 million contracts in May
after reaching 1.72 million contracts in April, the highest
level since September 2009, according to data from the bourse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
