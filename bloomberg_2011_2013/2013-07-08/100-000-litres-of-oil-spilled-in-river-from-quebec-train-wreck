About 100,000 litres (26,385 gallons)
of oil spilled into the Chaudiere River after a train carrying
crude oil derailed and exploded in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, said Eric Cardinal, a spokesman for the provinceâ€™s
environment ministry today.  The Chaudiere River runs between Lac-Megantic and the St.
Lawrence River, meeting the major shipping channel near Quebec
City.  The train derailed and exploded in the southeastern Quebec
town, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of  Montreal , on July
6, killing five people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
