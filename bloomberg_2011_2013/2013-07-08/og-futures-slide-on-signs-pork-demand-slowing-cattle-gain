Hog futures fell on signs that demand
for U.S. pork is slowing. Cattle rose.  Wholesale- pork  prices, a gauge of demand, fell 3.6 percent
last week, the first decline in five weeks and the biggest slump
since March, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Prices
are down 4.8 percent from $1.1133 a pound reached on June 26,
which was the highest since at least October 1997, government
data show. Hog futures were up 14 percent this year as of July
5, the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of
24 raw materials.  “The hogs have topped out,”  Dennis Smith , a senior
account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “I think there’s a lot more
pressure.”  Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.6 percent to
97.175 cents a pound at 9:46 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price rose 0.3 percent last week.  Cattle futures for August delivery added 0.4 percent to
$1.224 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed less
than 0.1 percent to $1.51825 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
