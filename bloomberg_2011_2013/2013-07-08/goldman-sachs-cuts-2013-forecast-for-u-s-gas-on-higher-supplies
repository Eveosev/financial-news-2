U.S. natural gas will average $3.85
per million British thermal units in the third quarter and $4.25
in the fourth quarter, below earlier forecasts as supply
increases,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said.  “Debottlenecking” at the Marcellus shale sites in  West
Virginia  and  Pennsylvania  are among the drivers of supply gains,
Goldman Sachs analysts led by Damien Courvalin in New York said
in an e-mailed report today. Goldman previously forecast U.S.
natural gas prices would be $4.50 in the third and fourth
quarters.  Production gains may be “temporary” because the number of
gas rigs operating is low, Goldman said. Natural gas prices need
to increase to $4.25 per million Btu by 2014 to bring rigs back
into active production and keep the market balanced, Courvalin
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
