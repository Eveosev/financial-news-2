Champions League runner-up  Borussia
Dortmund  said it will have spent almost all its 50 million-euro
($64 million) summer transfer budget by completing the signing
of Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan.  Dortmund, which lost 2-1 to German rival  Bayern Munich  in
the final of  Europe ’s top competition in May, said it agreed on
the trade with Mkhitaryan’s club Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukrainian
champion, and has a “general agreement” on contractual terms
through June 2017 with the 24-year-old.  Once Mkhitaryan formally joins, Borussia Dortmund will have
“finalized its essential transfer activities in the summer
period,” the club said in a statement. It didn’t specify the
transfer fee for Mkhitaryan, although European soccer’s
governing body  UEFA said  it was a reported 25 million euros.  His capture is a coup for the 2011 and 2012 German champion
after he was linked to several teams including the English
Premier League’s Liverpool. The Armenian national team player
scored a championship-leading 25 goals in Ukraine’s top division
last season and would replace Mario Goetze, the attacker who
quit for German champion Bayern at the end of last season.  Since then Dortmund, managed by Juergen Klopp, has added
Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Gabon national team
forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.  “In the course of the ordinary execution of these
transfers, Borussia Dortmund will have almost spent the
available investment budget in the amount of 50 million euros,”
Dortmund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
