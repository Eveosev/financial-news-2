Phoenix Solar AG (PS4) ’s U.S. unit is
building a solar power facility at a former cotton farm in
Georgia that will be the state’s largest when completed later
this year.  The company is erecting the 38.6-megawatt Simon Solar Farm
about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Atlanta in partnership
with closely held U.S. developer Silicon Ranch Corp., Phoenix
said today in a statement.  Phoenix, based in Sulzemoos, Germany, is installing  JA
Solar Holdings (JASO)  Co. photovoltaic panels,  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) 
inverters and Unirac Inc. ground-mounting systems. Southern Co.
utility Georgia Power has agreed to buy the solar farm’s
electricity for 20 years.  The project is expected to cost $85 million, Silicon Ranch
Chief Executive Officer Matt Kisber said today by e-mail.
Macquarie Group Ltd. is providing construction financing, and
Silicon Ranch is providing the equity for the project, he said.  Silicon Ranch, based in Nashville, Tennessee, completed
construction financing last month, according to the statement.  Phoenix and Silicon Ranch previously partnered to build a
9.5-megawatt solar farm at a  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  auto factory in
Tennessee.  Phoenix rose 14 percent to 1.55 euros at the close in
Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
