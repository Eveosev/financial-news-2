Iain Duncan Smith, Britain’s Work
and Pensions secretary, compared bankers to benefit claimants in
an interview with  the Times  published today.  “Bankers have to own up and put their hands in the air and
say: ‘We forgot that work isn’t just about earning more
money,’” Smith was quoted as saying in an interview with the
newspaper. “Work is about providing work for other people. Work
is about character. Honesty is part of the game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
