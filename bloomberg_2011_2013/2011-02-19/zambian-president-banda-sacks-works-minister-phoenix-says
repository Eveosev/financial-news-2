Zambian President Rupiah Banda fired
Mike Mulongoti after the works and supply minister said he
planned to run for vice president of the ruling party, Radio
Phoenix reported, citing a State House statement in Lusaka.  Vice President George Kunda is Banda’s preferred candidate
for the post in the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, the
privately owned station reported.  Banda won’t be challenged at the party’s April 5-7
convention, meaning he’ll be the Movement’s candidate in an
election to be held by October, the radio station said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
