U.K. investigators suspect criminal
gangs are illegally shipping toxic waste to West Africa and
parts of  Asia , the  Financial Times reported , citing a probe by
the Environment Agency.  The agency is pursuing 30 cases in which broken electronic
goods are exported to countries such as Nigeria or  Ghana ,
supposedly as used devices for re-sale, the newspaper said. On
arrival, the items are dismantled for metal components by teams
of workers including children, who are exposed during the
process to harmful materials such as cadmium and mercury,
according to the FT.  The courts are handling five cases, the newspaper said.
Individuals convicted may face two-year prison sentences or
unlimited fines, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
