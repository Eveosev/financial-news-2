  ConocoPhillips  reported an equipment
failure at its  Lake Charles  refinery in Westlake,  Louisiana ,
resulting in a release of naphtha, according to a  filing  with
the National Response Center.  The refinery said the cause of the leak appeared to be a
failed expansion joint.  The refinery processes mostly heavy, high-sulfur crude oil.
Its main products are transportation fuels such as gasoline and
jet fuel, according to the companyâ€™s website.  The plant, near Lake Charles in southwestern Louisiana, has
a capacity of 252,400 barrels of oil a day, according to the
Energy Department.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
