  Guinea  is ready to begin talks with
United Co. Rusal about 5 million euros ($6.8 million) of taxes
the government alleges the company hasn’t paid, Minister of
Economic and Financial Control Aboubacar Koulibaly said.  Rusal is likely to discuss the situation on Monday, Feb.
21, with an administrative committee, Koulibaly told reporters
today in Conakry, Guinea’s capital city.  Guinea is the world’s biggest bauxite exporter. Rusal is
the world’s largest aluminum maker.  “Rusal is concerned because the taxes that it should pay
were not paid,” Koulibaly said today without giving more
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
