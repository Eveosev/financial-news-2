PC Capital SAPI, a Mexican private-
equity firm, said it reached an agreement to acquire the holding
company of Compania Mexicana de Aviacion, bringing the bankrupt
airline closer to a return to the skies.  Investor group Tenedora K, which bought holding company
Nuevo Grupo Aeronautico in August, will transfer its shares to
PC Capital before a notary public Feb. 21, PC Capital said in an
e-mailed statement late yesterday. Nuevo Grupo Aeronautico owns
Mexicana, its Click and Link subsidiaries and maintenance
provider MRO Services. PC Capital didn’t disclose the terms of
the deal in its statement.  “This is an important step in the process of restarting
the operations of Mexicana de Aviacion,” the statement said.  Mexicana’s Cia. Mexicana de Aviacion unit filed for
bankruptcy protection in  Mexico  in August, sought Chapter 15
protection in the U.S., and shut its operations. The Chapter 15
petition in  New York  listed more than $500 million in
assets and $1 billion in debt.  In order for Mexicana to return to the skies, it will seek
government regulatory approval, an injection of capital from new
investors, the payoff of former employees and reopening of
ticket sales, the statement said.  Before its bankruptcy, Mexicana was the nation’s largest
carrier and flew to more than 65 national and international
destinations, including the U.S.,  Canada ,  Europe  and  South
America . In 2009, it transported 6.86 million passengers, while
its Click and Link subsidiaries carried an additional 4.25
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
