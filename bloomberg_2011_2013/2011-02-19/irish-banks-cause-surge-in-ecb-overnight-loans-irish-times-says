Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish
Nationwide Building Society caused a  surge  in overnight
borrowing at the  European Central Bank  as the country’s
government prepares to sell assets and deposits of the lenders,
the Irish Times reported.  The Dublin-based banks increased emergency borrowing at the
ECB as they shifted to overnight debt from longer-term loans,
the newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information. The banks needed to move to shorter maturities
because the Irish government-backed bonds they had used as
collateral for the long-term borrowings will also be sold off by
the state, the Irish Times said.  Overnight borrowings at the ECB rose to 16 billion euros
($22 billion) on Feb. 17 from just over 1 billion euros, the
Irish Times said. The ECB,  Anglo Irish  and Irish Nationwide
declined to comment, the Dublin-based newspaper said.  The banks’ net borrowing from the ECB will remain
unchanged, the Irish Times said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
