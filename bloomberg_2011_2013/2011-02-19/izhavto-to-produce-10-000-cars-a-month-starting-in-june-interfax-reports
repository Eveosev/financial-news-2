OAO IzhAvto, a Russian carmaker,
plans to produce about 10,000 automobiles a month starting in
June, Interfax said, citing Alexander Volkov, president of
Udmurtia, the region where the factory is located.  The plant will start making two KIA models and two from the
Renault-Nissan alliance by the end of the year, the news service
quoted Volkov as saying. He made the comments after meeting with
AvtoVAZ President Igor Komarov, the report said. In December,
AvtoVAZ said it will buy 100 percent of IzhAvtoâ€™s owner this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
