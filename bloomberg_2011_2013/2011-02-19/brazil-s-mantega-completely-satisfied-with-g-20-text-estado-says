Brazil is “completely satisfied”
with the statement issued today by Group of 20 finance
officials, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters in
Paris, according to  O Estado de S. Paulo  newspaper.  The G-20 statement supports his view that a “currency war”
is being waged, Mantega said,  according to Estado .  Brazil is in favor of using exchange rates as a measure of
global imbalances, and opposes controls on food prices, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper reported Mantega as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
