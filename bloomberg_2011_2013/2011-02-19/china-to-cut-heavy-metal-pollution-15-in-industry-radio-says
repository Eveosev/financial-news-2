China aims to cut heavy-metal
pollution in five key industrial areas 15 percent by 2015 from
2007 levels, the China National Radio  reported , citing
Environmental Protection Minister Zhou Shengxian.  Pollution of lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic in other
places during the 2011 to 2015 period shouldnâ€™t exceed 2007
levels, Zhou was cited as saying. The ministry will closely
monitor emissions by 4,452 companies nationwide during the 12th
Five Year Plan period, it said.  --Helen Yuan. Editor: Reed Landberg  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
