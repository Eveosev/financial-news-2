Brazil defense budget cuts will
reduce funding for KC-390 military transport planes being
developed by  Embraer SA ,  Folha de S.Paulo  reported, citing an
interview with Brazil Air Force Commander Juniti Saito.  The air unit will also reduce funding for the modernization
of its AMX fighter planes, another project involving Embraer,
and cuts will be made in a project with  France  to build EC-725
helicopters, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper  said , citing Saito.  Discretionary defense spending will be slashed 36 percent
this year, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
