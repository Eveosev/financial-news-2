  Germany ’s  Ifo Institute  called for a
special tax on profits and particularly high salaries in
financial institutions,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, according to
the e-mailed preview of an article that will appear in Monday’s
edition.  As the tax would only apply to a very “small circle” it
could be very high, the magazine said, citing a report by Ifo’s
European Economic Advisory Group. The tax income would flow to
the special crisis fund for the financial industry, WiWo
reported. The advisory council rejected a special tax on
bonuses, WiWo said, citing a report that will be published on
Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
