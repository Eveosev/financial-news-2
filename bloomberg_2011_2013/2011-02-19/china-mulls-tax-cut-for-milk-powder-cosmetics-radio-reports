  China  is considering cutting taxes
on imported milk powder and cosmetics as citizens increasingly
buy such goods directly from overseas markets, the  China
National Radio  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The government is weighing exempting consumption taxes on
cosmetics and removing duties on gold jewelry over the long run,
the report said.  --Helen Yuan. Editor: Alan Crawford  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
