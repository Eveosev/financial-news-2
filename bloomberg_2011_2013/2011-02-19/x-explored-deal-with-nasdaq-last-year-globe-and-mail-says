  TMX Group Inc ., the owner of the
Toronto Stock Exchange, considered joining forces with Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. last year before focusing on a transaction with  London Stock Exchange Group Plc , the Globe and Mail  reported .  TMX ended the discussions because Nasdaq would have held
too much control over the resulting company, the Globe said,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.
Carolyn Quick, a TMX Group spokeswoman in Toronto, declined to
comment yesterday, the Globe said.  LSE agreed to bid about C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) for
Toronto-based TMX on Feb. 9. Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement said Feb. 14 he will review LSE’s bid for TMX to
determine whether the transaction is beneficial to the country’s
economy.  Governance would have been the “sticking point” for any
TMX transaction with U.S. partners because of the size
difference between the companies, the Globe said. TMX has a
market capitalization of C$3 billion, compared with $5.1 billion
for  Nasdaq  OMX.  To contact the reporter for this story:
