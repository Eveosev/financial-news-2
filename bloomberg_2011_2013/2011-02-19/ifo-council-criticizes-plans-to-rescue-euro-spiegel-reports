The Ifo Institute’s  European
Economic Advisory Group  criticized the European Union’s plans
for saving the euro, Spiegel reported, according to the preview
of an article that will appear in the Feb. 21 edition.  The council said a case-by-case determination of what
creditors are owed won’t be enough if a member state ends up
bankrupt and that it will be necessary to have an “automatic
waiver” on the nominal value of bonds, Spiegel reported, citing
a report by the council that is due to be published.  The so-called “haircut,” or loss investors should take on
the nominal value of a bond, should be at least 20 percent and
as much as 50 percent, according to the report, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
