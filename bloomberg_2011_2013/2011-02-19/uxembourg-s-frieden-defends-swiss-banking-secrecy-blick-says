Luxembourg’s Finance Minister Luc
Frieden defended banking secrecy, saying that Switzerland and
Luxembourg should protect the industry from efforts to enforce
more transparency, Swiss newspaper Blick reported.  “Protecting citizens from state interference is a valuable
commodity,” Blick cited Frieden as saying an interview, when
asked about the future of banking secrecy.  “We shouldn’t give up that commodity easily,” Frieden
said, according to Blick. “Switzerland and Luxembourg should
not be ashamed of their position. To the contrary, we should go
on the offensive.”  Frieden also said that euro-area countries must reduce
their debt to protect the single currency.  “The euro is a very strong instrument for political unity
in  Europe . It makes life much easier,” the newspaper quoted
Frieden as saying. “But we have to reduce the debt burden.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
