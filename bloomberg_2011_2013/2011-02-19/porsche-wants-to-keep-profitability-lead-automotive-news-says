Porsche SE wants to retain and build
on its position as the world’s most profitable carmaker,
 Automotive News Europe  reported, according to the e-mailed
preview of an article that will appear in Tuesday’s edition.  Volkswagen AG needs to build five or six new plants
worldwide to meet demand, the magazine said, citing Chief
Executive Officer  Matthias Mueller . The VW Group plans to sell
10 million and 11 million cars a year and production capacity is
at a maximum 8 million, the magazine reported.  Mueller also said Porsche wants to sell 30,000 units a year
on average of the new 911, compared with about 20,000 units last
year when the old 911 came to the end of its life cycle.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
