Two German reporters held in  Iran 
for interviewing the son of a woman sentenced to death by
stoning have been handed over to German consular officers in
Tabriz, a  German Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.  The ministry hopes the pair will be in the care of the
German embassy by the end of the day, the spokesman, who
declined to be named in line with ministry policy, said by
telephone today.  Media reports earlier cited Iranian state television and
the  Islamic Republic News Agency  as saying that the journalists
had been fined about $50,000 each after being found guilty of
committing acts against Iranâ€™s national security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
