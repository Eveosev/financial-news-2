  Dana Gas PJSC , a fuel producer with
most of its output coming from Egypt, said production levels
were sustained during the weeks of protest in Egypt and after
the toppling of former President  Hosni Mubarak .  The company’s operations, located in the Nile Delta and
southern Egypt, are far from urban centers where most of the
demonstrations took place, Dana Gas said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “We continue along the path of growth projected for the
year,” Hany Elsharkawi, president of Dana Gas Egypt, said in
the release. “2011 promises to be yet another busy year for us
in Egypt, where we will continue to raise our production levels,
in addition to continuing our aggressive exploration-drilling
program in the Nile Delta and Southern  Egypt .”  Mubarak, Egypt’s ruler for 30 years, ceded power to the
military on Feb. 11 as a popular revolt swept the Arab world’s
most populous state. Since Feb. 13, Egypt has been governed by a
military council that has promised to lead the country through a
democratic transformation.  Dana Gas is developing deposits, production and
transportation facilities in Egypt. The company’s daily current
production in Egypt is more than 45,000 barrels of oil
equivalent. The company is planning a gas-processing plant to
process 120 million standard cubic feet a day in the Nile Delta
where the company continues its exploration, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
