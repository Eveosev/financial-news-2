  United Bank for Africa Plc , a
Nigerian lender, said its  Ivory Coast  subsidiary has suspended
operations because of the political crisis in the West African
country.  Operations have become “non-sustainable,” Liby Guillamme,
the chief executive officer of UBA Cote d’Ivoire, said today in
an e-mailed statement. The lender will resume business when the
situation improves, the statement said.  More than 300 people have been killed in post-election
violence after incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to
cede power to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized
winner of a Nov. 28 vote.  At least five banks closed for business this week because
of security concerns in the world’s biggest producer of cocoa.  Gbagbo on Feb. 17 ordered the seizure of “some” of the
banks that suspended operations, including units of BNP Paribas
SA and Societe Generale SA, according to a statement read out on
state-owned television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
