Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa Sp. z o.o.,
a Polish subsidiary of  Deutsche Telekom AG , may take top ranking
by revenue among the nation’s mobile phone companies as early as
this year,  Gazeta Wyborcza  said, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Miroslav Rakowski.  Purchasing a fixed-line operator is “not a question of
‘if’ but ‘when,’” said Rakowski, who became chief executive at
the beginning of this year, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
