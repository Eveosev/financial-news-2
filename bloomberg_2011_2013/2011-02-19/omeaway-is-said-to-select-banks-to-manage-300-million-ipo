HomeAway.com Inc. , the vacation-
rental website, has selected banks to manage an initial public
offering this year of as much as $300 million, three people with
knowledge of the plans said.  The banks include  Morgan Stanley ,  Deutsche Bank AG ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co . and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., said the
people, who declined to be named because the talks are private.
The share sale is likely to happen by June, two of the people
said.  Founded in 2005, HomeAway has gained users and expanded
internationally even as vacation-rental rivals such as  Airbnb
Inc.  have emerged. HomeAway is one of many U.S. Internet
companies planning to go public, joining online-radio provider
Pandora Media Inc., social-networking site LinkedIn Corp. and
Web-calling service Skype Technologies SA.  Eileen Buesing, a spokeswoman for Austin, Texas-based
HomeAway, declined to comment. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment, as did JPMorgan spokeswoman  Tasha Pelio  and Goldman Sachs’s Andrea Rachman. Scott Helfman, a
spokesman for Deutsche Bank, wasn’t reached for a comment.  HomeAway has raised about $500 million in private capital
from  Austin Ventures , also based in Austin, and Redpoint
Ventures in Menlo Park, California, which first invested in
HomeAway in 2005. Redpoint, along with Palo Alto, California-
based Technology Crossover Ventures and Institutional Venture
Partners, invested  $250 million  in 2008.  HomeAway has more than 540,000 rental listings in 120
countries, according to its website. Homeowners pay an annual
fee of about $300 to list, and the site is free for renters. In
addition to HomeAway.com, the company runs Vacation Rentals by
Owner, or  VRBO.com , and VacationRentals.com.  Last year, HomeAway bought Escapia Inc. and Instant
Software Inc., providers of software for vacation rentals, which
together represent almost 1,700 property-management customers,
HomeAway said in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
