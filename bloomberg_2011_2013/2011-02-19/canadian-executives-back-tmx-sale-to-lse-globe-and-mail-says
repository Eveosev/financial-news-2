Canadian executives such as Royal
Bank of Canada Chief Executive Officer Gordon Nixon back  London
Stock Exchange Group Plc ’s bid to buy  TMX Group Inc ., the owner
of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Globe and Mail  said , citing
its own “informal” survey.  Canadian executives and institutional investors contacted
for the survey express “broad approval” for the transaction,
the Globe said. Executives are optimistic that the deal will
benefit both traders and firms that seek capital, insisting that
the combination should not be blocked for political reasons, the
Globe said.  Even so, respondents want more details about the
transaction’s potential impact on public companies, traders and
the regulation of Canada’s stock markets, the Globe said the
survey showed. Leo de Bever, CEO of Alberta Investment
Management Corp., told the newspaper that  Canada  must ensure it
maintains national regulatory standards.  LSE agreed to bid about C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) for
Toronto-based TMX on Feb. 9. Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement said Feb. 14 he will review LSE’s bid for TMX to
determine whether the transaction is beneficial to the country’s
economy.  To contact the reporter for this story:
