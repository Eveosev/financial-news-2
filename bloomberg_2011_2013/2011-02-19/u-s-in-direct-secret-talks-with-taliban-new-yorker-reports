The Obama administration is secretly
in direct talks with senior Taliban leaders, the  New Yorker 
magazine reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the
discussions.  The talks are exploratory and aren’t yet working toward
negotiating an end to the fighting between the Taliban, U.S. and
NATO forces, the magazine said.  Mullah  Mohammad Omar , the Afghan Taliban leader, isn’t
participating in the latest discussions, nor does he attend
secret underground meetings of Taliban in Pakistani safe houses,
the New Yorker said.  The U.S.-led talks are aimed at producing a more fruitful
result than recent contacts between the Afghan government and
Taliban leaders, the magazine said. The U.S. wouldn’t be
directly involved unless the discussions focused on the presence
of international forces in Afghanistan or Taliban prisoners in
American custody, the New Yorker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Dan Hart  in Washington at
