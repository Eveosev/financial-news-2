  Germany  may give incentives to sales
of electric cars if  Daimler AG  keeps its stake in  European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Co NV ,  Spiegel  reported.  Daimler has requested the aid, and the government is
seeking ways to retain German influence in EADS in light of the
carmaker’s plans to sell its stake, the magazine said in the
preview of an article that will appear in Monday’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
