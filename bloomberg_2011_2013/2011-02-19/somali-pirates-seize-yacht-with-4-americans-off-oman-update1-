Somali pirates hijacked a yacht with
four U.S. passengers off the coast of  Oman , U.S. Central Command
said.  Central Command is monitoring the situation, said a
spokesperson for the military unit in Tampa,  Florida , who
declined to be identified. The Omani capital Muscat and
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, are about 1,700 miles apart.  The vessel was seized 240 nautical miles off the Oman coast
yesterday at 1:23 p.m. Universal Coordinated Time, according to
Ecoterra, an environmental group that monitors activity in the
region.  The yacht, S/Y Quest, is owned by Jean and Scott Adam, who
have been on a round-world sailing trip since 2004, Ecoterra
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The boat was traveling
from  India  to Oman’s southern port of Salalah, Ecoterra said.  Three days ago, Somali pirate Abduwali Muse was sentenced
to 33 years and nine months in prison for hijacking the
container ship Maersk Alabama in the  Indian Ocean  in 2009.  Thirty-one ships are being held by pirates in waters around
Somalia, with an estimated 694 hostages, according to data up to
Feb. 15 on the website of the  European Union’s Naval Force .  Somali pirates held British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler
for 388 days after seizing their yacht off the Seychelles in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
