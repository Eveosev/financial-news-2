Chicago Blackhawks coach Joel
Quenneville was released from the hospital after being treated
for gastrointestinal bleeding.  Quenneville, 52, is resting “comfortably at home” and is
expected to make a full recovery, the Blackhawks said in a
statement on their website. It’s not known when he’ll return to
the bench.  Quenneville, who led the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup
title last season, was admitted to the hospital four days ago
after becoming ill at his suburban Chicago home. Assistant Mike
Haviland has been coaching the team in his absence.  The Blackhawks are 29-23-6 this season, four points behind
the Anaheim Ducks for the Western Conference’s eighth and final
playoff spot. Chicago hosts  Pittsburgh tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
