U.S. stocks rose for the third
straight week, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its
highest level since June 2008, as the  Federal Reserve  raised its
forecast for economic growth and most companies reporting
earnings topped estimates.  Williams Cos. surged 13 percent, leading energy companies
to the biggest advance among 10 S&P 500 industries, after the
pipeline operator announced plans to spin off its oil and
natural-gas exploration unit.  Family Dollar Stores Inc . jumped
19 percent after investor  Nelson Peltz  offered to buy the
retailer.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc . gained 11 percent on
speculation the semiconductor maker is an acquisition target.  The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,343.01. The index needs to
advance 0.7 percent to 1,353.06 to complete a 100 percent rally
from its 2009 low. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained
117.99 points, or 1 percent, to 12,391.25.  “Earnings have come through spectacularly,” said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in  Boston . “Everything from a fundamental standpoint feels as good
as it’s felt in quite some time.”  The  S&P 500  has advanced 31 percent since last year’s low
in July as corporate profit surpasses analysts’ estimates for
the eighth straight quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Conference Board’s index of U.S. consumer
confidence climbed to an almost three-year peak in January, and
the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said businesses
expanded last month at the fastest pace since 1988.  Fed Minutes  On Feb. 16, minutes from the Fed’s Jan. 25-26 meeting
showed policy makers raised their projection for economic growth
this year to a range of 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent, compared
with a November forecast of 3 percent to 3.6 percent. The next
day, the Fed Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
showed regional manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace since
2004 in February.  Williams rose 13 percent to $30.37. The fourth-largest U.S.
pipeline operator by market value will sell as much as 20
percent of its oil and natural-gas exploration unit in an
initial public offering.  Family Dollar Stores jumped 19 percent to $52.55. Peltz’s
New York-based Trian Fund Management LP is proposing a bid of
$55 to $60 a share, according to a regulatory filing. The
second-biggest dollar chain in the U.S. may draw rival private
equity bids, said analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Nomura
Securities International Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  AMD Valuation  Advanced Micro Devices gained 11 percent to $9.18. While
its management vacuum is fueling speculation of a takeover, a
possible price tag of three times the average premium for
semiconductor makers may deter any acquirers.  AMD, whose chief executive officer resigned last month, has
gained 15 percent since two more departures announced on Feb. 9
reignited bets the second-largest maker of processors for
personal computers is vulnerable to a takeover. Acquirers of
chipmakers in the past five years offered a median of 14.5 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg that includes net debt.  That would value AMD’s equity at $12.8 billion, 120 percent
higher than its price the past 20 days. The average premium for
chipmaker deals since 2006 is 35 percent. Buying AMD at that
level would cost more than has been spent in all semiconductor
takeovers combined in the past four years for a company that has
reported only five years of profits since 2000.  Economic Reports  Home sales probably fell in January, while orders for long-
lasting goods climbed, a reminder that housing lags behind
manufacturing as the U.S. recovery strengthens, economists said
before reports next week.  Fourth-quarter profit exceeded the average analyst estimate
at 72 percent of the 395 companies in the S&P 500 that have
reported results since Jan. 10, Bloomberg data show. Dell Inc.,
the third-largest personal computer maker, iron-ore producer
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., and oil and natural-gas driller
Nabors Industries Ltd. advanced more than 9.5 percent this week
after beating forecasts.  Companies slated to report results next week include Home
Depot Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., all
Dow average companies. Priceline.com Inc., Mylan Inc. and First
Solar Inc. also have scheduled earnings releases.  Stocks fell yesterday before rising in the final hour of
trading after  China ’s central bank raised  reserve requirements 
for lenders 10 days after boosting  interest rates  as Premier  Wen
Jiabao  tackles accelerating inflation. Fertilizer companies such
as CF Industries Holdings Inc. slid as wheat declined.    Apple Inc ., the maker of iPad tablet computers, fell 1.8
percent to $350.56. The U.S.  Justice Department  and the Federal
Trade Commission are beginning to examine whether Apple’s new
media subscription service violates antitrust laws, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
