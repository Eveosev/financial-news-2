U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said  China  continues to resist a higher yuan, even as
it has begun to let its currency appreciate against the dollar.  “They’re still heavily leaning against the forces trying to
push their currency up,” Geithner said in a BBC television
interview. “But they’re beginning to move. They’re moving
against the dollar.”  In the interview, taped shortly before he departed Paris for  Washington , Geithner said this weekend’s Group of 20 meetings
there led to a “better outcome” than the U.S. expected.
Finance ministers and central bankers agreed to press ahead with
efforts to develop a global monitoring system and they defined a
set of economic measures for further study.  China and  Brazil , two emerging-market nations, joined
Germany and France and the U.S. in backing the agreement,
Geithner said. He said China is “feeling” international
pressure to allow the yuan to rise.  “It’s very important to all the countries that trade,
compete with China,” Geithner said. “That’s probably why I
think you’re seeing such a consensus around the room because I
think all those countries, and they’re competing with China
everywhere, understand how important it is that China moves, and
China’s sort of feeling that more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
