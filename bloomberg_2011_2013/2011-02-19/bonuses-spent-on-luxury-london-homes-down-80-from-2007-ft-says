The value of financial-industry
bonus pay spent on luxury properties in  London  will be 80
percent lower this year compared with 2007 as banks restructure
payments, the  Financial Times reported , citing data from
consultants  Savills Plc .  London bankers will invest about 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) of bonus money in premium property in 2011, compared
with 5 billion pounds four years ago, Savills predicts.
Financial workers are more cautious because more employers are
paying year-end compensation in shares and options rather than
lump sums of cash, Savills predicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
