The International Monetary Fund’s
basket of special drawing rights currencies should be expanded
to include the Brazilian real and the Chinese renminbi, Brazil’s
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told the  Financial Times .  Mantega called for an overhaul of the international
currency system to expand the use of the IMF’s special drawing
rights, or SDR, basket as a reserve currency, the newspaper
 reported  Mantega as saying.  The SDR is a composite of the dollar, euro, Japanese yen
and British pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
