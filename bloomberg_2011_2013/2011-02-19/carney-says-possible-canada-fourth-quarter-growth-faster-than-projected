Bank of  Canada  Governor  Mark Carney 
said it’s “possible” the economy grew at a faster pace in the
fourth quarter than the central bank projected last month.  “Is it possible that the fourth quarter is going to be
firmer than we had projected in our last monetary policy report?
Yes, it is,” Carney told reporters in Paris, where he attended
a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of 20. “Then the question is how much of that momentum
carries over into 2011, which is not based on one report but is
based on a series of reports, analyses, industry meetings,
surveys, etcetera, that we do.”  Recent reports have shown the country’s exports and
employment growing at a faster pace than expected by analysts,
prompting investors to raise bets that Carney will accelerate
interest rate increases this year.   The  Bank of Canada  last month projected annualized growth
of 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.5 percent in the
first quarter of this year.  Statistics Canada  is scheduled to
release fourth quarter GDP data on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
