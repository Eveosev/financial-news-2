Antonio Vivanco, formerly a top
adviser to President Felipe Calderon, was appointed as adjunct
chief executive officer of Comision Federal de Electricidad, the
state power company.  Current Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Elias Ayub will
leave his post shortly, according to an e-mailed statement from
the presidential office today.  Elias Ayub, who is the longest serving official in charge
of a major state company, became CEO of CFE, as the  Mexico  City-
based company is known, in January 1999, after being appointed
by former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.  Elias Ayub in 1992 wrote new rules allowing private
companies to distribute gas and generate electricity in Mexico.
In 2009, he oversaw CFEâ€™s takeover of Luz y Fuerza del Centro,
the smaller, money-losing state power company for Mexico City
and surrounding areas.  Alexis Milo will replace Vivanco as chief coordinator of
advisers to Calderon, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
