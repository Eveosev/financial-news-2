Algerian authorities surrounded
about 1,500 protesters in a peaceful sit-in in the capital
Algiers inspired by pro-democracy unrest in Egypt and  Tunisia .  The demonstrators chanted slogans against the Algerian
regime and called for democracy in the North African country.
Police, who outnumbered the protesters, separated about 50
government supporters carrying portraits of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from the anti-government demonstrators.  Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on Feb. 17 that the
country will lift a 19-year-old state of emergency before the
end of February. Bouteflika said on Feb. 3 that demonstrations,
banned under the state of emergency, would be permitted across  Algeria , except in the capital.  The end of the state of emergency has been a rallying point
for protesters who staged demonstrations across Algeria last
month. The measure was imposed after the cancellation of the
countryâ€™s first multiparty elections that Islamists were set to
win in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
