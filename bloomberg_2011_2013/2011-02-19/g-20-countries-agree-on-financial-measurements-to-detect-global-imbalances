Group of 20 countries have agreed to
an accord on the measurement of global imbalances that includes
private sector finances, public sector finances and the
components of the current account, an official with knowledge of
the talks said.  The accord will break out the current account into its
separate parts: a trade account of goods and services, a
“factor” account that includes income from interest and
dividends, and a transfer payments account like foreign aid
proceeds, said the official. The person declined to be
identified because the full agreement hasn’t yet been announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
