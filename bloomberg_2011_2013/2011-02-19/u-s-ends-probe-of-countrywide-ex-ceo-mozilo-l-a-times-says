California, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people
familiar with the prosecution and defense attorneys.  Mozilo declined to comment to the newspaper. Countrywide
was acquired by  Bank of America Corp . in 2008  Earlier this month, he and former Chief Operating Officer

predatory lending lawsuit filed by California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
