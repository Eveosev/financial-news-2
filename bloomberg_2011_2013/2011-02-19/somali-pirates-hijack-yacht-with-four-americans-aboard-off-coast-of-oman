Somali pirates hijacked a yacht with
four U.S. passengers off the coast of Oman, U.S. Central Command
said.  U.S. Central Command is monitoring the situation, according
to a spokesperson for the organization in Tampa,  Florida , who
declined to be identified. The Omani capital Muscat and
Somaliaâ€™s capital Mogadishu are about 1,700 miles apart.  The vessel was seized 240 nautical miles off the Oman coast
yesterday at 1:23 p.m. Universal Coordinated Time, according to
Ecoterra, an environmental group that monitors activity in the
region.  The yacht, S/Y Quest, is owned by Jean Adam and Scott Adam,
who have been on a round-world sailing trip since 2004, Ecoterra
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
