  Unilever NV ’s three biggest
shareholders are now willing to sell their cumulative preference
shares in the consumer-goods maker’s Amsterdam-listed holding
company, Dutch investors association VEB said.  Insurers ING Groep NV,  Aegon NV  and ASR Nederland NV, which
hold the majority of the preference shares and had voted last
May against the company’s buyback proposal, are now willing to
sell the stock “at a good price,” the VEB said on its  website 
yesterday, citing correspondence it had obtained. The buyback
price seems to be the only point of contention, the VEB said.  Unilever said last year the 155 million-euro ($212 million)
repurchase plan was aimed at resolving an imbalance between  voting rights  and ownership. The company said in its 2009 annual
report that ING, Aegon and ASR were the only holders of more
than 5 percent of Unilever NV’s share capital, and that their
interests were “mainly held in cumulative preference shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
