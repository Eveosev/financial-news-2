Helmut Schlesinger, former president
of German’s Bundesbank, said that the  European Central Bank ’s
purchasing of  government bonds  is similar to the monetary policy
during World War II,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, according to the
e-mailed pre-release of an article that will appear in the
magazine on Feb. 21.  Schlesinger said this kind of policy helped Germany and
other countries fund its war efforts and that the result was
inflation and currency reform, WiWo said, citing an interview
with Schlesinger, who served as head of the Bundesbank from 1991
to 1993, WiWo said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
