  Saudi Arabia  may lift a 2008 ban on
cement exports in the middle of this year,  Al Yaum  reported,
citing people familiar with the  Supreme Economic Council .  Saudi Arabia awarded new export licenses for cement
production companies in October 2009 to reduce cement prices in
domestic markets, the newspaper said.  The Supreme Economic Council was set up in 1999 to promote
the sale of state assets and boost investment by industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
