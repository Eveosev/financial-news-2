Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member of
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers,
backs  Mario Draghi  for European Central Bank president, the
Frankfurter Rundschau said.  The Italian central bank governor is highly competent, and
qualifications should trump nationality in the search for the
successor to ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet , Weder di Mauro
told the Frankfurt-based  newspaper  in an interview for today’s
edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
