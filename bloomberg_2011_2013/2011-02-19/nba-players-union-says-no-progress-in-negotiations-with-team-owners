The National Basketball Players
Association and team owners met for two hours without making any
progress in talks to reach an agreement to avert a lockout, said
Billy Hunter, the union’s executive director.  “I can’t say anything transpired,” Hunter said in a
televised press conference last night. “Everyone realizes time
is of the essence to avoid a lockout. We don’t want one.”  The two sides met yesterday for the first time in two
months amid the  National Basketball Association ’s All-Star
activities in  Los Angeles . The members of the All-Star rosters
and the team owners were invited to the negotiating session.  “There definitely was a commitment to trying to get this
process done in this room,” said Derek Fisher, union president
and a member of the  Los Angeles Lakers . “We haven’t gotten too
far into what the Collective Bargaining Agreement will look
like.”  The CBA expires June 30. At last year’s All-Star week
meeting, the players rejected the owners’ original proposal to
make changes in the structure of salaries and contracts.  The owners are seeking a hard cap, fewer guaranteed
contracts, shorter contracts and fewer exceptions to the salary
cap.  Hunter said there will be a meeting next week in  New York 
to set a schedule for future negotiating sessions.  “If it means we lose a season to get a good deal, we’ll
suffer some pay,” he said.  The 60th NBA All-Star game will be played tomorrow at
Staples Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
