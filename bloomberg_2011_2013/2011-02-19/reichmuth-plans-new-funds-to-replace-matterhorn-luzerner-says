Christoph Reichmuth, chief executive
officer of Reichmuth & Co., is planning to set up successors to
the private bank’s Matterhorn Fund, which will be dissolved next
week,  Luzerner Zeitung  reported.  The new funds will be open only to “known customers,”
Reichmuth told the Swiss newspaper in an interview, adding that
Matterhorn had returned around 7 percent a year over 13 years.  The bank managed more than 8 billion francs at the end of
2010, including about 25 percent in foreign assets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
