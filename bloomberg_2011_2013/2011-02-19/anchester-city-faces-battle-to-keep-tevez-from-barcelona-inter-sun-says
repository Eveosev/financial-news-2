Manchester City is facing another
fight to keep captain  Carlos Tevez , the Sun reported.  Barcelona and Inter Milan have interest in Tevez and City
officials are convinced the 27-year-old will look to move in the
summer after having a transfer request rejected earlier this
season, the Sun said.  City may also struggle to keep winger  David Silva  from
Atletico Madrid, the Daily Mail said.  Silva joined City from Valencia in June but is finding it
hard to adjust to life in England, the Mail said. That has
alerted Atletico, which wanted to sign him when he left Valencia
last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
