European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  declined to comment on press reports saying
Ireland’s Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish Nationwide Building
Society caused a  surge  in overnight borrowing costs.  “First of all, I will not discuss the process at all,”
Trichet said at a briefing in Paris today after a Group of 20
meeting, when asked about the two Irish lenders. “On the
particular case you were mentioning, I have nothing to say. I
will see whether with the central bank of Ireland, with the
suggestion to mention banks, will have anything to say.”  The  Irish Times  reported today that the Dublin-based banks
increased emergency borrowing at the ECB as the country’s
government prepares to sell assets and deposits of the lenders.
The newspaper didn’t say where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
