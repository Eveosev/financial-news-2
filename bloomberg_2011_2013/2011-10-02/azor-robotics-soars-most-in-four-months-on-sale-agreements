Mazor Robotics Ltd. (MZOR)  rallied the most
in more than two years after it sold two Renaissance spinal
surgery systems in the U.S. and Germany.  The shares advanced 22 percent, the biggest gain since May
2009, to 3.53 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  “Every publication about selling another robot is good
news and proof of the company’s ability to deliver its product
to the market,” said Natali Gotlieb, an analyst at I.B.I.-
Israel Brokerage Investment in Tel Aviv. “These are second-
generation robots. Their selling price is higher and Mazor’s
ability to sell them at a higher price is very important.”  Mazor said on Aug. 11 its second-quarter loss widened to
10.5 million shekels ($2.8 million) from 3.7 million shekels a
year earlier. The stock has retreated 40 percent since then
compared with a 1.4 percent drop for  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25
index.  The declines are another reason for the stock’s rebound
today, Gotlieb said. “It’s been awhile since we heard good
news,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
