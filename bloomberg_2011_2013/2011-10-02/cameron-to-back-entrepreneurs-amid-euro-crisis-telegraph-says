U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will support risk-takers and entrepreneurs with a pro-business
agenda at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this
week, the  Sunday Telegraph reported .  Cameron will say employment laws should be made more
favorable to businesses, according to the newspaper. Rules about
pension auto-enrollment, under which companies match employee
contributions, and unfair dismissal may hinder companies,
according to a report commissioned by the government, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
