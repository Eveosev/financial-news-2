The  U.S. dollar  advanced against the
euro, extending gains from last week amid concerns about a
global slowdown.  The dollar climbed to $1.3349 per euro in early Asia-
Pacific trading from $1.3387 at the end of last week in  New
York , and rose to 77.16 yen from 77.06 yen. The greenback was
little changed against the New Zealand dollar to 76.10 cents
from 76.14 cents and bought 96.62 cents per Australian dollar
from 96.62 cents.  The dollar and the yen strengthened last week as growing
evidence that the global economy is slowing boosted investor
demand for currencies perceived as being the safest.  The 17-nation euro posted its biggest monthly decline
against the yen in more than a year after data showed German
retail sales fell by more than economists forecast and U.S.
consumer spending slowed in August.  New Zealand ’s dollar
extended its second week of losses against its U.S. counterpart
after Standard & Poor’s joined  Fitch Ratings  in cutting the
nation’s credit ratings. The Swiss franc strengthened against
the euro even after the nation’s central bank said it will
prevent currency gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
