PBF Energy Partners LP’s Delaware
City oil refinery had a release of sulfur dioxide Sept. 30,
according to a filing with state regulators.  Michael Gayda, PBF’s president, didn’t immediately respond
to a phone call requesting comment.  PBF is expected to start a hydrocracker at the plant around
today, said a person with knowledge of plant operations on Sept.
26, who declined to be identified because the information is not
public.  PBF Energy, backed by private-equity firms Blackstone Group
LP and First Reserve Corp., bought the Delaware City plant from
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  for $220 million in June. The refinery was
shut by Valero in November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
