The  Big East  Conference will
“aggressively pursue discussions” with schools interested in
joining the league after the departures of  Syracuse University 
and the  University of Pittsburgh .  The presidents of the 14 remaining Big East schools and
 Texas Christian University , which is joining the conference next
year, voted unanimously yesterday to seek expansion.  Big East Commissioner John Marinatto was authorized to
negotiate with “a select number of institutions that have
indicated a strong interest in joining” the conference, the
league said in a statement. The Big East didn’t disclose schools
under consideration, though the U.S. Naval and Air Force
academies are possibilities, according to ESPN.  Syracuse and Pittsburgh accepted invitations on Sept. 18 to
join the Atlantic Coast Conference. Syracuse was one of the Big
East’s founding schools in 1979 and Pittsburgh joined the
conference in 1982.  When Syracuse and Pitt leave and TCU joins, the Big East
will have seven football-playing member schools, one short of
the requirement for an automatic bid to one of the Bowl
Championship Series postseason games. Retaining that automatic
BCS bid would be important when the Big East begins negotiations
on its next television contracts. The conference will have 15
members that play basketball.  Big East presidents also said they’re actively considering
changes to the league’s governing bylaws to further solidify the
membership of the conference. Those changes may include
increasing the cost to exit the league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
