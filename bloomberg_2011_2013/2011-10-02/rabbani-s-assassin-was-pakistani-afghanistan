The assassin of Burhanuddin Rabbani,
the former Afghan president and peace negotiator, was a
Pakistani, President  Hamid Karzai ’s office said today, citing
the conclusions of a panel that investigated the murder.  “Acquired evidence and the confessions of a man, who was
arrested in the connection with the death, prove Burhanuddin
Rabbani’s assassination was plotted in the city of Quetta in
Pakistan, and the person who carried out the suicide attack was
a Pakistani citizen,” an e-mailed statement from Karzai’s Kabul
office said today, citing the panel.  Members of the investigative committee, including Defense
Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, Interior Minister Bismullah Khan
Mohammadi, acting-chief of intelligence Rahmatullah Nabil and
Attorney General Mohammad Ishaq Alako, presented their
conclusions to Karzai in a meeting today, the statement said.  “Evidence and documents including biographies, addresses
and phone numbers of suspects involved in the incident have been
submitted to the government of  Pakistan  in order for them to be
arrested and handed over,” the statement said.  Rabbani was assassinated Sept. 20 by a suicide bomber who
hid explosives in his turban.  To contact the reporters on this story:
