The youth wing of  South Africa ’s
ruling  African National Congress  said it disbanded its executive
committee in President  Jacob Zuma ’s home province following the
region’s public support for him as party leader.  “As the only remedy to this situation, the special
national executive committee resolved to disband the provincial
executive committee of the ANC Youth League in Kwa-Zulu Natal
with immediate effect,” league spokesman Floyd Shivhambu said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The league’s provincial executive said in August it
preferred Zuma to continue leading the party after its elective
congress in December 2012. The ANC has banned public discussion
about party succession on the grounds it could divide the party.
The nomination process will be formally opened closer to the
conference, the party has said.  The Youth League, headed by  Julius Malema , said its
disciplinary committee will also press charges against three of
the provincial leaders who made the statement.  Malema also faces disciplinary charges for bringing the
party into disrepute and for calling for the removal of
neighboring Botswana’s government. He has previously said Zuma
must be replaced as president of the party and country by his
deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
