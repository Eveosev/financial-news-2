The elderly, disabled French woman
abducted by gunmen on the northern coast of  Kenya  yesterday has
been identified as Marie Dedieu, 66, Kenya’s  Sunday Nation 
reported, citing Tourism Minister Najib Balala.  Dedieu had arrived at a house on Manda Island with her
partner John Lepapa Moiyoi two days earlier from Paris, the
Nairobi-based newspaper reported today, citing Moiyoi who was
with her at the time of the attack and managed to escape.  A boat carrying Dedieu and her al Shabaab-linked abductors
entered Ras Kamboni, on the southern tip of Somalia, repelling
an attempt by the Kenyan navy to stop them, the newspaper said,
citing Kenya’s Internal Security Minister George Saitoti.  Kenyan police spokesman  Eric Kiraithe  didn’t answer his
mobile phone when Bloomberg News called seeking comment today,
and there was no answer at the French embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya’s capital, outside of regular office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
