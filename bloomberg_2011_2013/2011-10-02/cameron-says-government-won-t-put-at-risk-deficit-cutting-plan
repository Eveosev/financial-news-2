U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said he wasn’t going to deviate from his government’s deficit-
reduction strategy.  “We shouldn’t put at risk the overall picture of getting
the debts and deficits under control,” Cameron told the BBC’s
“Andrew Marr Show” in Manchester today. “Is it really a good
risk to spend a few more billion now and potentially put at risk
the low  interest rates  that are so key to economic         
revival?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
