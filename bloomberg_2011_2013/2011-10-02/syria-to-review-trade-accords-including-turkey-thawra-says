Syria  will review all its free trade
accords, including its pact with  Turkey , the official  Thawra 
newspaper said.  The  trade balance  favors Turkey as Syria exports a third of
what it imports from its northern neighbor, the newspaper said,
citing Nidal Al Shaar, Minister of Economy and Trade.  Syria and Turkey have been bound by a free trade agreement
since 2007, according to Thawra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
