The  Baltimore Ravens  scored three
defensive touchdowns in a 34-17 victory against the  New York
Jets , while the  Green Bay Packers  and  Detroit Lions  won to
remain the  National Football League ’s only unbeaten teams.  Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez had two fumbles returned for
touchdowns and threw a third-quarter interception that Lardarius
Webb took back 73 yards for another score last night at M&T Bank
Stadium in Baltimore.  The Ravens improved to 3-1 with their seventh straight win
against the Jets, who dropped their second road game in a row to
fall to 2-2. New York finished with 150 yards of offense,
including 38 yards rushing, its fewest since 2006.  “The performance by their defense was spectacular,” said
Jets coach  Rex Ryan , whose team will complete a three-game road
trip at New England on Oct. 9. “You just have to give them
credit. They made a lot of big plays and were coming after us.
We got it handed to us.”  The  New York Giants  pushed their winning streak to three
games by scoring two touchdowns in the final four minutes to
beat the Arizona Cardinals 31-27.  Eli Manning threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Jake Ballard
with 3:37 remaining and a 29-yard scoring pass to Hakeem Nicks
less than a minute later as the Giants rallied from a 10-point
deficit at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The Packers got six touchdowns from quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  in a 49-23 rout of the Denver Broncos, while the Lions
rallied from a 24-point third-quarter deficit to beat the host
Dallas Cowboys 34-30. It’s the first 4-0 start for  Detroit  in 31
years and was the largest blown lead in Cowboys history.  Bills Lose First  The  Buffalo Bills  were the only other unbeaten team
entering Week 4 and their streak ended with a 23-20 loss to the
Cincinnati Bengals, who got a 43-yard field goal from Mike Nugent as time expired in Cincinnati.  The Bills, Cardinals and Cowboys weren’t the only teams to
blow leads yesterday.  The Philadelphia Eagles (1-3) lost their third straight
game when the 49ers (3-1) rallied for a 24-23 win after trailing
23-3 midway through the third quarter in Philadelphia.  “It’s shocking and frustrating,” Eagles quarterback
Michael Vick, who passed for 416 yards and two touchdowns, said
during a news conference.  The New Orleans Saints won 23-10 at the Jacksonville
Jaguars (1-3), while the  New England  Patriots beat the Oakland
Raiders 31-19 and the San Diego Chargers defeated the Miami
Dolphins 26-16. The Saints, Patriots and Chargers are 3-1.  The Pittsburgh Steelers lost 17-10 against the Houston
Texans and the Atlanta Falcons held on for a 30-28 win against
Seattle when Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka was short on a 61-
yard field goal attempt with eight seconds left.  Metcalf’s Record  The  Chicago Bears  won 34-29 against the Carolina Panthers
as Matt Forte rushed for a career-high 205 yards and Devin Hester passed Eric Metcalf with his NFL-record 11th career punt
return for a touchdown.  In a matchup of winless teams, the Kansas City Chiefs beat
the Vikings 22-17, leaving Minnesota with a 0-4 record for the
first time since 2002. The  Washington Redskins  beat the St.
Louis Rams 17-10 and the Tennessee Titans defeated the Cleveland
Browns 31-13.  The Indianapolis Colts visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
tonight seeking to avoid their first 0-4 start since 1998, when
injured quarterback Peyton Manning was a rookie.  The Giants trailed 27-17 with 5:16 left in the fourth
quarter after Beanie Wells scored his third rushing touchdown
for the Cardinals. Manning then led consecutive scoring drives
to send  Arizona  (1-3) to its third straight defeat.  The Giants improve to 3-1 and now return home for three
games after playing three of their first four on the road.  The defending Super Bowl-champion Packers are 4-0 after
Rodgers passed for 408 yards with four touchdowns, and ran for
two more scores against the 1-3 Broncos.  The Lions outscored Dallas 31-3 over the final 26 minutes
at  Cowboys Stadium  to stay unbeaten.  Detroit returned two Tony Romo interceptions for touchdowns
in the third quarter and Matthew Stafford threw a pair of
scoring passes to Calvin Johnson in the fourth.  Johnson is the first player in NFL history to collect two
touchdown passes in each of his team’s opening four games. The
only other player to have four consecutive games with two
touchdown receptions was Cris Carter of the  Minnesota  Vikings
during the 1995 season.  “We did a great job in the second half as a team again,”
Stafford said at a news conference. “It’s crazy how it happens,
you just have to keep playing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
