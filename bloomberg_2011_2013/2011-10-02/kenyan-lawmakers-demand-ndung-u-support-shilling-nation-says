Kenyan lawmakers summoned central
bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u to explain what he’s done to stop
the slide of the shilling this year and urged measures to shore
up the local currency, the  Sunday Nation  said, citing Chris
Okemo, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on finance.  Kenya lawmaker Adan Keynan proposed on Sept. 30 that
legislators investigate the loss of value of the currency
against the dollar and publish their findings within four
months, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
