The French Senate elected Socialist
Jean-Pierre Bel as president after the country’s main opposition
party took control of the upper house for the first time in the
53-year history of the Fifth Republic.  Bel, 59, was elected with 179 votes in the first round
while Gerard Larcher, the outgoing president, obtained 134 votes
and Valerie Letard, a centrist senator, got 29 votes, according
to the Senate’s  website  late yesterday.  The Senate’s president represents  France ’s upper house,
organizing and leading its debates, according to its website.
The leader also has a role in guaranteeing the country’s
“continuity” and carries out the functions of the president of
the Republic if vacancy or impediment is established by France’s
constitutional court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
