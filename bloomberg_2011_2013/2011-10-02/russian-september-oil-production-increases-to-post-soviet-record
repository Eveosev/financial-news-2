Russian crude and gas condensate
production rose to a post-Soviet record in September and exports
jumped before Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  approved a new tax
structure raising the duty on fuel oil shipments.  Production reached 10.3 million barrels a day last month,
remaining at the highest level in the world, according to
preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit sent by
e-mail today. That is 0.2 percent higher than the previous
month’s 10.27 billion barrels a day and 1.2 percent higher than
in September of last year.  Crude oil exports surged to 5.47 million barrels a day, 7.2
percent more than in September of last year and 5.7 percent more
than in August of this year, according to the data.  Putin lowered the crude export tax rate from Oct. 1, while
raising the duty on heavy oil products, such as  fuel oil , to
spur investment in production. The leader, who may return as
president in the March election, has called for daily output to
remain above 10 million barrels for at least the next decade.
Oil is  Russia ’s largest source of  tax revenue . Soviet-era output
in Russia peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in 1987,
according to BP Plc data.  Lukoil Decline  OAO Lukoil, controlled by billionaires Vagit Alekperov and
 Leonid Fedun , remained the only of Russia’s five biggest oil
producers to show annual declines, as traditional fields in
western Siberia age. The company’s output at Russian fields fell
5.4 percent from a year earlier to 1.7 million barrels a day,
while remaining little changed from the previous month.  OAO Bashneft, the regional oil producer controlled by
billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov , lead the annual gain,
boosting output 5.3 percent to 307,400 barrels a day, that was
0.2 percent more than the previous month.  Russia reduced its export duty on most crude shipments by
7.4 percent to $411.40 a ton ($56.12 a barrel) as of Oct. 1
because of the new “60-66” tax measure and a decline in  oil
prices , on which the duty is based. The crude duty rate was
lowered to 60 percent from 65 percent last month under a decree
signed by Putin, while the tax on refined products was unified
at 66 percent of the crude levy. Given recent oil prices, that
decreased the tax on middle distillates such as diesel by 8.7
percent this month, while pushing up the rate for heavy products
by 31 percent.  Gas production fell 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 1.59
billion cubic meters a day. That was an increase of 7.6 percent
from the previous month, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
