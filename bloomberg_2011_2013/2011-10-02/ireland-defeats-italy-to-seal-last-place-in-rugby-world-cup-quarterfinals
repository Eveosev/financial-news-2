Ireland beat Italy 36-6 to advance to
the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals as the Pool C winner and
complete the last-eight lineup at the 20-nation tournament.     The win in Dunedin,  New Zealand , lifted Ireland atop Pool C
with 17 points from four victories and into a quarterfinal
against Wales on Oct. 8 in Wellington.  Australia  finished second
in the group and will face defending champion South Africa the
following day.  Argentina earlier beat Georgia 25-7 to set up a
quarterfinal against host New Zealand, which responded to the
loss of playmaker Dan Carter by routing Canada 79-15. Wales
defeated Fiji 66-0 in todayâ€™s other game to seal the runner-up
spot in Pool D.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
