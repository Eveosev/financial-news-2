Israel â€™s use of diesel fuel for
electricity production doubled during the first eight months of
the year, compared to the same period a year ago, due to the
interruption of the flow of gas from  Egypt , the National
Infrastructures Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
The use of diesel instead of gas cost the economy 10 million
shekels a day, on average, during the summer, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
