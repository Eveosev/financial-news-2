Saudi Arabia , which had a 10.8
percent unemployment rate in July, will begin to pay
 unemployment benefits  for the first time from November, Labor
Minister Adel Fakieh said today in Jeddah.  The government from next year also will seek to encourage
the hiring of more Saudi nationals in the kingdom’s private
sector, Fakieh said.  The government plans to sign agreements with Saudi banks in
2012 to monitor the wages of Saudis and foreign workers to
ensure nationals are earning salaries that increase in line with
the cost of living, Fakieh said.  The Ministry of Labor in March initiated efforts to reduce
unemployment and offset anger among citizens amid the “Arab
Spring” demonstrations that have swept North Africa and the
 Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
