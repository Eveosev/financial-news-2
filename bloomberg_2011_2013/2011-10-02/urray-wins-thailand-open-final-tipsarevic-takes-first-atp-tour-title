Britain’s  Andy Murray  beat Donald
Young of the U.S. in the final of the Thailand Open to win his
third ATP tennis title of the year. Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic
claimed his first-ever title at the Malaysian Open.  The 24-year-old Murray,  ranked No. 4  on the ATP Tour,
defeated the 55th-ranked Young 6-2, 6-0 in Bangkok.  “I served very well throughout and didn’t give him any
opportunities,” Murray told the ATP Tour’s website. “It was a
great match.”  Murray has also won at Queen’s Club in London and at the
Cincinnati Masters in 2011, while he was runnerup to Serbia’s
Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open. He reached his maiden ATP
final at the Thailand Open back in 2005, losing to Switzerland’s
 Roger Federer .  Young, 22, will break into the top 50 for a first time
tomorrow.  Tipsarevic, 27, ended his wait for a title with a 6-4, 7-5
victory against Cyprus’s Marcos Baghdatis in Kuala Lumpur. He’d
previously suffered four defeats in finals, including two this
year.  Yesterday, Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska beat Vera Zvonareva
of Russia 6-3, 6-2 to win the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
