William Morrison Supermarkets Plc,
the smallest of the four main U.K. supermarket chains, may buy
Garden Centre Group, the Mail on Sunday reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Other potential include Bridgepoint Capital Ltd.
and Duke Street Capital Ltd., the Mail said. The gardening
center outlet, formerly Wyevales, was put up for sale by  Lloyds
