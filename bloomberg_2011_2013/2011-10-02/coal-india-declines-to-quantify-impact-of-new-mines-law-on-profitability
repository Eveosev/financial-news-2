Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  won’t quantify the
impact of a new bill on mines on its profitability, Chairman
Nirmal Chandra Jha said.  “Since we do not know what this year’s profit will be, I
can’t talk about that number,” Jha said by telephone today.
“Our net profit from mining operations last year was about 70
billion rupees, and as per that, our outgo will be about 20
billion rupees.”  India’s cabinet approved a bill Sept. 30 that will make
companies mining coal and other minerals pay for development of
areas where they operate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
