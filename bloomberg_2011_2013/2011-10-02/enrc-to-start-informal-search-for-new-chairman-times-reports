Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., the
Kazakh ferroalloy producer that held a corporate governance
review, will start an “informal search” for a new chairman
even after the company confirmed incumbent Johannes Sittard’s
position on Sept. 28, the Sunday Times reported.  Brian Gilbertson, the former chief executive officer of BHP
Billiton Ltd. and chairman of Pallinghurst Resources Ltd., is a
candidate to replace Sittard as soon as the end of the year, the
newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify with knowledge
of the situation.  “The board is fully agreed on the structure and has no
intention to make any changes” to the chairman position, Mehmet Dalman, a senior independent director at ENRC, told the Sunday
Times. “We look forward to a period of stability to be able to
concentrate fully on the growth and profitability of the
business.”  ENRC did not immediately return an e-mail seeking comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
