Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe  is
in Singapore for the seventh time this year seeking medical
treatment, the  Zimbabwe Standard  said, citing Information
Minister Webster Shamu.  Doctors in Singapore will “review” an eye operation
performed on the 87-year-old president earlier this year, the
Harare-based Zimbabwe Standard said on its website, citing
Shamu. In March, Mugabe’s spokesman  George Charamba  said the
final review of Mugabe’s operation had been performed, the
Standard reported.  Leaked U.S. cables exposed by Wikileaks quoted Zimbabwe’s
central bank governor Gideon Gono as saying that Mugabe has
advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other organs, the
Zimbabwe Standard said.  Charamba didn’t answer his phone when called by Bloomberg
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
