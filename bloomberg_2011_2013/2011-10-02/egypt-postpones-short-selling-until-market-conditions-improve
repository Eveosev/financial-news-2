Egypt ’s stock market regulator
postponed introducing short-selling until “market conditions
improve,” Ashraf El Sharkawy, chairman of the Egyptian
Financial Supervisory Authority, said today.  “It’s not under consideration now,” he told reporters in
Cairo. “It wouldn’t make sense to start it considering current
market conditions.”  Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index fell 23 percent last
quarter, bringing its decline for the year to 41 percent after
the Arab nation ousted its president in February. Mohamed Abdel
Salam, the Egyptian Exchange’s former chairman, said in June the
exchange planned to introduce short-selling in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
