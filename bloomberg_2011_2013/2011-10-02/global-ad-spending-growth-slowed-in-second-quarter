Advertising spending declined
in almost half of the world’s most important media markets in
the second quarter, deflating global growth, as economic
concerns crimped sales, according to Nielsen Holdings NV.  Sixteen of 36 major markets, mainly in  Europe , experienced
a decline, while Asian countries posted a 9.3 percent increase,
Nielsen said. Overall ad spending rose by 5.7 percent in the
quarter, compared with 8.9 percent in the first three months of
the year, to about $127 billion, the information and
analytics company said in a statement.  Advertisers are looking for new avenues of growth as
consumer spending stagnates in many developed countries and
large corporations cut marketing budgets.  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s largest advertising company, is
doubling spending on acquisitions this year in order to focus on
fast-growing markets like  Brazil  and make inroads into digital
marketing, a relative bright spot compared with more traditional
media like newspapers.  The hardest-hit advertising markets in the second quarter
included Egypt, where spending declined by more than half amid
political turmoil, along with Spain and  Greece .  While WPP and Publicis SA are focused on acquisitions of
social media start-ups, television remains a robust destination
for advertising dollars. In the first half of the year TV
attracted $65 out of every $100 spent on ads globally, up from
$63.70 a year ago, according to Nielsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
