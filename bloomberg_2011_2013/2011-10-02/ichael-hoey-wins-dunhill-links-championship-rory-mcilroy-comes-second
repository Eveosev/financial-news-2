Michael Hoey resisted the challenge
of fellow Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell to
win golf’s Dunhill Links Championship.  Hoey’s final-round 68 at  St. Andrews  in  Scotland  today left
him on 22-under par for his second European Tour title and a
prize of 515,000 pounds ($802,000).  McIlroy was two shots behind, and McDowell shared third
place with Scotland’s George Murray on 18-under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
