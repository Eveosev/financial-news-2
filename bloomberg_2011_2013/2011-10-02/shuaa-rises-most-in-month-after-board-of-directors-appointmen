Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  rallied the most in
more than a month after the investment bank controlled by
Dubaiâ€™s ruler said it appointed Michael Philipp to its board.  The shares advanced 5.5 percent, the most since Aug. 23, to
79 fils at 12:18 p.m. in Dubai as four trades on the stock were
made.  The appointment fills a vacancy on the board and will bring
the total number of directors to eight, the company said.
Philipp was previously the chairman and chief executive officer
for Europe,  Middle East  and Africa at Credit Suisse Group AG, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
