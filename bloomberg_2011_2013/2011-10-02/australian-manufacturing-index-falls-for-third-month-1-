A gauge of Australian manufacturing
fell for a third month in September as a surging currency hurt
exports and the highest borrowing costs in the developed world
curbed demand at home.  The manufacturing index dropped to 42.3, the lowest level
since June 2009, from 43.3 in August, the Australian Industry
Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a survey released today.
It was the sixth month in seven the index was below 50, the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Weakness in manufacturing adds to the case for Australian
central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  to keep  interest rates 
unchanged tomorrow, extending a rate pause to 11 months. As the
nation’s job market weakens, Stevens may opt to keep borrowing
costs on hold until mid-2012, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists.  “Caution continues to be the order of the day with most
respondents uncertain about the outlook,”  Heather Ridout , chief
executive officer of the industry group, said in a statement.
“The usual suspects of weak domestic demand, the strong
Australian dollar, increased overseas competition and
uncertainty surrounding proposed carbon pricing continue to
weigh on the sector.”  Monthly employment growth averaged 2,800 from January
through August, less than a 10th of the average of 30,500 in the
first eight months of 2010.  Australia ’s unemployment in August
rose for a second straight month, reaching a 10-month high of
5.3 percent.  The manufacturing index’s reading on wages fell 7.1 points
to 61.9, today’s report showed. A gauge of employment fell 2.7
points to 45.7 and the production measure dropped 4.7 points to
39.2.  A gauge of new orders advanced 1.2 points to 44.6, the
report showed.  The manufacturing survey, which is similar to the U.S. ISM
index, polled more than 200 companies about production, new
orders, deliveries, inventories and employment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
