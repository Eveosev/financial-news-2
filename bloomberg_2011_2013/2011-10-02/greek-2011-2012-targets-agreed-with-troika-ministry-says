Greece  will take an additional 6.6
billion euros in deficit-cutting measures this year and next
year to ensure new budget targets are met, the Athens-based
Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  “As agreed with the troika, a combined approach to the
goals for 2011 and 2012 in the framework of the medium-term
fiscal strategy plan will ensure the achievement of the fiscal
goal for 2012 of an deficit of 6.8 percent of GDP, or 14.7
billion euros,” according to the statement. The measures will
mean a primary surplus of 3.2 billion euros in 2012, the
statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
