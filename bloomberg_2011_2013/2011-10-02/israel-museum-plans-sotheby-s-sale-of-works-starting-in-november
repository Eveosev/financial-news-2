The  Israel Museum  in  Jerusalem  plans
to sell 39 impressionist and other artworks at Sotheby’s
starting in November in the hope of raising more than $17
million for new modern art acquisitions, its director said.  “The idea was to be very selective and take a group of
works where we were overly represented and raise funds to
acquire works in the same period where we have gaps or
weaknesses,” director James Snyder said in a phone interview.  The collection of Marc Chagall is strong but could be
improved with works by the artist from before the 1920s, Snyder
said. The modern art wing, while owning a good representation of
 Pablo Picasso , could add some “analytic cubist” works by the
master, he said.  The Sotheby’s sale, which will run through February in  New
York  and  London , follows the completion of the national museum’s
three-year $100 million makeover that included the creation of
new galleries and public spaces and a review of the
institution’s 500,000-piece collection.  On offer will be “Le cirque” by  Marc Chagall , “Le
Louvre, matin, printemps,” by Camille Pissarro, and “Ledroit
chemin” by Rene Magritte, among others, according to an e-
mailed statement from Sotheby’s, whose list gave pre-sale
estimates for six of the pieces that came to as much as $11.6
million.  There are 3,500 modern art pieces currently at the museum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
