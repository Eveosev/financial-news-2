Swiss business groups and labor
unions will urge the central bank to increase its franc ceiling
against the euro from 1.20, SonntagsZeitung reported, without
saying from where it obtained the information.  Heads of the Swiss industry association Swissmem and
union leaders will meet with the  Swiss National Bank  this month,
the Zurich-based  newspaper  reported.  Labor unions are pushing for a ceiling of 1.30 to 1.40
versus the euro to prevent an exodus of jobs abroad, while
Swissmem President Hans Hess had also called for a weakening of
the franc toward 1.35 or 1.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
