Naspers Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest media
group, bought online advertising company  Slando  from Michael
Pennington and Simon Crookall, the founders of Gumtree, they
said in a statement.  The site, with 11 million users in eastern  Europe  and
Russia, was sold for an undisclosed price to Cape Town-based
Naspers. Slando brought the idea of flat-sharing to Russia and
has hosted advertisements for items of Stalin’s clothing,
diamonds and an entire oil refinery, according to the statement.  “We spotted a massive opportunity in Eastern Europe and
Russia, particularly because Internet usage was so low,”
Pennington said in the statement. “Over the past few years it
has grown exponentially and will continue to do so.”  Gumtree.com is the largest classified site in Britain with
13.7 million visitors every month, according to its  site .  To contact the reporter on this story:
