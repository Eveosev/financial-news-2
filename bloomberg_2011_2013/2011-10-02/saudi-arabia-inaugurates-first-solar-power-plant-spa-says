Saudi Arabia inaugurated its first
solar power plant as the worldâ€™s largest oil exporter seeks to
diversify energy sources, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported.  Government-owned utility  Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO)  and Showa
Shell Sekiyu K.K., a Japanese energy company partly owned by
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., built the plant on Farasan Island off the
Red Sea coast, SPA said yesterday. The plant will save 28,000
barrels of  diesel fuel  normally sent to the island, SPA said,
without saying how often the island receives such shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
