The new Libyan government may seek to
review pre-existing contracts with Italy, La Stampa  reported ,
citing unidentified Libyan authorities.  Members of Libyaâ€™s transitional council told Italian
Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini  that they cannot guarantee
contracts at this time because it will be up to the new
government, once it is in power, to make specific decisions, La
Stampa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
