UBS AG (UBSN)  interim Chief Executive
Officer  Sergio Ermotti  and Chairman Kaspar Villiger met with
undisclosed investors last week in Zurich, SonntagsZeitung
reported, without saying from where it obtained the information.  Ermotti and Villiger presented their plan for the future of
UBS after unauthorized trading at its investment bank, according
to the report in Zurich-based SonntagsZeitung. UBS said last
month it may be unprofitable in the third quarter after a rogue
trader lost $2.3 billion.  UBS will give all details at its investorsâ€™ day in
November, according to a spokesman at the Zurich-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
