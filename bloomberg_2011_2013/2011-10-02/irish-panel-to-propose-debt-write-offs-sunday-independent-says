The Irish cabinet will receive a
report next week from a group chaired by Declan Keane that
proposes changes to Ireland’s bankruptcy laws and mortgage debt
write-offs by banks for some homeowners, the Sunday Independent
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Any government response to the report will stress that
mortgage repayment is the “best option,” the Dublin-based
newspaper said. Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  has
already ruled out blanket mortgage forgiveness for homeowners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
