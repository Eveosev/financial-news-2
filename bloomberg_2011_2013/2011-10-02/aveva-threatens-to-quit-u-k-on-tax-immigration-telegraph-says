Aveva Group Plc (AVV)  Chief Executive
Officer Richard Longdon threatened to move the software
engineering company out of the U.K. over business limitations
such as the 50 percent  tax rate  and curbs on immigration,
according to the Sunday Telegraph.  The top tax rate should be scrapped and restrictions on
immigration should be lifted to make it easier to attract
foreign talent, the newspaper reported, citing the executive.
Longdon may consider taking Aveva to Hong Kong if conditions
donâ€™t improve in the U.K., according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
