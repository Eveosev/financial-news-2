Irish home asking prices fell 3.2
percent in the third quarter from the previous three months,
Dublin-based online property company MyHome.ie said.  House prices slipped 3.8 percent in Dublin, it said in a
statement today. This brings the decline from the peak of the
market in late 2006 to 42 percent nationally and 48 percent in
Dublin, according to MyHome.  House prices nationally fell 13.8 percent from the same
period a year earlier, while in Dublin the corresponding figure
is 15.2 percent, according to the report.  The average asking price nationally for an Irish house now
is 241,000 euros, according to MyHome. Prices will probably
continue to fall for the rest of the year, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
