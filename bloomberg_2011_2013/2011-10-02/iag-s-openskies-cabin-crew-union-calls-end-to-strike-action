France ’s SNPNC-FO cabin-crew union
will end a strike against Openskies, a unit of International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA, today at 11:59 p.m., Paris time,
despite getting “no concrete response” from directors of the
airline, it said in an e-mailed statement.  The strike, which began on Sept. 21, was called as the
union sought to negotiate an agreement to set standard rules
that give crew more predictability in scheduling and job
descriptions, as well as more-transparent pay practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
