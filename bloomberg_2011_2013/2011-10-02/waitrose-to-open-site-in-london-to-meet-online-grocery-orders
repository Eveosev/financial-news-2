Waitrose Ltd., a U.K. supermarket
chain owned by John Lewis Partnership Plc, said it will start
delivering orders from its first ‘dark store’ in  London .  The Dotcom Fulfilment Centre in Acton, converted from a
former John Lewis distribution center at a cost of 3 million
pounds, will begin dispatching orders on Oct. 4, according to an
e-mailed statement from Waitrose.  “We see huge potential for our online business across the
country and in the important London market,” Mark Price,
managing director of Waitrose, said in the statement. The store
will initially handle 2,000 orders a week from customers.  The company started delivering Internet orders in July from
its existing branches, according to the statement. The center
has created 200 new jobs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
