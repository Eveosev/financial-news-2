Chile’s draft 2012 budget calls for
Congress to approve a plan to sell as much as $6.5 billion in
bonds, La Tercera reported, citing a statement from the  Economy
Ministry  yesterday.  The government’s request would be less than the $7.8
billion authorized for this year, La Tercera said. The bonds
could be sold in either pesos or a foreign currency, the
Santiago-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
