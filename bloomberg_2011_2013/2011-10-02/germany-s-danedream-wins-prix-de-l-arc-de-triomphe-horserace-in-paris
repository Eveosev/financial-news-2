German-trained Danedream won the Prix
de l’Arc de Triomphe,  Europe ’s richest horserace, at Longchamp
in Paris today.  The three-year-old, a 20-1 shot ridden by Andrasch Starke
and trained by Peter Schiergen, went clear in the final straight
to win in a record time of 2 minutes, 24.49 seconds. Shareta was
second and Snow Fairy came third as fillies clinched the first
three places.  “This is my best moment in racing. I don’t believe it, she
was such an easy winner,” Schiergen told reporters. “It’s
fantastic, she’s the best horse I have trained. It’s a great
moment.”  The Arc is Europe’s top race for three-year-olds and older,
over a distance of 1 1/2 miles. It’s worth about $3 million to
the winner.  Danedream, a late entry for this year’s race, is the second
German-trained winner of the event, Star Appeal having won in
1975.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
