Swiss lenders’  investment-banking 
business poses “large risks” to the economy and tougher
capital rules will lead to change, Peter Siegenthaler, who heads
a government-appointed panel on the new regulations for large
banks, said in an interview with  NZZ am Sonntag .  The rules have “created an incentive that should lead to
changes in the business models” of  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) , Siegenthaler told the Zurich-based newspaper in the
interview published today. “If not, the involved risks mean
that one has to impose even tougher regulation.”  Investment banking practices before 2008 do not have an
“added value for our economy,” he said. “I’m convinced that
this manner of investment banking is posing large risks that
can’t be passed on to the state.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
