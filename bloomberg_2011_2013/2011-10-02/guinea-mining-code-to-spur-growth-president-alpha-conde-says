Guinea ’s adoption of a mining code
will boost growth and protect national interests, according to
President Alpha Conde.  “This is an important step towards growth and economic
emergence,” Conde said in a televised speech from the capital,
Conakry. “Exploitation of mining resources will not be made any
more. We will also insure stability and profitability of
investments for our partners.”  Guinea , the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, adopted a
mining code last month that will give the West African nation a
35 percent stake in commodity companies. United Co. Rusal,
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., and  Vale SA (VALE3)  are among the companies that
operate in Guinea.  The nation is celebrating its 53th anniversary of
independence from  France  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
