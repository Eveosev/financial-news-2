Three women won in Bahrain’s special
parliamentary elections held on Sept. 24 and Oct. 1, bringing
their total number in the 40-seat assembly to four.  State-run Bahrain News Agency reported late yesterday that
two female candidates won in yesterday’s run-off elections while
a third won uncontested before the first round of elections that
was held on Sept. 24. The fourth candidate was elected in the
October 2010 polls.  The ballots were held to fill 18 seats vacated by lawmakers
from  al-Wefaq  group, the biggest Shiite Muslim party, who quit
in protest at a crackdown on mostly Shiite demonstrators earlier
this year. Al-Wefaq boycotted the elections. It was not clear
how many of the new 18 lawmakers are Shiite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
