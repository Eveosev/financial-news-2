Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South
African retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , will repeat
a price-cut promotion at its stores and open 23 new outlets over
the next eight months.  Massmart reduced prices for 10 weeks starting in July,
shortly after Wal-Martâ€™s acquisition of a controlling stake was
approved by South African authorities. The latest promotion will
run from today until Dec. 4, according to an e-mailed statement
from the company. The first promotion saved consumers over 50
million rand ($6.1 million), the company said.  The company will open 23 new stores in the next eight
months, which will help its plans to create 15,000 jobs over the
next three years, Massmart Chief Executive Officer Grant Pattison said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
