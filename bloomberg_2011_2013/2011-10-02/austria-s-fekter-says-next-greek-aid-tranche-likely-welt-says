Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said she expects the next aid tranche to  Greece  to be
paid out,  Welt am Sonntag  newspaper reported, citing an
interview.  “The likelihood that the next tranche of 8 billion euros”
($10.8 billion) “will be paid to Greece in October is in my
view clearly higher than the likelihood of not being paid out,”
Fekter was quoted as saying. She also backed demands by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel to give European authorities the right
to intervene in national budgets if fiscal rules are violated,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
