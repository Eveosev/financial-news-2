Stelios Haji-Ioannou , the founder of
 Europe ’s second-biggest discount airline  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , is working
on plans to offer transatlantic flights through a new carrier
branded Fastjet, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Fastjet is unlikely to compete with EasyJet on low-cost
European routes, the newspaper said, without saying where it got
the information. Stelios refused to comment on his plans for
Fastjet in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
