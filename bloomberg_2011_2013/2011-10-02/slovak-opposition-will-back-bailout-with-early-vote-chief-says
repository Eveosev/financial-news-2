Slovakia’s largest opposition party
is ready to back the European bailout-system overhaul if the
ruling parties agree to early elections or the governing
coalition is reshuffled, Smer party Chairman  Robert Fico  said.  The government of Iveta Radicova is seeking backing for the
package designed by European Union leaders to strengthen the
European Financial Stability Facility, the region’s temporary
bailout fund. One ruling party, Freedom and Solidarity, or SaS,
opposes the measures, and Radicova must gain opposition support
to push it through parliament.  Should the coalition fail to get SaS support in a Oct. 14
vote, Smer “will vote for the EFSF, but it wouldn’t be that
this government will continue and pretend that everything is all
right,” Fico said today in a debate on state Slovak Television.
“Don’t worry, the EFSF will be approved.”  A rejection of the package in Slovakia, one of the three
euro area nations that haven’t ratified it, may derail the plan
aimed at stopping the debt crisis from spreading. European
Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, a Slovak national, urged national
backing of the package during a visit two days ago.  SaS has said that Radicova has presented an unspecified
compromise that may meet the party’s conditions for backing the
overhaul. Still, on Sept. 30 she said the agreement hasn’t been
reached and negotiations will continue with the party’s head and
parliamentary speaker Richard Sulik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
