Lawyers for five activists in the
 United Arab Emirates  accused of threatening security and
insulting the president said the men are not being treated
fairly while in jail.  Mohammed Roken, lawyer for two of the five men on trial,
told the federal  Supreme Court  that the defendants are often
subjected to solitary confinement and attorneys are not
permitted to cross examine witnesses in the case. None of the
defendants were present in court today.  Activists circulated an online petition in April demanding
that balloting for seats on the Federal National Council, a
government advisory board, be held through universal elections.
The petition, signed by about 140 people including academics and
journalists as well as the five people on trial, also called for
the constitution to be amended to give the body full legislative
and regulatory authority.  Elections for the council were held last week with about 15
percent of all U.A.E. citizens entitled to vote, based on the
national electoral college system.  The five activists were arrested in April on charges that
include participating in an online pro-democracy discussion
group called UAE Hewar. The verdict is expected Oct. 9.  Amnesty International, the Arabic Network for Human Rights
Information, Front Line Defenders, and  Human Rights Watch  called
the trial “fundamentally unfair” in a joint e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
