Chi-X  Europe  Ltd., the region’s
alternative trading platform, and Russell Investments introduced
European equity indexes that will compete with benchmark gauges
compiled by Stoxx Ltd. and MSCI Inc.  The four new measures use Russell’s methodology and Chi-X’s
prices, the two companies said in a statement today. Two of the
indexes focus on companies in the euro region, and two also
include stocks in other parts of Europe.  Chi-X Europe, a London-based company which started in March
2007 and is owned by banks and brokers, signed a deal with
Russell to create the new gauges in March as a step toward
expanding into derivatives. Seattle-based Russell operates
indexes that account for $3.9 trillion in assets.  Chi-X Europe has agreed to be acquired by Bats Global
Markets, the operator of the second-largest alternative trading
system in Europe. The merger was referred to the U.K.
Competition Commission in June and the regulator is due to issue
a report by Dec. 2.  Chi-X Europe was the first alternative trading platform in
Europe to contend with traditional exchanges such as  London
Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  by offering
lower fees and faster trading.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Chi-X Europe and Russell in providing financial indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
