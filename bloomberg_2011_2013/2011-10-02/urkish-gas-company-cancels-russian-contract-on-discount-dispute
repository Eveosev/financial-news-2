Botas Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima
AS canceled a natural-gas supply contract with  Russia ’s export
monopoly after failing to agree on discounts.  Botas, as the Turkish gas distributor is known, decided to
allow the contract to buy 6 billion cubic meters of gas a year
to lapse, OAO Gazprom’s press service said today, without
elaborating.  The cancellation doesn’t mean natural-gas purchases from
Russia will stop, Turkish Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  told
reporters at the parliament in Ankara yesterday, according to
the state-run Anatolia news service. Botas wanted a lower price
than Gazprom was willing to allow, Yildiz said Sept. 29.  Firms from  Turkey ’s private sector will probably sign new
contracts with Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer and
Russia’s exporter of fuel, within three months to continue the
gas flows, Anatolia reported, citing the minister.  Botas’s press service wasn’t immediately available to
comment when called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
