Greece â€™s budget for next year aims at
a deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product of
5.7 percent to 5.9 percent, state-run NET Radio reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The budget will target a primary surplus of 2 billion euros
and debt is seen stabilizing at around 160 percent of GDP, the
broadcaster said. The economy will shrink at a slower pace than
the 5.5 percent forecast for this year, contracting for a fourth
year in a row, NET said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
