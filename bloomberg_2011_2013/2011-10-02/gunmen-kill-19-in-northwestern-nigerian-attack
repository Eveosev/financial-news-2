Gunmen killed 19 people early today
in Lingyado village, in  Nigeria ’s northwestern Zamfara
state, Police Commissioner Tambari Yabo said.  “I believe it was a reprisal attack in a fight that has
been ongoing between Fulani herdsmen and the local vigilante
group in the area,” Yabo said today by phone from Gusau, the
state capital. Dozens wounded in the attack are being treated at
the Gusau General Hospital, he said.  Three people were killed in a separate attack in the
northeastern city of Maiduguri after a bomb was hurled at a
military patrol vehicle by suspected Islamic militants,
Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Muhammed, a spokesman for the military
 task force  in the area, said today by phone from the city. The
attack occurred last night, he said.  Authorities in Nigeria blame Boko Haram, a militant group
inspired by  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a wave of
violence since last year targeting government buildings and
security forces. The group claimed responsibility for the Aug.
26 suicide car-bomb attack on a United Nations building that
claimed 23 lives and wounded 71 in the capital, Abuja.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, is split between a
mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More
than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the
West African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the
Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
