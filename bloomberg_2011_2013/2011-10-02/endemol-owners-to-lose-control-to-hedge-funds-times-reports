Owners of Endemol NV, the Dutch
producer of the “Big Brother” TV shows, will lose control of
the company in a restructuring that will reduce debt from 2.2
billion euros ($2.9 billion) to 500 million euros, the Sunday
Times reported.  Shareholders such as Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi ’s  Mediaset SpA (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Cyrte
Fund II BV, will have their stakes diluted when  hedge funds 
holding the company’s debt swap it for equity, the newspaper
reported. Goldman Sachs may lose as much as 500 million euros on
the deal, according to the Sunday Times.  Goldman Sachs and Endemol didn’t immediately return phone
calls seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
