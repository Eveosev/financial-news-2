Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  board member Thomas Schmidheiny said he plans to increase his stake in the Swiss
cement maker to 20 percent from 18 percent, without specifying
when, SonntagsZeitung reported, citing an interview.  Schmidheiny said he’s “impressed” with the Swiss central
bank’s ability to defend its franc ceiling of 1.20 versus the
euro, the Zurich-based newspaper reported today.  Switzerland ’s
tourism sector and export industries are “only fully
competitive at an exchange rate of 1.40, however,” he was
quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
