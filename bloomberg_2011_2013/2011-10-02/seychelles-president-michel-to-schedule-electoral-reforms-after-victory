Seychelles President James Michel
said electoral reforms will soon be on the agenda in an
announcement after his  People’s Party  won all 25 seats in the
Indian Ocean island nation’s parliamentary elections held over
three days.  The  Electoral Commission  will start national consultations
on the reforms, Michel said in a statement on television today.  The Seychelles National Party, led by Wavel Ramkalawan,
pulled out of the vote, accusing the government of reneging on
an earlier a promise of political reform. The election was a
sham and an undemocratic process, Ramkalawan said by telephone
today.  Six additional National Assembly members from the winning
party will be nominated this week, according to the country’s
partly proportional electoral system, Hendrick Gappy, chairman
of the Electoral Commission, said today in Victoria, the capital.  The new National Assembly’s first major task will be to
examine the national budget later this year. The national
currency of Seychelles depreciated by 2.1 percent during the
quarter through September, its worst in four, and closed at
12.5005 on Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
