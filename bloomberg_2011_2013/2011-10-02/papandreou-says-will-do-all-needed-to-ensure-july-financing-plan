Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said his government will do all that’s needed to
restore the country’s prestige and ensure a July 21 financing
package is implemented.  “Important decisions which need to be taken on a European
level depend first and foremost on us,” Papandreou told his
ministers today in Athens, according to an e-mailed statement
from his office. “We need to show our dedication to reaching
the goals.”  Papandreou said that a special meeting of euro area finance
ministers will be held on Oct. 13 to discuss an evaluation of
 Greece ’s progress by the heads of a European Union,
International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank mission,
known as the troika.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
