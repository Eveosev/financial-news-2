Iran resumed natural-gas exports to
 Turkey  after an eight-day halt following an explosion on the
pipeline on Turkish territory, the state-run  Fars  news agency
said, citing Javad Owji, managing director of the National
Iranian Gas Co.  Imports of Iranian gas were halted on Sept. 22 at the
request of Turkey’s state gas distributor, Boru Hatlari ile
Petrol Tasima AS, known as Botas, which said at the time that it
needed to examine the pipeline and repair “probable defects.”
Shipments resumed Sept. 30, Fars said.  Iran exports 30 million cubic meters of natural gas a day
to its western neighbor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
