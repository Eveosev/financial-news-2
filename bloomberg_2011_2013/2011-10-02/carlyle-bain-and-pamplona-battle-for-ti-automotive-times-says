Carlyle Group LP, Bain Capital LLC
and Pamplona Capital Management LLP are the final bidders for TI
Automotive, a closely held auto-industry supplier put up for
sale this year, the Sunday Times reported.  A preferred bidder for the Oxford, England-registered
company may be chosen in the coming weeks, the newspaper said,
without saying where it got the information. Offers are expected
at about 900 million pounds ($1.4 billion), the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
