Used-home sales in 10 of  Hong Kong ’s
largest private developments were unchanged on Oct. 1 to Oct. 2
compared with a week ago as negative property news and global
financial market turmoil dented buyers’ confidence, Centaline
Property Agency Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement today. Ten
transactions were recorded, it said. Buyers may have exercised
caution ahead of the Hong Kong government’s policy address this
month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
