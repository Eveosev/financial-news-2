Danny Smalley speaks with Bloomberg's
David Evans about his daughter, Danielle Smalley, and the 
foundation which promotes pipeline safety that bears her name.  In 1996, a leak in a Koch Industries Inc. butane pipeline 
led to an explosion that killed 17 year-old Danielle. The 
November issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine examines the 
history of some illegal and improper practices of the global 
empire run by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
