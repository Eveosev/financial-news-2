Jonah Lomu, the leading try scorer
at Rugby World Cups, may need a second kidney transplant because
a donated organ he received in 2004 is failing, the  New Zealand 
Herald  reported .  The former All Blacks winger, who was diagnosed with
nephrotic syndrome in 1995, is undergoing daily treatment after
being admitted to Auckland Hospital’s renal unit last month, the
newspaper said, citing an interview with Lomu and his wife,
Nadene, in New Zealand Women’s Weekly magazine.  “They’ve said there’s a very slim chance this kidney may
survive,” the Herald cited Nadene Lomu as telling the magazine.
“So for now Jonah’s having dialysis every day and a load of
other treatments to see if it can be revived.”  Lomu, who was the special guest at the World Cup opening
ceremony on Sept. 9, played 63 Tests for New Zealand and scored
37 tries, including a record 15 at the 1995 and 1999 World Cups.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
