Russian stocks may extend their
biggest quarterly decline since 2008 amid prospects a global
recession will stymie the nation’s already slowing economy by
cutting demand for commodities, trading in futures shows.  Contracts on Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS index expiring
in December dropped 1.9 percent to 129,305 on Sept. 30, as the
measure in Moscow slid 3.5 percent, bringing its slump in the
three months to Sept. 30 to 30 percent. The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF) 
lost 18 percent in the period, the worst quarter for both
indexes since the last three months of 2008. The Micex may slip
2.5 percent at the open today, according to  Alfa Bank .  The Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index of Russian companies
traded in  New York  dropped 3.8 percent to 85.74, bringing its
quarterly loss to 32 percent as German retail sales in August
declined the most in more than four years, fueling concern that
the region’s debt crisis is hitting consumer demand in  Europe ,
Russia’s biggest trading partner. Data today may show U.S.
factories grew last month at the slowest pace since July 2009,
adding to speculation about faltering global growth.  “The markets are driven by this type of uncertainty and
fear, a real crisis of some kind approaching,” Mattias Westman,
managing director of Prosperity Capital Management, the largest
Russia-focused equity investor with about $5 billion under
management, said in a phone interview from London on Sept. 30.
“People can’t really quantify the risk of something really bad
happening. A lot of people just want out.”  Faltering Economy  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global
growth for 2011 and 2012 to 4 percent on Sept. 20, reducing
previous estimates of 4.3 percent and 4.5 percent respectively.
Oil and gas make up 17 percent of  Russia ’s gross domestic
product, which expanded 3.4 percent in the second quarter, the
slowest pace since the three months to Sept. 30 2010.  Oil declined 17 percent in the three months to Sept. 30,
also the worst quarter since the global financial crisis, which
was ignited by the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
September 2008. Crude for November delivery dropped 3.6 percent
to settle at $79.20 a barrel in New York at the end of last
week, the lowest settlement since Sept. 29, 2010.  The delay in resolving Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis,
which spurred $9.4 trillion to be wiped off global stock markets
last quarter, may push the world economy into another economic
slump,  Josef Ackermann , Deutsche Bank AG’s chief executive
officer said last week.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  is Russia’s largest maker of coal for
steelmakers and about 19 percent of the company’s 2010 sales
were to Europe.  Mechel (MTL) ’s American depositary receipts declined 6
percent in New York to $10.19 on Sept. 30, bringing its loss in
the third quarter to 57 percent, the most since the last quarter
of 2008.  European Delays  “If Europe continues to kick the can down the road, there
will be continued pressure on markets such as Russia, until
policy makers there deliver some real solutions,” Vlad Milev, a
Los Angeles-based analyst at Metzler Payden, which manages $750
million in assets, said in a phone interview on Sept. 30.
“Russia is still a good market long term, but there are very
few reasons for momentum at this stage.”  Russia’s Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin was ousted last
week after refusing to serve in a government under President
 Dmitry Medvedev  because of spending disagreements. Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin , who was president from 2000 to 2008,
said on Sept. 24 that he’ll swap jobs with Medvedev by running
for the presidency again in March elections. Kudrin oversaw
Russia’s recovery from its 1998 debt default and presided over
budget surpluses through Putin’s presidential term.  Gazprom, Lukoil  American depositary receipts of OAO Gazprom, the world’s
biggest natural gas exporter, fell 3.3 percent to $9.55,
bringing their loss for the quarter to 34 percent, the most
since the last quarter of 2008. Gazprom fell 1.9 percent on the
Micex index on Sept. 30 to 156.07 rubles, or the equivalent of
$4.83.  OAO Lukoil, Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, fell
2.6 percent in New York to $50.19 for a 21 percent third-quarter
loss. Lukoil in Moscow dropped 1.1 percent to 1,637.40 rubles,
or the equivalent of $50.64.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , a Russian television network, was the
biggest decliner on the Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index last
quarter, tumbling 58 percent, the most since the last three
months of 2008. The stock fell 3.2 percent to $8.90 in New York
on Sept. 30 and was downgraded last week to “neutral” from
“overweight” at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Moscow-based company
cut its forecast for revenue growth to 15 percent from 20
percent on Sept. 12 because of lower-than-anticipated audience
share.  Yandex Tumbles  Yandex NV, the operator of Russia’s most popular Internet
search engine, lost 42 percent last quarter. Dow Jones Newswires
reported on Sept. 29 that Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh
told investors that the company had lost ground to Google Inc.
Yandex spokesman Ochir Mandzhikov didn’t immediately reply to a
phone call and e-mail requesting comment after hours in Moscow
on Sept. 30.  Netherlands-registered Yandex, which trades at 38 times
analysts’ estimates for its earnings, fell 9.5 percent to $20.46
on Sept. 30, its lowest level since going public on May 24 at
$25 a share. The shares sank 20 percent last week.  “In these times, when people are very cautious, that’s an
excuse for some rapid selling,”  Prosperity Capital ’s Westman
said. “Yandex has one of the highest valuations in the markets,
so it has further to fall.”  ‘Open Interest’  Investor unease about Russian equities can be illustrated
in the drop in number of RTS futures contracts that were rolled-
over to December from those that came due on Sept. 15, according
to Luis Saenz, chief executive officer of the U.S. unit of
Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp.  The number of contracts in “open interest” has fallen to
about 617,000 valued at about $1.6 billion, from more than 1.2
million contracts on Sept. 14 valued at about $3.5 billion,
according to Otkritie. Open-interest contracts are both long and
short bets on equities that haven’t closed.  The decline is largely due to Russia-based traders exiting
the market because price volatility has made it difficult for
them to “meet their margin calls,” Saenz said in a phone
interview from  London , referring to brokers’ demands for cash
from investors to cover adverse price movements. The average
margin requirement for RTS futures rose to 18 percent over the
past two weeks, from 10 percent in early September, he said.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures, rose the most in a week on Sept. 30, gaining
7.7 percent to 57.27 points. The index more than doubled in the
three months to Sept. 30, its biggest advance since the third
quarter of 2008.  Metals Fall  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 2.5 percent to
1,131.42 on Sept. 30, losing 14 percent in the quarter, its
worst performance since the last three months of 2008. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lost 2.1 percent to 10,913.38, falling
12 percent in the third quarter.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell
2.6 percent to 591 as commodities recorded their biggest
quarterly drop since the end of 2008. Nickel declined 5.7
percent to settle at $17,600 a ton on the London Metal Exchange,
while copper for delivery in three months slid 2.2 percent to
settle at $7.018 a metric ton. Gold futures gained 0.3 percent
to $1,622.3 on the Comex in New York.  Lower Valuations  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 6.5 percent to $25.30, down 34
percent last quarter, while the Bank of New York Mellon Russia
ADR Index dropped 5.1 percent, for a 36 percent quarterly drop.  The Micex has slipped 19 percent in 2011 and trades at 4.9
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member stocks. That
compares with a 25 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index,
which trades at 9 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at
10.9 times estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index
has a ratio of 13.7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
