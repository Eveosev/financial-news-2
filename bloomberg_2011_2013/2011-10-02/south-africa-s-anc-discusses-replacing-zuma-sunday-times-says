The ruling  African National Congress 
party has begun discussions about replacing President  Jacob Zuma 
with his deputy Kgalema Motlanthe at its elective conference in
December next year, the  Sunday Times newspaper  said today.  Party structures in the Johannesburg and Pretoria regions
have circulated documents calling for Motlanthe to succeed Zuma,
the Johannesburg-based paper said, citing internal documents.  The ANC’s spokesmen, Jackson Mthembu and Keith Khoza, did
not immediately respond to telephone calls and  text messages  to
their mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
