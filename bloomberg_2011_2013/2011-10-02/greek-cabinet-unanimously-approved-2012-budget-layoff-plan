Greece ’s Cabinet unanimously approved
the government’s 2012 budget and plans to place 30,000 state
workers in a labor reserve system, a government official said.  The labor reserve system, which will reduce spending on
wages for those workers before they are dismissed, will mainly
target workers who are due to retire in the next 24 months, said
the official, who declined to be named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
