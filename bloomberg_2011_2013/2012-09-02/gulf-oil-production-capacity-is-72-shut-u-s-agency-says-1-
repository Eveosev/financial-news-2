     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg) --About 72 percent of the Gulf of
Mexico’s daily crude oil output is still shut because of
Hurricane Isaac, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said.  The agency said the daily equivalent of about 986,698
barrels a day of oil production was offline, while about 56
percent of the Gulf’s daily natural gas output was shuttered as
of 12:30 p.m.  New York  time, down from 65 percent yesterday.  About 22 percent of production platforms in the Gulf and 24
percent of drilling rigs were evacuated, the agency said in a
report on its  Web site , down from 37 percent and 25 percent
yesterday.  “Once all standard checks have been completed, production
from undamaged facilities will be brought back on line
immediately,” BSEE said.  The Gulf accounts for 23 percent of U.S. oil output and 7
percent of natural gas production.  Yesterday, about 94 percent of the region’s daily oil
output was offline, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
