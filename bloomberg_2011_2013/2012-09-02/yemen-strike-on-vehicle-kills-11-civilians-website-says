An air strike in central Yemen
killed 11 non-combatants, including nine men and two women, an
independent Yemeni news website reported.  The attack yesterday in the city of Radaa in al-Baidha
province was thought to have missed the intended target, a
vehicle carrying an al-Qaeda militant, the al-Masdar website
reported. The website said it wasn’t clear whether the strike
was launched from a U.S. drone or a Yemeni warplane.  The incident, which the website said provoked anger among
tribesmen, follows two separate strikes last week that killed at
least 11 suspected militants in the southeastern province of
Hadramaut.  The Association of Southern Provinces Clerics called the
the Aug. 29 strike, which it said killed a cleric named Salem
bin Ali Jaber, “heinous.”  The Yemeni government asks for the help of U.S. drones
“where there is a need against the militants who have gone to
plot terrorist attacks,” Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi said
in an interview Aug. 29 with  Bloomberg News .  A Defense Department spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Todd
Breasseale, said “as a general rule, we don’t comment on
reports of specific counterterrorism operations in Yemen.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
