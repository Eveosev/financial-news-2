China will reopen its stock markets
to  trust companies  to help increase the number of investors,
according to a statement posted on the China Securities
Regulatory Commission website.  The notice , posted on Aug. 31, doesn’t specify when the
change will take effect.  Policy makers are striving to revive confidence in
securities markets and boost economic growth. The Shanghai
Composite Index fell to the lowest level since February 2009 on
Aug. 31, capping a fourth month of losses.  The CSRC’s notice didn’t specify when trust companies were
banned from investing in stocks. The prohibition was based on
verbal notices in 2009, the Oriental Morning Post reported
yesterday.  Two phone calls today to the CSRC’s press office outside
business hours were unanswered.  The regulator has already announced a 20 percent reduction
in transaction fees on equities trading. That cut, which took
effect yesterday, will save investors 600 million  yuan  ($94
million) in the last four months of the year, the regulator
estimated on Aug. 2.  The commission outlined guidance for participation by
securities companies in regional equity rights exchanges in a
separate  statement  on Aug. 31.  --Fan Wenxin, Bonnie Cao. Editors:  Jim McDonald , Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg news staff on this story:
