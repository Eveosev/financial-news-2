Egypt sold the targeted 5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($819 million) of treasury bills as yields
declined after the nation’s currency posted the biggest monthly
drop of the year.  The North African country accepted bids for 1 billion
pounds of three-month notes and 4 billion pounds of nine-month
securities, according to data on the  Finance Ministry ’s website.
The average three-month yield retreated eight basis points, or
0.08 of a percentage point, from last week’s sale to 14.15
percent, the lowest since April. The nine-month yield decreased
seven basis points to 15.79 percent.  The sales are part of a  plan to borrow  52 billion pounds
this month after the government raised 94 percent of its target
so far this quarter. The Egyptian pound, subject to a managed
float, weakened 0.4 percent in August, its third month of
declines, to 6.1028 a dollar on Aug. 31, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That day it fell to as low as 6.1072 a
dollar, the lowest since December 2004.  Egypt  doesn’t plan to devalue the pound, President Mohamed
Mursi told Reuters in an interview last week, becoming the
latest government official this year to speak on the matter
after similar assurances by Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
dropped three basis points to 5.43 percent on Aug. 31, taking
the month’s decline to 104 basis points. That compares with a
seven basis-point drop to 5.98 percent in the Middle East
average, according to the JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBIG Mideast
Sovereign Yield Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
