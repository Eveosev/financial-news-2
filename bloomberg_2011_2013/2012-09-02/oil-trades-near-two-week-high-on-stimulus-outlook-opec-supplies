Oil dropped from the highest closing
price in almost two weeks as manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted in  China  and crude production resumed in the Gulf of
Mexico after Hurricane Isaac.  Futures fell as much as 0.5 percent in New York after the
biggest monthly gain since October. China’s Purchasing Managers
Index shrank for the first time in nine months in August, a
government survey showed Sept. 1. A separate measure by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today showed the fastest
contraction since March 2009. China is the world’s second
biggest oil user. About 72 percent of daily crude output in the
Gulf of Mexico is shut, from as much as 95 percent last week,
the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.  “The primary reason is the reaction to the PMI figure in
China,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets
in Sydney. “The general run of indicators in recent months has
shown an easing in the Chinese economy and the manufacturing
sector in particular.”  Crude for October delivery slid as much as 46 cents to
$96.01 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $96.20 at 2:46 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract rose 2 percent on Aug. 31 to $96.47, the highest level
since Aug. 22. Prices climbed 9.6 percent in August for a second
monthly gain and are down 2.7 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement decreased 37 cents to
$114.20 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Prices advanced 9.2 percent last month. The European
benchmark grade’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate was at $18,
compared with $18.10 on Aug. 31.  Uptrend Channel  Floor trading in New York will be closed for the U.S. Labor
Day holiday today. Electronic trading will halt from 1:15 p.m.
to 6 p.m. local time before resuming, exchange owner CME Group
Inc. said on its  website .  New York  oil has technical support at $95.76 a barrel,
along the bottom of an uptrend channel on the daily chart,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This channel started
from the 2012 intraday low of $77.28 on June 28. Buy orders tend
to be clustered near chart-support levels.  China’s Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.2 in August
from 50.1 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said Sept. 1. The figure
was below the estimates of 24 of the 25 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The final reading for the HSBC and Markit Economics
report fell to 47.6 from a preliminary figure of 47.8 provided
Aug. 23. The dividing line between expansion and contraction for
both surveys is 50.  Gulf Output  Oil also fell amid signs of increasing supply. Production
in the  Gulf of Mexico  from undamaged platforms will resume
immediately after checks have been completed, the BSEE said on
its website. The equivalent of about 986,698 barrels a day of
oil and 56 percent of daily gas output was offline as of 12:30
p.m. New York time yesterday, it said.  Crude shipments from  Iraq , the second-largest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, rose for a
fourth month in August, according to Falah al-Amri, the head of
the State Oil Marketing Organization. Exports increased 2
percent to 2.57 million barrels a day from July, he said on
Sept. 1 from  Baghdad .  OPEC production slipped 75,000 barrels to an average 31.988
million barrels a day last month from a revised 32.063 million
in July, according to a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts. Output in  Iran  fell 350,000 barrels to
2.75 million barrels a day, the lowest level since February
1990.  Saudi Arabia , the biggest producer in OPEC, pumped 9.9
million barrels a day, unchanged from July.  Net-long positions in oil held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity trading advisers, in
the seven days ended Aug. 28 advanced 7.2 percent, to 192,471
futures and options combined, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
