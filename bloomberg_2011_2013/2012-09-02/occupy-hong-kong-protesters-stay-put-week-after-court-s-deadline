Occupy Central protesters in Hong
Kong remained at the ground floor plaza of  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) ’s
Asian headquarters yesterday, almost a week after a court
deadline ordering them to leave the site passed.  More than a dozen people sat on couches and chairs
surrounded by bookshelves, tents and wooden boards, one pinned
with a sign that said “here to stay.” They were outnumbered
by hundreds of foreign domestic helpers gathered in the area
on their day off.  The demonstrators were ordered to leave the area by 9
p.m. on Aug. 27 by Hong Kong’s Court of First Instance last
month. The city will assign a bailiff to execute the order,
Master R. Lai said on Aug. 13.  Riya Mahbu, a 48-year-old former teacher originally from
Spain, said she hadn’t witnessed any attempt by authorities to
evict the protestors. Mahbu said she had regularly visited the
demonstrators over the past four months.  The Occupy Central protest in  Hong Kong , one of the
longest-running demonstrations sparked by the  Occupy Wall
Street  movement, numbered about 50 at the peak. Activists in
New York were evicted in November and in  London  in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
