England defeated  South Africa  by 6
wickets in their fourth one-day cricket match at Lord’s in
London to take a 2-1 lead in their series.  England reached 224-4 after 46.4 overs. Ian Bell’s 88 runs
put the hosts in control after South Africa set a target of 221
runs. Bell and Jonathan Trott, who scored 48, combined for 141
runs after captain  Alastair Cook  was out for 2.  The victory means England will keep the top spot in the
International Cricket Council’s one-day rankings until at least
January.  Hashim Amla led the visitors with 45 runs, with AB de
Villiers adding 39 and Dean Elgar hitting 35 as South Africa
finished 220-8 in its 50 overs.  James Tredwell  was 3-35 and Ravi
Bopara was 2-34 to lead England.  The hosts defeated South Africa by 4 wickets two days ago
to even the five-match series after losing the Aug. 28 match.
The series opener was abandoned Aug. 24 because of rain in
Cardiff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
