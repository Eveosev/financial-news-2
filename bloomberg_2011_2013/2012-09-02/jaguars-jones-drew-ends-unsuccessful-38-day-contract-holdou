Maurice Jones-Drew, who led the
 National Football League  in rushing last season, reported today
to the  Jacksonville Jaguars , ending a 38-day contract holdout.  Jones-Drew, 27, hasn’t negotiated a new deal, team
spokesman Ryan Robinson said in an e-mail.  Shahid Khan , who
bought the Jaguars last year, said repeatedly that the team
wouldn’t renegotiate Jones-Drew’s contract this season.  Jones-Drew has two years remaining on a five-year deal
worth $31 million, according to ESPN. The three-time Pro Bowl
selection has accrued $1.2 million in fines after missing
training camp and all four of Jacksonville’s preseason games.  “I had a really good visit this morning with Maurice and I
welcomed him in,” Jaguars coach Mike Mularkey said in comments
e-mailed by the team. “He’s ready to go, so we’ll be working
with him to get him up to speed as quickly as possible. It’s
great to be able to proceed with our preparation for the opener
and the season beyond with Maurice as part of the plans.”  First-year coach Mularkey has already named Rashad Jennings
as starting running back for the first game of the regular
season on Sept. 9 against the  Minnesota Vikings .  Chosen by the Jaguars in the second round of the 2006 draft,
Jones-Drew has rushed for more than 1,300 yards in each of the
past three seasons. In 2011, he carried the ball 343 times for
1,606 yards to lead the league in both categories.  To contact the reporters on this story:
