Egyptian shares surged to the
highest level in almost six months after Qatar’s  QNB Group (QNBK) 
expressed interest in buying a majority stake in  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA’s Cairo unit.  National Societe Generale Bank SAE (NSGB) , Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded lender after  Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI) , advanced the most since November 2008. CIB rose to the
highest since May last year. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed
1.7 percent to 5,424.79, the highest since March 7, at the close
in Cairo. Qatar’s measure fell 0.3 percent, while the Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index lost 0.6 percent.  Talks for QNB to buy a stake from Paris-based Societe
Generale, which owns  77.2 percent  of the Cairo-based bank, were
at an early stage, NSGB said after markets closed on Aug. 30.
Societe Generale’s stake was valued at about 10.8 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.77 billion) based on NSGB’s closing price
last week. A request to conduct due diligence was presented to
 Egypt ’s central bank, NSGB said.  “Local investors are expecting a favorable valuation by
QNB for NSGB,” said Teymour El-Derini, Cairo-based director of
Middle East and North Africa sales trading at Naeem Brokerage.
“It’s a boost to sentiment, which is looking up for the rest of
the year.”  World’s Top Performer  Egypt’s benchmark gauge has surged almost 50 percent this
year, making it the world’s best-performing gauge among the 92
tracked by Bloomberg. NSGB rose 10 percent to 34.77 pounds, the
highest since Jan. 27, 2011, the last day of trading on the
Egyptian Exchange before a two-month suspension due to the
popular uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. CIB added 5 percent
to 31.60 pounds.  QNB shares fell 0.4 percent to 133.6 riyals in Doha.
Elsewhere, in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, Dubai’s
DFM General Index slipped 0.1 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s measure
fell 0.2 percent. Bahrain’s index dropped 0.8 percent, Kuwait’s
measure advanced 0.6 percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All
Share Index lost 0.6 percent.  Israel’s TA-25 Index retreated 0.5 percent. The yield on
the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bonds maturing in January 2022
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.19
percent at the close in Tel Aviv. The yield jumped 28 basis
points in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
