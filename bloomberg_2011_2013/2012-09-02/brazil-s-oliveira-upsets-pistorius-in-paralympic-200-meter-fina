Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira of
Brazil upset South Africa’s  Oscar Pistorius  in the 200-meter T44
final at the London Paralympic Games.  Oliveira ran 21.45 seconds, passing Pistorius in the
straightaway at London’s Olympic Stadium. Pistorius finished in
21.52 seconds, and Blake Leeper, a 23-year-old American, got the
bronze medal in 22.46.  The 25-year-old South African, who was born without fibulas
in both legs and is nicknamed “ Blade Runner ” for his J-shaped
carbon fiber legs, last month became the first amputee runner to
compete at the Olympics when he ran the 400-meters and as part
of South Africa’s 1,600-meter relay team.  Oliveira, 20, set a record for an athlete from the Americas
in the final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
