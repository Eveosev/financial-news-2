Chile’s GNL Mejillones, a liquefied
natural gas terminal in northern Chile, signed a 20-year
contract with  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , La Tercera reported, citing GNL
Mejillones General Manager Frederik Janssens.  The agreement gives BHP, the world’s biggest mining
company, access to the terminal and defines the capacity it will
be able to use and the rate it will pay, the newspaper said,
without providing more details.  GNL Mejillones, 37 percent owned by Codelco, will start
negotiations with current and prospective clients to close long-
term contracts by the first half of 2013, La Tercera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
