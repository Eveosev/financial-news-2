The European Stability Mechanism,
the euro area’s permanent rescue fund, is unlikely to be
successful if  Germany ’s highest court rules against it this
month, ESM chief Klaus Regling told  Der Spiegel .  “Without Germany, the ESM doesn’t make any sense,” the
magazine quoted Regling as saying in an e-mailed preview of a
story to be published tomorrow. If all euro-area states meet
targets and improve their competitiveness, the debt crisis “can
be overcome in one to two years,” Regling said, according to
the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
