South Korea ’s inflation slowed to
the weakest pace in 12 years in August, according to a report
released 10 days before the central bank reviews  interest rates .  Consumer prices increased 1.2 percent from a year earlier
after a 1.5 percent gain in July, Statistics  Korea  said today in
Gwacheon, south of  Seoul . The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 12 economists was for a 1.4 percent gain. Prices
rose 0.4 percent from July.  Europe’s debt crisis and austerity measures are weighing on
exports and confidence across Asia, weakening production and
growth in countries from Japan to China to South Korea. The Bank
of Korea held rates steady last month after an unexpected
reduction in July. Weak inflation gives more room for another
cut in the benchmark.  “A rate cut is likely in September to support growth,”
Lee Min Koo, a Seoul-based economist at Eugene Investment &
Securities Co. said before today’s data.  Core consumer prices, which exclude oil and agricultural
products, advanced 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier.  The  Bank of Korea  cut its forecast for the nation’s growth
this year to 3 percent from 3.5 percent on July 13 and is likely
to make a further reduction in October, according to Lee Sung Kwon, a Seoul-based economist at Shinhan Investment Corp.  Signs the economy is cooling include an Aug. 29 report that
the current-account surplus climbed to a record in July because
of declining imports. An index measuring manufacturers’
confidence for September was at 75 from 70 the previous month,
the only readings below 80 since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
