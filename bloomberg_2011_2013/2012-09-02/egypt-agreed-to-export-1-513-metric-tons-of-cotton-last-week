Egypt  agreed to export 1,513 metric
tons of cotton in the week through Aug. 30, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said.  The country has shipped 90,327 tons of the fiber, valued at
$280 million, since the marketing year began Sept. 1, 2011, the
association said today in a weekly bulletin. Of last week’s
agreed sales, 213 tons were of the Giza 88 variety and 1,300
tons were Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
