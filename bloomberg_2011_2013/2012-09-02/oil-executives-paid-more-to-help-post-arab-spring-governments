North African nations emerging from
civil unrest are offering foreign oil executives 50 percent wage
increases to help them revive their energy industries, a London
recruiting firm reported.  Demand from  Egypt  and Libya is pushing up the wages of oil
and gas executives, according to  Interim Partners .  “Post-Arab Spring countries want to retain control over
their energy resources rather than engage too many large foreign
contractors,” Jonathan Mooney, a consultant at Interim
Partners, said in a report today. “Using interims is an astute
way to rapidly ramp up production to pre-conflict” while
providing training to local staff, he said.  The average daily rate for interim project engineering
directors has jumped to 1,500 pounds ($2,373) from 1,000 pounds
a year ago, the recruitment firm said.  Companies operating in  Africa , the Americas and Australasia
face the biggest challenge in hiring local staff because of a
skilled  labor shortage , according to a  separate report  released
last week by  OilCareers Ltd.  and  Air Energi Ltd.  Their survey
covered more than 170,000 oil and gas respondents in more than
50 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
