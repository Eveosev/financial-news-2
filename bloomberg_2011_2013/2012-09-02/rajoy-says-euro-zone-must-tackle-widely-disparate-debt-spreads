A situation in which widely
differing spreads exist in the cost of financing among euro zone
nations cannot last for too long and the problem must be
resolved, Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  says in interview
with newspapers.  *Rajoy comments in joint interview with Spain’s ABC, Germany’s
Bild am Sonntag, France’s Le Journal du Dimanche, Italy’s
Corriere della Sera
*Rajoy has “total and absolute conviction that the euro is
irreversible,” he tells newspapers
*Spain’s banks will be “absolutely secure” after country
receives EU100b in European aid for its financial system, Rajoy
says
*Spain hasn’t made any decision on seeking a further bailout and
will wait to see what steps the ECB takes, Rajoy tells
newspapers
*Spain’s existing commitments to cut deficit mean it will comply
with conditions for eventual bond buying program by ECB, Rajoy
says
*Spanish regions including Catalonia must comply with their
commitments to cut their deficits, Rajoy says
*Rajoy will seek to cut income tax as soon as it can, Rajoy says
*A Greek exit from euro would be “monumental failure” for
European Union, Rajoy says  To contact the reporter on this story:
