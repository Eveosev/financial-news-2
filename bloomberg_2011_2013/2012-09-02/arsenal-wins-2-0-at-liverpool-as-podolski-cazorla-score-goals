Arsenal won 2-0 at Liverpool as new
signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla scored, sending the
hosts stumbling to their worst league start in 50 years.  Podolski’s left-foot strike went past Liverpool goalkeeper
Pepe Reina in the 31st minute for the Gunners’ first goal of the
season. Cazorla’s shot snuck under the keeper in the 68th
minute.  Liverpool has beaten the north London club once in the last
11 league matches, and the loss pushed the Reds to their worst
start in 50 years. Liverpool has 1 point from the first three
games, which matches the start from the 1962-63 season as the
worst in the club’s history.  For Arsenal, which started the season with two 0-0 draws,
it was the first time in 88 years the team hasn’t allowed a goal
in its first three matches.  Newcastle hosts  Aston Villa  and Southampton meets
 Manchester United  in the day’s late matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
