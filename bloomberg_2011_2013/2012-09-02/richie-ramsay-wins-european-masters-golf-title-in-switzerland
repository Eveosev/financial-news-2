Scotland’s Richie Ramsay carded a 5-
under-par final round to win golf’s European Masters by four
strokes and collect his first title in almost three years.  The 29-year-old finished on 16-under 267 at Crans-sur-
Sierre in Switzerland, with Australia’s Marcus Fraser, France’s
Romain Wattel, Sweden’s Fredrik Andersson Hed and Danny Willett
of England on 12-under.  Ramsay’s countryman  Paul Lawrie , who has been named in the
Europe team for the Ryder Cup, was among three players another
shot behind.  Ramsay’s only previous European Tour victory was at the
South African Open in December 2009. He collects 350,000 euros
($440,300) for today’s win, the biggest prize of his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
