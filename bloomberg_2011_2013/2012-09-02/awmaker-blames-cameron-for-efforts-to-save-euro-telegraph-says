U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
should stop trying to help ensure survival of the European
single currency in its current form, Conservative Party lawmaker
 David Davis  said, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Some “fracturing” of the euro area is “inevitable,” and
a managed breakup of the currency zone will be less harmful to
the British economy than a decade of financial austerity in
Europe, Davis said, according to the newspaper. Additional cuts
in taxes and spending in the U.K. before the next general
election are “unavoidable,” the Telegraph reported, citing
Davis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
