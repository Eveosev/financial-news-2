Rory McIlroy has a one-stroke lead
going into the third round of the PGA Tour’s Deutsche Bank
Championship, the second in the FedExCup playoff four-event
series.  McIlroy, ranked No. 1 in the world, fired a 6-under 65
yesterday to finish 36 holes at 12-under 130 at the TPC  Boston 
in Norton,  Massachusetts .  Louis Oosthuizen is in second place at 11-under 131 after
carding a 65 yesterday, while Tiger Woods shares third with  Ryan
Moore  after both shot 3-under 68s to enter today’s play at 10-
under.  “I was very happy with the two scores that I’ve got
already and know that I need to go out and play just as good
tomorrow to give myself a chance going into Monday,” McIlroy,
the 2011 U.S. Open champion, told reporters yesterday.  “I
think there’s been a big improvement in my putting from last
week to this week.”  Woods missed six birdie putts from inside 18 feet.  “I didn’t make anything today,” Woods said. “I hit it
pretty good, but made nothing. Well, I was two shots back going
into today, so I’m kind of right there. There are a bunch of
guys stacked up so we have to go out there and make some
birdies.”  Korean golfer Seung-Yul Noh, who led after the first round,
shot an even-par 71 to fall into a tie for fifth at 9-under 133
with  Jason Dufner , D.A. Points, Charl Schwartzel and Chris Kirk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
