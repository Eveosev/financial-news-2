The  Baltimore Orioles  moved within
two games of the first-place Yankees in the American League
Eastern Division by winning two of three games in New York over
the weekend.  Mark Reynolds  hit two home runs in yesterday’s 8-3 victory
at Yankee Stadium and had four homers in the Major League
Baseball series.  The Yankees (76-57) had a 2-4 record on their six-game
homestand and today start a 10-game road trip that includes
three games against the Tampa Bay Rays, four in Baltimore and
three in Boston against the Red Sox. The Orioles (74-59) have
won 19 of their last 27 games.  “We need to play better baseball,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said at a news conference. “I’m asked everyday what my
level of concern is. We’re still in control of our own
destination. The concern is we need to play better.”  The Yankees took a 3-1 lead into the sixth inning before
the Orioles struck four runs against starting pitcher  Phil
Hughes . Matt Wieters had a run-scoring single before Reynolds
slugged a three-run homer to put Baltimore ahead 5-3. Reynolds
also hit a solo homer off Hughes in the fifth inning.  The Orioles start a three-game series in Toronto today
before returning home for the four games against the Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
