British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said his government will stick with its deficit-reduction plans
amid calls from the opposition for a rethink with the nation in
a double-dip recession.  “We’ve cut the deficit by a quarter already, and we are
sticking to this course: rejecting the easy path; restoring
sanity to our finances,” Cameron wrote in an opinion column
published today in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.  “You cannot borrow your way out of a debt crisis,”
Cameron wrote. “We’re on a hard road to balancing Britain’s
books.”  He said the euro-region’s debt crisis has “made things
more difficult” for reviving U.K. growth and reducing the
deficit.  Cameron said he wants to promote so-called green technology
and advanced manufacturing as ways to boost the size of the
private sector and lessen the significance of “unsustainable
financial services”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
