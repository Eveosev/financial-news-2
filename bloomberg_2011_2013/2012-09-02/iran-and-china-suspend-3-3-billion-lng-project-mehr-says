Iran  and  China  suspended a contract
to build a liquefied natural gas plant in the Persian Gulf port
of Asaluyeh “until further notice,” the Mehr news agency
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  The governments decided to halt the 2.6 billion euro ($3.3
billion) contract because the Chinese group involved was unable
to finance the project, the state-run agency said today.  Iran LNG Co., an affiliate of the National Iranian Gas
Export Co., signed the accord with Chinese counterparts in 2008,
Mehr said. The facility, to be built in two phases over six
years, was to produce 10.5 million metric tons a year of LNG and
other products such as gas condensate, Mehr said.  Iran holds the world’s largest deposits of natural gas
after  Russia , according to BP Plc data. Gas producers worldwide
chill and convert the fuel into a liquid so as to export it more
easily using specialized tankers. Iran faces tighter
international sanctions on its energy and financial industries
because of its nuclear program, which the U.S. and allied
nations say may be conceal an effort to develop atomic weapons.
The Gulf nation counters that it wants nuclear expertise for
energy and other peaceful purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
