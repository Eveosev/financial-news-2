Libya ’s Arabian Gulf Oil Co. made an
oil and natural-gas discovery in the Ghadames basin about 150
kilometers (93 miles) southwest of the capital Tripoli, National
Oil Corp., according to it state-run parent company.  The company, also known as Agoco, made the find after
drilling a 10,300-foot deep exploratory well, Tripoli-based NOC
said yesterday on its website.  National Oil expects to generate $54.9 billion in revenue
from oil and gas this year, according to a separate statement
posted on its website. The revenue will come from exports and
taxes on  oil companies  operating in the North African country,
NOC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
