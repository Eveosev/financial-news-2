Adrian Lim, a Singapore-based senior
investment manager who helps oversee about $6 billion of assets
in  India  at  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , commented on India’s
inflation and stock market. Lim spoke to Thai reporters via a
video conference from  Singapore .  On India’s inflation:  “I think some of the government’s measures will help curb
inflation in the medium term. But in the short term, we will see
inflation in India will move up a little bit.  “The only unknown factor here is the  oil prices , which
remains on an upward trend. So in the short term, there is still
some risk on inflation going higher. But that would primarily be
due to rising oil prices. In the medium term, some of this
inflation pressure will be reduced.  “I’m not too concerned with India’s political risk.
Besides high inflation, another concern is high  interest rates 
in India. For a certain period of time, high interest rates are
OK because the credit market should be more disciplined.  “High interest rates will help rein in credit lending from
the banks. But I don’t want to see a situation of high interest
rates for a long time. That would be our next concern about
India other than inflation.”  On the stock market:  “We think that the finance and banking sectors will do
well on higher loan growth. We think that the information
technology companies should do well as well on the recovery of
their American customers. Generally, we expect Infosys and HDFC
will do well above average.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
