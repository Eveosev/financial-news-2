Barclays Bank SA, the U.K. lender’s
Spanish unit, agreed to a capital increase of as much as 600
million euros ($858 million) and a boost to capital of as much
as 700 million euros via buying back debt, it said in a filing.  Barclays Bank SA will buy back subordinated debt from
 Barclays Plc (BARC) , said a spokeswoman for the Spanish unit in a
telephone interview.  As part of  Spain ’s efforts to restore investor confidence
in its economy and financial system, the government tightened
banking rules on Feb. 18. The new law demands listed lenders
have 8 percent core capital, a measure of financial strength,
and gives them until September to meet the new requirements.  The Bank of Spain said on March 10 that Barclays Bank SA
had a capital shortfall of 552 million euros, and that the
lender had committed to covering the shortfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
