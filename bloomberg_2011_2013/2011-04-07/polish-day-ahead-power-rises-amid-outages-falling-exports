Polish day-ahead electricity prices
increased in the past week as local outages offset higher
imports and decreased exports. Generation capacity is scheduled
to return after the weekend.  Next-day baseload power climbed 1.8 percent to 210.71 zloty
($75.67) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily electricity demand was as high as 18,424
megawatts this week, down 1.7 percent from last week’s maximum
daily average, according to  system load data . Exports to  Germany 
decreased, while more Czech power was imported.  The highest temperatures in Warsaw may fall to 7 degrees
Celsius (45 Fahrenheit) on April 9 from today’s high of 20
degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Power producers in  Poland  will halt 1,040 megawatts of
generation capacity during the weekend, while another 450
megawatts will stay off-line until April 10, according to data
from the power grid operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
