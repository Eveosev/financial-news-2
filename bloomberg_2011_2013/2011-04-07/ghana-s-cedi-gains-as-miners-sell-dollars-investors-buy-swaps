Ghana ’s cedi gained a second day
against the dollar as mining companies sold the U.S. currency to
finance operations in the West African nation and foreign
investors used dollars to buy currency swaps from local banks.  The cedi appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.5135 to the dollar as
of 2:30 p.m. in Accra after closing at 1.5177 yesterday.  “The mining guys are in the market selling dollars, and we
have some offshore investors coming in with dollars buying
swaps,” said Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader with  Access Bank
Plc (ACCESS) ’s Accra office, in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
