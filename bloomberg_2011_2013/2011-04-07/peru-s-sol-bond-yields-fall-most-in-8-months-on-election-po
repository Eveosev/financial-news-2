Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in 8 months, after a poll triggered bets that
opposition candidate Ollanta Humala won’t garner enough support
to win the presidency.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 6.66 percent at today’s close, according to Deutsche
Bank AG’s local unit. That’s the biggest decline since July
2010. The price rose 0.78 centimo to 108.18 centimos per sol.  Humala, who wants to increase state control of the economy,
was the frontrunner in a simulated vote by researcher CPI before
the April 10 vote. Humala had 29 percent support in the poll,
congresswoman Keiko Fujimori had 22 percent and former Finance
Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had 19 percent, CPI’s chief
Manuel Saavedra told reporters in Lima today.  Investors took the poll as a sign that Humala would
probably face Fujimori in a likely runoff on June 5 and would
lose the two-way race, said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at
 Barclays Capital  in  New York . Fujimori would defeat Humala by
three percentage points in a runoff vote, according to a poll by
CPI published March 26.  “The market has overreacted,” Melzi said. “Where things
stand today, it’s too close to call. It’s still 50:50 who wins
in the second round. We’re still buying dollars and we’re still
out of the local curve.”  The sol gained 0.3 percent to 2.8024 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.8115 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
