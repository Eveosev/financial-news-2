Banks may raise  interest rates  for
borrowers and lower deposit rates to cope with increased  capital
requirements , the European Commission said.  “While higher capital standards make banks more resilient
in times of asset losses, this comes possibly at the price of on
average higher lending rates if regulation imposes higher
funding costs on banks,” the Brussels-based commission, the
European Union’s executive, said today in a quarterly report on
the euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
