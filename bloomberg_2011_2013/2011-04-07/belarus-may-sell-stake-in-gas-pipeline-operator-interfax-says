OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, may sell its share of a venture
with Belarus if the government carries out a plan to auction its
controlling stake on the international market.  “If Belarus offers its holding for the reported price of
$1 billion, we don’t exclude that we will simultaneously put
ours up for sale,” said Yelena Kokhanovskaya, a Moscow-based
spokeswoman for Mobile TeleSystems, which is also known as MTS.  MTS held talks about buying out Belarus’s 51 percent of the
venture, although the negotiations failed over the price, the
state news service Belta  reported  today, citing Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Kalinin.  “MTS is still interested in developing its Belarus
business and in acquiring the government’s stake at a reasonable
price,” said Kokhanovskaya.  Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko said the government
is willing to sell its 51 percent of the venture to MTS for $1
billion, the Interfax news service reported March 18.  Belarus may sell its stake the mobile-phone venture and in
part of its 50 percent stake in the Beltransgaz pipeline
operator this year to raise cash from abroad as it faces a
budget gap, Interfax reported yesterday, citing Natalya
Zhernosek, the director of the state property fund.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas-export monopoly, owns half of
Beltransgaz, paying $2.5 billion to build up its stake from 2007
to 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
