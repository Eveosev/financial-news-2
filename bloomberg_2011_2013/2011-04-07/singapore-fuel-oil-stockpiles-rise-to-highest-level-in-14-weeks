Singapore â€™s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest in 14 weeks, data from a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 11.2
percent to 20.7 million barrels in the seven days to April 6,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 21.6 million in the week to Dec. 29.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 7.8 percent to 12.3 million barrels. Inventories
of light distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline
declined 0.7 percent to 11.98 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
