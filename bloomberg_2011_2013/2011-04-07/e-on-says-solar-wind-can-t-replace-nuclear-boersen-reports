Renewable energy such as solar and
wind power won’t be able to replace nuclear power in  Germany  in
the next ten years,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing  E.ON AG (EOAN) 
Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen.  The development of natural gas power plants could
compensate for the loss of capacity if Germany closes its
nuclear plants, Teyssen also told the newspaper.  Nuclear plants produce about 23 percent of Germnay’s
energy, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
