The terms of  Portugal ’s bailout
package must be tighter than they otherwise would have been
given the political situation caused by Prime Minister  Jose Socrates ’s resignation, Finnish Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi
said.  Portugal’s request for aid, though it doesn’t come as a
surprise, may prove difficult for the Helsinki-based parliament
to ratify amid political opposition, Kiviniemi said today at a
press conference in the Finnish capital.  If Portugal fails to agree to austerity measures once a new
government is formed, it will become “clearly a crisis
country,” Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen said at the
same presser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
