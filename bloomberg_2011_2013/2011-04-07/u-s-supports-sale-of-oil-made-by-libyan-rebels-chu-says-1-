The U.S. supports the sale of oil by
Libyan rebels and backs the transitional government that sold
the crude, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said at a news
conference today in  Abu Dhabi .  A crude tanker able to load 1 million barrels left a rebel-
held terminal in Libya yesterday, ship-tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. The Equator arrived at the Marsa al Hariga
terminal on April 5 and signaled Singapore as its destination.  The tanker is headed to China,  Al Arabiya  reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
