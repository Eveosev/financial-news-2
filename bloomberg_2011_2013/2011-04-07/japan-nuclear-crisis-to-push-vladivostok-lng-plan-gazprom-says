OAO Gazprom expects  Japan  to boost
support for a project to build a liquefied natural gas plant on
 Russia ’s Pacific coast after an earthquake and tsunami damaged
the Asian country’s nuclear reactors and leaked radiation.  “We are now working with the Japanese government and sense
strong support,” Viktor Timoshilov, head of Gazprom’s
department for eastern projects, told reporters today in Moscow.
“After these tragic events I think the support will be even
stronger.”  Russia’s state-controlled gas exporter and Japan’s Agency
for Natural Resources and Energy in January agreed to conduct a
front-end engineering design this year for a liquefied natural
gas plant near Vladivostok. They signed preliminary accords on
studying options for supplying fuel in the region in May 2009.  Japan, already the world’s biggest buyer of LNG, may boost
use of the fuel after the March 11 earthquake and a tsunami
damaged the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, International
Energy Agency Executive Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
