Chicago  gasoline strengthened as
Marathon Oil Corp. shut a unit at its Catlettsburg refinery in
 Kentucky  after a leak of hydrogen fluoride.  The leak occurred late yesterday in piping and workers shut
the unit, according to a filing with the National Response
Center.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 0.5 cent to 5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:42 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
1.49 cents to $3.123 a gallon.  “The Catlettsburg refinery experienced a small HF release
yesterday,” Shane Pochard, a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail. “There was no offsite impact and the issue is being
addressed.”  Hydrogen fluoride, or HF, is used as a catalyst in
alkylation units that produce blending components to raise the
octane value of gasoline.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose
0.62 cent versus futures to a discount of 11.13 cents a gallon.  A crude unit and fluid catalytic cracker that were shut for
planned work at BP Plc’s Texas City refinery in Texas remain
offline, a person with knowledge of the matter said yesterday.  A March filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality that said the No. 1 cat cracker would restart between
March 21 and 25 wasn’t correct, said the person, who declined to
be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
