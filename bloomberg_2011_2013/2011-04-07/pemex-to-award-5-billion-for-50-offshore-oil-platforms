Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, plans to award contracts worth $5 billion
in the next two years to build 50 platforms to boost output in
the Bay of Campeche in the  Gulf of Mexico .  The platforms will be used at developments such as Ayatsil
and Tsimin,  Carlos Morales , head of production and exploration
at Pemex, said today in an interview in  Buenos Aires . They may
be built domestically, Morales said.  Potential domestic companies include billionaire  Carlos
Slim ’s Carso Infraestructura & Construccion SAB, known as Cicsa,
and Empresas ICA SAB, Mexico’s largest construction company,
said  Carlos Hermosillo , head of research with Grupo Financiero
Banorte. Both companies have done similar projects for Pemex
that don’t include drilling equipment, he said.  “These types of contracts are very profitable,”
Hermosillo said today in a telephone interview from  Mexico  City.
“It can represent a constant stream of revenue.”  He rates Cicsa a “hold” and ICA a “buy,” without owning
shares in any of those companies.  Ayatsil and Tsimin are located in developments that contain
a total of 622 million barrels of proved oil reserves, according
to Mexico City-based Pemex’s estimates.  The platforms would be used for new and existing wells,
Morales said. Some of the contracts would have to be approved by
the company’s board, he said.  -- Editors: Robin Saponar, Robin Stringer  To contact the reporter on this story:
