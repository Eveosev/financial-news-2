PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest
oil company, will increase oil processing and shorten
maintenance of its plants to ease a fuel shortage in some
regions,  China  News Service reported.  The refiner will raise processing volumes by 15 percent
this month from a year earlier and oil-product output by 19
percent, according to the  report  dated yesterday, which didn’t
give exact volumes. Gasoline and diesel yields will rise 2.4
percent, it said.  PetroChina will run its refining units at more than 98.5
percent of designed capacity, it said. The Dagang refinery in
Tianjin has resumed operations after completing maintenance two
days ahead of schedule, it said.  Domestic fuel supplies have fallen after some private
refineries cut processing because of higher crude costs and
sellers hoarded fuels on speculation the government will approve
a price increase. China raised gasoline and diesel prices by as
much as 5.8 percent today after crude rose to the highest in
more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
