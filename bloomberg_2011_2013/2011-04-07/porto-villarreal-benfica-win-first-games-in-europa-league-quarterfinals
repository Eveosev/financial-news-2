Porto, Villarreal and Benfica all
won easily at home to open their Europa League quarterfinals,
while Braga tied 1-1 at 10-man  Dynamo Kiev .  Falcao scored three goals last night as Porto, the favorite
with U.K. bookmakers to win European soccer’s second-tier club
competition, routed Spartak Moscow 5-1 at home. Villarreal also
won 5-1 over  FC Twente  behind two goals from Nilmar, while
Eduardo Salvio scored twice in Benfica’s 4-1 victory over PSV
Eindhoven.  Falcao’s hat trick at the Estadio do Dragao gave him the
competition’s scoring lead with 10 goals, one more than
Villarreal’s Giuseppe Rossi. Silvestre Varela and Maicon added
goals for Porto, while Kirill Kombarov scored for Spartak.  Villarreal also got goals Rossi, Carlos Marchena and Borja
Valero at Estadio El Madrigal in matching the club record for
biggest win in European competition. Marc Janko’s goal in
second-half stoppage time prevented Twente from suffering its
biggest European loss.  Salvio scored twice over a six-minute span of the first and
second halves to lead Benfica at the Estadio da Luz. Pablo Aimar
and Javier Saviola also scored in the win, while Zakaria Labyad
had the PSV goal.  Oleg Gusev’s own-goal earned Braga, the third Portuguese
team in the final eight, the draw in  Ukraine . Andriy Yarmolenko
scored for Dynamo Kiev, which had Andriy Shevchenko sent off
after getting two yellow cards in the second half.  The teams will meet April 14 in the final piece of the
quarterfinals. The final is in Dublin on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
