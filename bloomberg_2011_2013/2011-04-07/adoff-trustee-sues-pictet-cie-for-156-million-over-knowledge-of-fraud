Pictet & Cie and Banque J. Safra,
two Geneva-based private banks, were sued for $216 million by
the trustee liquidating the former investment firm of con man
 Bernard Madoff .  The trustee,  Irving Picard , said today in separate filings
in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  New York  that the Swiss banks should
have known Madoff was engaged in a fraud. He is seeking return
of the money to redistribute to Madoff’s creditors.  Pictet made $156 million and Safra made $60 million through
investments in feeder funds that steered money to the Madoff
firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, Picard
claimed in the complaints. Picard has sued hundreds of firms,
individuals and trusts seeking the return of profits made in
Madoff’s fraud.  When Madoff was arrested in December 2008, firm statements
showed 4,900 accounts with a total of $65 billion in nonexistent
holdings, according to Picard. Investors lost about $20 billion
in principal.  Calls to Pictet & Cie and Banque J. Safra after business
hours in  Switzerland  weren’t answered.  Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to masterminding the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history and is serving a 150-year sentence in a
North Carolina federal prison. Picard has collected about
$10 billion for Madoff’s creditors.  The cases are Picard v. Pictet & Cie, 11-1724, and Picard
v. Banque J. Safra (Suisse) SA, 11-1725, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
