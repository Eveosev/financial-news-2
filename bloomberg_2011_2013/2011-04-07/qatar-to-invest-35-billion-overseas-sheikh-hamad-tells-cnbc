Qatar plans to  boost investments 
overseas to as much as $35 billion this year from more than $20
billion last year as the Persian Gulf country eyes deals in U.S.
real estate, Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber Al Thani told CNBC.  “We are looking for properties, commercial properties in
the U.S., because we think in some cities,” it’s the “right
moment” to do that, Al Thani said, according to a transcript of
the CNBC interview posted yesterday. “We are checking and
discussing some deals in U.S.”  Qatari Diar, a real-estate developer owned by the Persian
Gulf country’s sovereign wealth fund, said April 4 it is an
anchor investor in Washington D.C.’s $700 million CityCenterDC
Development.  “Maybe now is the right time to talk with the banks, which
have a lot of these commercial properties which they want to get
rid of, if they want cash. Then sometimes we might find the
right deal to do.”  For Related News and Information:
