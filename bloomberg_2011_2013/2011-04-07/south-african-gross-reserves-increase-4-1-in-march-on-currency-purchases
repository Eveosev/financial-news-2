South African gross reserves climbed
the most in a year last month after the government sold dollar-
denominated bonds and the central bank bought more foreign
currency.  Gross reserves rose 4.1 percent to $49.27 billion in March
from the previous month, while net reserves decreased 0.1
percent to $44.73 billion, the  Reserve Bank  said on its website
today.  “The increase in the gross reserves was the result of
foreign exchange purchases, the proceeds of the government’s
foreign bond issuance which were deposited with the bank and
valuation adjustments,” the Pretoria-based bank said.  The decline in net reserves reflected an increase in assets
owned by the National Treasury after it deposited the proceeds
of the bond sale with the bank. The Treasury sold $750 million
worth of 30-year dollar denominated bonds on Feb. 28, to fund
part of the  budget deficit  for the year that began April 1.  The Reserve Bank has stepped up foreign currency purchases
following a surge in the value of the rand that has undermined
the competitiveness of  South Africa ’s exports.  The rand traded at 6.6825 per dollar at 8:40 a.m. in
Johannesburg, little changed from before the release of the
reserves data. The currency has fallen 0.8 percent against the
dollar this year, trimming its gain since the beginning of 2009
to 41 percent.  “The Reserve Bank is expected continue to accumulating
foreign exchange reserves in order to reduce some of the upward
pressure on the rand,’’ Nedbank Group Ltd., the country’s
fourth-largest bank, said in e-mailed comments.  Gold reserves climbed 1.4 percent to $5.76 billion as the
price of bullion gained 1.3 percent to an average of $1,432.75
an ounce, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
