Nirjhar Jain,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s U.S.
head of structured-products credit trading, has left the bank,
and may join an investment firm.  Jain, 33, who oversaw trading of residential- and
commercial-mortgage bonds, asset-backed securities and
collateralized loan obligations at the New York-based firm,
plans to “pursue opportunities on the buy side,” according to
a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Jain joined Morgan Stanley last year from  Deutsche Bank AG (DB) ,
where he ran European asset-backed securities trading. He
earlier traded so-called ABX index credit-default-swap contracts
tied to subprime-mortgage bonds during the boom in that
 derivatives market , which the Frankfurt-based lender helped
create.  Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, confirmed the
details of the memo and declined to comment further. Jain
confirmed his departure.  Mike DePietro, Morgan Stanley’s head of residential-
mortgage-backed securities trading, Rebecca Hogan, its head of
consumer asset-backed securities and CLO trading, and Kevin Ng,
who runs commercial-mortgage bond trading, will now report
directly to Jay Hallik, the firm’s global head of securitized-
products trading, according to the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
