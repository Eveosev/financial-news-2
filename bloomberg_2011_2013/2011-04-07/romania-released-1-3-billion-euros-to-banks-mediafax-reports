Romania ’s central bank released 1.3
billion euros ($1.9 billion) from its reserves to commercial
banks after cutting requirements on foreign-exchange deposits,
Governor Mugur Isarescu told the news service Mediafax.  The bank cut the  reserve requirements  on foreign-exchange
deposits by 5 percentage points to 20 percent on March 31 to
boost market liquidity and allow the  Finance Ministry  to convert
lei into euros to pay 2.7 billion euros of debt that came due,
Isarescu said in an interview to Bucharest-based  Mediafax .  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei seeks to discourage foreign-
exchange lending to leu-earning potential borrowers, mostly
through “prudential measures,” Isarescu told Mediafax. The
bank will raise its inflation forecast because of rising global
energy and food prices, according to Isarescu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
