Middle East crude oils rose for the
seventh day as a surge in processing profits boosted demand from
refiners.  Oman oil for immediate loading increased 18 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $115.50 a barrel today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since August 2008. Dubai
for loading in June was up 0.1 percent at $114.97 and Murban
crude climbed 0.5 percent to $118.92.  Demand for crude has climbed as refiners ramp up runs to
take advantage of rising processing profits. Gasoil’s premium to
Dubai, a measure of profitability, climbed 36 cents to $22.94 a
barrel today, according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates
Ltd.  Oman futures for June delivery rose 10 cents to $115.90 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:05 p.m. Singapore
time, with 859 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at
$115.97 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for May narrowed 14
cents to $7.20 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates. The exchange for swaps for June narrowed 13 cents to
$7.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
