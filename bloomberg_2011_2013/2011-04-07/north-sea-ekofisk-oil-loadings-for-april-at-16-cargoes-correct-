crude in April will total 16 cargoes, or 9.75 million barrels, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The shipments will decline by 3.6 percent to 325,000
barrels a day compared with 337,097 barrels a day in March,
according to the program.  Ekofisk is one of four North Sea oil grades used to price
more than half of global oil. The other blends are Brent,
Forties and Oseberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
