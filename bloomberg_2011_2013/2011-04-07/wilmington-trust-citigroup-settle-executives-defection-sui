Wilmington Trust Co., the Delaware
bank founded by the du Pont family and being bought by  M&T Bank
Corp. (MTB) , settled a lawsuit against three former vice presidents
who allegedly defected to  Citigroup Inc. (C)  with proprietary
information.  The parties “agree that this case has been resolved and
that this case should be dismissed” without awarding fees or
costs to either party under a confidential settlement agreement,
Judge J. Travis Laster wrote in an order today in Delaware
Chancery Court.  The Wilmington-based bank had claimed the trio, who worked
in wealth-management, might pass on information about “client
revenue, fee projections, investment strategies” and other
competitive data.  The executives -- Barbara McCollum, Robert Rosenberg and
 Paul Gordon  -- should be barred from using information related
to former clients in their new jobs, Wilmington Trust contended
in the April 1 complaint.  Timothy Holly , an attorney for the three, declined to
comment. Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citigroup, also
declined to comment. Megen Morris, a Wilmington Trust
spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  The case is Wilmington Trust Co. v. McCollum, Rosenberg and
Gordon, CA6334, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
