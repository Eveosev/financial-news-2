Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  won’t face
regulatory hurdles for its dominant market position if it
acquires a majority stake of Telekom Srbija AD from the state,
Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said.  The Austrian company submitted the only offer among seven
registered bidders in a tender to purchase a 51 percent stake in
Telekom Srbija, which controls 98 percent of the landline market
and nearly 60 percent of mobile phone services. Telekom Austria
already controls 14 percent of the Serbian mobile phone market
through its local unit,  VIP Mobile .  “Market share is an issue only in cases where an operating
license is issued,” Cvetkovic told a press conference today in
Belgrade. “It’s not an issue whether someone will gain more
than 50 percent of a market, but whether that share will be used
contrary to market principles.”  Other companies registered in the tender included  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) ,  France Telecom SA (FTE) , America Movil SAB,  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  and Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS.  Cvetkovic reiterated that the “government is not ready to
lower” the 1.4 billion-euro ($2 billion) minimum price for the
stake. Telekom Austria offered 950 million euros in cash and 450
million euros in investments over three years in its bid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
