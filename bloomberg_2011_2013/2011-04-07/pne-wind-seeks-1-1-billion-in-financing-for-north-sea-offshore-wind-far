PNE Wind AG (PNE3) , a German developer, is
seeking about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) in loans to
finance a wind farm in the  North Sea .  PNE Wind, which has installed 97 wind projects to date,
plans to start building the 252-megawatt Gode Wind II park north
of the island of Norderney by 2013, Martin Bilhardt, chief
executive officer of the Cuxhaven-based company, said in an
interview in  New York .  The 84-turbine plant would cost 1.2 billion euros in total,
Bilhardt said, adding that he has “already received soft
commitments from about 10 banks” for the money.  Those banks may provide 50 million euros to 100 million
euros each, he said. In addition, PNE Wind is looking for an
investor to provide equity for the project. That may be a
pension fund or other financial investors forging a strategic
partnership, he said.  The company plans to complete the transaction by the third
quarter, Bilhardt said. Vestas Wind Systems A/S will supply its
V112  wind turbines , he said.  Agreements are also in place with MT Hojgaard A/S for the
single-pole foundations that support the turbines, Alstom Grid
GmbH for the plant’s transformer station and Draka Norsk Kabel
AS for the internal cabling.  Germany  is seeking to boost its offshore wind capacity to
help meet its target of generating 18 percent of energy from
renewable sources by 2020. The government plans to have 10
gigawatts of wind power at sea by then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
