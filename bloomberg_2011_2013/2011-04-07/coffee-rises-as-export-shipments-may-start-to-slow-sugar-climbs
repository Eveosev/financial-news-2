(Corrects to 41.9 million bags in fifth paragraph.)  Coffee rose in  New York , erasing
yesterday’s losses, on speculation growers won’t be able to keep
up the recent pace of exports, limiting new supplies. Sugar
advanced.  Bean exports for the season started Oct. 1 climbed to 42.3
million bags, up from 37.1 million bags a year earlier,
according to the  International Coffee Organization . Shipments in
February rose 15 percent from a year earlier to 8.5 million
bags. The increase was lead by arabica beans, favored for
specialty beverages such as those made by Starbucks Corp.  “The strong export performance in the first five months of
coffee year 2010-11 is unlikely to be maintained in coming
months, especially in light of reduced availability in  Brazil ,”
the London-based ICO said in a report yesterday.  Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 1.3 percent to $2.6855
a pound by 7:27 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Robusta
coffee for July delivery advanced $16, or 0.7 percent, to $2,405
a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Production in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, may
fall as much as 13 percent to between 41.9 million bags and 44.7
million bags, the government’s crop forecasting agency, known as
Conab, estimated on Jan. 6.  Low Inventories  Inventories in coffee-producing countries are at the lowest
since records began, according to the ICO.  “With current low levels of world stocks and consumption
showing continued dynamism, the prospects for the rebuilding of
stocks are limited,” the ICO said.  Mexico ’s coffee exports declined 16 percent last month from
a year earlier to 331,318 bags, according to the country’s
coffee association Amecafe. Shipments from  Guatemala  fell 6
percent in March to 453,572 bags, data from the country’s
National Coffee Association, known as Anacafe, show. Both
countries mainly produce arabica beans.  Raw sugar futures for July delivery gained 0.1 percent to
25 cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined-sugar futures for May
delivery rose $1.80 a ton, or 0.3 percent, to $707.60 a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for July delivery slid $9, or 0.3 percent, to $3,005
a ton in New York. Cocoa for July delivery fell 13 pounds, or
0.7 percent, to 1,908 pounds ($3,111) a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
