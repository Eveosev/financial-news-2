Britain’s antitrust regulator
retracted a statement that said it wanted the European Union to
investigate  Aditya Birla Group ’s proposed $875 million purchase
of Columbian Chemicals Co., the carbon black manufacturer owned
by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  buyout unit One Equity Partners LLC.  The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading  said the statement today
was “released in error and should be disregarded.” The
statement said the agency had sought referral of the deal to the
European Commission in Brussels. Mumbai-based Aditya Birla
announced the acquisition on Jan. 31, saying it would help the
company become the world’s largest maker of the product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
