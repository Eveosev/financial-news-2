Natural gas futures dropped for a
fifth day, heading for their longest losing streak in more than
seven months, after a government report showed a smaller-than-
expected decline in U.S. stockpiles.  Gas fell as much as 2.7 percent after the Energy Department
said stockpiles declined 45 billion cubic feet in the week ended
April 1 to 1.579 trillion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg
users showed an expected decline of 56 billion.  Natural gas for May delivery fell 10.7 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $4.039 per million British thermal units at 10:39
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas traded at $4.146
before the storage number was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  The five-year average change in stockpiles for the week is
an increase of 13 billion cubic feet, department data showed.
Supplies were 0.6 percent above the five-year average last week,
down from a 4.4 percent surplus the previous week.  Temperatures will be above normal in the U.S. East through
April 16, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland .  U.S. heating demand will be 29 percent lower than average
from tomorrow through April 14, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton, Missouri.  The high temperature in  New York  on April 10 will be 64
degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
