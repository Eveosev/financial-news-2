JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  gave Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  a 51 percent raise in 2010 as the
bank resumed paying cash bonuses following two years of pressure
from regulators and lawmakers to curb compensation.  Dimon’s $23 million compensation package makes him the
highest-paid chief executive among the top six U.S. banks since
2007, according to the banks’ proxy statements.  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  CEO  Lloyd Blankfein , 56, received the next-highest
payout for 2010 at $19 million, followed by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
head  John Stumpf , 57, at $17.5 million.  Morgan Stanley, which hasn’t filed its statement yet, is
not going to pay CEO  James Gorman  more than the $15.1 million he
received for 2009, a person familiar with his pay package said
in January.  Dimon’s pay included a $5 million cash bonus, his first
since 2007, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
 regulatory filing . His base salary remained at $1 million and
his restricted stock payout increased 20 percent to $17 million.
That helped boost total compensation by more than half from
$15.2 million in 2009, according to the bank’s calculations.  JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a record $17.4 billion profit for the year, buoyed by $7 billion
in pretax reserves that were added back to earnings as  credit
quality  and the  U.S. economy  improved. Wall Street firms are
reinstating bonuses for top executives as earnings rebound from
the 2008 financial crisis.  Dimon received restricted shares valued at about $12
million, according to yesterday’s filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. He also received options
valued at about $5 million, according to the company. That
compares with restricted shares and options valued at $14.2
million awarded last year for his work in 2009, according to
disclosures by the company. He additionally received $579,624 in
benefits attributed to his personal use of company aircraft,
cars and real estate fees to sell his home in  Chicago .  Far From 2007  Dimon, 55, took a salary of $1 million for 2009 and gave up
bonuses that year and in 2008 after receiving $49.9 million in
total compensation for 2007, which included cash and restricted
stock bonuses of $14.5 million each. The board raised Dimon’s
base salary for 2011 to $1.5 million.  Blankfein’s pay package, which doubled from the prior year,
is less than the $68.5 million record compensation he received
for 2007. Blankfein’s 2010 pay included a cash bonus of $5.4
million and $12.6 million in restricted stock.  JPMorgan’s shares rose 1.8 percent last year, outperforming
competitors including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp. and
 Morgan Stanley. (MS)   JPMorgan awarded Dimon’s top 15 executives more than $73
million in restricted shares, plus stock options, for their
performance in 2010, according to Jan. 21 SEC filings. That
compares with $64.2 million in stock granted to his top 16
executives a year earlier, filings at the time show.  A majority of Dimon’s wealth is in JPMorgan stock. He and
his wife owned directly or through trusts and retirement plans
more than 5 million shares valued at more than $221 million as
of Jan. 19, when his total holdings were last disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
