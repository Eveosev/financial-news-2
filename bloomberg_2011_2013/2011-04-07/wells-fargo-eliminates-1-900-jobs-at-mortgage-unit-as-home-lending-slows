Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, cut 1,900 employees from its mortgage unit, or less
than 1 percent of the workforce, as fewer would-be borrowers
submit applications for loans.  Wells Fargo told U.S. employees of the cuts on March 23,
giving them 60 days notice,  Jason Menke , a spokesman for the San
Francisco-based bank, said today. Most employees were in interim
roles processing mortgage applications, and a “handful” were
in servicing operations. Some employees may be transferred to
other departments, he said.  “The mortgage business is incredibly cyclical and we have
to scale our operations according to customer demand,” Menke
said in a phone interview. Employees “were brought in for
short-term assignments when they were hired. They were told that
at some point these roles would end.”  Wells Fargo mortgage originations slipped to $386 billion
last year from $420 billion in 2009, according to the bank’s
fourth-quarter earnings statement. Pending mortgage applications
declined to $73 billion at the end of 2010 from $101 billion in
the third quarter, the bank said. Wells Fargo had 272,200
employees at the end of December, according to a filing.  The average rate on a typical U.S. fixed-rate 30-year
mortgage increased to 4.89 percent on April 6 from 4.20 percent
in November, according to bankrate.com, a  North Palm Beach ,
Florida-based data firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
