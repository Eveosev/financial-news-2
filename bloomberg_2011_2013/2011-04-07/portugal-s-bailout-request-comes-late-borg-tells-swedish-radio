Portugal  should have requested a
European Union-led bailout in November or December instead of
waiting until yesterday,  Sveriges Radio reported , citing Swedish
Finance Minister Anders Borg.  The delay has worsened the debt crisis both in Portugal and
other countries, the Stockholm-based state-owned broadcaster
cited Borg as saying. Sweden has yet to decide whether it will
provide aid to Portugal in the bailout, Borg told SR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
