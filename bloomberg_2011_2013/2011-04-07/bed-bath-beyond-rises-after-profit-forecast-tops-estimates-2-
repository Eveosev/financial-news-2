Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) , the New
Jersey-based seller of linens, towels and cookware, rose the
most in almost two years after projecting full-year earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates.  Profit will increase 10 percent to 15 percent in the year
through February 2012, the Union, New Jersey-based retailer said
yesterday in a statement. That translates to per-share earnings
of as much as $3.53, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $3.48,
the average of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Bed Bath & Beyond, which operates more than 1,100 stores in
 North America , increased sales by 12 percent in the fourth
quarter, twice as fast as expenses grew, amid high unemployment
and declining home prices. Fewer markdowns as a percentage of
sales helped boost profitability, Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares told analysts yesterday on a conference call.  “Bed Bath & Beyond is clearly winning in the
marketplace,”  Colin McGranahan , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. in New York, said today in a note to clients. He
rates the shares “outperform” and said the retailer is “now
operating a more productive, more profitable business than
ever.”  The retailer jumped $5.16, or 10 percent, to $54.55 at 4
p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest gain since April
2009. The shares have gained 11 percent this year.  Bed Bath & Beyond said sales at stores open more than a
year rose 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  It also reported quarterly earnings of $1.12 a share, a 30
percent increase from a year earlier. Analysts had projected
earnings of 97 cents, according to an average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
