The U.S. House approved a stopgap
spending bill to keep the government open through next week,
although President  Barack Obama  said he would veto the measure
and a shutdown still looms.  The measure, passed 247-181, would cut another $12 billion
in spending this year and fund the Pentagon at current levels
through Sept. 30. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada
Democrat, called the bill a “non-starter.”  Reid and House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican,
returned to the White House today to meet with Obama for talks
to try to avert a shutdown at midnight tomorrow.  Leaders of both parties insist they don’t want a shutdown
while they maneuver to avoid blame if one occurs.  An administration statement, in threatening a veto of the
short-term House measure, said it would be a “distraction”
from the budget talks. Reid said the one-week measure is a sure
“way to close the government.”  Boehner called on the Senate to act on the bill.  “There is absolutely no policy reason for the Senate not
to follow the House in taking these responsible steps to support
our troops and keep our government open,” he said on the House
floor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
