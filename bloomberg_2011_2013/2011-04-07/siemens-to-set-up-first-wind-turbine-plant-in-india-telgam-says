Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, plans to build its first wind-turbine plant
in India as companies shift manufacturing to the south Asian
nation to seek better margins and a fast-growing market.  The plant, to be located in western Gujarat state, will
begin production in 2013 and may manufacture as much as 500
megawatts a year of turbine capacity, Bernhard Telgmann, chief
executive of Asia-Pacific operations at the company’s wind unit,
said in an interview in the southern city of Chennai.  Siemens follows Europe’s largest wind-turbine makers,
including  Denmark ’s Vestas Wind Systems A/S and  Spain ’s Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnologica SA, in shifting production to India to
take advantage of lower costs, better margins and proximity to
the world’s fifth-largest wind market, where wind installations
expanded by 20 percent in 2010.  Siemen’s facility will make 2.3-megawatt turbines primarily
for the local market, he said. Telgmann declined to say how much
Siemens was investing in the facility.  Indian wind farms are installing larger, more efficient
turbines of 2-megawatt capacity or greater as the numbers of
sites experiencing high wind speeds dwindle in the country.
Gamesa plans to begin making 2-megawatt turbines in  India  by the
end of this year.  Last year, installations of such turbines outstripped those
of less than 1-megawatt capacity for the first time in India,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
