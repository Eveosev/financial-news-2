Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-run
oil company, will receive a $2.8 billion financing package from
the U.S. Export-Import Bank to help buy refinery equipment and
services from 150 U.S. companies.  The financing is part of a more than $5 billion expansion
at Ecopetrol’s Refineria de Cartagena, the government-backed
lender said in a statement. The accord pends final bank
approval.  The funding would be the second-largest such transaction
ever by the bank, according to the statement. U.S. President
Barack Obama and Colombian leader  Juan Manuel Santos  met in
Washington today to discuss how to advance a stalled trade
agreement.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol, Colombia’s largest oil company, is
expanding its refinery on the nation’s Caribbean coast as it
increases production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
