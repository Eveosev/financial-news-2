Louis Capital Markets LP ’s Edward Kott is planning to depart to join EDF Trading in  London  as head
of global natural gas analysis.  Kott’s last day as head of energy research and strategy at
Louis Capital’s LCM Commodities unit in  New York  will be
tomorrow, and he will join EDF Trading on May 1, according to
statements from Kott and the companies.  “The past two-and-a-half years at LCM Commodities has been
a wonderful experience,” he said in an e-mail today. “I’m now
excited to move to a recognized leader in energy markets around
the world. I’m very much looking forward to contributing to EDF
Trading’s capabilities in natural gas and other energy
markets.”  Kott will report to Steve Lewis, global head of natural gas
at EDF, said Michele Reid, a London-based spokeswoman for EDF
Trading, a unit of Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s biggest
power generator.  Kott informed his LCM clients of his departure in an e-mail
yesterday. He joined LCM in 2008 after the demise of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., where he developed the bank’s natural-
gas research platform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
