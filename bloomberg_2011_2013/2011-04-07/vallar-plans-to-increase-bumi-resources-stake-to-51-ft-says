Vallar Plc (VAA)  plans to raise its stake
in Indonesian coal company PT Bumi Resources to 51 percent next
month from 25 percent, the Financial Times reported, citing
Andrew Beckham, chief financial officer of both Bumi and Vallar.  This would give Vallar indirect control over the Kaltim
Prima mine, the world’s largest power station-coal mine, which
is operated by Bumi, the FT said.  Eddy Soeparno, chief financial officer at PT Bakrie &
Brothers, Bumi’s parent, confirmed the plan by phone from
Jakarta without specifying stake sizes. Vallar, based in  Jersey ,
 Channel Islands , said in November it would increase its stake in
Bumi this year.  Bumi, with a market value of 68.03 trillion rupiah ($7.85
billion), was unchanged at 3,275 rupiah at the 4 p.m. close in
Jakarta trading. The stock has climbed more than 47 percent in
the past six months, outpacing the 4 percent gain in the
benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index. (JCI)   To contact the reporters on this story:
