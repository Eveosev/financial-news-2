Japanese output of agricultural
products from pork to vegetables is set to drop after March’s
earthquake and tsunami left the country’s farm and food
industries in a “dire” situation, Rabobank International said.  Production will fall as much as 9 percent for beef and will
decline 13 percent for pork, the bank said in a report today.
Rice and poultry output each may slide as much as 11 percent,
and production will drop for seafood, fruit, vegetables, milk
and wheat, the report showed.  Japan  will import more agricultural products, including
staples such as rice and milk, according to Rabobank. Lower
production in the country will have little effect on world
trade, Rabobank analyst Jean-Yves Chow said in the report.  “Rice and skim-milk powder imports could, in theory,
increase dramatically, but inventory levels will act as a
buffer,” Chow said. “Perishable products, such as meat,
seafood, fruits and vegetables, will likely require additional
imports. Still, even if Japan takes the hypothetical losses from
the global market, the impact on global commodity trading will,
in fact, be minimal.”  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities gained 7.5 percent
since the end of February on increased demand for raw materials,
including commodities used in  food production . Cattle futures
climbed 25 percent in the past year on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and hogs rose 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
