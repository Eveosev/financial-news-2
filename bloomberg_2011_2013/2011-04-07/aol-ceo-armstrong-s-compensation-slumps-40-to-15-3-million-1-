AOL Inc. (AOL) , the Internet company that
bought the Huffington Post last month, cut Chief Executive
Officer  Tim Armstrong ’s total compensation 40 percent last year
as revenue dropped and the company posted a net loss.  Armstrong received $15.3 million, including salary, stock
awards and options, compared with $25.5 million in 2009, the New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing. His stock
and options awards led the decline.  AOL’s revenue fell 26 percent last year, with declines in
both its advertising and Internet-access subscription
businesses. The company posted a loss of $782.5 million in 2010,
its first full year separated from Time Warner Inc. Last month,
the company completed its $315 million purchase of Internet
publication the  Huffington Post  as part of a bid to revive
growth in advertising revenue.  AOL fell 9 cents to $20.44 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have lost 14 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
