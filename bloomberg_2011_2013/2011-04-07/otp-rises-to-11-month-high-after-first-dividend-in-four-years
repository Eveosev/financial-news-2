OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, rose to the highest since May after proposing to pay the
first dividend in four years from its 2010 profit.  The stock advanced as much as 1.9 percent and traded 0.8
percent higher at 6,308 forint by 9:35 a.m. in Budapest, the
highest intraday level since May 18.  “After three years of paying no dividend, it was expected
that management would propose a moderate dividend from 2010
earnings, reflecting caution but also the ongoing economic
recovery,” Mark Macrae, an analyst at KBC Securities in Warsaw,
wrote in a research note today. OTP proposes to pay a dividend
of 72 percent of face value per share from 2010 earnings, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
