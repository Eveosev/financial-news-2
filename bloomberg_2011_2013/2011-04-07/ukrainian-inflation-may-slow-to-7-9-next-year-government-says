Ukraine’s annual inflation may slow
to 7.9 percent next year and producer prices will probably gain
9.7 percent, according to government forecasts submitted to
parliament for approval.  The government seeks to lower the  budget deficit  to 2.5
percent of gross domestic product and finance the gap
“predominantly” by issuing domestic debt, according to a draft
of the 2012 budget provisions published on the parliament’s
 website  late yesterday.  The forecasts are based on an average hryvnia rate of 7.9
to 8 per dollar, according to the document.  Ukraine is relying on a $15.6 billion bailout loan of the
 International Monetary Fund  approved last summer for two and a
half years. The country has received two disbursements totalling
$3.4 billion. The third tranche, planned for March, is being
delayed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
