The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it will offer
1 trillion yen ($12 billion) in one-year loans to alleviate cash
shortages in the wake of the nationâ€™s record earthquake.  The central bank made the announcement after a policy 
meeting in  Tokyo  today. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board
also held the benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1
percent. Officials kept a separate credit program unchanged at 
30 trillion yen and an asset-purchase fund at 10 trillion yen,
the bank said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
