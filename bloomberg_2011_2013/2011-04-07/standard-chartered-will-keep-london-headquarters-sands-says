Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank that earns most of its profit in Asia, has no plan to move
its headquarters out of  London , Chief Executive Officer Peter Sands said. Sands made comments on its headquarters, bank
consolidation and competition to reporters at a press briefing
today in Seoul.  On plan to move headquarters:  “I see it as a distraction for our customers and
shareholders.”  On talks on South Korean banks’ consolidation:  “I don’t think scale for scale’s sake is necessarily a
recipe for success in banking.  “The notion of megabank tends to revolve too much about
just being big.”  On tougher competition in Korea:  “We’re competing with the biggest banks in the world all
the time. And if you look at our performance in terms of
shareholder value creation, profit growth and market share,
we’ve performed better than bigger banks on all of these
dimensions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
