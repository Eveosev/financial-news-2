Scottish police investigating the
1988 Lockerbie bombing have interviewed former Libyan Foreign
Minister Moussa Koussa, the  BBC  reported, without saying where
it got the information. Koussa agreed to the interview, the BBC
said.  The Crown Office in  Scotland , responsible for prosecuting
crimes there, held a “very positive” meeting with the U.K.’s
Foreign and Commonwealth Office on April 4 about arranging for
Scottish police to talk to Koussa “at the earliest
opportunity,” an FCO spokesman said by telephone today. “It is
not appropriate for us to say anything more at this stage,” the
spokesman said.  The duty officer at the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary,
which is investigating the Lockerbie bombing, said, when
contacted by telephone outside office hours, that he was unable
to confirm the BBC report and was “unaware of what the current
situation is with this inquiry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
