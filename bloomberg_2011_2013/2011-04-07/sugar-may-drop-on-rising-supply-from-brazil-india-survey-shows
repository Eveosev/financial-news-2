Sugar may fall next week on bets
that supplies are increasing from  Brazil , the world’s biggest
producer, and that  India  will expand exports.  Eleven of 12 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar traded in New York will
decline, while one said prices will gain. Before today, the
commodity fell 7.9 percent this week to 25.27 cents a pound.  Ten of 12 respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s NYSE
Liffe exchange will slump, and two said it will rise. The price
declined 8.1 percent this week to $655.40 per metric ton.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener may narrow next
week, according to six respondents. Five said the spread would
widen, and one forecast little change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
