A Bangladesh panel set up to
investigate a decline in the stock prices that forced the Dhaka
Stock Exchange to shut twice recommended the government remove
members of the market regulator and demutualize bourses.  Bangladesh’s Securities & Exchange Commission “was
responsible for the market crash as it did not do adequate due
diligence,” Chairman of the Capital Market Investigation
Committee Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled said in a phone interview from
Dhaka. The SEC Chairman Ziaul Khondker didn’t answer five calls
made to his mobile phone and didn’t respond to a text message.  The DSE General Index has lost 21 percent so far this year,
with trading being halted at least twice prompting local
investors to riot and pelt stones at the exchange. The panel
submitted its report to the finance minister today and also
recommended that the nation’s two stock exchanges demutualize to
improve transparency.  The benchmark index climbed 1.3 percent to 6,540.6 as of
the 3 p.m. local time close in Dhaka, according to the bourse’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
