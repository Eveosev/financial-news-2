Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s South
Korean banking unit will keep paying dividends to its parent
company after making its first payment last year, the unit’s
chief executive officer said.  The company paid a 100 billion won ($92 million) dividend
for 2010 and will continue making payments of a “proper size,”
 Richard Hill , CEO of  Standard Chartered  First Bank, told
reporters in Seoul today.  Standard Chartered is “committed” to the Korean market
and has no plan to pull out of the country, CEO Peter Sands said
at the briefing with Hill. Sands spoke after being asked whether
the U.K. bank will reduce franchises in  South Korea  after
announcing 27 branch closures this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
