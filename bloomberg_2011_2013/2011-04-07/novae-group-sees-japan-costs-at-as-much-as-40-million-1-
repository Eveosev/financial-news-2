Novae Group Plc (NVA) , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, said it expects the net cost of the Japanese earthquake
and tsunami to be about $25 million to $40 million.  The net cost of losses from the floods in Australia in
January and Cyclone Yasi in February will be about about $10
million, while the  New Zealand  earthquake could cost it as much
as $30 million, Novae said in a statement today.  Lloyd’s insurers have been hurt by the 9.0 magnitude quake
which struck northeast Japan on March 11. Separate earthquakes
in New Zealand, Chile as well as the flooding in Australia also
dented insurers’ catastrophe reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
