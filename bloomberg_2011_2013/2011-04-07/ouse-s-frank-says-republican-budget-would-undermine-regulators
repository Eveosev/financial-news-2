Republican efforts to roll back
federal spending to 2008 levels would force the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to cut two-thirds of its staff and
put the Securities and Exchange Commission in the position of
subsidizing the government, Representative Barney Frank said.  The fiscal 2012 budget proposed by  House Republicans  would
be a “serious threat” to the financial-industry regulators,
said Frank, the Massachusetts lawmaker who is the top Democrat
on the House Financial Services Committee, at a news conference
in  Washington  today.  Funding for the SEC and the CFTC, which received expanded
authority under the regulatory overhaul that bears Frank’s name,
is less than the cost of a week’s worth of munitions in the
fighting in Libya, the lawmaker said. He also noted that since
the SEC collects fees from regulated entities, its funding
doesn’t have to be cut in the name of deficit-reduction.  “The Republicans want to turn the SEC into a bigger
moneymaker,” Frank said. “They’re doing it under the guise of
 deficit reduction .” The budget proposal would require the SEC
to cut 1,000 jobs, he said.  House Democrats including Frank based their estimates of
the impact of proposed cuts on the 2012 spending plan outlined
by Representative  Paul Ryan , the Wisconsin Republican who leads
the House Budget Committee. The plan didn’t include specific
numbers for agency funding levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
