South Korea ’s current-account
surplus is expected to widen in March from February, supported
by robust exports, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said.  The ministry also said in a statement today that domestic
private consumption may slow down as consumer confidence fell to
the lowest level in almost two years in March, hit by the
disaster in Japan and increases in food and energy prices.  Rising oil prices, Japan’s trouble containing a damaged
nuclear plant hit by a record earthquake and ensuing tsunami
last month, and  Europe ’s debt problems are adding to the
external uncertainty, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
