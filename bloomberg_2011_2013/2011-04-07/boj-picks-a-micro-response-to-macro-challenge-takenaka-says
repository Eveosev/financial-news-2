The Bank of  Japan ’s offer of credit
to cash-strapped businesses falls short of what’s needed to
bolster growth after last month’s record earthquake, according
to the former minister who led a clean-up of the nation’s banks.  The central bank yesterday offered a 1 trillion yen ($12
billion) one-year loan program to banks designed to get funds to
companies hit by the record quake and tsunami March 11. Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa left the main policy tools untouched, having
boosted an asset-purchase program by 5 trillion yen last month.  Shirakawa has eschewed the “insurance policy” approach of
the  Federal Reserve  in responding to risks, with policy stimulus
added so far amounting to about one-tenth the U.S. quantitative-
easing initiative. As the economy enters a likely contraction
this quarter, with a report today showing one gauge of sentiment
slumping by a record, lawmakers may prod the BOJ to do more.  “The bank will likely continue to do such a micro
policy,” Heizo Takenaka, who served in former Prime Minister
 Junichiro Koizumi ’s cabinet and was credited with forcing debt-
laden banks to write off 19 trillion yen in bad loans. “However,
the problem is macro monetary policy,” he said, urging the bank
to step up purchases of  government bonds  in the secondary market.  BOJ officials have focused on maintaining financial
stability in the wake of the magnitude-9 temblor and tsunami,
injecting a record 15 trillion yen of one-day funds into the
banking system on March 14. The bank “has been responding
properly to additional fund demand,” Takenaka said.  Shirakawa to Watch  Shirakawa said at a press conference following the bank’s
meeting yesterday in Tokyo that policy makers will watch how the
steps taken so far will affect the economy. The bank downgraded
its  assessment  of growth for the first time since October,
seeing “strong downward pressure” after the catastrophe.  The Economy Watchers index, a survey of merchants, slid to
27.7 in March from 48.4 in February, the Cabinet Office said,
the biggest drop since the survey began in 2000.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average was little changed after
yesterday’s announcement; it rose 1.9 percent to 9,768.08 at the
close today in Tokyo. Stocks fell earlier after a magnitude 7.1
earthquake struck northern Japan last night, knocking out some
power at nuclear facilities.  The special credit program unveiled yesterday may help
avert corporate bankruptcies in a region that’s suffered in
excess of 27,000 people killed or missing and more than 200,000
buildings destroyed. Three prefectures -- Miyagi, Iwate and
Fukushima, site of the crippled nuclear power plant -- accounted
for most of the damage.  Bailout Comparison  The gross domestic product of the three prefectures amounts
to an equivalent of about $243 billion, or more than Ireland or
 Portugal . Portugal is seeking a European Union rescue package
that may be worth as much as 75 billion euros ($107 billion),
two European officials with knowledge of the situation said this
week. Ireland’s bailout was 85 billion euros.  The disaster has affected production and consumer sentiment
nationwide. Total retail sales in the world’s third-largest
economy may drop as much as 10 percent this year, FamilyMart Co.,
the country’s No. 3 convenience-store chain, said yesterday.
Companies from Toyota Motor Corp. to Sony Corp. have suspended
factories.  “With the economy in this dire of a situation, the BOJ’s
continued passivity means it further loses credibility,” said
Hiroshi Miyazaki, chief economist at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
in  Tokyo . “Right now, the government’s been pretty quiet but
soon enough, spurred by public opinion, politicians will start
to step up pressure on the BOJ. The BOJ will then have no choice
but to play its next card.”  Rate Becomes Useless  The BOJ has kept the benchmark overnight rate at 0.5
percent or less since 1996, and asset purchases and loan
programs have become the BOJ’s main policy tools. The bank
yesterday left the rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.  Damage from the quake and tsunami is estimated by the
government to swell to as much as 25 trillion yen. Because the
hit to the economy is mostly from production, so-called demand-
side stimulus such as quantitative easing may be less effective,
according to Azusa Kato, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in Tokyo.  “Disruptions to supply chains and power shortage are
forcing companies to cut production, fueling concerns over a
recession,” said Kato. “The most important measure Japan needs
to take right now isn’t further monetary easing. It’s all about
measures to counter power shortage.”  ‘Repeatedly’ Mistaken  Takenaka, 60, now a professor at  Keio University  in Tokyo
and chairman of temporary-staff provider Pasona Group Inc., said
the central bank “unfortunately has been pursuing mistaken
policy repeatedly” for years, failing to end deflation.  Consumer prices haven’t risen at a sustained 1 percent
annual pace -- the definition of  price stability  laid out by BOJ
board members -- since the early 1990s. Prices, excluding fresh
food, dropped 0.3 percent in February from a year before.  Deflation may be poised to end as the yen weakens and
commodity prices climb. The currency has retreated 7.4 percent
in the past three weeks amid signs U.S. growth is picking up,
auguring a widening interest-rate gap between the U.S. and Japan.
Crude oil has climbed 27 percent in the past year.  A shortage of daily necessities along with rising raw
material costs and a weakening yen may prompt companies to pass
on costs to consumers, fueling inflationary concerns in the
future, Takenaka said.  BOJ policy makers could help anchor price expectations at
the same time as they inject more stimulus by setting an
inflation target, said Takenaka, who was economy and banking
minister from 2002 to 2004, then led a project of selling the
postal service, aimed at boosting financial competition, from
2004 to 2006. He suggested a range of 1 percent to 3 percent  ‘Ridiculous Argument’  Shirakawa yesterday reiterated his opposition to the BOJ
underwriting government debt with direct purchases, warning that
it would undermine the yen. Some ruling-party and opposition
Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have urged the step, which is
allowed in emergency circumstances with approval by the Diet.  Takenaka echoed current cabinet members in Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan ’s government in opposing direct BOJ financing of
deficit spending. He also rejected the proposal of some
legislators of a temporary tax increase, saying it was “a
ridiculous argument” at a time of economic weakness.  Kan plans to unveil what he says may be the first of
multiple supplementary budgets this month. He has yet to detail
how the spending will be paid for. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters yesterday the first budget may be 4
trillion yen.  “It’s too early to discuss” the possibility of
instructing the BOJ to buy government debt directly,  Sadakazu Tanigaki , who served in Koizumi’s cabinet and now heads the LDP,
told reporters yesterday. “That needs to be discussed in the
process of figuring out how much fiscal spending will be
necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
