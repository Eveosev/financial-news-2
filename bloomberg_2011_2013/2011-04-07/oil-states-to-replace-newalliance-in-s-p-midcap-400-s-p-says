Oil States International Inc. (OIS)  will
replace  NewAlliance Bancshares Inc. (NAL)  in the Standard & Poor’s
MidCap 400 Index, and LivePerson Inc. will fill Oil States’s
spot in the S&P SmallCap 600, S&P said in a statement.  The changes will take place after the close of trading on
April 14 and are being made because Buffalo, New York-based
 First Niagara Financial Group Inc. (FNFG)  is acquiring NewAlliance in a
deal expected to be completed around that time, S&P said.  Oil States, which is based in Houston, has a market value
of $3.88 billion. Its shares have risen 66 percent in the past
year, compared with a 63 percent gain for an index of energy
companies in the S&P SmallCap 600.  LivePerson, a New York-based Internet sales and service
provider, has a market value of $653 million. Its shares have
advanced 51 percent in the past year, compared with a 40 percent
rise for a gauge of technology companies in the Russell 2000
Index. The stock jumped 5.7 percent to $13.22 in after-hours
trading as of 5:30 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
