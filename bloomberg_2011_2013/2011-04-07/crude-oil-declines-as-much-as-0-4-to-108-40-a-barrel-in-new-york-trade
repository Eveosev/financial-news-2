Oil dropped from the highest in 30
months in  New York  on speculation rising fuel prices may dent
demand in  China  and the U.S., the world’s biggest crude users.  Futures slid as much as 0.6 percent after China’s National
Development and Reform Commission said gasoline and diesel
retail prices will increase today because of global crude costs.
The world’s second-biggest economy raised  interest rates  for the
fourth time since October this week to cool inflation. U.S. oil
inventories climbed for a fifth week to 357.7 million barrels,
according to an Energy Department report yesterday.  “Typically when China raises interest rates, that has some
impact on the market because that would mean they are tightening
policies and the usual flow of thought is that it would impact
demand,” said Serene Lim, an energy and commodity strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore.
“Nonetheless, momentum is still quite bullish. A few of the
crude complexes have breached key resistance.”  Crude oil for May delivery slipped as much as 60 cents to
$108.23 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract was at $108.49 at 3:40 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, it climbed 49 cents to $108.83, the
highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008. Prices are up 26
percent from a year ago.  Brent oil for May settlement fell 50 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $121.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Yesterday, the contract increased 8 cents to $122.30,
the highest settlement since Aug. 1, 2008.  Brent Resistance  Brent prices may rally further after surpassing a key
resistance level at $119 a barrel, Lim said. “Once it breaches
that, the next level is $149 a barrel,” she said.  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $13.20 to
U.S. futures. The difference between front-month contracts in
 London  and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21 as
unrest spread in the Middle East and North Africa and stockpiles
climbed at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York
futures. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  China raised the ceiling for gasoline prices by 500 yuan
($76) a metric ton and for diesel prices by 400 yuan. The cost
of No. 3 jet fuel gained by 500 yuan to 6,840 yuan a ton,
according to the country’s top economic planner.  Prices also dropped after the Bank of  Japan  cut its
assessment of the economy, the world’s third-largest energy
user, following the nation’s record earthquake on March 11.  U.S. crude advanced 10 percent in March as fighting in
Libya cut exports from  Africa ’s third-largest producer. Rebels
aiming to end Muammar Qaddafi’s 42-year rule and forces loyal to
the Libyan leader waged battles between the Qaddafi stronghold
of Sirte and the rebel-held city of Ajdabiyah.  Libya Premium  “The Libyan situation has been priced in” to the oil
price, said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at
National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne . “We haven’t seen
further signs of contagion and as a result prices seem
relatively comfortable around this range.”  The conflict is the bloodiest in uprisings that have
toppled the presidents of Tunisia and  Egypt  and spread to
Bahrain,  Iran , Yemen and Oman.  Nigerian output may decline after the presidential election
takes place on April 16, according to  Barclays Capital . That
would curb supplies of the light, low-sulfur grades that have
been curtailed because of fighting in  Libya . More than 50 people
have died in election-related violence since July, according to
Amnesty International, while sectarian clashes in the north have
claimed the lives of at least 200 since Dec. 24.  Crude Inventories  Total U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.95 million barrels,
the Energy Department report showed. A 2 million-barrel gain was
projected, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Supplies at Cushing slipped 16,000 barrels to 41.9 million
in the week ended April 1. Stockpiles in the previous week were
at the highest level since the government began keeping records
in 2004.  U.S. gasoline inventories fell 357,000 barrels to 216.7
million last week, the Energy Department said. They were
forecast to drop by 1.9 million barrels, the survey showed.
Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, rose 195,000 barrels to 153.5 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
