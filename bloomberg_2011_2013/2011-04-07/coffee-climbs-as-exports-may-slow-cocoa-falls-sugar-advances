Coffee rose to a two-week high in
 New York  on speculation that growers won’t be able to maintain
the recent pace of exports. Cocoa fell, while sugar gained.  In the five months ended Feb. 28, coffee shipments climbed
14 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the
 International Coffee Organization . That pace “is unlikely to be
maintained in coming months, especially in light of reduced
availability in Brazil,” the world’s largest producer, the
London-based ICO said yesterday. Prices have almost doubled in
the past year.  “Supplies are very tight,” said Sterling Smith, an
analyst at Country Hedging in  St. Paul , Minnesota. “People are
willing to pay a premium to secure supplies.”  Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 7.65 cents, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $2.728 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the commodity touched $2.7585, the
highest since March 22.  Inventories in producing countries are at the lowest since
records began, according to the ICO. Last month,  Mexico ’s
exports fell 16 percent from a year earlier, the nation’s coffee
association Amecafe said. The country mainly produces arabica
beans.  In  London , robusta-coffee futures for July delivery
advanced $54, or 2.3 percent, to $2,443 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Cocoa futures for July delivery dropped $12, or 0.4
percent, to $3,002 a ton in New York. Raw-sugar futures for July
delivery gained 0.3 cent, or 1.2 percent, to 25.27 cents a pound
on ICE.  In London, cocoa declined, and refined sugar rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
