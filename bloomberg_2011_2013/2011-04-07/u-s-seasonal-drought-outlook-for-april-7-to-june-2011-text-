Following is the text of the U.S.
 Seasonal Drought Outlook  as released by the National Weather
Service in Camp Springs, Maryland:  Latest Seasonal Assessment - The seasonal drought outlook for
April-June 2011 is based in part on stream flows, soil moisture
conditions, observed precipitation anomalies, mountainous snow
water content, the CAS soil moisture outlook, and the CPC
monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation outlooks.
Precipitation has been above-normal for the past few weeks from
 New England  southwestward across the Appalachians to the central
Gulf Coast states, as well as over central  Florida , bringing
significant drought relief to some areas. West-central Florida
in particular received up to 9 inches (225 mm) of rain during
what is normally considered the height of their dry season. In
contrast,  Arkansas , most of Louisiana, and the southern half of
the Great Plains region has received less precipitation than
usual, resulting in further deterioration of drought, especially
around the Ark-La-Tex area. For the April-June forecast period,
it is unlikely for the region to experience much relief from the
continuing and intensifying drought. In the Southwest, April-
June is considered the dry season, and little relief is
anticipated until the climatological onset of the summer
monsoon. In Hawaii, after a wet La Nina winter for much of the
Islands, the typical trade wind pattern is likely to return,
with precipitation being confined mainly to windward slopes.  Next Outlook issued: April 21, 2011 at 8:30 AM EDT  SOURCE:  National Weather Service   To contact the reporter on this story:
