Fingrid Oyj, the operator of
 Finland ’s power grid, said maintenance will reduce capacity on
the electricity cable between Finland and  Sweden  this month.  Available commercial capacity from Finland to Sweden will
decline 33 percent to 1,100 megawatts from April 11 through
April 20, the company said today in a filing to the Nord Pool
Spot AS exchange.  Capacity from Sweden to Finland will drop 27 percent to
1,500 megawatts over the same period, according to the filing.  The reduction is due to “construction work of Fennoskan
2,” the cable expansion between the two nations, Fingrid said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
