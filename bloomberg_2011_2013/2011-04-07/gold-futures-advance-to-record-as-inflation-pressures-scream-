Gold climbed to a record for the
third straight day on speculation that inflation will accelerate
as the U.S. trails  Europe  in raising  interest rates .  Bullion advanced to an all-time high of $1,466.50 an ounce.
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  lifted
borrowing costs for the first time in almost three years.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 4 that
any boost to consumer prices would be “transitory.” The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose to
the highest since September 2008.  “Gold, oil, the CRB Index, foreign currencies and Treasury
yields are all screaming at Bernanke that it’s time to join Mr.
Trichet in the fight against inflation,” said Michael Pento, a
senior economist at Euro Pacific Capital in New York. “But the
sad truth is that the double-dipping real estate market and the
onerous U.S. debt levels prohibit interest-rate hikes without
dire consequences in the short term.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 80 cents to settle at
$1,459.30 an ounce at 1:53 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
metal for immediate delivery in  London  gained as much as 0.4
percent to a record $1,464.93.  Trichet signaled more rate increases after the ECB today
raised the benchmark rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1
percent. The Fed has kept the benchmark U.S. rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to stimulate growth.  Dollar ‘Differential’  “Going forward, there will be a differential between the
euro and the dollar because the U.S. can’t or isn’t inclined to
raise rates,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “Gold is supported by the
view that the dollar will weaken.”  Prices will average $1,460 this year, up from a previous
forecast of $1,426, Standard Chartered Plc said today in a
report. The metal will average $1,650 next year, the bank said.  Gains were limited as some investors locked in profits,
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock in Chicago.  “Everyone had priced in the ECB rate hike, and the dollar
regained a bit of strength, which dampened the sell-dollar-buy-
gold trade,” Klopfenstein said.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 16.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $39.552 an ounce on the Comex. Yesterday, the price
reached $39.785, the highest since January 1980. That year, the
most-active contract reached a record $50.35.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $4.35, or 0.6
percent, to $780.25 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for July delivery fell $7.20, or 0.4
percent, to $1,790.60 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
