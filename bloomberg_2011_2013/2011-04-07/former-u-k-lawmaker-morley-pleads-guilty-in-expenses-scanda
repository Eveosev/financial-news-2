Former U.K. lawmaker Elliot Morley
pleaded guilty to improperly claiming more than 30,000 pounds
($49,000) in parliamentary expenses.  Morley, a 58-year-old former Labour Party lawmaker, entered
the plea at a court in  London  today. Judge John Saunders said he
would sentence Morley at a later date.  Morley is the third Labour Party lawmaker to plead guilty
to expenses fraud since the Daily Telegraph newspaper began to
publish stories about abuses of parliamentary expenses in 2009.
Former lawmakers David Chaytor and Eric Illsley, were sentenced
earlier this year after admitting guilt.  John Taylor , a Conservative member of Britainâ€™s unelected
second chamber, the House of Lords, was convicted of similar
charges in January. Last week  Jim Devine , formerly a Labour
lawmaker, was sentenced to 16 months in prison after being
convicted by a jury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
