Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , the
buyout and hedge-fund firm run by  Daniel Mudd , said its Asia-
focused macro fund rose 3.5 percent in March, even as uprisings
in the Middle East and Japan’s worst earthquake roiled markets.  The New York-based firm said it started the Fortress Asia
Macro Fund on March 1, according to a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Hedge funds  gained, on average, 0.2
percent last month, according to Eurekahedge Pte, based on 25
percent of funds that have reported to the Singapore-based
industry data provider as of today.  Fortress aims to increase the size of the Asia-focused
macro hedge fund to $500 million, after it started trading with
the firm’s own money and that of a few clients, three people
with knowledge of the plan said last month. Adam Levinson, co-
chief investment officer of global macro funds, moved to
 Singapore  from New York in January to lead the firm’s Asia-
specific macro-trading activities from the newly opened office.  The Fortress Macro Fund Ltd. gained 1.8 percent in March,
the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
