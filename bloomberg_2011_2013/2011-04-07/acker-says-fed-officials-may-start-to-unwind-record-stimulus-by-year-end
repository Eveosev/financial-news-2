President Jeffrey Lacker said the U.S. central bank could begin
unwinding record stimulus by year-end.  “I think rate hikes by year-end are certainly a possible
outcome at this point given what we see in the momentum in
economic growth and given how the inflation risks seem to have
evolved,” Lacker told reporters in Roanoke,  Virginia , today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
