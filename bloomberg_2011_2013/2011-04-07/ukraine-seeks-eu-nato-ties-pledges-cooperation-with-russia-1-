Ukraine plans to sign an accord with
the European Union this year and continue cooperation with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization even as it’s “normalizing”
relations with  Russia , President  Viktor Yanukovych  said.  “I want to reiterate that integration into the European
Union didn’t and won’t hurt the development of strategic
cooperation with Russia,” Yanukovych said during his annual
address to parliament in Kiev today. “Normalizing relations
with Russia is an integral part of Ukraine’s European choice.”  Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 46 million people, is
seeking to sign the  association agreement  with the EU to deepen
economic and political ties with the European bloc. Russia is
wooing Ukraine to join its customs union and common economic
space with Belarus and Kazakhstan.  Membership of the organization would entail annual savings
of $8 billion on fuel purchases for Ukraine, which relies on
Russia for more than 50 percent of its natural-gas needs, OAO
Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Valery Golubev said
today.  Yanukovych took over as president last year from  Viktor
Yushchenko , who advocated closer ties with the West and less
dependence on Russia. The current Ukrainian leader has ruled out
formal NATO membership for the country.  “Development of relations with the customs union will be
based on a new accord on free trade and a possible agreement on
cooperation,” Yanukovych said without elaborating.  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  will visit Kiev next
week as Ukraine seeks to review the gas accord signed in January
2009, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
