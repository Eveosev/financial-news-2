Copper in  London  may decline for the
first time in three days as some investors deemed the biggest
gain in two weeks as excessive amid a lack of signs that Chinese
demand is picking up.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was little
changed at $9,606 per metric ton at 3:37 p.m. in  Singapore  after
earlier losing as much as 0.4 percent. The metal gained 2.3
percent yesterday, the most since March 23.  “Recent price gains have hinged on China’s demand picking
up and that’s not happening yet,” Shi Wenzhu, an analyst at
Huatai Great Wall Futures Co., said from Shanghai. “Inventories
remain high and premiums aren’t picking up.”  Inventories in LME warehouses have risen 17 percent this
year, climbing to a nine-month high of 442,325 tons on April 5.
Copper stockpiles in  Shanghai  are up 23 percent this year.  Premiums paid by Chinese importers over the London Metal
Exchange cash price have been quoted at $20 a ton on a cost,
insurance and freight basis to Shanghai since February,
according to data from industry publication Metal Bulletin. A
rise in premiums would indicate a pickup in demand.  “We remain cautious on the base-metals group, particularly
on copper, which remains elevated despite rising inventories,
sluggish physical premiums, and persistent questions about
hidden Chinese stocks,”  Edward Meir , a senior analyst at MF
Global, wrote in a monthly report yesterday.  Shanghai warehouses hold about 600,000 tons of refined
metal, with a further 100,000 tons in southern ports, equivalent
to about 11 percent of China’s total annual usage, Standard Bank
Plc analyst  Leon Westgate  said in a March 28 report.  Japan ’s Economy  Copper in London dropped to a three-month low of $8,944.50
a ton on March 15 on concern Japan’s record quake will hamper
economic growth. The  Bank of Japan  today cut its assessment of
the economy following the March 11 temblor and ensuing tsunami.  Copper on the Comex in  New York  declined as much as 0.5
percent to $4.35 per pound. The contract rose 2.5 percent
yesterday, also the most since March 23. June-delivery metal on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained as much as 0.7 percent to
71,950 yuan ($10,994) a ton and ended the day at 71,690 yuan.  Expectations that global copper supply will lag behind
demand drove a 30 percent rally last year and pushed the price
in London to a record $10,190 on Feb. 15. Rio Tinto Group, the
third-largest mining company, expects copper demand in  China  and
other emerging markets to grow faster than output, prompting a
global deficit of as much as to 500,000 tons this year,  Andrew Harding , head of the company’s copper business, said yesterday.  Lead in London shed 0.5 percent to $2,805 a ton, and zinc
lost 0.3 percent to $2,443.75 a ton. Nickel rose 1.7 percent to
$26,869 a ton, tin advanced 0.6 percent to $32,300 per ton, and
aluminum gained 0.7 percent to $2,688 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
