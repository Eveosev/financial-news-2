Oil options volatility edged up as
the underlying front-month futures rose to a 30-month high for
the fifth time in the past six trading days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.6 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 29.5 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery gained $1.47, or 1.4 percent, to
$110.30 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008, as a fire burned at
 Libya â€™s Sarir oil field. Prices are up 28 percent from a year
ago. June futures rose $1.40, or 1.3 percent, to $110.88.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $105 puts with 1,657 lots changing hands. They fell 26 cents
to 24 cents a barrel. June $120 calls, the next-most active
contract, gained 20 cents to $1.54 a barrel with 1,317 contracts
trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  May options expire in one week, on April 14.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  September $150 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,703 lots changing hands. They increased 9
