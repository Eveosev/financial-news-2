A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck
the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, sending shockwaves that
were felt more than 366 miles away in  Mexico  City. There were no
immediate reports of damages or injuries.  Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned  oil company , said it
hasn’t received any reports of damage following the earthquake.  Pemex, as the company is known, evacuated for a “brief
period” an administrative building in Ciudad del Carmen,
Campeche and its Salina Cruz refinery, said a spokesman, who
can’t be named because of company policy, in a telephone
interview from Mexico City.  “Refinery output was not affected,” the spokesman said.  The temblor, which occurred at 8:11 a.m. local time, was
centered offshore about 91 miles southeast of Coatzacoalcos,
Mexico, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
