Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Japanâ€™s
third-largest copper producer, aims to resume partial operations
in mid-July at its Onahama copper smelter after the March 11
quake and tsunami halted production.  The Tokyo-based company is repairing damaged parts and
equipment at the smelter in Fukushima prefecture, northern Japan,
it said in a  statement  today. On March 14, the company declared
force majeure on concentrate shipments to its smelter.  The Onahama smelter has an annual capacity of 300,000 tons
and produces between 220,000 tons to 240,000 tons each year.  Mitsubishi Materials also plans to resume full production
this month at its Iwaki plant in Fukushima and its Ibaraki plant
in June. Shares rose 0.4 percent to close at 271 yen today.  The company has 50 percent  stake  in the Onahama smelter,
followed by Dowa Holdings Co. with 31.6 percent and Furukawa
Metals & Resources Co. with 12.7 percent. The remainder is owned
by other Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Cable
Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
