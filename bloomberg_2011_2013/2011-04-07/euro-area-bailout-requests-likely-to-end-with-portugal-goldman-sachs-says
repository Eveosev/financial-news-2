Portugal  is likely to be the last
euro region country to seek an international bailout after the
government yesterday joined Greece and Ireland in seeking aid,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  “We do not expect any other EMU sovereign to be in need of
financial assistance,” said Francesco Garzarelli, Goldman
Sachs’s London-based chief interest-rate strategist, in a report
to clients. While Goldman doesn’t expect any “principal
impairment” for bonds sold by Ireland and Portugal “a
‘voluntary’ extension of the maturity profile of Greek debt is
likely.’”  Portugal is aiming for a package that may be worth as much
as 75 billion euros ($107 billion), two European officials with
knowledge of the situation said. Bond yields have surged since
Socrates offered to resign on March 23 after parliament rejected
proposed budget cuts.  The bonds of “outer peripheral” countries “are likely to
remain volatile and less liquid as they are removed from bond
indices and fixed-income mandates,” Garzarelli said. Spreads
between the yields of  Italy , Spain, Belgium and those of AAA-
rated economies such as  Germany  “will slowly compress,” he
said.  Goldman Sachs expects half of Portugal’s funding to come
from European funds and the rest to come from the  International
Monetary Fund . The EU may use the opportunity to align the
bailout lending rates of Portugal and Ireland with those of
Greece, it said.  The  European Central Bank  is also likely to remove the
rating threshold for Portuguese debt, according to Goldman Sachs  To contact the reporters on this story:
