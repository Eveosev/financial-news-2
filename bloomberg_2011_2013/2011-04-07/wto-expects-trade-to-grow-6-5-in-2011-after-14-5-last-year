Global commerce will grow 6.5
percent this year after expanding a record 14.5 percent in 2010
as economies from  China  to  Brazil  recover from the worst
recession in six decades, the  World Trade Organization  said.  The Geneva-based WTO said today it sees a “greater degree
of uncertainty to any forecast” for 2011 as growing inflation,
unrest in the Middle East and the March earthquake in  Japan  have
“tilted the balance of risk toward the downside.”  Developing economies will lead global trade growth this
year, with a forecast 9.5 percent rise, compared with 4.5
percent for developed nations. Commerce expanded an average 6
percent yearly between 1990 and 2008, the WTO said. It used
trade volumes rather than values for its assessment to avoid
distortions caused by changes in commodity prices or exchange
rates.  “Trade growth is stabilizing at levels that are both more
conventional and sustainable,” WTO Director-General  Pascal Lamy 
said at a news conference. He added that “the hangover from the
financial crisis is still with us,” urging the trade group’s
153 members to open their markets.  Out of Recession  Emerging markets led the world out of the recession
triggered by the banking crisis in developed nations, with China
replacing Japan as the world’s second-largest economy last year.
While most countries have emerged from recessions, the WTO
continues to  press  governments to take steps to stimulate
commerce and bolster the global trading system.  Trade forecasts are based on economic growth of 2.2 percent
in developed countries and 5.8 percent in the rest of the world.  Increasing oil prices are also increasing pressure on
global trade, the WTO said. With Libyan oil exports halted for
an indeterminate period amid the rebellion against  Muammar Qaddafi , “an interruption of supplies for any other major
producer would raise prices higher still,” the WTO said. “In
such an event, the WTO would have to revisit its trade
projections.”  Lamy said the Japan crisis forced forecasters into a
“slight downgrade from the initial estimates” for the world’s
third-biggest economy. Japan’s exports may fall between 0.5 and
1.6 percent this year, while imports may rise between 0.4
percent and 1.3 percent.  Shift of Power  The seven biggest emerging markets, led by China and  India ,
will surpass the Group of Seven economies in size in 2032 as the
financial crisis accelerates the shift of power in the global
economy, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said in January.  The WTO predicted last September that global trade would
expand 13.5 percent in 2010, raising its March 2010 forecast of
9.5 percent growth for the second time. The trade arbiter  said 
on March 14 that the value of world merchandise trade based on
current U.S. dollars -- meaning inflation wasn’t taken into
account and the figures weren’t seasonally adjusted -- surged 22
percent last year, returning to pre-crisis levels.  That came after global trade fell more than 12 percent in
2009, the biggest contraction since World War II. The value of
goods traded globally tumbled 23 percent in 2009 to $12.2
trillion and the value of trade in commercial services fell 13
percent to $3.3 trillion, the first year-on-year drop since
1983.  To contact the reporters on this story:
