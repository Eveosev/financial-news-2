European power prices fell as demand
eases ahead of the weekend, while French energy workers went on
strike and cut production from the country’s nuclear reactors.  French baseload power for tomorrow dropped 9.6 percent to
49.50 euros ($70.66) a megawatt-hour, as of 12:30 p.m. Paris
time, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
equivalent German contract lost 2.9 percent to 52.25 euros,
while the U.K contract declined 1 percent to 50.60 pounds a
megawatt-hour.  European power markets are linked by cables, and
electricity usually flows toward the markets where prices are
higher. For this reason, changes in operations in one country
can influence prices in others.  A 24-hour strike by energy workers starting at 8 a.m. local
time reduced output by 18,000 megawatts, with about half of that
decrease coming at 12 of Electricite de France SA’s nuclear
plants, said Laurent Langlard, an EDF representative for the CGT
labor union.  EDF’s press office didn’t have an immediate comment on the
numbers.  Power demand often diminishes before weekends as businesses
wind down operations. National Grid Plc, the U.K. grid manager,
predicts peak power demand to fall 1.7 percent to 41,410
megawatts tomorrow,  data on its website  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
