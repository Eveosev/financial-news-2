Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  has developed an
equity trading algorithm that imitates high-speed market-making
strategies, the Financial Times reported, citing Jose Marques,
the bank’s global head of electronic equity trading.  The algorithm will use models that predict price changes
over a period of microseconds, and other quantitative tools to
execute trades for institutional clients such as pension funds
or mutual funds, the newspaper said.  Institutional investors’ concerns about the impact of high-
frequency trading have accelerated use of “dark pools” and
block-trading venues such as Liquidnet and BIDS Trading, which
enable institutions to trade with one another without the
mediation of market-makers in public markets, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
