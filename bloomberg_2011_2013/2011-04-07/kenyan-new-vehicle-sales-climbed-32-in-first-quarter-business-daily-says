New car sales in Kenya jumped 32
percent in the first quarter, boosted by increased demand for
pick-up trucks and buses, Business Daily reported, citing the
Kenya Motor Industry Association.  Sales grew to 2,451 units in the three months through March
from 1,851 units a year earlier, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said. A total of 13,000 vehicles may be sold this year, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
