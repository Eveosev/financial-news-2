U.S. individual income from wages,
 capital gains , dividends and business activity fell during
2009, according to tax  data  released today by the  Internal
Revenue Service .  Adjusted gross income decreased 6.9 percent in 2009, to
$7.6 trillion while salaries and wages fell 3.7 percent, to
about $5.8 trillion. Unemployment compensation increased 91.5
percent, to about $84.1 billion. Income from capital gains
decreased 46.1 percent, to $240.5 billion as ordinary dividend
income declined 25.5 percent, to $147.1 billion.  The figures reflect the hit most Americans felt in their
wallets during the height of the recession. The recession was
unusual in its impact on all income brackets, said Christopher
Low, chief economist at  First Horizon National Corp. (FHN) ’s FTN
Financial.  “It shows how different this recession was from the
typical one in that it hit upper-income workers particularly
hard,” Low said. “That’s particularly true for people
involved in finance.”  Revenue generated from the alternative minimum tax
declined 9.1 percent in 2009, to $20.2 billion. That marks the
first decrease in the tax, aimed at higher-income individuals,
since 2001, according to the IRS.  Income associated with business activities fell during
2009, the most recent year for which IRS tax data is available.
Net earnings from partnerships and S-corporations fell 9.1
percent, to $303.1 billion.  Other figures released today confirmed some of the most
prominent anecdotal evidence of the recession. For instance,
mobility declined as individuals faced difficulty selling their
homes. The IRS said deduction claims for moving expenses fell
30.8 percent in 2009, to about $2.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story: Steven Sloan in
