The euro extended its decline
against the dollar from a more than 14-month high reached
yesterday after  Portugal  became the third euro-area country to
request a financial bailout package.  The euro declined 0.4 percent to $1.4280 as of 8:24 a.m. in
 London . The shared currency reached $1.4349 yesterday, the
strongest level since Jan. 19, 2010.  Portugal is aiming for a package that may be worth as much
as 75 billion euros ($107 billion), two European officials with
knowledge of the situation said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
