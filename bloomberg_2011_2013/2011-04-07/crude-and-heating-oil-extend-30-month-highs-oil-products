Crude oil  extended its 30-month high
as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir oilfield, bolstering concern
that unrest in North Africa and the Middle East will spread,
curbing shipments. Heating oil also gained, extending its 31-
month high. Gasoline and ethanol slipped.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.47, or 1.4 percent, to
$110.30 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 21 percent this year and 28 percent in the past year.  “The situation in Libya, and issues elsewhere in the
Middle East, offer a chance to buy the rumor,” said  Sarah Emerson , managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “I see nothing in the near term to
stop the rally.”  Gasoline  Gasoline for May delivery declined 0.64 cent to $3.1865 a
gallon on the Nymex. Gasoline has increased 38 percent in a
year. Prices have slipped two consecutive days after surging to
a 32-month high. Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged
nationwide, increased 1.8 cents to $3.725 a gallon yesterday,
AAA said on its website.  Heating Oil  Heating oil for May delivery rose for the sixth straight
