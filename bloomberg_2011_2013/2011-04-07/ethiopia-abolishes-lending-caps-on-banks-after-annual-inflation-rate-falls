Ethiopia abolished lending caps on
lenders after inflation in the Horn of Africa country slowed,
said Yohannes Ayalew, deputy governor of monetary stability at
the  National Bank of Ethiopia .  The restrictions imposed in January 2009 to curb inflation
that peaked at 64.2 percent in July 2008 were removed on April
4, Yohannes said in an interview yesterday in the capital, Addis
Ababa. The inflation rate fell to 16.5 percent in February, a
level that is not a cause for concern, he said.  “Generally we are confident we have put in place monetary
and fiscal measure to control inflation,” he said.  The central bank has used measures that include requiring
banks to keep 15 percent of deposits in reserve and restricting
money supply growth to 9 percent as its main monetary policy
tools, Yohannes said. In addition, the national  budget deficit 
has been reduced to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product,
curbing  government spending , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
