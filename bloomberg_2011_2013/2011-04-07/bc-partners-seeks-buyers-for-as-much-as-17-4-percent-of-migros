BC Partners Holdings Ltd., a London-
based private equity firm, plans to sell as many as 31 million
shares of grocer  Migros Ticaret AS (MGROS) , or 17.4 percent of the
Turkey-based company.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. were
hired yesterday to find potential buyers for 26 million shares
with the option to purchase 5 million more, Migros Ticaret said
in a  filing  with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today. The stake
won’t be sold on the exchange and the sale price will be set
according to demand, the statement said.  Migros was unchanged at 35.1 liras on the bourse yesterday.
The share has risen 19 percent this year, beating the main ISE
National 100 index’s 4 percent advance.  Migros traded at 19.8 liras per share when BC Partners
announced it was buying a 51 percent stake on Feb. 14, 2008 for
$1.7 billion. It raised its stake to 98 percent by offering to
buy out minority shareholders at 21.95 liras a share.  BC Partners  owns Migros via unit MH Perakendecilik &
Ticaret AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
