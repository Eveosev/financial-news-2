Novartis AG (NOVN)  plans to sell the global
rights to manufacture and market Elidel skin cream to  Meda AB (MEDAA) 
for an upfront payment of $420 million.  Meda will make Elidel within three years of the agreement
being concluded, Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis said in a
statement today. Novartis will receive an accounting gain of
about $406 million from the transaction, of which $345 million
will be recognized by the end of 2011 and the remainder in the
following two years.  Elidel treats mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and
received regulatory clearance in the U.S. in 2001 and the
European Union in 2002, Novartis said. The deal with Stockholm-
based Meda, which will be filed for review with the U.S. and
some other antitrust authorities, is expected to be completed
during the second quarter of 2011, it said.  Meda will in turn license the drug in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico to Mississauga, Ontario-based  Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) , the Canadian company said today in a
statement. Terms of this contract will be disclosed when the
companies have a firm agreement, it said.  Valeant “has a stronger position” in dermatology than
Meda in that region, Anders Larnholt, vice president of  investor
relations  at the Swedish drugmaker, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
