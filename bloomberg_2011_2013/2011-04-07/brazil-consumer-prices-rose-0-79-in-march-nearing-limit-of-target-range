Brazilian inflation accelerated more
than economists expected in March from a year earlier, led by
food and transportation costs, taking the annual rate near the
upper limit of the government’s target range.  Consumer prices rose 6.3 percent in March from the same
month a year earlier and 0.79 percent from February, the
national statistics agency said today. The results beat the
median estimates of 6.19 percent and 0.7 percent in Bloomberg
surveys of analysts. Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  on March 17
said monthly inflation might slow to 0.45 percent as Brazil’s
economy decelerates toward 5 percent growth in 2011.  The year-on-year increase in consumer prices was “awful”
and boosts “considerably” the chances that annual inflation
could soon breach the 6.5 percent upper limit of the bank’s
target range, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Espirito
Santo Investment Bank in  Sao Paulo .  The last time the index was so close to exceeding the
target range was November 2008, when it reached 6.39 percent.
Brazil targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  “Economic activity is likely to remain strong in the
short-term, which should keep on challenging the perception that
inflationary pressures are going to abate,” Serrano wrote in a
note to clients. “We do not foresee any relief with regard to
inflation projections.”  Eggs and Potatoes  In the interest rate futures market, contracts maturing in
January 2012 were unchanged at 12.24 percent at 10:58 a.m. New
York time. The real rose 1.3 percent to 1.5937 per dollar,
strengthening beyond 1.60 for the first time since August 2008.  Food prices accelerated 0.75 percent in March from 0.23
percent in February, fueled by higher prices of eggs, potatoes,
sugar, milk and beans, the agency said. Transportation prices
rose 1.56 percent compared with 0.46 percent the previous month,
as plane tickets rose 29 percent due to demand during the
Carnival holiday.  The central bank, in its quarterly inflation report
published March 30, said the cost of meeting its 4.5 percent
inflation target this year is “too high,” prompting traders
and analysts to revise their interest rate outlook.  The eight-member bank board, known as Copom, said monetary
policy will seek to ensure inflation slows toward 4.5 percent by
2012, according to the report.  Brazilian manufacturers increased the use of installed
capacity to a record 83.6 percent in February, from a revised
83.1 percent in January, the national industrial confederation
said in a report released today in Brasilia. After falling for
two straight months, industrial sales rose 6.9 percent in
February from January, the confederation said.  Benchmark Rate  Policy makers led by central bank President Alexandre Tombini raised the benchmark rate by 50 basis points at each of
their two meetings in 2011 to 11.75 percent.  Economists covering  Brazil ’s economy raised their forecast
for 2012 inflation to 5 percent, from 4.91 percent, according to
a central bank survey of about 100 economists published April 4.
The same survey showed economists expected a 0.65 percent rise
in prices last month.  Economists in the survey raised their 2011 inflation
forecast to 6.02 percent, up from a week-earlier forecast of 6
percent.  Analysts expect the central bank to raise borrowing costs
by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 12.25 percent at
its April 19-20 policy meeting, the survey found.  Rate futures contracts show traders are betting the bank
will lift the rate to at least 12.5 percent by year-end, down
from a reading of 13.25 percent on March 9.  In a bid to slow the appreciation of the real, Brazil
yesterday extended a 6 percent tax on loans taken abroad to
those with maturities of up to two years instead of the previous
cap of 360 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
