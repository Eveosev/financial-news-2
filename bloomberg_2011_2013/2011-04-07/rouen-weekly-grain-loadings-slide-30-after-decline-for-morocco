Grain loaded for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell
30 percent in the week through yesterday as the volume of wheat
for  Morocco  fell to the lowest in five weeks.  Outgoing grain shipments were 173,930 metric tons between
March 31 and April 6, the Seine River port said in an e-mailed
statement today. Loadings dropped from 246,767 tons, the highest
level in five months, the previous week.  Algeria was the biggest export destination with 96,280 tons
of wheat in the most recent week. The country bought 2.95
million tons of wheat from Dec. 16 to Jan. 26, probably the
most-ever in a five-week period, French crops office
FranceAgriMer said in February.  France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
