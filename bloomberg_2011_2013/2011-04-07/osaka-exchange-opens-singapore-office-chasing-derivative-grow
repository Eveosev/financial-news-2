Osaka Securities Exchange Co. opened
an office in  Singapore  as it seeks to build its derivatives
business, a spokesman for the bourse confirmed.  “We opened the office in Singapore because many clients
who trade derivatives live there,” Fumihiro Yada, a Tokyo-based
spokesman for the bourse, said by phone today. “The office will
gather information including what kind of needs the clients
have.”  The Osaka exchange aims to be one of the 10 biggest
exchanges for derivatives, according to its medium-term business
plan for 2011 to 2013. It was the 15th-largest exchange for
derivatives in 2010, according to the bourse, while the top was
the Korea Exchange. The number of equity option contracts traded
on the exchange in the first two months of this year exceeded
the total volume for 2010,  exchange data  shows.  The bourse may consider expanding the office, which
currently has one employee, Yada said. Jiji Press newswire
reported earlier that the Osaka bourse opened the office in
Singapore.  To contact the reporters on this story:
