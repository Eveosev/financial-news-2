The euro may decline more than 4
percent against the yen if it drops below a trend line
connecting its lows of the past week, Gaitame.Com Research
Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The single currency would be poised to fall below the trend
line connecting the lows between March 29 and April 7 if it
fails to strengthen above 123 yen, said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher at the unit of  Japan ’s largest foreign-exchange
margin company in Tokyo.  “The euro may enter an adjustment period should it snap
its gain and drop below the line,” Kawabata said.  A decline below the trend line would send the euro toward
its 12-day moving average at 118.42 yen and then its previous
level of resistance at 116 yen, Kawabata said. Resistance refers
to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  The euro traded at 121.45 yen as of 8:34 a.m. in Tokyo
after strengthening to 122.61 yen on April 6, the highest level
since May 5. The common currency last traded below 116 yen on
March 29.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
