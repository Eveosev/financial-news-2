U.S. stock futures gained following
the  European Central Bank ’s interest-rate increase and
Portugal’s request for financial assistance and before
government data forecast to show a drop in jobless claims.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
increased 0.2 percent to 1,332.10 at 8:06 a.m. in  New York . Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 26 points, or 0.2
percent, to 12,383.  The  S&P 500  rose yesterday to the highest level since
February and the Dow climbed to an almost three-year high as
Cisco Systems Inc. spurred a technology rally and bank capital
increases in Europe lifted financial shares.            ECB policy makers meeting in  Frankfurt  today raised the
benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1
percent, as predicted by all 57 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. It also raised the marginal lending rate to 2 percent
from 1.75 percent and increased the deposit rate to 0.5 percent
from 0.25 percent, maintaining 75 basis-point corridors either
side of the benchmark.  Portugal is set to start hammering out a bailout package
that may total 75 billion euros ($107 billion) as it becomes the
third euro-region country to seek European Union aid.  The U.S. Labor Department may report that initial jobless
claims slipped to 385,000 last week, according to the median
estimate of 44 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The data
is scheduled for release at 8.30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
