Delancey Estates Plc has agreed to
buy out the equity owners of Plantation Place, one of the
largest buildings in  London â€™s financial district, and take over
the securitized debt, the Financial Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The deal brings the property fund manager, which is advised
by former British Land Co. Chief Executive Officer John Ritblat,
close to taking control of Plantation Place, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
