publicly traded Internet company, extended its longest winning
streak in three months, increasing 40 cents, or 4.3 percent, to
9.75 shillings.  Renaissance Capital  said yesterday the operator
is “a natural acquisition target.”  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, advanced for the first time in 17 trading
sessions, gaining 50 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 32.5 shillings on
speculation the decline to the lowest level since 2009 was
overdone given the company’s earnings. Its 14-day relative
strength index closed trading yesterday at 21.59 yesterday. A
reading below 30 indicates a stock is due to increase. The
company is valued at 7.4 times earnings for the year ended March
2010. That compares with 13.4 times profit a year ago, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA)  , Nigeria’s biggest lender by
market value, surged 43 kobo, or 3 percent, to 14.59 naira.
Nigerian stocks surged the most in two weeks, led by banks,
after a state-owned company set up to buy debts from lenders
said it raised 20.7 billion naira ($134 million) in bonds to
bolster its loan-buying program.  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) 
, the second-largest lender, rallied 30 kobo, or
2.2 percent, to 13.9 naira.  To contact the reporters on this story:
