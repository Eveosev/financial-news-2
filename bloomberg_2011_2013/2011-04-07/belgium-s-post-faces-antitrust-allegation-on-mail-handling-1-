De Post NV/La Poste SA,  Belgium ’s
state-controlled postal company, used its dominance to thwart
smaller competitors in the market for mail-handling services, a
legal panel of the country’s competition watchdog said.  An investigation showed De Post imposed discriminatory
conditions between its own customers and the mail handlers as
well as between the mail handlers themselves, the Brussels-based
prosecutors’ college said in a statement today. It referred the
case for further consideration by antitrust authorities.  The case follows complaints from G3 Worldwide (Belgium) NV,
Publimail NV and Link2Biz NV. The discriminatory practices,
which included a refusal to sell and the reinforcement of
barriers to market access, existed as early as 2003, according
to the statement from the prosecutors. Mail-handling services
include preparation of mail for large companies and depositing
that mail to the five big sorting centers in Belgium which are
owned and operated by De Post.  Piet Van Speybroeck, a spokesman for De Post, said by
telephone from Brussels that he couldn’t immediately comment on
the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
