Bally Technologies Inc. (BYI) , the second-
largest U.S. maker of  slot machines , lowered its fiscal 2011
earnings forecast and announced a tender offer to buy back $400
million in stock.  The company, based in  Las Vegas , cut its fiscal 2011
forecast to $1.82 to $1.95 a share, from its prior guidance of
$2 to $2.15, citing installation delays and lower than expected
systems revenue. U.S. casinos are spending more carefully as
they emerge from record declines in gambling during the
recession and financial crisis.  Bally’s board approved a new $550 million share repurchase
program, including a $400 million modified Dutch auction for
stock priced between $34.50 and $40 a share, the company said
today in separate statements. Bally said it had arranged $700
million in new loans, including a $400 million five-year
revolving credit facility.  The timing of large system installations is “becoming more
challenging to predict,” Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Haddrill said today in a statement.  Bally competes with  International Game Technology (IGT) , the
largest U.S. slot machine maker, WMS Industries Inc. and
Australia’s Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., to develop and sell
gambling machines and software.  Bally’s shares fell 51 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.68 at
4 p.m. in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are
down 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
