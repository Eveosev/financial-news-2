The  Federal Reserve  is wrong to
focus on low measures of consumer-price inflation because such
indexes are distorted by the method used to calculate rents,
said  Allan Meltzer , a historian of the central bank.  “Inflation is a problem in the U.S.” Meltzer, a professor
at  Carnegie Mellon University  in Pittsburgh, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.”  “The reason the Fed gets away with saying we don’t have
much inflation and the core is really low is because” the
indexes look at “what people would have to pay in rent if they
rented their house,” Meltzer said, referring to a component of
the index known as owners’ equivalent rent. “But that’s not a
price, like the price they pay at the gas pump, the grocery
store, at the health clinic.”  Meltzer said the Fed lacks a strategy to reduce its balance
sheet, which rose to $2.63 trillion last week as it pumped money
into the financial system to boost the economy.  “The Fed doesn’t have a program, that’s the problem,”
Meltzer said. “When it talks about how it’s going to handle the
inflation it mumbles something about selling six-month CDs to
money-market funds and it experiments with that,  but that’s not
going to do the job and they should know it’s not going to do
the job.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
