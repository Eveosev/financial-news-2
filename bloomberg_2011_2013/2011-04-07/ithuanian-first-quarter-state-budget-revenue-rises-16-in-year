Lithuania’s state budget revenue
rose 16 percent in the first quarter from the same period last
year because of improved tax collection.  Revenue rose to 3.95 billion litai ($1.63 billion), the
Vilnius-based  Finance Ministry  said in a statement on its
website today. The result was below the government’s target of
4.31 billion litai for the first quarter because of delays in
the sale of carbon credits, which were expected to add 86.8
million litai to the budget, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
