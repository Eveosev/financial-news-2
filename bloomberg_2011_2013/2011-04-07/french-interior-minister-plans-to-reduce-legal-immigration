The French government will increase
expulsion of undocumented aliens and plans to reduce the number
of legal immigrants it admits each year, Interior Minister
Claude Gueant said.  In an interview with  Figaro  Magazine to appear April 10,
Gueant said he plans to reduce the 20,000 work visas handed out
each year and to cut the number of people allowed each year to
join family members, now at 15,000.  “We must listen more to the French people and bring
precise answers and results to what they expect from us,” he
was cited as saying in the magazine.  The government of President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has so far
focused on expelling people without residency papers and has not
touched the number of visas granted.  Gueant said he’s fixed a target of 28,000 expulsions this
year “and frankly, I hope we do more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
