The  Los Angeles Dodgers  hired former
Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton to evaluate security
procedures after a San Francisco Giants fan was beaten during
the season-opening Major League Baseball game between the teams.  Bryan Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from  Santa Cruz ,
California, has been in a coma at Los Angeles County-USC Medical
Center since he was attacked March 31 in a Dodgers car park
after the home team’s 2-1 win over the Giants. Stow was wearing
Giants’ gear, while the two assailants were wearing Dodgers
clothing.  Bratton, who also was chief of the New York City police
department, is now chairman of Kroll Inc., a New York-based
company that focuses on intelligence and security issues.  “Bratton is widely credited with spearheading modern
community policing in America,” said Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  in a statement. “There is no one better to lead a top-
to-bottom review of our current practices and make
recommendations to be implemented now and into the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
