Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA (IBLA) 
pilots may strike over the Easter holiday or in May,  Cinco Dias 
reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
information.  Sepla, the pilots’ union, started an administrative process
to allow members to hold a legal strike after failing to reach
agreements on rest periods for pilots who will work for the
company’s new low-cost unit, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
