Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister,
 Saad Hariri , denounced what he said was Iranian inference in the
affairs of Arab countries.  “This Iranian policy is not acceptable anymore,” Hariri
said in a speech at a conference in  Beirut  today. “The gradual
abduction of the Arab societies under any slogan will not be in
the interest of Iran or Arab-Iranian relations.”  Bahrain and other members of Gulf Cooperation Council have
criticized Iran, the main Shiite power in the region, for
meddling in Bahrain, where the Shiite Muslim majority population
has been protesting against the Sunni Muslim ruling Al Khalifa
family.  Lebanon does not want to be an Iranian “protectorate” and
defends the right of Bahrain, Kuwait and other Arab countries to
be free of Iranian control, Hariri said.  The coalition government of Sunni Lebanese Hariri collapsed
after the Shiite Hezbollah movement and its allies withdrew.
Hezbollah is backed by  Iran  and Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
