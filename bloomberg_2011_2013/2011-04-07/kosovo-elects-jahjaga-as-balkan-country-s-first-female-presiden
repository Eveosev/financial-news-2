Kosovo elected Atifete Jahjaga as
its first female president of the Balkan nation as it seeks to
improve relations with its former federation partner  Serbia .  Lawmakers in the capital Pristina voted 80-10 to appoint
Jahjaga, 35, a former deputy chief of the Kosovo police,
according to public broadcaster  Radiotelevizioni i Kosoves . She
will serve a one-year term, after which the country’s 2 million
residents will pick a new leader in a popular vote.  The country’s top court ruled last month that the
Parliament’s decision to choose businessman Behgjet Pacolli was
illegal. The administration of Hashim Thaci, renominated Prime
Minister in February must amend ties with Serbia, revive the
economy, root out corruption and eventually win a visa-free
travel regime to the European Union.  “We have a shared past” with Serbia, and “we are forced
to share the future,” with it, she said after being elected.
“The dialog will be successful and after it the region will
return to the peace. Kosovo and Serbia will have an open path
towards the EU and the citizens of the two countries will return
to a normal life.”  Serbia, which aims to win EU-candidate status this year,
refuses to recognize its former province and is joined by five
of the 27-bloc members in doing so. The U.S. and 22 other EU
nations treat Kosovo as an independent country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
