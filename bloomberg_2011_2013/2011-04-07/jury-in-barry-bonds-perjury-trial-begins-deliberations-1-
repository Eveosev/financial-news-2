The jury in baseball player  Barry Bonds ’s perjury trial began deliberations over his guilt or
innocence on three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count
of obstruction of justice.  Shortly after the panel of eight women and four men left
the courtroom, the jurors informed U.S. District Judge  Susan Illston  that they would leave for the day and resume
deliberations tomorrow. The jurors listened to more than four
and half hours of closing arguments by prosecutors and Bonds’s
attorneys today, and seven days of testimony by government
witnesses.  Bonds’s lawyers didn’t call any witnesses.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
