The  Oyu Tolgoi  copper and gold
project operated by Rio Tinto Group and Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.,
together with the Mongolian government, is likely to start
operations earlier than expected, an executive said.  The project, one of the largest untapped sources of copper
and gold globally, according to Ivanhoe, will be on line from
August 2012, Temuulen Ganzorig, deputy director of  Erdenes MGL
LLC , Mongolia’s state-controlled mining company, said in
 Singapore  today. Oyu Tolgoi was due to start before the end of
2012.  “The timetable is a bit earlier than expected due to
expedited construction,” Ganzorig said at the Asian Mining
Congress. Erdenes, which represents the nation’s 34 percent
interest in Oyu Tolgoi, is in talks with Rio and Ivanhoe on
 project financing , he said.  Ivanhoe Mines Chief Executive Officer Robert Friedland said
last month that “large elements” of Oyu Tolgoi are ahead of
schedule, though it did not mean the whole development would be.
The budget for the project is close to $2.5 billion this year
and the workers at the site will rise to 18,000 by June,
Friedland told a Hong Kong conference.  Oyu Tolgoi holds estimated resources of 37 million metric
tons of copper and 1,300 tons of gold, allowing the mine to
operate for almost 60 years, Rio said in December. Mongolian
President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj said in 2009 that the project
may operate for 30 years and generate $30 billion to $50 billion
of revenue.  Oyu Tolgoi, which means “turquoise hill” in Mongolian,
lies about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Chinese border.
The mine will produce an average 1.2 billion pounds of copper
and 650,000 ounces of gold a year for the first decade,
according to Ivanhoe.  --Xiao Yu in Singaore and Yuriy Humber in  Tokyo . Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
