U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains amid speculation European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet will continue to raise  interest rates  to ward off
accelerating inflation.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
slipped less than 0.1 percent to 1,328.8 at 9:08 a.m. in  New
York  after climbing as much as 0.3 percent earlier. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures increased 1 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,358 after rising 28 points earlier.  Trichet said the bank will continue to monitor
inflation risks “very closely” after raising interest rates
today for the first time in almost three years. He said policy
makers hadn't decided if this was the first in a series of
increases.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
