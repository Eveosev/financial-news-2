Russia ’s raw-sugar imports rose 15
percent from October through March from a year earlier,
according to the Moscow-based  Institute for Agricultural Market
Studies , after the country’s worst drought in a half century
damaged domestic crops.  “We see growth of imports to 805,000 metric tons from
703,000 tons in these periods, because of a harsh decline in the
domestic sugar-beet harvest,” Yevgeny Ivanov, an analyst at the
institute, also known as Ikar, said today by phone.  In the first quarter,  Brazil  was the biggest source of
shipments to Russia, supplying more than 470,000 tons of the
sweetener, he said. Deliveries from Guatemala and  Nicaragua  were
26,000 tons and 30,000 tons respectively.  Russia’s sugar-beet output dropped to 2.7 million tons in
2010 from 3.3 million tons a year earlier, according to Russia’s
Federal Statistics Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
