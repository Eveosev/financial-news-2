Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA) , a producer of
the fuel in South  Africa , faces a challenge from environmental
groups for a water license granted to its Vele project, said
Hayley Komen, a spokeswoman for the Endangered Wildlife Trust.  Seven groups, including the Association of Southern African
Archaeologists and the Wilderness Foundation, are objecting to
the license, Komen said today in an e-mailed statement from
Johannesburg. They will appeal to the water affairs ministry to
change its decision and take its argument to the country’s  High
Court , if necessary, she said.  The Perth, Australia-based company “has grossly
underestimated the quantity of water it will use at the proposed
Vele colliery” and the mine will affect the flow of water in
the Limpopo river, Komen said.  South Africa ’s government granted Vele the license on April
4, taking it closer to resuming output after production was
halted in August. The mine is about 17 miles from the Mapungubwe
Hill ruins, a United Nations World Heritage site and once
southern Africa’s biggest settlement.  The company isn’t in breach of any laws and followed “all
legal processes required,” Coal of Africa said in an e-mailed
statement. Criticism of the company’s environmental record is
“sensationalist” and “emphatically denied,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
