Japanese stocks pared gains after
the Bank of Japan said it would keep a credit program and asset-
purchase fund unchanged following the nation’s worst earthquake.  Fast Retailing Co.,  Asia ’s biggest clothing chain, fell 0.1
percent, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.9 percent.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest listed
lender, advanced 2.4 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No.
1 carmaker, gained 0.9 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.,
operator of the nuclear-power plant damaged by the March 11
temblor and tsunami, increased 0.9 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose less than 0.1 percent to
9,590.93 as of the close of trading in Tokyo, after earlier
advancing as much as 1.1 percent. The gauge has fallen 8.1
percent from the close on March 10, the day before Japan was hit
by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami. The broader Topix index
advanced 0.2 percent to 841.10 today, with about two shares
falling for each that gained on the 1,666-member gauge.  “It’s possible that some investors, who expected an
increase in the framework of the asset-purchase program, or
additions to quantitative easing, are selling stocks after
seeing the  Bank of Japan ’s policies maintained the status quo,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion as
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent today. The index rose 0.2 percent yesterday as Cisco
Systems Inc. spurred a technology rally and European lenders’
plans to raise capital lifted financial shares.  Fast Retailing, which is also due to release first-half
earnings today, lost 0.1 percent to 11,130 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ
advanced 2.4 percent to 381 yen, the biggest support to the
Topix index’s gains.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-
largest bank by market value, rose 1.6 percent to 131 yen,
paring earlier increases of as much as 3.9 percent.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the No. 2, rose 0.2 percent to
2,500 yen. It earlier jumped as much as 2.3 percent.  While the Bank of Japan said it will offer 1 trillion yen
($12 billion) in one-year loans to alleviate cash shortages in
the wake of the nation’s record earthquake, officials kept a
separate credit program unchanged at 30 trillion yen and an
asset-purchase fund at 10 trillion yen. The bank held the
benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent today.  Automakers Advance  The Topix Transportation Equipment Index, which tracks
automakers, was the second-biggest contributor to the Topix
index’s gains today among the measure’s 33 industry groups,
behind the gauge for  utility companies .  Toyota gained 0.9 percent to 3,295 yen, the third-biggest
support to the Topix index. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-
largest carmaker by market value, rose 1.1 percent to 2,927 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., which counts  North America  as its biggest
market for sales, climbed 1.1 percent to 720 yen.  Speculation the BOJ will loosen policy this month following
its injection of record emergency funds into the financial
system since March 11 helped the yen to tumble against all of
its most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg yesterday.  The yen weakened to as low as 85.50 per dollar today,
compared with 85.27 at the Tokyo stock-trading close yesterday
and 82.89 at the close of  currency trading  on March 30. It pared
declines to 85.20 at the close of Japan’s stock trading.  Tepco Advances  Against the euro, the yen traded as low as 122.55 today,
from 121.66 yesterday. A weaker yen versus the dollar and euro
boosts the value of U.S. and European income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  The Topix Electric Power & Gas Index rose 3.2 percent today,
the biggest gain among the 33 industry groups on the Topix index
and its first advance in 12 days.  Tokyo Electric Power, also known as Tepco, added 0.9
percent to 340 yen, its first increase in 12 days. Workers at
 Japan ’s damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant are pumping
nitrogen into a reactor to prevent a possible explosion.  Tepco is trying to prevent another hydrogen explosion at
the plant after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami triggered
three blasts, damaging reactor buildings and releasing radiation
into the air.  To contact the reporters on this story:
