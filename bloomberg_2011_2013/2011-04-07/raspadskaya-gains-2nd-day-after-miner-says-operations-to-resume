OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  climbed for a second
day after the Russian coal producer said operations at its
Koksovaya mine will resume once the circumstances of an April 4
accident are established.  The stock added 2.1 percent to 197.04 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest close in more than a week.  Investigators finished an inspection at the accident site
yesterday and electricity has been reconnected, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  The mine will resume operations at an unspecified date, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
