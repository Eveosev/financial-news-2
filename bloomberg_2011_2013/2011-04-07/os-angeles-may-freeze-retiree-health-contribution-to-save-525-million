Los Angeles  City Administrative
Officer Miguel Santana proposed freezing the city’s contribution
to its retiree health-care plans for some union workers to save
$525 million over five years.  The proposal, which would cap the city’s payments at a
maximum of $1,190 a month per worker, will be considered by the
City Council on April 12, Santana said in a telephone interview
today. Any difference between the cap and actual health-care
payments would be paid by the retirees.  Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa reached a deal with employee
unions March 24 that would save the cash-strapped city $400
million over four years by asking some workers for the first
time to contribute 4 percent of their salary toward health-care
costs in retirement.  That agreement, which still must be ratified by the unions,
would apply to about 14,500 full-time employees, Santana said.
The current proposal would cover the rest of the city’s 32,000
employees, including police officers and firefighters.  The nation’s second-largest city by population faces a $350
million  budget deficit  for the fiscal year that begins July 1.  To contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Palmeri in
