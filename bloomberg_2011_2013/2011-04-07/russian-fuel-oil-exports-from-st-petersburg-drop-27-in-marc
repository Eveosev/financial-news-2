Russian  fuel oil  exports in March
from the  St. Petersburg  oil terminal fell 27 percent from a year
earlier, a port official said.  Shipments dropped to 432,000 metric tons last month from
589,000 tons in March 2010, the official said today by phone
from St. Petersburg, declining to be identified because the
information is confidential. Fuel oil is used to power ships and
generate electricity.  Diesel exports from the port last month rose 7 percent from
February to 237,000 tons, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
