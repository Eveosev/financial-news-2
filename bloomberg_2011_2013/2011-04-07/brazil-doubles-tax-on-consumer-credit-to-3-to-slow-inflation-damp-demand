Brazil doubled a tax on  consumer
credit  in a bid to slow inflation and contain consumer demand,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  Starting tomorrow, the so-called IOF tax levied on consumer
credit will increase to 3 percent a year from 1.5 percent,
Mantega told reporters in  Sao Paulo .  Inflation is running faster than government wishes and
policy makers can take additional steps to slow inflation,
Mantega said. The tax can be repealed when credit growth slows
to an “adequate” level of 12 percent to 15 percent a year,
Mantega said.  In the minutes of its March 1-2 policy meeting, published
March 10, the central bank said that so-called macro-prudential
measures to curb bank lending are a “rapid and potent” weapon.  Credit growth in  Brazil ’s economy picked up in February.
Total outstanding credit rose 1.3 percent in February from
January to 1.74 trillion reais ($1.05 trillion), up from a 0.6
percent increase the previous month, even as lending rates rose.
Credit rose 21 percent from a year ago.  The central bank forecasts credit growth of 13 percent in
2011, Tulio Maciel, acting head of the bank’s economic research
department, said March 29. The average rate charged on consumer
loans was unchanged at 43.8 percent in February.  Traders are betting policy makers will raise borrowing
costs this month by 25 basis points to 12 percent, according to
Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  Brazil’s annual inflation accelerated to 6.30 percent in
March, close to the upper limit of the government’s target range
of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
