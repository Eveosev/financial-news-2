The  New Orleans  Hornets defeated the
Houston Rockets 101-93 and the Indiana Pacers beat the
 Washington Wizards  136-112 to clinch National Basketball
Association playoff spots.  The Oklahoma City Thunder (52-26) sealed the Northwest
Division title last night with their 112-108 victory over the
Los Angeles Clippers.  At Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Danny Granger scored
25 points to lead the Pacers (36-43) to their first postseason

(45-33), who made the playoffs for the third time in four
seasons. Trevor Ariza and Jarrett Jack each scored 19 points.  In Oklahoma City,  Kevin Durant  scored 29 points and Russell Westbrook added 26 for the Thunder. It’s the first time the
franchise has won the division since 2005, when it was based in
Seattle. Blake Griffin had 35 points and 11 rebounds for the
Clippers.  One playoff berth remains to be settled in the Western
Conference. The Memphis Grizzlies (44-34) are eighth, 3 1/2
