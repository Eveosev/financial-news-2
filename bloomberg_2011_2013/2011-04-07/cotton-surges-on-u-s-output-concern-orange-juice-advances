Cotton futures rose to a four-week
high on mounting concern that the government will lower its
estimate of the U.S. harvest, signaling tighter global supply.
 Orange juice  also gained.  Farmers probably collected 18.16 million bales in the year
that ends on July 31, less than the 18.32 million estimated by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture on March 10, according to a
survey by Bloomberg News. The USDA will update its forecast
tomorrow. Cotton prices have more than doubled in the past year,
touching a record in March, as demand increased in  China  and
output dropped in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  “Expectations of lower U.S. output coupled with fear of
dry weather across the Texas region is pushing prices higher,”
said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville,
Louisiana.  Cotton for May delivery rose 0.16 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
settle at $2.0822 a pound at 3:05 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Earlier, the contract gained by the 7-cent exchange
limit to $2.1506, the highest since March 8. The fiber reached a
record $2.197 on March 7.  Texas is the biggest cotton producing state in U.S.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery gained 1.15 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.652 a pound on ICE, rising for the fifth time
in six sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
