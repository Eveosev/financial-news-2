The  Central Bank  of Kenya plans to
appoint primary dealers to market Treasury bonds, Business Daily
reported, citing Governor Njuguna Ndungâ€™u.  The direct sale of  government securities  by the central
bank will be limited to major banks and cash-rich institutional
investors, who will then help create a secondary market in the
instruments, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  The roll out of a so-called market-makers window is
expected to be announced by the end of the first half, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
