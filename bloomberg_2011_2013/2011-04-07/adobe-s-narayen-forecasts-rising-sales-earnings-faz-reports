Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) ’s sales and
earnings will rise in the next few quarters as the company adds
clients and products and shortens the development cycle of new
software, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported today,
citing Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen.  The company, which plans to stay independent, is “clearly
on a growth path,” Narayen told the newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
