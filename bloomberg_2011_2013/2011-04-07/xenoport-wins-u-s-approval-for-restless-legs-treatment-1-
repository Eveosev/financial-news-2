XenoPort Inc. (XNPT)  had its biggest gain
in Nasdaq trading after U.S. regulators approved its first
product following more than a year of delays.  The Santa Clara, California-based company rose $3.58, or 56
percent, to $9.96 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
composite trading, the largest percentage increase since the
shares were listed in June 2005.  XenoPort and partner  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said late
yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration cleared their
Horizant medicine as a treatment for moderate-to-severe restless
legs syndrome. The FDA asked in February 2010 for more
information about tumors in rats that were seen in early drug
studies. The delay led XenoPort to fire half its employees.  “We think it’s a great example of a company able to work
with the FDA to clear up misconceptions, suggesting the agency
indeed can still work rationally with biotech companies,” said
 Michael Yee , an analyst with  RBC Capital Markets  in  San
Francisco , in an e-mail.  Horizant may bring in at least $100 million a year in U.S.
sales, Yee said. The drug was developed by XenoPort and licensed
to London-based Glaxo. It will compete with Glaxo’s Requip and
closely held Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s Mirapex.  Millions of Patients  People with restless legs syndrome have uncontrollable
urges to move their legs to relieve uncomfortable sensations,
according to the  National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke . The condition affects 2 percent to 3 percent of the
U.S. population, according to  XenoPort .  In  two studies  of more than 400 patients, about 75 percent
of those taking Horizant for 12 weeks said their symptoms were
much or very much improved, compared with about 45 percent of
those taking placebos.  “This significant milestone represents the culmination of
XenoPort’s efforts,” said Ronald W. Barrett, XenoPort’s chief
executive officer. “XenoPort is honored to have contributed to
the efforts to find new treatments for restless legs syndrome.”  Horizant is a modified-release form of Neurontin, a  Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)  drug for epilepsy that is now sold as a generic.  Astellas
Pharma Inc. (4503) , of Tokyo, has licensed rights to the product in
Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
