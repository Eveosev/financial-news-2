Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) , which gets 15
percent of its sales from Japan, led chip-equipment stocks lower
after a 7.1-magnitude aftershock hit that country, less than a
month after a 9-magnitude earthquake left thousands dead and
disrupted business.  Lam, based in Fremont, California, fell $2.80, or 5
percent, to $53.52 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading.  KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) , in nearby Milpitas, dropped
$2.11, or 4.6 percent, to $44.06. That company gets 13 percent
of its revenue from Japan.  The aftershock struck at 11:32 p.m. Tokyo time, about 215
miles (345 kilometers) northeast of the Japanese capital. A
tsunami alert was issued and later canceled. The March 11
temblor and tsunami left more than 27,000 people dead or
missing, crippled nuclear power plants and caused an estimated
25 trillion yen ($295 billion) in damage.  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT)  in Santa Clara, California, lost 25
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $15.50.  Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS)  in
nearby  San Jose , fell $1.30, or 3.6 percent, to $35.15. Japan
accounted for 8 percent of total revenue at Applied. Novellus
gets about 4 percent of sales from Japan, according to Patrick Ho, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Dallas.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the
performance of 30 industry stocks, fell 0.5 percent to 443.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
