Kenya ’s government is discussing a
plan to increase the  minimum wage  by 10 percent, Business Daily
reported, citing Labour Minister John Munyes.  The least-paid workers in Kenya earn 8,364 shillings ($99)
to 10,606 shillings per month, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.
The Central Organization of Trade Unions, the main umbrella body
for the country’s labor unions, is seeking a 60 percent increase
in wages, it said.  Kenyan inflation surged to 9.2 percent in February from 6.5
percent a month before, as food prices jumped, the Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics said on March 30. The data was
released a week after the central bank raised its key lending
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent and warned
that food and fuel costs may push inflation higher still.  To contact the reporter on this story:
