Adriatic Solarni Projekti , a group
of 10 Croatian companies, is seeking investors for three solar
power projects in  Croatia  with a combined capacity of 16.8
megawatts and an estimated value of 60 million euros ($85.7
million).  A 20-million-euro facility in Bukovica, in southern
Croatia, would include six solar  power plants , the group’s
director, Sinisa Bijelic, said today in a phone interview. 
Adriatic Solarni is also preparing to build eight power plants
in Bravar, in southern Croatia, for 25 million euros, and five
power plants in Erdut, in eastern Croatia, for 15 million euros.  Taken together, the projects represent the biggest solar
power proposal in Croatia, according to Bijelic. Existing solar
installations, apart from individual rooftop systems, generate
about 60 kilowatts in that country, he said.  “We have secured land that we can lease with right-to-build,
we have the support of local authorities, and there’s a
possibility of connecting to the main electric distribution
system,” Bijelic said. “At the moment we are trying to obtain
the necessary permits.”  Bijelic also said the company is lobbying to change
government regulations currently limiting to 1 megawatt the
capacity of solar power plants eligible for so-called feed-in
tariffs, which provide incentives for the sale of electricity
generated from renewable sources.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
