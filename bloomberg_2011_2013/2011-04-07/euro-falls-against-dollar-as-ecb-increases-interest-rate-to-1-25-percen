The euro fell versus the dollar as
 Portugal ’s request for aid overshadowed the European Central
Bank’s first interest-rate increase for almost three years.  The euro declined versus 14 of its major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg as the Frankfurt-based ECB increased its
main rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent, as predicted by
all 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
decision.  “We definitely see further upside potential in the euro
exchange rate,” said Chris Scicluna, deputy head of economic
research at Daiwa Capital Markets  Europe  in London. “Our
central forecast is for one rate hike per quarter from the ECB
this year.”  The shared currency fell 0.4 percent to $1.4281 as of 1:02
p.m. in  London . Daiwa Capital expects the euro to end the year
at $1.50 while the ECB’s main rate will be 1.75 percent,
Scicluna said.  The euro has appreciated 6.7 percent against the dollar
this year as economic growth in  Germany  and accelerating
inflation boosted expectations of a rate rise to curb consumer
prices, which reached a two-year high of 2.6 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
