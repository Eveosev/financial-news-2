(Corrects second paragraph to say ethanol mix in gasoline.)  Brazil  may tax sugar exports by
between 4 percent and 5 percent in a bid to spur more ethanol
production and lower prices, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  The government is also considering reducing the ethanol mix
in gasoline to below 25 percent and creating a national
development bank credit line to help sugar cane growers renew
planting and boost output, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said
today.  Other measures being considered include having ethanol
regulated by the national petroleum agency, which would oblige
mills to guarantee supply, Estado said, citing Gilson
Bittencourt, the Agriculture Ministryâ€™s deputy economic policy
secretary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
