Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the
most in more than a week against the dollar as oil importers
speculated crude prices will climb further and bought the U.S.
currency to make purchases before the increase.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.3 percent to 84.83 per dollar, the lowest since March
30, and was trading less than 0.1 percent up at 84.54 at 12:40
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “The shilling is weakening as oil importers seek more
greenback on the anticipation of global crude surge in the
coming days,” Steve Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CfC
Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in an phone interview today.  Brent crude oil traded at $121.96 a barrel, within $1.41
cents of 31-month high reached yesterday. The price has rallied
on concern that conflict in  Africa  and the Middle East may
curtail supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
