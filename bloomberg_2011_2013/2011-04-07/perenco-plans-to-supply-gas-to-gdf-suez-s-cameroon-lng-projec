Perenco SA , a French oil company
operating in Africa and Latin America, plans to supply gas to
a  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA-led liquefied natural-gas project in Cameroon.  The closely held company is in talks with the officials in
Cameroon and GDF Suez about the price of the fuel, said Didier
Lechartier, deputy head of business development at Perenco. It
will need to drill wells to prove about 2 trillion cubic feet
of gas reserves and plans to complete the acquisition of  Total
SA (FP)  assets in the African nation this month, he said.  “We are going to be the first player to produce and sell
gas in Cameroon,” Lechartier said yesterday in an interview in
Paris. Perenco will develop an exploration program if it has “a
clear positive signal as to what the gas price is going to be.”  GDF Suez and Cameroon state-owned Societe Nationale des
Hydrocarbures are in talks with explorers including  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and  Noble Energy
Inc. (NBL)  to secure gas supplies for LNG production, said Kevin Hart,
the chief executive officer at  BowLeven Plc. (BLVN)  Hart said BowLeven
may supply gas to the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
