A 24-hour strike by French energy
workers over a possible threat to subsidized bills cut power
nationwide by 18,000 megawatts, a union representative at
Electricite de France SA said.  About 9,000 megawatts of the cuts were from 12 of EDF’s
nuclear plants, said Laurent Langlard, a member of the CGT
union. EDF’s press office didn’t comment on the strike when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  Workers are protesting against a move by management to
scale back the size of the discount they receive on electricity
and natural gas rates, Langland said. EDF, which is 85 percent
owned by the government, operates the country’s 58 reactors.  EDF wants workers to pay taxes on their power bills rather
than the current arrangement where they are treated as a perk on
income tax forms, he said.  The power and gas discounts date to before World War II and
employees are “attached” to them, Langland said. Ending the
discounts will help EDF meet future balance sheet provisions of
as much as 2.3 billion euros ($3.3 billion), he said.  Industry Minister Eric Besson told RMC Radio today that the
discounted bills for EDF’s current and former employees “weigh
heavily on its costs.”  It’s not “abnormal” to suggest they should face higher
bills, alongside the rest of the country, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
