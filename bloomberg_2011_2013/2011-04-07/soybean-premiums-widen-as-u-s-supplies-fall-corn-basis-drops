Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
in April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers withheld supplies left from last year’s
crops. Corn basis narrowed as spot demand slowed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 60 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 47 cents to 60 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis for delivery in the first
half of April fell to 55 cents to 57 cents a bushel from 55
cents to 59 cents. Premiums rose for delivery in May and June.  “Farmers are done selling last year’s crop because they
focus on getting ready to plant,” said Troy Lust, a commercial
grain analyst for INTL FCStone Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“The export program for corn is not expected to pick up until
early May.”  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 13 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $13.635 a bushel on the CBOT, the fourth decline in
five sessions. Corn futures for May delivery fell 4 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $7.59 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
