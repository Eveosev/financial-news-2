Ivory Coast’s  defaulted Eurobonds
jumped to their highest level in more than four months on
speculation a government headed by  Alassane Ouattara  will resume
payments to investors.  The $2.3 billion bonds due 2032 of the world’s biggest
cocoa producer rose 5.8 percent to 54.667 cents on the dollar,
the highest price since Dec. 2, as of 9:12 a.m. in London,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Ivory Coast  failed to make a $29 million interest payment
due at the end of January as Ouattara, internationally
recognized as victor of Nov. 28 presidential elections, was
locked in a political standoff with incumbent  Laurent Gbagbo ,
who refused to step down. Gbagbo may leave the west African
nation, the incumbent said in an interview broadcast yesterday
on LCI, a Paris-based TV news channel.  “I anticipate some agreement soon after the Ouattara
government enters office to bring the service payments back on
line,” Timothy Ash, the London-based head of emerging-market
research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, in an e-mailed
reply to questions today. “The coupon payments are relatively
light.”  Troops loyal to Ouattara, 69, a former deputy managing
director at the  International Monetary Fund , are surrounding the
residence of Gbagbo, 65, who is holed up in a bunker at the
house in the Abidjan, the commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
