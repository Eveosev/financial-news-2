Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi division
outsold  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz brand in the first quarter on
growing demand in China, underscoring the carmaker’s quest to
become the world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles .  Audi’s sales jumped 18 percent to 312,600 vehicles, the
Ingolstadt, Germany-based company said today. Deliveries at the
Mercedes-Benz brand gained 13 percent to 280,552.  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s registrations in the period were
“significantly up,” sales chief  Ian Robertson  said today.  Audi, which has been gaining on market leaders Mercedes and
BMW, targets an increase in 2011 sales of more than 10 percent
on demand for the revamped A6 sedan and new Q3 compact sport-
utility vehicle. The VW unit aims to dethrone BMW, which will
publish first-quarter figures tomorrow, as the top luxury-car
maker by 2015.  “Audi is very well positioned across the relevant model
range,” said Aleksej Wunrau, a Frankfurt-based analyst at BHF-
Bank AG with an “overweight” rating on VW stock. “The latest
model releases suggest that momentum behind Audi sales may grow
even stronger in the second half of the year.”  Audi sold 1.09 million autos last year, a 15 percent
increase. The Mercedes-Benz brand in 2010 gained 12 percent to
1.17 million vehicles. The BMW brand rose 15 percent to 1.22
million cars and SUVs.  Record Results  Audi’s record first quarter was fuelled by a 25 percent
increase to 64,122 vehicles in  China , where the VW unit is the
leading luxury manufacturer. U.S. deliveries gained 19 percent
to 25,383 autos.  “With the new generation of the A6 we see even greater
potential, especially in China and the U.S.,” sales chief  Peter Schwarzenbauer  said in an e-mailed statement. Audi aims to
increase sales of the A6 by “around 25 percent” over the car’s
lifespan, he said.  Mercedes-Benz’s China deliveries surged 78 percent in the
first quarter to 42,990 cars and SUVs. Sales in the U.S., the
company’s second biggest market, rose 8.4 percent to 53,346.  Audi plans to continue expanding its 37-model lineup at
“an undiminished pace” in the coming years, the carmaker said
in its 2010 annual report. Besides the new Q3 SUV and overhauled
A6, Audi’s second-best selling model, new releases in 2011 also
include the RS3 Sportback and a hybrid Q5 SUV.  “There’s no doubt that Audi already fulfills the
requirements to become the market leader from a model
perspective,” Wunrau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
