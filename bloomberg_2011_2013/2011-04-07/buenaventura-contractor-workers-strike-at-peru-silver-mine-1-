Compañia de Minas Buenaventura SAA,
 Peru ’s biggest precious-metals miner, said contract workers went
on strike at the Uchucchacua silver mine in Peru, its second
labor stoppage in the past 12 months.  The strike, which began April 4, has halted mine
operations, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Galvez said today in
a telephone interview. The walkout, declared illegal by the
Labor Ministry, is by 1,300 workers who want the company to
allocate public works funds to the local community, he said.  “This is a political dispute between the community and the
Town Hall of Oyon and not labor-related,” Galvez said. “This
strike will probably be over in a few days.”  Workers in Peru, Chile and  Bolivia  held work stoppages at
copper, gold and zinc mines in the past six months to seek
better working conditions and a bigger slice of record company
earnings. A 13-day strike at zinc miner Cia. Minera de San
Ignacio de Morococha SA ended Feb. 17.  Uchuchaccua’s silver output fell 12 percent last year to
9.3 million ounces, Buenaventura has said.  Buenaventura fell 2.9 percent, or $1.29, to $42.80 at 12:15
