The  World Bank  is urging  Uganda  to
broaden its tax base to reduce its reliance on donors, Kundhavi
Kadiresan, the lender’s country manager said.  The bank wants the East African nation to raise tax as a
percentage of gross domestic product to the levels of
neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, she told reporters in the
capital, Kampala, today. Uganda has a ratio of 13 percent, while
Tanzania and Kenya have 18 percent and 25 percent respectively.  Increased tax collection will enable Uganda to lower its
dependence on donor aid, which currently accounts for 24 percent
of the budget, and to raise additional funds for infrastructure
as the country prepares to start producing oil next year,
Kadiresan said.  “We are really looking at options to expand the tax
base,” Kadiresan said. “The informal sector should be brought
in the tax base.”  The  World Bank  also wants Uganda to adhere to  budgetary
discipline  by promoting transparency and cutting administrative
costs, she said.  Uganda, which has a population of more than 30 million,
will become  Africa ’s next oil producer in 2012 when U.K.-based
Tullow Plc and its partners Total SA and China National Offshore
Oil Corp. start pumping crude oil and gas from the Lake Albert
basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
