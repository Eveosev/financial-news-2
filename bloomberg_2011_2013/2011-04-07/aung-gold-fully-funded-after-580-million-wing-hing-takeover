Taung Gold Ltd. , studying two gold
projects in  South Africa , said it will have enough funds for the
next two years after agreeing to a $580 million takeover by Hong
Kong investment company  Wing Hing International Holdings Ltd. (621)   Taung will be “fully funded,” Chief Executive Officer
Neil Herrick said today by telephone from Johannesburg, where
the company is based. Taung won’t make an  investment decision  on
its two prospective South African mines for another two years,
he said, adding that each would cost about $1 billion.  Wing Hing, with holdings in Chinese gold and coal projects,
will swap 84 percent of its shares for 87 percent of Taung to
expand  gold reserves  in anticipation of rising prices, Wing Hing
said April 4. Gold has gained for the past 10 years and touched
a record $1,462.35 an ounce in  London  today.  While it’s too early to detail funding for Taung’s two gold
projects, “getting access to the Hong Kong market is a big plus
for us,” Herrick said. The mines, named Evander and Jeanette,
contain a combined 12 million ounces of indicated gold resources
and may have annual output of 267,000 ounces and 380,000 ounces,
respectively, according to Taung’s preliminary estimates.  Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s third-largest producer of
the precious metal, agreed three years ago to transfer the
“low-priority” Evander and Jeanette assets to African Precious
Minerals Ltd., of which Taung was a unit, for about 700 million
rand ($104 million).  While the deal gave Taung the right to earn equity in
Evander over time, the company agreed late last year to acquire
all of the project from Harmony for 225 million rand, subject to
government approval.  Taung’s largest shareholder is Electrum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
