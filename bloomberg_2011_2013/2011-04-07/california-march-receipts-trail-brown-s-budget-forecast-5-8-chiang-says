California  took in $370 million less
in taxes and other revenue in March than projected, in part
because Governor  Jerry Brown  scuttled the sale of government-
owned office buildings, Controller John Chiang said.  Sales- tax revenue  came in $9.7 million above what Brown
estimated in the budget he proposed in January. Personal-income
levies were $1.2 billion above the forecast. Corporate tax
revenue trailed projections by $387.6 million, Chiang said in a
report. In February, Brown canceled the sale of state-owned
buildings that was supposed to produce $1.2 billion.  “The state’s cash position actually worsened by $370
million in March, despite very strong income-tax collections,”
Chiang said in a  statement . “California’s economic recovery is
clearly under way but is threatened by a budget gridlock that
could halt job-producing public works projects, further erode
the state’s credit ratings and delay billions of dollars in
payments.”  Brown, who turned 73 today, and Republican lawmakers remain
deadlocked over how to erase a remaining $15 billion deficit
through June 2012 after Democrats approved $8 billion of
spending cuts and $3 billion of internal loans. Chiang has
warned that the state will need to again pay bills with
promissory notes by July if the stalemate continues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
