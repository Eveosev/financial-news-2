Mineral production from  Zimbabwe ,
which has the world’s second-biggest platinum and chrome
reserves after  South Africa , doubled last year to $1.38 billion
as the country’s economy recovers from a decade-long recession,
Harare-based  Robertson Economics  said.  The southern African nation boosted output from $672
million in 2009, economist John Robertson said in an e-mailed
statement today, citing figures from the country’s Chamber of
Mines. Platinum production rose 26 percent to 8.6 metric tons in
2010, earning $409 million, while gold generated $380 million
from 9.6 tons, compared with $157 million from 4.9 tons a year
earlier, he said.  President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front and Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s Movement
for Democratic Change formed a coalition government in 2009,
helping to end a political crisis and lift the economy out of
recession. Platinum and gold production will probably reach 12.5
and 13 tons respectively this year, with total mining output
expected to grow 44 percent, the nation’s central bank said on
Jan. 29.  The government wants local Zimbabweans to benefit more from
the increase in output, particularly from mines. Foreign-owned
miners like Zimplats Ltd.,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
were on March 28 given 45 days to show how they will dispose of
51 percent of their Zimbabwe operations.  Zimbabwe produced 154,336 tons of high carbon ferrochrome
worth $135 million in 2010, more than double the 72,223 tons in
2009, Robertson said.  Expanding Smelter  Sinosteel Corp.,  China ’s second-biggest iron-ore trading
company, is Zimbabwe’s largest chrome ore miner through its
Zimasco Ltd. unit. Zimasco said March 3 that it plans to spend
$300 million to expand its Kwekwe-based smelter. Zimbabwe been
mining chrome on Zimbabwe’s Great Dyke mountain range since
about 1918.  Coal production jumped 60 percent to 2.66 million tons last
year, Robertson said. The fuel, mined mainly by the Hwange
Colliery Co. Ltd., generated $97 million. Nickel output rose to
6,133 tons in 2010 from 4,858 tons in the previous year, he
said. Nickel is mined in the northeastern town of Bindura by
Mwana Africa Plc-owned Bindura Nickel Corp. Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
