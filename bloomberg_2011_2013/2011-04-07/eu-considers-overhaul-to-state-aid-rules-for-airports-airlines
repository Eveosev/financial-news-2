The European Commission said it’s
seeking views on possible changes to state-aid rules for
airlines and airports.  The European Union antitrust regulator said it’s reviewing
the way it examines subsidies earmarked for airports and start-
up aid to airlines from regional airports.  Rules on social and restructuring aid for airlines are also
part of the information-gathering exercise, the commission said
in an e-mailed statement from Brussels today. The agency said it
will consider the need for changes and will make a proposal by
2012 if they are required.  To contact the reporter on this story:
