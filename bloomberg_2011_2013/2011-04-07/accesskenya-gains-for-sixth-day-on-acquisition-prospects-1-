AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the nation’s
only publicly traded Internet company, extended its longest
winning streak in three months a day after  Renaissance Capital 
said the operator is “a natural acquisition target.”  The stock rallied for a sixth day, adding 40 cents, or 4.3
percent, to 9.75 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the
longest streak of increases since Jan. 6.  “The mobile-phone companies would target Access for
acquisition because of its investment in infrastructure such as
international fiber-optic links, its metro fiber and high-end
corporate clientele,” Gregory Waweru, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  AccessKenya’s stock has rallied 38 percent in the last six
trading sessions, paring its loss this year to 28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
