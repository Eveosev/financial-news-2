Portuguese bonds dropped and German
10-year government debt yields reached a 20-month high after the
Iberian nation sought a bailout and investors bet the  European
Central Bank  will raise  interest rates  today.  Portuguese yields increased after Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  said he tried “everything” before requesting
financial aid from the European Union. All 57 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg expect the ECB to boost the main
refinancing rate by 25 basis points. Spanish bonds stayed lower
after the nation sold three-year notes.  “If you look where the other markets are trading that are
under bailout already, it was to be expected” that Portuguese
yields would rise, said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European fixed-
income strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “No one
really knows what the end game is.”  Portuguese 10-year yields rose four basis points to 8.58
percent as of 11:20 a.m. in London. They reached 8.80 percent
yesterday, the highest since the euro was introduced in 1999.
The 3.85 percent security due April 2021 fell 0.195, or 1.95
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,429) face amount, to 69.075. Two-year
yields climbed one basis point, to 8.88 percent.  The cost of insuring Portuguese sovereign debt fell 4
basis points to 550, CMA prices for credit-default swaps show.
LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s largest clearing house, said it will
impose an extra 15 percent deposit charge for clients buying
Portuguese government bonds.  Germany ’s 10-year yield rose one basis point to 3.44
percent, after reaching 3.46 percent, the highest since Aug. 13,
2009. Yields on two-year notes were little changed at 1.84
percent.  Industrial Production   German industrial production rose three times as much as
economists forecast in February, adding to signs economic growth
accelerated in the first quarter.  Output increased 1.6 percent from January, when it gained 2
percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists
had forecast a 0.5 percent gain for February, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. In the year, production rose 14.8 percent
when adjusted for working days.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on March 3 that the
key rate may be raised from a record low of 1 percent.  “The market is now positioning in front of the ECB
meeting,” said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. Portugal’s aid
request “means they will not rely any more on short-term
funding, which opens the door for the ECB to raise rates.”  Spanish, French Auctions  Spanish 10-year government bond yields rose one basis point
to 5.25 percent. The spread over bunds was little changed at 181
basis points.  The nation sold 4.13 billion euros ($5.9 billion) of three-
year notes at an average yield of 3.568 percent compared with
3.592 percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt in March,
the Bank of  Spain  said.  Finance Minister Elena Salgado earlier said she
“absolutely rules out” contagion from  Portugal  as “markets
absolutely distinguish between the two countries.”  “The decoupling of Italy and Spain that has developed
since February should receive further momentum on the back of
the Portuguese bailout,”  Michael Leister , a fixed-income
analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, wrote today in an e-mailed
note. “A major layer of uncertainty is now cleared, which
should result in a further reduction in spill-over effects.”  ‘Credible’ Stress Tests  The difference in yield, or spread, between French 10-year
debt and equivalent German securities narrowed to 31 basis
points, the least since Sept. 13, as France sold about 9.45
billion euros ($13.5 billion) of securities maturing in 2020,
2023, 2026 and 2041 today.  The benchmark Greek 10-year yield was little changed at
12.71 percent and Irish bonds gained, pushing the yield 24 basis
points lower to 9.13 percent.  Irish bonds gained for a fifth straight day, pushing the
10-year yield 20 basis points lower to 9.16 percent.  Investors should buy Irish sovereign risk after bank stress
tests last week proved “credible,” moving the focus to the
country’s economy, Morgan Stanley said on April 4.  The nation’s financial regulator, Matthew Elderfield,
yesterday said the government will only seek to share losses
with Anglo Irish Bank Corp.’s senior bondholders if more capital
is needed. He ruled out forcing losses on Bank of Ireland Plc,
Allied Irish Banks Plc, EBS Building Society, and Irish Life &
Permanent Plc’s senior bondholders.  “There are a number of reasons why Ireland might be a bit
different,” Schaffrik said. “There’s some positive reaction
coming from the  stress test . But you have to be extremely
careful about reading too much into individual moves” because
the market liquidity is low, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
