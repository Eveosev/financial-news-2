     April 7 (Bloomberg) --  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, advanced for the first time in
17 trading sessions on speculation the decline to the lowest
level since 2009 was overdone given the company’s earnings.  The stock gained 1 shilling, or 3.1 percent, to 33
shillings at 1:08 p.m. in Nairobi, its biggest intraday advance
since March 21. Kenya Airways’ 14-day relative strength index
closed trading yesterday at 21.59 yesterday. A reading below 30
indicates a stock is due to increase.  “It had reached its bottom,” Renaldo D’souza, an analyst
at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview
today. “Initially people did not even expect it to go below 40
shillings.”  Kenya Airways has lost 28 percent this year, making it the
worst performer on the nation’s index. The company is valued at
7.5 times earnings for the year ended March 2010. That compares
with 13.4 times profit a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
