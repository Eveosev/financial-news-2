Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported a small
fire caused an emergency shutdown at a crude unit at its Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery, according to a filing with state
regulators.  No impact to production is expected,  Bill Day , a Valero
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The unit was shut down after a
flange leak and the fire, he said, and the refineryâ€™s other
crude unit is operating.  The event occurred from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. today, according
to the filing, which identified the unit as AVU-146.  To contact the reporter on this story:
