South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index snapped four days of gains, dropping 254.22, or 0.8
percent, to 32,633.25 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following stocks were among the most active stocks in
the South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock

Officer  Cynthia Carroll  said.  Combined Motor Holdings Ltd. (CMH)  , the car retailer,
rose the most in more than three weeks, gaining 24 cents, or 1.9

through February probably more than doubled.  Miranda Mineral Holdings Ltd. (MMH)  , a minerals
explorer, fell the most in three weeks, declining 2 cents, or
2.8 percent, to 70 cents. A claw back offer became
unconditional, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
