Centamin Egypt Ltd. (CEY) , a gold company
operating in the north African country, said 2011 production
will be at the lower end of its target following a revolution
that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  “Gold production guidance of an estimated 250,000 ounces
to 290,000 ounces remains intact; however, with the events that
transpired during the quarter, it is prudent to guide towards
the lower end of this range,” Centamin said today in a
statement. First-quarter output was 45,204 ounces, it said.  Centamin slumped 23 percent in the first quarter in London
trading after unrest in Egypt caused “mild disruptions” to its
operations. The shares rose as much as 2 percent to 149 pence
today, and traded at 148.7 pence as of 10:36 a.m.  London  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
