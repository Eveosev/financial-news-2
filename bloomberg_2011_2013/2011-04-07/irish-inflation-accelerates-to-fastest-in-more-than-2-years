Irish inflation accelerated the
fastest in more than two years last month, led by surging energy
costs, as the  European Central Bank  prepares to raise interest
rates.  Irish consumer prices rose 3 percent in March from a year
earlier after climbing 2.2 percent in the previous month, the
 Central Statistics Office  in Cork said in a statement on its
website today. That’s the biggest gain since October 2008.
Prices increased 0.5 percent in the month.  ECB policy makers meeting in  Frankfurt  today will raise the
benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1
percent, according to all 57 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. That may pose an extra challenge for Ireland’s new
government, which is trying to revive economic growth and plug
the country’s budget deficit as rising prices curb demand.  “Inflation is expected to remain elevated,” said Ronnie
O’Toole, chief economist at Danske Bank’s Irish unit,  National
Irish Bank , said in an e-mailed note. “We expect the ECB to use
this window to increase at a moderate pace to 2 percent.”  Costs of gas and other fuels jumped 13 percent in the year,
the report showed. Based on a harmonized European Union measure,
Irish inflation accelerated to 1.2 percent in March from 0.9
percent in January. That’s the fastest pace since December 2008.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
