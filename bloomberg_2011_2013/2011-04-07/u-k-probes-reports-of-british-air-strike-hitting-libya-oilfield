The U.K. Ministry of Defence is
investigating media reports that a British air strike hit the
Sarir oil field in  Libya , killing three guards, a spokeswoman
said by telephone.  Reuters cited Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim as
saying that the guards were employees at the oilfield and that
the strike damaged a pipeline connecting the field to a port in
the Mediterranean. Al-Arabiya also reported the air strike.  The MOD spokeswoman said the ministry could not confirm the
air strike.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
