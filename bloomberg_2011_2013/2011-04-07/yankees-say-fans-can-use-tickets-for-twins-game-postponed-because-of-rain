The  New York Yankees  said fans can
use their tickets for last nightâ€™s postponed game against the
 Minnesota Twins  for the rescheduled matchup.  Ticket holders also have the option of obtaining an
exchange for any regular-season Major League Baseball game at
Yankee Stadium within the next 12 months. A new date for the
game has yet to be set.  The game was postponed after rain pelted Yankee Stadium in
the Bronx. The New York area was expecting more than half an
inch of rain last night, according to AccuWeather.com.  The Yankees have started the 2011 season at 3-2, while the
Twins are 2-3.  The teams are also scheduled to play at 1:05 p.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
