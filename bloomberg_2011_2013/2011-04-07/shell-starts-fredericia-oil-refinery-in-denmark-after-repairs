Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, is starting its Fredericia refinery in
 Denmark  following a halt for planned maintenance.  “Everything is starting up as planned here,” Trine
Jensen, a Shell spokeswoman based in Denmark, said in a voice-
mail message late yesterday.  The plant was halted on March 8 for the work, which was
expected to last for about three weeks. A complete shutdown
would take a week and the start-up would also take a week, the
company said on March 7. Part of the work included replacing a
heat exchanger. Refiners must halt plants periodically for
repairs and inspections to ensure efficient and safe operations.  The Fredericia refinery can process 64,000 barrels of crude
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
