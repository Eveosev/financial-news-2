Malaysia’s ringgit retreated from
near a 13-year high on speculation the central bank will take
steps to reduce capital inflows.  The currency has closed in a narrow range between 3.0235
per dollar and 3.0275 in the past two weeks after  Bank Negara
Malaysia  said on March 23 that excessive capital inflows could
 undermine  the nation’s economic recovery and price stability.
 Government bonds  advanced.  “We are simply seeing some gentle leaning against the wind
of the fundamental forces driving Asian foreign-exchange
appreciation,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a Hong Kong-based senior
currency strategist at  Scotia Capital , a unit of  Canada ’s third-
largest banking group. “The inflation dynamics of the region
suggest that further appreciation is well justified.”  The ringgit traded at 3.0265 per dollar as of 4:46 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur versus 3.0250 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.0190 on April 1, the
strongest level since October 1997. It has appreciated 1.2
percent this year after rallying almost 12 percent in 2010.  Consumer prices in  Malaysia  rose 2.9 percent in February
from a year earlier, the most since April 2009, a government
report on March 25 showed. Malaysia’s central bank has kept its
overnight policy rate at 2.75 percent since July last year after
raising it three times earlier in 2010. Policy makers next meet
on May 5.  Three-year bonds gained for a fourth day on speculation
investors are favoring shorter-maturity debt over long bonds on
inflation outlook as the government prepares to sell 10- and 15-
year notes.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 dropped
1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.37 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price rose 0.03, or 30 sen per
1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.2.  The government is scheduled to sell 2026 bonds as early as
next week and Shariah-compliant 2021 notes later this month,
according to its auction calendar. It hasn’t disclosed the date
and amount of the offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
