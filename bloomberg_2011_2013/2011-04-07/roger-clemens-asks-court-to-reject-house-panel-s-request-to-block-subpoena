Roger Clemens , the former New York
Yankees pitcher, asked a judge to deny a request by a U.S. House
of Representatives panel to block his subpoena for information
to defend against perjury and obstruction of justice charges.  The subpoena, issued Feb. 10 by one of Clemens’s lawyers,
seeks “interview summaries, notes and memorandum” related to
the February 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform hearing on steroids. The committee asked a federal judge
in Washington on March 18 to block the subpoena.  Clemens said the subpoenaed documents weren’t created in
connection with any legitimate legislative activity, so the
House panel can’t use the speech-and-debate clause of the U.S.
Constitution to thwart his request, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in  Washington . Clemens said the
hearing the committee held focusing on accusations made against
him in the Mitchell Report on steroids in baseball didn’t lead
to any legislation.  Clemens, 48, was indicted in August on one count of
obstructing a congressional investigation, three counts of
making false statements and two counts of perjury. Clemens, who
also played for the  Boston Red Sox , Toronto Blue Jays and
 Houston Astros  over a 24-year Major League Baseball career,
pleaded not guilty.  He faces a $1.5 million fine and a maximum of 30 years in
prison if convicted on all charges. Jury selection is scheduled
to begin July 6.  The case is U.S. v. Clemens, 10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
