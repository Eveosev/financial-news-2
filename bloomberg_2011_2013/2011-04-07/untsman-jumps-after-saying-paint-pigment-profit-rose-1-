Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the world’s third-
biggest producer of titanium-dioxide pigment, gained in New York
trading after the company said profit margins for the white
paint ingredient widened in the first quarter.  Huntsman increased prices about $400 a ton in the quarter
and each $100 gain adds $50 million to earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, Chief Executive Officer J. Kimo Esplin said today in a  presentation  on the company’s
website. Rising raw-material costs will erode some of the margin
expansion, he said.  “We’re going to still expand margins and we’re going to
expand them at a pretty good rate,” Esplin said. “Just don’t
forget the headwinds that we are all experiencing.”  Huntsman, which is run from offices in  Salt Lake City  and
The Woodlands,  Texas , rose $1.05, or 5.8 percent, to $19.16 as
of 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The largest titanium dioxide maker is DuPont Co., followed
by Cristal Global, Esplin said. The chemical adds opacity and
whiteness in paints, plastics and paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
