Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households slipped for a second day on forecasts of milder
weather that may reduce demand for the heating fuel. Shipments
to the Midwest also extended a decline.  Scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and  Canada  fell
4.2 percent to 28.3 million dekatherms (27.6 billion cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
lowest level since Oct. 30.  Residences in a region including the Great Lakes and parts
of the mid-Atlantic were to receive 11.7 million dekatherms of
gas, down 2.6 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  The low temperature in Cincinnati early today was 41
degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius), 3 above normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The overnight low
may be 52, 12 above normal.  Wholesale gas at the NGPL Midcontinent hub, which
transports the fuel to the Midwest from the 9,800-mile NGPL
pipeline, slid 3.1 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.9618 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange. Prices at the hub fell for the seventh day.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 5.03 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.1739 per million Btu
on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
