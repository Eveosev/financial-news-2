National Oil Corp. of  Kenya , the
East African nation’s state-owned oil company, returned to
profit in the first half of the year, helped by an increase in
sales volumes.  The Nairobi-based company, which sells gasoline and other
oil products, posted pretax profit of 116 million shillings
($1.4 million) for the six months through December, up from a
loss of 13.7 million shillings a year earlier, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Sales volumes jumped 57 percent to 133 million liters (35
million gallons) during the period, beating its target of 113
million liters, National Oil said. That helped push sales 46
percent higher to 9.5 billion shillings, it said.  “We expect a better performance in the second half of the
year owing to our expanded retail network,” Managing Director
Sumayya Athmani said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
