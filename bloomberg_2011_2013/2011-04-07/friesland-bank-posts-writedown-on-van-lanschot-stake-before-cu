Friesland Bank NV wrote down 61
million euros ($87 million) last year on its 23 percent stake in
 Van Lanschot NV (LANS) , the oldest independent Dutch lender, as it
prepares to dispose of the holding.  “In line with our strategic points of departure, the
decision was made to reduce our interest in Van Lanschot,” the
Leeuwarden, Netherlands-based lender said today. “This resulted
in a considerable writedown, which clears the way to a sale of
this stake, without a further negative impact on our results,”
Friesland Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
