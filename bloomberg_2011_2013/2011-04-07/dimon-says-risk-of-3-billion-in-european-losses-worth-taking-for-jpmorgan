JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  said potential rewards of investing in five
European nations including Greece and Ireland outweigh the risk
of losing $3 billion if the countries default.  “In the unlikely occurrence of extremely bad outcomes in
all these countries, JPMorgan Chase ultimately could lose
approximately $3 billion,” Dimon said today in a letter to
shareholders. “But we are in the business of taking risks in
support of our clients and believe that this is a risk worth
bearing since we hope to be growing our business in these
countries for decades.”  Portugal is set to start hammering out a bailout package
that may total 75 billion euros ($107 billion), following  Greece 
and Ireland in seeking European Union aid. Nations in the
continent are seeking to quell the sovereign debt crisis that
threatened to splinter the euro region.  “In the next year or two, we believe that the Euro Zone,
in fits and starts, will work through its problems,” Dimon
wrote. “It has the will and wherewithal to do so.”  JPMorgan had about $20 billion in net exposure to Greece,
Ireland, Portugal,  Spain  and Italy when the crisis began, and
the company scaled back some investments while continuing to
serve clients, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
