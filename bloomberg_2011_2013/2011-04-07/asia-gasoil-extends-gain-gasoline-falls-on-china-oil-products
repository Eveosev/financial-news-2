Asia gasoil and jet fuel extended a
rally as cargoes changed hands at premiums in  Singapore , the
region’s biggest oil-trading center. Gasoline fell on
speculation rising fuel prices in China will curb demand.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur added 30 cents,
or 0.2 percent, to $138.80 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Jet fuel increased 60 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$139.05. Each product gained for a seventh day to the highest
since August 2008.  In Singapore, Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold 250,000 barrels of
0.5 percent sulfur gasoil to Total SA at 50 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes, traders said. Hin Leong Trading Pte sold a
similar-sized cargo of 0.25 percent sulfur grade at plus $1.50 a
barrel, the biggest premium for this grade since March 23. The
buyer was  China  International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp.,
or Unipec.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude climbed 36
cents to $22.94 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, according to
PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, ended a two-day decline.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after falling
yesterday to 60 cents a barrel, PVM said. This regrade has
dropped 33 percent in the past week, indicating it’s less
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Vitol Group sold two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore,
bringing its sales in five days to 650,000 barrels, traders
said. Hin Leong paid 30 cents and 40 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes, the largest premiums in four weeks.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose 0.7
percent to $1,029.75 a metric ton, according to Bloomberg data.
Prices advanced for a seventh day, the longest rising streak
since the 10 days to Oct. 7. The premium of Japan-delivered
naphtha to Brent, or the crack spread, rose to $110.45 from
$97.78 at the end of Asian trading yesterday.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline fell 0.3 percent to $125.65 a
barrel, the first decline since March 29, Bloomberg data showed.
Gasoline’s premium to naphtha fell 7.8 percent, the biggest drop
since March 25, to $13.10. A narrowing reforming margin signals
that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha is decreasing.  China raised retail fuel prices for the second time this
year after oil’s advance to a 30-month high undermined the
government’s efforts to cap costs and cool inflation in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Prices rose by as much as 5.8 percent today, with gasoline
increasing by 500 yuan ($76) a ton, or 0.37 yuan a liter, and
diesel by 400 yuan, or 0.34 yuan a liter, the National
Development and Reform Commission said in a statement yesterday.  Glencore International AG sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
gasoline loading April 22 to April 26 to BP Plc at $125.70 a
barrel, traders said. Glencore sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON
loading April 29 to May 3 to Trafigura Beheer BV at $128.  Trafigura also bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-
half May delivery from Vitol at $1,035 a ton. Shell sold 25,000
tons for first-half June delivery to Noble Group at $1,030.  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil dropped $2.75, or 0.4
percent, to $685.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The
price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
fell $8.25, or 1.2 percent, to $670.25. Each variety snapped a
six-day rally, the longest since January.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened for a third day
to $8.72 a barrel, signaling the biggest losses from turning oil
into residues since March 23, Bloomberg data showed. The premium
of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade rebounded to
$15.50 a ton, the highest in almost two weeks. A widening
viscosity spread means bunker declined more than higher-quality
fuel oil.  In Singapore, BP bought four 20,000-ton cargoes of 180-
centistoke fuel oil at $3 a ton over benchmark quotes, traders
said. Gunvor Singapore Pte and PetroChina Co. each sold two
cargoes for loading between May 3 and May 7.  Refinery News  PetroChina, the country’s biggest oil company, will
increase processing and shorten maintenance of its refineries to
ease a fuel shortage in some regions, according to China News
Service.  Vietnam  may start building its second  oil refinery  as early
as this quarter, Thoi Bao Kinh Te newspaper reported, citing
Dinh La Thang, chairman of Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, or
PetroVietnam.  To contact the reporters on this story:
