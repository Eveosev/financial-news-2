Tohoku Electric Power Co. said the
tsunami that struck northern  Japan  on March 11 reached as high
as 13 meters (43 feet) at its Onagawa nuclear station, almost a
meter below the site’s base.  The tsunami didn’t reach major buildings of the plant,
which sits on a base about 13.8 meters higher than  sea level , it
said in a statement on its website. While the company found some
traces of seawater at the site, there was no significant damage
to the power station.  Peak seismic accelerations from the magnitude-9 quake
exceeded design limits at several locations of the plant, it
said. Tohoku Electric confirmed functions of nuclear reactor
buildings have been maintained and will conduct further
inspections, it said. It didn’t give a timetable for restarting
the reactors.  Tohoku Electric’s calculations are based on a preliminary
report by the  Geospatial Information Authority of Japan , which
estimates that the site sunk about 1 meter because of changes in
the earth’s crust, the utility said.  The three reactors at the plant in Miyagi prefecture were
safely shut after the earthquake and cooling systems continued
to operate.  About 120 kilometers (74 miles) down the coast, Tokyo
Electric Power Co. has been trying to cool down reactors at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant after the quake and tsunami knocked out
the station’s cooling systems, causing radiation to leak in the
world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.  To contact the reporters on this story:
