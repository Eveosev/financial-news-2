The pound stayed higher against the
euro after the  Bank of England  kept its benchmark interest rate
at a record low as it seeks to nurse the U.K. economic recovery.  Sterling slipped from near a two-week high against the
dollar. The decision to keep the main rate at 0.5 percent was
anticipated by all 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
British currency fell yesterday after a report showed U.K.
industrial production unexpectedly declined in February. Gilts
declined, leaving the 10-year yield within two basis points of
the highest since Feb. 21.  “I would imagine they will increase in May or June,”  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London, said before the decision. “There should be
more of a shift in the monetary policy committee by then.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to 87.58 pence per euro as of
12:11 p.m. in  London . It was 0.2 percent weaker versus the
dollar at $1.6302 after climbing to $1.6364 yesterday, the most
since March 23.  Sterling declined 0.1 percent against the euro and the 10-
year gilt yield fell seven basis points after the central bank’s
last meeting on March 10, when it kept rates on hold and
maintained its asset-purchase program at 200 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
