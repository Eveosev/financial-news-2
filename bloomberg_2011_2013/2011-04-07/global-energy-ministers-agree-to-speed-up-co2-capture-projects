Global energy ministers agreed to
accelerate the development of projects that capture carbon-
dioxide emissions for permanent storage.  Leaders at the  Clean Energy Ministerial  pledged to speed up
carbon capture projects in a meeting in  Abu Dhabi , the U.K.
government said today in an e-mailed statement. The initiative
was proposed by the Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Action
Group, headed by the U.K. and  Australia .  “There can be no solution to  climate change  and  energy
security  globally without carbon capture and storage,” Energy
and Climate Change Secretary  Chris Huhne  said in the statement.
“Deployment of the technology is tantalizingly close, but it
won’t happen at commercial scale without concerted efforts by
governments around the world to address legal, financial and
technical barriers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
