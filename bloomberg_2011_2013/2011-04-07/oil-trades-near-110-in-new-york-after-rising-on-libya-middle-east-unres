Oil headed for a third week of gains
in  New York  after rising above $111 a barrel as a fire burned at
Libya’s Sarir field, bolstering concern unrest in North  Africa 
and the Middle East will further reduce supply.  Futures extended a rally to a 30-month high as NATO said
forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi caused a fire at Sarir, Al
Arabiya television reported yesterday. The Libyan conflict is in
a stalemate, according to Army General Carter Ham, the U.S.
commander for Africa. Unrest since mid-January has toppled
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and cut output from Libya, Africa’s
third-largest oil producer, by about 1 million barrels a day.  “The main game continues to be the Middle Eastern
situation,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “What happens
there is going to trump other events.”  Crude for May delivery rose as much as $1.12, or 1 percent,
to $111.42 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest since Sept. 22, 2008. The
contract was at $111.40 at 2:23 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday,
it rose $1.47, or 1.4 percent, to $110.30. Prices are up 3.2
percent this week and 30 percent in the past year.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization stepped up its air
campaign over Libya, deploying 164 missions on April 6,
including 73 “strike sorties” to engage possible ground
targets, the military alliance said in a web statement.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed as much as $1.15, or
0.9 percent, to $123.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it added 0.3 percent to $122.67, the
highest settlement since Aug. 1, 2008.  Uprisings  Brent, against which North African crude supplies are
priced, has surged 25 percent since the Jan. 14 ouster of
Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali. The Libyan conflict is
the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings that has spread to  Algeria ,
Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Syria and Yemen.  “Key oil support came from Middle East headlines,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in an e-mailed note. “The
Sirte Basin is where two-thirds of Libyan oil production comes
from. The oilfield was originally thought to be unlikely at risk
of sabotage due to its remote location in the Saharan desert, so
the fire significantly weighed on the supply outlook.”  Libya’s crude output has fallen to between 250,000 barrels
and 300,000 barrels a day, all of which goes to domestic
refineries,  Shokri Ghanem , chairman of state-owned National Oil
Corp., said yesterday in a telephone interview from Tripoli. The
country supplied 1.39 million barrels a day in February,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of producers and analysts.  OPEC Shipments  Libya  is one of 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, a group that pump 40 percent of the world’s
crude.  OPEC will cut oil loadings for a ninth week as Libya’s
exports decline, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements. The
group will ship 22.98 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
April 23, down from 23.36 million barrels in the period ended
March 26, the Halifax, England-based consultant said in a report
yesterday.  The  United Nations  imposed sanctions against  Iraq  in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded  Kuwait . They were lifted
in 2003 after a U.S.-led invasion overthrew the regime.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer and most populous
nation, scheduled parliamentary elections for April 9 and a
presidential vote for April 16. Elections in 2003 and 2007 were
marred by violence, voter intimidation and the stuffing of
ballot boxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
