South Korea ’s producer prices rose
at the fastest pace in more than two years, bolstering the case
for the central bank to raise  interest rates  for a third time
this year.  Prices increased 7.3 percent in March from a year earlier,
the biggest gain since November 2008, after climbing 6.6 percent
in February, the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement in Seoul
today. Prices advanced 1.2 percent a month earlier.  Policy makers in Asia are stepping up the fight against
inflation as political unrest in the Middle East boosts crude
oil prices, prompting Thailand, South Korea and  India  to raise
borrowing costs in March. Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said March 31 the central bank’s biggest concern in making
policy decisions is inflation, as “rapid” economic growth and
rising oil and food costs boost expectations of higher prices.  Finance minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said yesterday that
inflation pressures will likely ease “considerably” starting
this month because food prices have stabilized on improving
weather conditions. Consumer prices climbed 4.7 percent from a
year earlier in March, the biggest gain in more than two years.  The  Bank of Korea  will keep its benchmark rate unchanged at
3 percent next week after raising it by a quarter of percentage
point each in January and March, according to all nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Kim signaled on March 10 that the
bank wouldn’t raise rates abruptly and that inflation pressures,
which have largely been driven by oil prices, may ease in coming
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
