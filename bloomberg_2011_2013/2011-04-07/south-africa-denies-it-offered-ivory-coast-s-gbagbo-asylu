South Africa ’s Foreign Ministry
denied a report that it had offered former Ivory Coast leader
Laurent Gbagbo asylum as diplomats sought to end a military
standoff in the West African nation.  “It’s completely baseless and untrue, South Africa has not
made such an offer,” said Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the
ministry, in a phone interview today. “There has not been a
request and there has not been an offer.”  Forces loyal to internationally recognized President-elect
 Alassane Ouattara  have besieged Gbagbo’s residence in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, for the past few days as diplomats
seek to negotiate an end to the crisis.  South Africa and Togo have both offered to grant Gbagbo
safe haven if he leaves the country, Reuters reported yesterday,
citing an unidentified senior official at the African Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
