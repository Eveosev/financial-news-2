HomeChoice Holdings Ltd., the direct
 marketing company  that delisted from the  Johannesburg Stock
Exchange  in 2003, said it may sell shares in the first half of
next year to help finance expansion.  “We are considering a listing next year in order to raise
capital to fund growth,” Shirley Maltz, the company’s chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview from  Cape Town 
yesterday.  Revenue rose 34 percent to 869 million rand ($129.7
million) in the year through December, the company said in an
annual report on its  website . Earnings per share jumped 73
percent to 1.76 rand, according to the report.  The company has “been growing strongly over the past few
years,” Maltz said. “We want to maintain that growth and grow
even faster.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
