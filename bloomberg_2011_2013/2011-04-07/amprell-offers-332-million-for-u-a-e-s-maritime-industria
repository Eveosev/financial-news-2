Lamprell Plc (LAM) , an oil and gas rig
builder active in the Middle East, said it offered about 1.8
billion Norwegian kroner ($330 million) for U.A.E.’s  Maritime
Industrial Services Co.   Lamprell offered 38 kroner per Maritime share in a bid for
the whole company, the Douglas, Isle of Man-based company said
today in a statement. It offered a 19 percent premium to
yesterday’s closing price, and 28 percent more than the Dubai-
based company’s share price as of March 31, before it disclosed
talks with a third party on April 4.  Maritime jumped 6 percent to 33.8 kroner in Oslo. Lamprell
dropped 5 percent to 340.9 pence in  London .  Lamprell’s order book stood at $962 million at the end of
February after it benefited from a global increase in demand for
new rigs after the blowout last year at BP Plc’s Macondo well in
the  Gulf of Mexico .  The transaction value was calculated by Bloomberg and
doesn’t include Maritime’s debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
