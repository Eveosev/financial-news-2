Ukraine’s parliament approved a
draft law on grain export quota auctions in the first reading as
the government extends limits on cereals shipment abroad through
July 1.  The draft law was backed by 242 lawmakers in the 450-seat
Kiev-based legislature. It has to be approved in two more
readings and signed by the president before it takes effect.  Ukraine has limited grain exports since October in an
attempt to tame domestic food prices after drought reduced
harvests in the country and  Russia . The total limit of 6.2
million metric tons runs through the end of the marketing year
on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
