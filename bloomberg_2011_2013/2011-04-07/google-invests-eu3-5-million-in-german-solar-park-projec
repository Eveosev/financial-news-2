Google Inc. (GOOG)  will pay 3.5 million
euros ($5.1 million) to buy almost half of an 18.7-megawatt
solar project near Berlin.  The German private equity company Capital Stage AG agreed
to sell Google a 49 percent stake in the project, its first
renewable-energy investment outside the U.S., the  Mountain View ,
California-based technology company said in a statement.  The photovoltaic plant in Brandenburg an der Havel can
power more than 5,000 households and was connected to the grid
in 2010, Google said in a  posting  on its European policy blog.  The investment must be approved by the German competition
authorities, Google said. The company has invested more than
 $100 million  in renewable energy projects in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
