Turkey’s winter-crop outlook was
“promising” after warm weather boosted grain development, the
 United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization  said.  Winter cereals for harvesting in 2011 have entered the
growth stage known as  heading , when a grain’s ear starts to
develop, “earlier than normal” following warmer-than-average
temperatures, the Rome-based FAO said in a  report  on its website
today.  Turkey, the Middle East’s largest wheat grower, will be a
net grain importer in 2010-11 after its wheat harvest fell 4.6
percent last year, based on FAO forecasts. The country had
exported more grain than it bought the previous year.  “Despite a dry spell in November that affected some south-
eastern growing areas, prospects are generally favorable,” the
FAO said. “Harvest outlook is currently very promising in
western Central Anatolia.”  The Central Anatolia Region’s west, which accounts for
about 40 percent of  Turkey ’s wheat crop, benefited from
“adequate” rain in February and March, according to the FAO.
Yields in southeast Anatolia and Cukurova are expected to be
“about average,” the UN agency said.  Harvesting of winter grains is due to begin in June,
according to the FAO.  Farmers are “about to start” planting corn, and the area
sown with the grain is expected to shrink as some switch to
cotton in response to “very high” prices for the fiber, the
FAO said. Most of the switch will happen in corn-growing regions
in Cukurova and southeast Anatolia that are also suitable for
cotton, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
