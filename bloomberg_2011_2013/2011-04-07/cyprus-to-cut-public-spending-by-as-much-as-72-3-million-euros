Cyprus’s government will cut public-
sector jobs and spending in unspecified areas to save as much as
72.3 million euros ($103.1 million) amid disappointing tax
revenues, government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said.  The government “decided to cut public spending by 63.8
million euros and to eliminate 218 permanent jobs in the public
service,” to save a further 8.5 million euros annually,
Stefanou said, according to a transcript of his comments e-
mailed by the Nicosia-based government press office.  Tax revenues in the euro area’s third smallest economy
showed “an unsatisfactory trend” in the first two months of
2011, Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis said March 17. Cyprus
forecasts a budget deficit of 4 percent of gross domestic
product this year compared with its estimate of a 5.3 percent
shortfall in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
