Poland’s zloty retreated from a
four-week high versus the euro and bond yields rose after
Portugal requested financial aid and the  European Central Bank 
prepared to raise  interest rates .  The zloty eased 0.1 percent to 3.9757 per euro as of 12:18
a.m. in Warsaw, snapping its biggest two-day gain since Jan. 12.
The yield on bonds maturing in October 2020 rose 2 basis points
to 6.17 percent following a six-day rally that drove the cost of
government’s borrowing on 10-year debt to the lowest level in
three months.  Portugal’s Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  said in a televised
statement late yesterday that his nation was seeking financial
assistance, becoming the third euro area member to seek a
European Union-led bailout. The decision came as the Frankfurt-
based ECB will probably increase its main interest rate by 25
basis points today, according to all 57 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “A lot will hinge on comments from ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet at today’s conference,” Bank BPH economists
wrote in a note to customers. “Any suggestions that the
monetary tightening will gather pace may boost the euro and the
zloty. It is more likely though that after yesterday’s events in
 Portugal  the ECB’s tone will be more neutral and this may weaken
the currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
