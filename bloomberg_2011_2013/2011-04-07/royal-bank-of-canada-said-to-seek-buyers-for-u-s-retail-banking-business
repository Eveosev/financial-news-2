Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  is seeking
buyers for its U.S. retail banking operation a decade after
entering the market, said three people with knowledge of the
talks.  Royal Bank is getting advice from JPMorgan Chase & Co. on
the potential sale of the RBC Bank unit, said the people, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.
RBC Bank, whose branches are concentrated in the southeast U.S.,
had $4 billion of equity capital and $27.6 billion of assets as
of Dec. 31, according to data on the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.â€™s website.  Katherine Gay, a Royal Bank spokeswoman, declined to
comment on a potential sale of RBC Bank, and said that the bank
remains committed to its U.S. growth strategy. Tasha Pelio, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
