The  Federal Reserve ’s total assets
rose by $26.2 billion to $2.65 trillion, the tenth consecutive
record-setting week, as the central bank bought  Treasury
securities  in its second round of so-called quantitative easing.  Treasuries held by the Fed rose by $24.8 billion as of
yesterday. The Fed’s holdings of mortgage-backed securities and
federal agency debt were unchanged, according to a weekly
release by the central bank today.  The central bank has purchased $512.2 billion in Treasuries
since Nov. 12 under plans to buy $600 billion of government debt
through June and reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage debt.
The unconventional monetary easing is aimed at spurring economic
growth and preventing inflation from falling too low.  M2  money supply  fell by $1.1 billion in the week ended
March 28, the Fed said. That left M2 growing at an annual rate
of 4.3 percent for the past 52 weeks, below the target of 5
percent the Fed once set for maximum growth. The Fed no longer
has a formal target.  The Fed reports two measures of the money supply each week.
M1 includes all currency held by consumers and companies for
spending, money held in checking accounts and travelers checks.
M2, the more widely followed, adds savings and private holdings
in money market.  M1 rose by $11.8 billion, and over the past 52 weeks M1
rose 9.9 percent, according to the central bank. The Fed no
longer publishes figures for M3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
