Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest smelter, has joined the country’s producers in buying
metal from overseas to fill customer orders after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami curbed domestic output.  “It may last until the Hitachi plant resumes operations
later this month,” Pan Pacific spokesman Kouichi Shirai said
today. The Tokyo-based company, which exports 30 percent to 40
percent of its total output, halted operations at its Hitachi
refinery in Ibaraki, northern Japan, after the disaster.  Smelters in  China  and  South Korea  will benefit from a pick-
up in demand and from climbing processing fees after the 9-
magnitude temblor and 23-foot tsunami forced the suspension of
output at smelters and refineries operated by Pan Pacific and
other producers of copper, zinc and lead in Japan.  “Producers’ purchases of these metals will underpin prices
in London,” said Kim Gyung Jung, an analyst at Eugene
Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul . “This will continue until
they are able to fully resume operations.”  Japan is the fourth-biggest consumer of copper used in
pipes, tubes and wires, and the second-largest buyer of copper
concentrate after China. The country imported 5.4 million metric
tons of copper concentrate in 2010, up from 4.8 million tons the
year before, finance ministry data show.  Distress Sales  Charges to treat and refine copper ore jumped after the
disaster curbed smelter and refinery capacity, Macquarie Group
Ltd. said in a report March 26. Treatment charges increased to
$130 a ton from $60 to $70 before the quake, while refining
charges gained to 13 cents a pound from 6 to 7 cents, Macquarie
said.  Weaker Japanese demand for copper concentrates would mean
treatment and refining charges rise “substantially,” Aurubis
AG said in a report March 15. “Deliveries must now be
redirected via distress sales to other purchasers,” Aurubis
said in the report.  Pan Pacific Copper said yesterday that it plans to produce
257,494 tons in the six months started April 1, down 12 percent
from 293,669 tons a year earlier. This compared with 264,485
tons in the six months ended March 31. Output may change because
of uncertainty over scheduled power blackouts, it said.  Force Majeure  The Hitachi refinery has an annual capacity of 120,000 tons
of copper. The company, a joint venture between  JX Holdings Inc. (5020) 
and Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., is operating its Saganoseki
and Tamano smelters at full capacity.  Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Japan’s third-largest copper
producer, said today it aims to resume partial operations in
mid-July at its Onahama smelter. On April 5, the company said
it’s buying metal from domestic and overseas markets after
declaring force majeure on concentrate shipments on March 14.
The smelter produces 220,000 tons to 240,000 tons each year.  On April 1, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan’s second-
largest copper smelter, cut output 12 percent to 354,000 tons in
the year from April 1, it said. The company, which has copper
capacity of 450,000 tons, will shut its Toyo smelter from Sept.
13 to Nov. 11 for maintenance.  Mitsui Mining & Smelting, Dowa Holdings and Toho Zinc Co.,
Japan’s top three zinc producers, said March 25 they were
importing metal from overseas to replace local supplies.  The total zinc capacity affected was 451,200 tons,
according to Bloomberg calculations. The affected capacity
includes the Hachinohe, Akita and Annaka smelters. Zinc is used
to galvanize steel.  Copper for three-month delivery rose 1.1 percent on the
 London  Metal Exchange to $9,710 a ton at 6:02 p.m. Tokyo time,
zinc gained 0.4 percent to $2,459.75 and lead was little changed
at $2,821. Copper has climbed 5.7 percent, zinc has risen 7.5
percent and lead has jumped 16 percent since March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
