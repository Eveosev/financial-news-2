The German state of  Lower Saxony 
will soon hold a majority stake in Norddeutsche Landesbank, or
NordLB, after the planned conversion of its silent participation
into core capital, Handelsblatt said in a preview of a report to
be published tomorrow, citing an interview with state Finance
Minister Hartmut Moellring.  The stateâ€™s stake may increase to around 60 percent from 42
percent following the transaction, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
