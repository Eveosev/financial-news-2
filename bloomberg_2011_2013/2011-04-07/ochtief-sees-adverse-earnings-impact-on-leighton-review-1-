Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s biggest
listed builder, said Australian unit  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ’s
earnings review will likely have “significant adverse effects”
on its 2011 forecast.  Leighton is due to publish a detailed review of its
guidance for this year by April 11, Hochtief said in a statement
today. The Essen, Germany-based construction company doesn’t
expect any impact on its forecasts for 2012 and 2013, it said.  Leighton, 54 percent owned by Hochtief, halted its shares
today for the forecast review. The company has faced delays in
completing a desalination plant in  Australia ’s Victoria state,
poor weather in regions where it has mining contracts and
higher-than-expected costs for building the  Airport Link  road in
Brisbane, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “We envisage further weakness in Leighton’s share price as
these issues are fully analyzed by investors,” RBS analysts led
by Andrew Hodge wrote in an April 6 report to clients. Sydney-
based Leighton may also revise the value of its Middle East
venture with the Al Habtoor Group, they wrote.  Hochtief confirmed its 2011 earnings target on March 23,
when it forecast pretax profit of about 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) and net income of about 600 million euros. Madrid-based
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA has said it plans to
raise its stake in the German builder to more than 50 percent.  The German company has climbed 20 percent this year in
Frankfurt trading. Leighton has declined 6 percent in Sydney,
compared with a 3.5 percent gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index in the same period.  Hochtief forecast 2012 pretax profit of 1 billion euros and
higher earnings in 2013, according to its March 23  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
