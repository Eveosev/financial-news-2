Ghana ’s government will probably
earn a third more from oil this year than previously estimated
by  Databank Financial Services Ltd. , the investment bank said.  The West African nation’s proceeds from oil will reach
about $800 million, up from an initial projection of $600
million, Sampson Akligoh, an economist at Databank, based in the
capital, Accra, said in an e-mailed reply to questions today.  Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said in his budget speech
on Nov. 18 that government revenue from oil may reach 584
million cedis ($386 million) this year. Crude oil has surged 34
percent in  New York  in the past six months and was trading as
high as $109.37 a barrel today.  “We have raised our average crude oil price forecast for
2011 to $105 per barrel from $75, owing to ongoing market
dynamics and the unrest in the Arab countries,” Akligoh said.
“We are optimistic that production at the Jubilee field
currently around 50,000 barrels per day will rise to more than
100,000 barrels in the second half.”  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the field’s operator, expects production to
increase to 120,000 barrels a day later this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
