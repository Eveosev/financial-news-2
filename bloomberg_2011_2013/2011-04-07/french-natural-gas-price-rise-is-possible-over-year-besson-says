France  may allow  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, the
former monopoly natural gas supplier, to increase prices in the
next year, according to Industry Minister Eric Besson.  “Before the presidential election I can’t say for
certain,” Besson said during an RMC radio interview, referring
to the 2012 poll. There may be an increase, he said. “That
doesn’t mean there will be.”  Prime Minister Francois Fillon two days ago said natural
gas prices wouldn’t rise July 1 after an average increase of 4.9
percent at the start of this month. He also told parliament
there wouldn’t be an increase for a year.  The government plans to work with GDF Suez and the French
energy regulator to revise the way regulated prices are
calculated to take into account a drop in  spot market  prices,
Besson said today.  “There has to be an automatic revision of gas prices under
the law,” he said. “Gas prices for consumers need to reflect
costs and until now there was no doubt. There is a doubt now
about the method of calculation.”  The rise in regulated rates should have been 7.5 percent on
July 1, Fillon said. Most of GDF Suez’s costs of supply to
French consumers are through long-term contracts which the
utility says are more expensive than the spot market. GDF has
said it’s entering discussions with suppliers on the contracts
with the aim of pegging a higher volume to market prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
