Canada ’s dollar rose to almost the
strongest level in more than three years against the U.S. dollar
as crude oil, the nation’s largest export, traded at a 30-month
high, adding demand for commodity-linked currencies.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, earlier pared
gains against the greenback after reports of an earthquake off
 Japan ’s coast damped risk appetite. Crude oil exceeded $110 a
barrel as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir field, bolstering
concern that unrest in North Africa and the Middle East will
spread. Canadian building permits rose more than forecast in
February before a report tomorrow forecast to show a March gain
of 28,000 jobs.  “The Canadian dollar upward trend remains,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “There’s strong
underlying support there, rather than just speculative
positioning, which suggests sustained strengthening.”  The Canadian currency rose 0.3 percent to 95.79 cents per
U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 96.08 cents yesterday. It
appreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 95.71 cents. The currency
touched 95.69 cents yesterday, the strongest since November
2007. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0436.  The yen strengthened against most of its major peers
including Canada’s dollar after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit
215 miles northeast of  Tokyo .  ECB Moves  The currency pared gains against the greenback earlier as
 European Central Bank  policy makers raised the benchmark
interest rate to 1.25 percent from a record low 1 percent.  “The Canadian dollar is generally reflecting a bit of euro
profit taking after the European Central Bank, which has given
the  U.S. dollar  a bit of a lift,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief
currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to $110.33 a
barrel in New York. It touched $110.44 a barrel, the highest
since September 2008. Gold for June delivery reached a record
$1,468.80 an ounce earlier.  Raw materials , including oil and gold, account for about
half of Canada’s export revenue.  “Commodities are still great support for the Canadian
dollar with oil and gold up,” said Steve Butler, managing
director of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit. “All things point to the Canadian
dollar getting stronger.”  Building Trend  Canadian building permits rose in February almost twice as
fast as the most optimistic forecast as a gain in nonresidential
work exceeded a drop in housing.  The total value of permits issued by municipalities rose
9.9 percent to C$5.81 billion ($6.06 billion), the fastest pace
in five months, according to Ottawa-based  Statistics Canada . The
rise was almost double the highest of the 13 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey, which had a median estimate of a 1.3
percent increase.  U.S. initial jobless benefit claims fell 10,000 last week
to 382,000, the fewest since Feb. 26, Labor Department figures
showed today.  Canada’s trade ties to the U.S. have fallen to the lowest
since at least 1986, extending a slide between the world’s
largest commercial partners, Statistics Canada said.  Trade Patterns  About 62.5 percent of Canada’s foreign merchandise trade
was with the U.S. in 2010, down from 76.3 percent in 2001, the
Ottawa-based agency said in an annual review report today.
Canada’s share of trade involved  China  tripled to 3.3 percent
from 1.1 percent during that time, while trade with the U.K.
rose to 4.1 percent from 1.3 percent.  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s election campaign
may get a boost from an employment report that is forecast to
show a sixth straight monthly gain, bolstering his argument his
Conservative Party is best at managing the economic recovery.  Statistics Canada is likely to report a job gain of 28,000
people for March, and a decline in the  unemployment rate  to 7.7
percent from 7.8 percent, according to the median of 25
estimates in a Bloomberg News Survey. The Ottawa-based agency’s
jobs report, the only one scheduled to be published before the
May 2 election, is due tomorrow at 7 a.m. Toronto time.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year up two basis points, 0.02 percentage point, to
3.44 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in
June 2020 dropped 17 cents to C$100.51.  To contact the reporter on this story:
