Russiaâ€™s largest oil companies,
including OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP and OAO Gazprom Neft
will probably compete for the rights to the Imilor field that
the government plans to sell at auction, Vedomosti reported.   The government plans to start the auction for the Siberian
deposit at about 18 billion rubles ($640 million), the Moscow-
based newspaper said today, citing unidentified officials in the
Natural Resources Ministry.  The field holds about 193 million tons (1.42 billion
barrels) of crude, the newspaper said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
