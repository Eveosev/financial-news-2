Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  repaired and restarted
the fluid catalytic cracker at its Marcus Hook refinery in
 Pennsylvania  for the first time since a power loss on March 28,
a person familiar with refinery operations said.  The gasoline-making unit is progressing toward planned
rates, said the person, who declined to be identified because he
isn’t authorized to speak for the refinery.  The refinery’s other main processing units were idled until
the catalytic cracker was running again.  Sunoco advised the  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection  on April 5 that the refinery was unsuccessful in
restarting the catalytic cracker that day because a plant flare
needed to start the unit had gone out, according to Lynda Rebarchak, a spokeswoman for the agency. Rebarchak said in an e-
mail today that she doesn’t expect that Sunoco will give her an
update on the restart of the unit.  Thomas Golembeski, a company spokesman in Philadelphia,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The refinery has a capacity of 194,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The refinery supplies
fuel to New York Harbor, the delivery point for gasoline and
heating oil futures, and shutdowns at the plant can increase
spot and futures prices.  Since the  power failure , the discount to futures for
immediate delivery regular gasoline in New York Harbor has
narrowed to 8 cents from 16 cents on March 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
