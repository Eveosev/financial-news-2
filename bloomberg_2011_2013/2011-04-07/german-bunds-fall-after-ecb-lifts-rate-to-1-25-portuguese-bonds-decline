German government bonds erased their
declines after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled today’s interest-rate increase may not be
followed by repeated monetary tightening.  Two-year yields earlier rose to the highest since December
2008 as policy makers boosted the main refinancing rate by a
quarter percentage point to 1.25 percent, an outcome predicted
by all 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Trichet said the
bank’s decision did not signal the “first of a series of
interest-rate increases” at a news conference in Frankfurt.
Portugal’s bonds declined after it became the third euro-region
country to seek a European Union bailout.  “The ECB president certainly did not suggest that the
central bank was embarking on a tightening cycle, which has
provided a bit of relief for bunds,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “However, policy remains accommodating, so it is
just a matter of time before they tighten again, probably in
July.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund fell two basis
points to 4.42 percent as of 4:53 p.m. in London. The 2.5
percent security maturing January 2021 climbed 0.13, or 1.3
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,429) face amount, to 92.52. The two-
year note yield also slipped two basis points, to 1.82 percent.  Today’s ECB rate increase is the first since July 2008 and
also the first time in 40 years that  Europe ’s benchmark has
risen before the U.S. equivalent.  Bunds were also supported after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake
hit 215 miles (345 kilometers) northeast of  Tokyo , according to
the  U.S. Geological Survey .  Portuguese Bailout  Portugal’s Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  said he tried
“everything” before requesting financial aid. The Iberian
nation sold 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of bills yesterday,
paying more to borrow for six months than it costs Germany for
30 years of funding.  The Portuguese two-year yield jumped 20 basis points to
9.07 percent. The benchmark 10-year yield rose six basis points
to 8.60 percent, after reaching 8.80 percent yesterday, the
highest since the euro was introduced in 1999.  “If you look where the other markets are trading that are
under bailout already, it was to be expected” that Portuguese
yields would rise, said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European fixed-
income strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “No one
really knows what the end game is.”  Spanish, Italian ‘Decoupling’  Portuguese debt ranked as the worst performer this year,
down 9.6 percent, according to indexes compiled by the European
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Spanish
 government bonds  generated returns of 2.7 percent while German
bunds have lost 2.7 percent.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields were little changed at 5.24
percent after the nation sold 4.13 billion euros of three-year
notes at an average yield of 3.568 percent compared with 3.592
percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt in March, the
Bank of Spain said.  Finance Minister Elena Salgado earlier said she
“absolutely rules out” contagion from Portugal as “markets
absolutely distinguish between the two countries.”  “The decoupling of Italy and Spain that has developed
since February should receive further momentum on the back of
the Portuguese bailout,”  Michael Leister , a fixed-income
analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, wrote today in an e-mailed
note. “A major layer of uncertainty is now cleared, which
should result in a further reduction in spill-over effects.”  The benchmark Greek 10-year yield jumped 10 basis points to
12.82 percent and Irish bonds gained, pushing the yield on
similar maturity debt 11 basis points lower to 9.26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
