Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , Canada’s
second-largest insurer, said it expects to post a first-quarter
loss of about C$75 million ($78.2 million) after last month’s
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  The loss is primarily related to claims on coverage sold to
property and casualty reinsurers by London Reinsurance Group
Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Great-West, the Winnipeg,
Manitoba-based company said today in a statement.  Great-West had been expected to report adjusted net income
of C$483 million for the three months ended March 31, according
to the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
