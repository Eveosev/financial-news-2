BNP Paribas Clean Energy Partners
GP, a London-based fund, acquired a 25-megawatt wind farm in
 Northern Ireland  from the U.K. wind project developer  Renewable
Energy Systems Ltd .  The fund, which counts BNP Paribas Investment Partners
among its investors, bought the Gruig wind farm in County Antrim
and plans to acquire more plants in the island, it said today in
an e-mailed statement. The plant opened in April 2009.  “This acquisition complements our previous acquisition in
Ireland and maintains our momentum toward a larger portfolio
that we are building in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic,” Chief Executive Officer Joost Bergsma said. “Both
renewable energy markets are very attractive for financial
investors.”  The fund is also looking for further investments in the
French, U.K. and Spanish wind markets, he said today by phone.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  Clean Energy Partners, which raised 437 million
euros ($624 million) in December, aims to invest in wind,
photovoltaic, biomass and small-scale hydro projects in
construction or operation across  Europe .  The fund has bought seven renewable energy projects so far,
according to Bergsma. He declined to disclose further details on
the latest deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
