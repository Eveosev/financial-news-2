Grifols SA (GRF) ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of blood-plasma products, is optimistic it will get regulatory
approval to buy Talecris Biotherapeutics Holding Corp., Chairman
Victor Grifols said.  “I have in my bag $4 billion sitting and waiting to be
invested,” Grifols said at an event in Madrid late yesterday.
“I don’t know when we’ll receive the green light from the FTC.
I’m sure we’ll get it, but it’s a very long process. As soon as
we get approval we are going to invest it.”  The deadline for completing the $3.8 billion purchase
acquisition of Talecris was extended to June 30 from March 6,
Barcelona-based Grifols said March 4.  Grifols in February pledged to give the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission at least 30 days’ notice of the transaction’s
closing. Grifols said Feb. 24 that it’s “meeting all necessary
conditions” to complete the takeover of Talecris, which is
based in Research Triangle Park,  North Carolina .  “We are not going to damage competition,” Grifols said at
the event, at which he was given the global business leader
award 2011 by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in  Spain . “This has
been our philosophy.” Victor Grifols has been CEO since 1985 and
chairman since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
