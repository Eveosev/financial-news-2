Vitol Group bought jet fuel in
northwest Europe for at least a third day. Stockpiles declined
for a fourth week to the lowest level since Jan. 20.  Gasoil’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , widened.
Inventories of the fuel, which include heating oil and diesel,
rose to the highest level in more than three months.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,086 and $1,087 a metric ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That’s the highest price since the grade
was introduced in January last year and compares with
yesterday’s deals from $1,079 to $1,084 a ton.  Vitol and Mabanaft BV were among the sellers. Trafigura
Beheer BV and Gunvor International BV were among the buyers.
Ethanol is added to the Eurobob grade to make finished
automotive fuel. The trades are typically for lots of 1,000 tons
or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack widened to $6.63 a barrel from $6.40
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an oil and
refined-products broker in  London .  Naphtha’s discount to Brent decreased to $7.79 from $7.96
yesterday, according to PVM. Naphtha is used in gasoline and
petrochemicals production.  Middle Distillates  Vitol purchased two cargoes of jet fuel from Morgan Stanley
at premiums of $88 and $89 a ton to May ICE gasoil, according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. That compares with
yesterday’s trade at a $95 premium.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a jet-fuel barge from BP Plc
at $83 a ton above the April gasoil contract, the survey showed.
That compares with trades yesterday at premiums of $81 and $82 a
ton.  Jet-fuel inventories in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp declined 6.3 percent to 680,000 tons in the
week to today, according to PJK International BV, a Netherlands-
based researcher.  Gasoil for April was little changed at $1,025.25 a ton as
of 5:12 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.
The contract for May delivery was at $1,021.25 a ton. Brent for
May was little changed at $122.15 a barrel on the ICE exchange.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, rose
to $14.89 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time from $14.48 at the
same time yesterday, according to ICE data.  Stockpiles of gasoil increased 10 percent to 2.9 million
tons as the fuel arrived from  Canada ,  India ,  Latvia  and  Russia ,
according to PJK. That’s the highest level since Dec. 16.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at $12.50 to $13 a
ton more than April gasoil, in line with trades yesterday,
according to the survey of Platts. Barges also traded at $18 a
ton above May gasoil.  Two diesel cargoes traded at premiums of $28 and $31 a ton
to May gasoil, the survey showed. Greenergy International Ltd.
and Glencore International AG were the respective buyers from
Shell and Cargill SA.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  barges traded at $644 to $647 a ton,
the survey of Platts showed. That compares with yesterday’s
trades at $646 to $650 a ton. Fuel oil is used to power ships
and generate electricity.  Refineries  Shell is starting its Fredericia refinery in  Denmark 
following planned maintenance. “Everything is starting up as
planned here,” Trine Jensen, a Shell spokeswoman based in
Denmark, said in a voice-mail message late yesterday.  The plant was halted on March 8 for the work, which was
expected to last for about three weeks. A complete shutdown
would take a week and the start-up would also take a week, the
company said on March 7.  The refinery can process 64,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
