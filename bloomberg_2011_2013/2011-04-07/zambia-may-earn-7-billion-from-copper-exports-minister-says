Zambia,  Africa ’s largest copper
producer, may earn more than $7 billion from exports of the
metal this year, Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane  said.  “This can be attributed to increased copper production by
mining companies trying to ride on the high copper prices in
London,” he said by phone today from the capital, Lusaka.
“It’s very encouraging for 2011.”  Zambia, which earns about 70 percent of its foreign
currency from shipments of copper, plans to boost production to
more than 1 million metric tons a year by 2015, the  Daily Mail 
reported on March 25, citing Mines Minister Maxwell Mwale.  The southern African nation produced about 819,000 tons in
2010, Bank of Zambia Governor Caleb Fundanga said on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
