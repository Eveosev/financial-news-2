Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a
state company set up to buy debts from the West African nation’s
lenders, put the underlying value of assets bought in its two
phases of purchases at about 3 trillion naira ($19.4 billion),
Executive Director Foluke Dosumu said.  The underlying value of assets bought in the first phase on
Dec. 31 is estimated at 2.48 trillion naira, while that of the
second portion, undertaken on March 31, is “about 600 billion
naira,” Dosumu said by phone today.  Amcon issued 1.7 trillion naira of bonds in the first
series of its debt program to fund the purchases, Dosumu said. A
second series of bonds totaling 1.3 trillion naira will be sold
to make the lenders the  central bank  bailed out capital-neutral,
Renaissance Capital banking analyst Adesoji Solanke said in an
e-mailed note yesterday.  A debt crisis prompted the  Central Bank of Nigeria  to fire
eight chief executives of lenders in 2009 and bail out the
industry with 620 billion naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
