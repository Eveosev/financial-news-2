Rural/Metro Corp. was sued by a
shareholder over its proposed buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC in a
complaint alleging that the $17.25-a-share price is too low.  Rural/Metro directors have a duty to get the best possible
price for the company and wrongly agreed to the buyout at an
unfair price, common stockholder Beatriz Llorens said in a
complaint filed yesterday in  Delaware  Chancery Court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The deal offers “grossly inadequate consideration, through
a flawed process, based upon grossly inadequate disclosures,”
and the acquisition should be halted, Llorens said in the
complaint.  The new ownership presents an opportunity to expand the
emergency services company, Rural/Metro Chief Executive Officer
Michael DiMino said when the plan was announced March 28.  Rural/Metro, based in Scottsdale,  Arizona , reported
$530.7 million in revenue last fiscal year. The company, started
in 1948, has about 1,700 vehicles providing fire protection,
ambulance, wheelchair transport and other medical services in 20
states, according to court papers.  “Actions such as this are expected as part of these types
of transactions; however, we have not received the lawsuit and
cannot provide any further comment at this time,” Liz Merritt,
a Rural/Metro spokeswoman, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Rural/Metro was unchanged at $17.03 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 2:22 p.m. in  New York .  The case is Llorens v. Rural/Metro, CA6350, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
