Mortgage rates  in the U.S. inched
higher, the third straight week of increases in borrowing costs.  The average rate for 30-year fixed home loans rose to 4.87
percent in the week ended today from 4.86 percent, according to
 Freddie Mac . The average 15-year rate was 4.1 percent, up from
4.09 percent a week ago, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-
 finance company  said in a statement.  Mortgage applications decreased 2 percent in the week ended
April 1, according to the  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index.
The Washington-based group’s refinancing measure fell 6.2
percent, while its purchasing gauge rose 6.7 percent to the
highest level this year. The increase reflected a jump in demand
for government loans as buyers tried to beat an April 18
increase in Federal Housing Administration insurance premiums,
the group said yesterday.  The housing market remains weak as foreclosures mount and
unemployment hovers close to 9 percent. Sales of existing homes
fell 9.6 percent in February, and distressed properties
accounted for 39 percent of deals, the National Association of
Realtors said March 21.  Rates for 30-year loans began climbing from a record low of
4.17 percent in the week ended Nov. 11 and reached a 10-month
high of 5.05 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
