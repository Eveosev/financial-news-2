Finnish Finance Minister Jyri
Katainen said it’s likely Finland would participate in loan
guarantees for  Portugal , state-owned radio and TV broadcaster
YLE reported on its website.                                   “It’s clear that if the support is given, then a belt and
suspenders would be put on Portugal and both of them tightened
enough to restore the country to health,” Katainen said in an
interview according to YLE. The guarantees would avoid a greater
catastrophe from Finland’s point of view, YLE cited him as
saying.  Katainen said he couldn’t give a timetable for  Finland ’s
reaction, adding that the decision would be made by the
Parliament, YLE reported.    Click here for web link in Finnish  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
