Germany ’s savings banks agreed to
become sole owners of DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale by buying
the 50 percent stake held by the country’s state-owned
Landesbanken.  The DekaBank stake will cost 2.3 billion euros ($3.3
billion), the German savings bank association DSGV said in an e-
mailed statement today. The savings banks will pay 1.3 billion
euros of the sum and DekaBank will buy back its own shares held
by Landesbanken for 1 billion euros, DSGV said.  “This is a significant capital relief for Landesbanken,”
Heinrich Haasis, president of the savings bank association and
chairman of the supervisory board of DekaBank, said in the
statement. “It’s a very big success for our entire group.”  Germany’s state-owned banks, known as Landesbanken, agreed
to sell their DekaBank stakes to replenish capital to pay back
state aid received during the financial crisis. Landesbank
Baden-Wuerttemberg owned 14.78 percent, HSH Nordbank AG 7.75
percent and WestLB AG 7.61 percent, with the rest split among
other state lenders, according to its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
