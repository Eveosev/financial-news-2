Enea SA (ENA) , Polandâ€™s third-largest
utility, asked the antitrust regulator to approve a purchase of
Elektrocieplownia Bialystok SA, a Polish heat and power plant
owned by  E.ON AG (EOAN) , the  watchdog  said on its website today.  Enea spokesman Grzegorz Adamski declined to comment on
whether an agreement has been reached with E.ON. Eva Hofner, a
spokeswoman for E.ON, also declined to comment.  In 2008, Enea bought a 30 percent stake in the Bialystok,
eastern Poland-based plant for 173.6 million zloty ($62.7
million) from the Polish government. According to the company
website, in 2009 it had net income of 47 million zloty on sales
of 249.9 million zloty.  SNET SA, a unit of E.ON, owns 70 percent of the Polish
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
