Switzerland ’s government might amend
legislation to cut back on expected tax revenue shortfalls after
recent changes to company taxation rules,  Neue Zuercher Zeitung 
reported.  The changes may restrict companies’ ability to pay out tax-
free funds from formerly paid-in capital, NZZ  said on its
website today , citing a government statement in parliament.  The legislation came into effect after a 2008 national
referendum, according to NZZ. Unless the provisions are changed,
they could result in a tax shortfall of 7 billion Swiss francs
($7.7 billion), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
