Copper may fall on speculation
figures for imports of the metal last month into  China , the
world’s biggest consumer, might signal tepid demand, a survey
showed.  Eight of 16 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, said prices will drop next week. Five
predicted a gain and three expected little change. Copper for
delivery in three months was up 3.4 percent for this week at
$9,682 a metric ton at 5 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange.  Chinese imports of copper and products in February were the
lowest since January 2009 at 235,469 tons, customs data showed
last month. That was a 35 percent drop from January. Figures for
March shipments are scheduled for release on April 10, according
to a calendar compiled by Bloomberg.  “I don’t think they’ll be as weak as February, but they’re
not going to be great on a year-over-year basis,” Bart Melek,
an analyst at TD Securities in Toronto, said of March
deliveries.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of April 1.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
63 of the past 131 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 8 Bullish: 5 Hold: 3  To contact the reporter on this story:
