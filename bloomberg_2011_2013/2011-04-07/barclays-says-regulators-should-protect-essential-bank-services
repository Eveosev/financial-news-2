Barclays Plc (BARC)  Finance Director Chris Lucas said regulators should adopt proposals for the orderly
winding down of failed lenders, while protecting access to
“essential” banking services for individual customers.  Barclays is talking to the  Independent Commission on
Banking , Lucas said at a conference in London today. The ICB’s
interim report will be published at 7 a.m. on April 11.  “We never want to see a rerun of the crisis in 2008 and we
never want to be put in a position again where we are challenged
by the failure of other banks,” Lucas said.  John Vickers , the Oxford University professor and former
Bank of England economist who’s overseeing the government-
appointed commission, said in January he was examining ring-
fencing, or subsidiarization, of banks’ operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
