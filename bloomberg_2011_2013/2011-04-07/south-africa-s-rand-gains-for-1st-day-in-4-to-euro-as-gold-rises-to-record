The rand advanced against the euro
for the first day in four as gold rose to a record and the
 European Central Bank  signaled it won’t necessarily raise its
interest rate more than today’s 0.25 percent increase.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 9.5050 per
euro, and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 9.5611 as of 5:36 p.m.
in Johannesburg. It was little changed at 6.6892 per dollar
after earlier rising to 6.6514, the strongest level since Jan.
4. The rand pared gains against both currencies after reports of
an earthquake off  Japan ’s coast and tsunami warnings.  The ECB increased its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.25
percent, after  Portugal  earlier became the third euro-area
country to seek a financial bailout, spurring demand for gold as
an investment haven. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the
tightening wasn’t necessarily “the first of a series.” Gold,
together with platinum, accounts for a fifth of  South Africa ’s
export earnings. The rand rose today even after the central bank
said it boosted foreign-currency purchases in March to add to
reserves.  “The rise in gross reserves confirms that officials are
not that comfortable with the dollar below 7 rand,” BNP Paribas
analysts led by London-based Paul Mortimer-Lee said in an e-
mailed research note. “But there will be little in the way of a
stronger currency as long as gold prices continue to print new
record highs.”  Gross reserves rose 4.1 percent to $49.27 billion in March
after the central bank bought more dollars and the government
sold $750 million of bonds, the  Reserve Bank  said on its website
today.  Yield Difference  The rand maintained its gains after the ECB raised its
rate, reducing the differential with South Africa’s 5.5 percent
benchmark rate.  The ECB decision won’t reduce investor appetite for rand
assets, said Deon van Zyl, who oversees about 13 billion rand
($1.9 billion) of debt as head of fixed-interest investments at
Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset Managers.  “With higher commodity prices, you could see some more
rand strength,” Van Zyl said by phone.  South African  government bonds  declined. The 13.5 percent
security due 2015 dropped 7 cents to 121.27 rand, driving the
yield up 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.73
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
