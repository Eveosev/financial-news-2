Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn declined and as crude oil advanced.  The grain-based gasoline additive was steady as corn dipped
after gaining 9.5 percent so far this month on anticipation a
report tomorrow will show smaller stockpiles of the ethanol
ingredient. Oil rose on concern that unrest in Libya will spread
to other countries in the region.  “They’re pricing ethanol now with corn more than the
petroleum products,” said  Rich Nelson , director of research at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois. “They’re trying to get a
minimal profit level. Corn’s rallied a good deal ahead of the
tomorrow’s supply and demand report.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 0.6 cent to $2.694
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen 13
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast gained
1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.86 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.69, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slumped 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.75 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the fuel lost 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.775.  Corn for May delivery declined 4 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$7.59 a bushel in Chicago. Prices for the grain, the main input
in U.S.-made ethanol, have more than doubled in the past year.  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.47 to $110.30 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Sept. 22, 2008. Futures are up 28 percent from a year ago.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are earning 11 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are profiting 15 cents
on a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
