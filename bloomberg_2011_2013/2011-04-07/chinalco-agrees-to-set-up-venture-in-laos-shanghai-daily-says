Chinalco signed an agreement with a
Laotian government company on March 30 to jointly develop
mineral resources in Laos’s south, Shanghai Daily said, citing a
statement from the Chinese company.    The metals producer’s  Hong Kong  unit will buy a stake in
the Laotian company, the English-language newspaper said today.
Talks on completing details of the investment are underway, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified Chinalco spokesman.  Chinalco, or Aluminum Corp. of  China , is the state-owned
parent of Hong Kong-listed Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., or
Chalco.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
