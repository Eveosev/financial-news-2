PT Pertamina,  Indonesia â€™s state oil
company, bought cargoes of Nigerian Qua Iboe and Escravos crude
for delivery from June to August, according to two traders who
participate in the West African crude market.  The seller was Vitol Group, said the traders, who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential.
Deliveries of both grades consist of 950,000 barrels a month,
they said.  Patrick Handley, a London-based spokesman for Vitol,
declined to comment.  Details of the purchase are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
