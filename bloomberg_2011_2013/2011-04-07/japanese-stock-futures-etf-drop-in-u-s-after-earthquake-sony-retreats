Japanese stock futures retreated
after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the country less than a
month following the nation’s worst temblor on record. Australian
stock futures fell.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s biggest
exporter of electronics, slipped 0.8 percent in New York. Those
of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest maker of cameras, fell 0.5
percent. ADRs of Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker of solar
panels, lost 1.2 percent. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index slipped 0.1 percent today and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
was little changed in Wellington.  Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 9,505 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared
with 9,590 in Osaka, Japan and 9,595 in  Singapore . The  iShares
MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ) , an exchange-traded security tracking the
nation’s equities, lost 0.8 percent to $9.79 in U.S. trading.
The Bank of New York Mellon Japan ADR Index fell 0.2 percent in
New York yesterday and has plunged 12 percent since March 10,
the day before Japan was hit by a magnitude-9 earthquake and
tsunami.  “The concern is further disruptions to the economic base
of Japan,” said  Martin Schulz , who manages $360 million of
international equities as a senior portfolio manager at PNC
Capital Advisors LLC in Cleveland. The March 11 quake “not only
affected the local economy, but also the supply chain of some of
the companies that are leaders in the technology industry. The
concern is how it’d further affect those companies.”  March 11 Quake  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  posted its biggest two-day plunge since the
1987 crash on March 14 and March 15 after the quake and tsunami
on March 11 killed or left missing more than 27,000 people and
prompted radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima
nuclear power plant. The benchmark gauge has fallen 8.1 percent
since March 10.  The 7.1-magnitude earthquake minutes before midnight
yesterday spared the Fukushima plant, although workers
struggling to cool radioactive fuel were evacuated, Tepco said,
based on its initial assessment. The aftershock was the second-
strongest since the March 11 quake. No unusual conditions were
observed at the plant afterward, the utility and Japan’s Nuclear
and Industrial Safety Agency said in statements.  Sony slipped 0.8 percent in the U.S. to $30.33 in  New York .
Canon fell 0.5 percent to $42.57.  Yen Stregthens  The yen strengthened on speculation traders will reduce
investments in higher-yielding assets funded by the currency
after last night’s aftershock.  The Japanese currency rose against all 15 of 16 of its
most-traded counterparts except the Brazilian franc. The yen
gained to 84.98 against the dollar today, from 85.20 per dollar
at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A stronger yen
versus the dollar cuts the value of U.S. income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  “Even though it appears there wasn’t that much damage from
last night’s aftershock, it’ll lead to investors holding back,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura
Holdings Inc. “Exporters are likely to be sold as there seems
to be a pause in the weakening yen.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
