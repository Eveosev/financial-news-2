China ’s yuan advanced to a 17-year
high on speculation policy makers will tolerate appreciation to
rein in inflation as fuel prices surge.  China increased retail gasoline and diesel prices for the
second time this year as oil traded near the highest in 30
months in  New York .  Asia ’s largest economy imported 54 percent
of the oil it used in 2010, according to the China Petroleum &
Chemical Industry Association. A government report due April 15
will show inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent last month from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since July 2008, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The currency will gain gradually given the rising
imported inflationary pressure,” said Kenix Lai, a foreign-
exchange analyst at Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong .
“China will not allow drastic appreciation as that could hurt
the exporting industries.”  The yuan gained 0.03 percent to end at 6.542 per dollar in
Shanghai, the strongest level since the country unified official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan strengthened 0.02 percent to 6.5365.  The central bank set the yuan’s reference rate 0.06 percent
higher at 6.5456 today, the strongest level since July 2005.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4015 per dollar as of 4:46 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 2.2 percent in a year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China should consider letting the yuan strengthen to help
curb inflation and improve the balance of international payments,
Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center
wrote in a commentary in  Shanghai  Securities News today. A gain
of 6 percent to 7 percent a year against the dollar would be
“reasonable,” Zhu wrote. The State Information Center is
affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission,
China’s top economic planning agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
