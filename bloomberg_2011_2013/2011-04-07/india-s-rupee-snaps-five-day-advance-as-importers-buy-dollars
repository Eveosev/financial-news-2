India ’s rupee weakened, snapping a
five-day rally, on speculation the nation’s oil refiners stepped
up dollar purchases to pay for costlier crude imports.  Oil touched a 30-month high of $109.15 a barrel yesterday
in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India
imports almost 75 percent of the crude it uses. Concern that
political disagreements in Washington over budget cuts will lead
to a partial government shutdown and hamper the global economic
recovery also weighed on the rupee, said Vikas Babu, a foreign-
exchange trader at state-owned  Andhra Bank .  “Importers, including  oil companies , are in the market
buying dollars,” Mumbai-based Babu said. “The rupee’s weakness
also tracks the offshore forwards market, which seems to be
driven by concern about the threat of a U.S. government
shutdown.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 44.245 per dollar as of
11:37 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 44.14 yesterday, the strongest level since
Oct. 15.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.91 in
three months, compared with expectations of 44.85 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
