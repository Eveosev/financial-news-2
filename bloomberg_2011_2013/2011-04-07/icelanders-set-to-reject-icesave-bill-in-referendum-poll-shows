A majority of Icelanders will block
an accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands on depositor
guarantees, a poll published by Frettabladid showed.  The poll showed 54.8 percent of voters will reject the bill
in the April 9 referendum, while 45.2 percent will support it.  Frettabladid polled 800 people March 5 through March 6. Of
those polled, 76 percent responded. Twenty-four percent said
they hadn’t decided whether they will participate in the
referendum or refused to answer. No margin of error was
provided.  The April 9 plebiscite will decide whether the north
Atlantic island’s government can ratify an agreement with the
U.K. and the Netherlands that compensates depositors from the
two countries for losses stemming from the 2008 failure of
Landsbanki Islands hf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
