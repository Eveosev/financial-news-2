Bahrain’s economy grew at a slower
pace for the fourth consecutive quarter according to data from
the state statistics bureau.  Economic growth expanded an annual 4.2 percent in the
fourth quarter as  oil prices  climbed, the bureau said on its
website today. The economy grew 4.4 percent in the third
quarter, the organization said Nov. 25, while second-quarter
growth was 4.6 percent. The economy expanded 4.5 percent in the
year.  The Bahraini economy, the smallest in the  Persian Gulf , is
dependent on foreign direct investment, oil exports and the
local financial industry.  Barclay’s Capital yesterday cut its growth forecast for
2011 to 1.4 percent from 4.3 percent, after anti-government
uprisings and a violent crackdown against protests by security
forces threaten to deter tourists and undermine efforts to make
Bahrain a financial hub.  To contact the reporter on this story:
