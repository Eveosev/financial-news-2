A former Deloitte Tax LLP partner’s
wife pleaded guilty to a criminal obstruction charge in
connection with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
insider-trading investigation, according to court documents.  The SEC sued Arnold McClellan and his wife, Annabel, of  San
Francisco  last year for allegedly providing confidential
information on mergers and acquisitions to family members,
allowing them to make millions of dollars trading on the tips.  “Ms. McClellan admitted to making false statements in
connection with the SEC’s investigation,” SEC officials said
yesterday in a status report in the civil case.  Annabel McClellan entered her guilty plea April 5 before
U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco and will be
sentenced Sept. 20, according to court records. She faces a
maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the
crime, charging papers show.  “Annabel McClellan has apologized to the SEC and her
husband, who had no knowledge of or involvement in her
wrongdoing,” according to an e-mailed statement released today
by Nanci Clarence, her lawyer. “She accepts that she will serve
a sentence in prison, and takes full responsibility for what she
has done.”  The criminal case is U.S. v. McClellan, 10-CR-860; the
civil case is SEC v. McClellan, 10-CV-5412, both in U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
