(Corrects to remove company name from headline.)  North Sea loadings of Ekofisk grade
crude in May will total 16 cargoes, or 9.9 million barrels, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The shipments will fall by 1.7 percent to 319,355 barrels a
day compared with 325,000 barrels a day in April, according to
the program.  Ekofisk is one of four North Sea oil grades used to price
more than half of global oil. The other blends are Brent,
Forties and Oseberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
