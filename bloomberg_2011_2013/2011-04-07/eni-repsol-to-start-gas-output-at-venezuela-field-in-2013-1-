Eni SpA (ENI)  said it will start natural-
gas production with partner  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  at the Perla field,
Venezuela’s largest gas discovery, by 2013.  Perla, in the Cardon IV block in shallow waters of the Gulf
of Venezuela, “contains significant amounts of gas reserves,”
Eni said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. Eni reported Feb. 24 that the field holds 16 trillion
cubic feet of natural-gas reserves.  Eni and Repsol, Italy and Spain’s largest oil companies,
respectively, each own 50 percent of the block where the field
is located. State oil producer Petroleos de Venezuela SA has the
option to take as much as 35 percent when commercial operations
begin.  Venezuela faces natural-gas deficits and is working to
boost domestic production for both residential and commercial
consumption. The country currently imports about 200 million
cubic feet a day from Colombia and was hit by power outages when
shipments through a pipeline were disrupted last month.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based  oil company  is known, uses
natural gas to maintain oil output at mature fields. The company
is also developing liquefied natural-gas export capacity with
international partners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
