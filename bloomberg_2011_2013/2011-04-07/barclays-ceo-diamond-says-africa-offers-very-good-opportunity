Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Diamond  said Africa’s expanding economy and increasing
demand for the continent’s exports presents “very good”
opportunities for his bank.  “When I say to myself, ‘Where is there growth in the world
and where are there real competitive advantages for Barclays,’
Africa comes right to mind,” Diamond, 59, said in an interview
that aired yesterday on public television’s “Charlie Rose”
program. “The opportunities are very good.”  Barclays has lending businesses in 11 African nations and
is among the top-three banks in nine of those, Diamond said.
Africa’s  economy expanded  by 4.7 percent last year, and may rise
to 5 percent in 2011 and 5.1 percent in 2012 on growing demand
for exports, the  United Nations  said in January.  “Most of us think, and I certainly thought before I spent
time with this, that Africa was the future and Africa was what
was coming,” said Diamond, who was London-based Barclays’s
investment-banking chief before replacing John Varley as CEO in
January. “We underestimated the economic growth that’s already
taking place in Africa and the amount of business that’s already
happening there.”  Africa’s economic expansion may be threatened by conflicts
in Libya and  Ivory Coast . The West African Monetary Union said
today that economic growth in the region this year would be
“significantly weaker” than the 4 percent it previously
forecast because of the civil war in Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
