U.K. stocks declined as a retreat
among commodity producers outweighed a gain in banks after
Portugal asked for a bailout from the European Union.  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  each slid at
least 2 percent after the companies extended a deadline for a
$9.6 billion deal to acquire Cairn’s Indian unit.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index retreated 23.13, or 0.4
percent, to 6,018 at 3:45 p.m. in London after the Bank of
England left interest rates at a record low for a 26th month.
The FTSE All-Share Index lost 0.4 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index decreased 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
