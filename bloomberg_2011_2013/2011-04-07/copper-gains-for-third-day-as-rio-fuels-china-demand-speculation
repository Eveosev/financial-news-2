Copper rose to the highest in almost
two weeks on signs that demand will outstrip mine output.  Usage in  China , the world’s biggest consumer, and other
emerging markets will gain faster than production, spurring a
global deficit, according to Rio Tinto Group. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. said this week it’s “very confident” about
Chinese demand, even as the country raises  interest rates .
Prices jumped 23 percent in the past year, touching a record in
February.  “We are having a supply issue with the metal,” said Bart
Melek, an analyst at TD Securities in Toronto. “We continue to
see Chinese authorities to be fairly benign in the way they
attack monetary policy.”  Copper futures for May delivery advanced 4.65 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $4.4165 a pound at 1:25 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , after touching $4.437, the highest since March 25.
Prices climbed to a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  Consumption may outpace output this year by as much as
500,000 metric tons,  Andrew Harding , head of Rio’s copper
business, said yesterday in an interview.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery climbed $65, or 0.7 percent, to $9,670 a ton ($4.39 a
pound).  Zinc, nickel, tin and aluminum also rose in London. Lead
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
