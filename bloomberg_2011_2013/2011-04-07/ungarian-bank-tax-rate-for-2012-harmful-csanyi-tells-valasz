Hungary ’s decision to keep a special
tax on financial institutions at an unchanged rate in 2012 is
“outright harmful,” Sandor Csanyi, chairman of OTP Bank Nyrt.
told  Heti Valasz .  Sluggish lending, partly caused by the bank levy, damages
economic growth and Hungary’s ability to use European Union
funds, Csanyi said in an interview published today.  “The country will lose more because of the tax than it
gains,” the head of Hungary’s largest lender told the weekly. A
plan to help distressed borrowers is a “fair” deal, Valasz
reported Csanyi as saying.  The arrangement would only require budget spending if the
forint doesn’t strengthen as much as expected based on the
government’s reform program, Csanyi told the publication. He
also forecast Hungary’s currency will strengthen more, supported
by “strict fiscal policy,” Valasz reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
