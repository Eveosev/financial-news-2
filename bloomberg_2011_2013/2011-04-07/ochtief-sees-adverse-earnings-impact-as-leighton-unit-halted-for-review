Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s largest
builder, dropped the most in more than 10 months in Frankfurt
trading after saying an earnings review at its  Leighton Holdings
Ltd. (LEI)  unit in Australia will reduce its forecast this year.  Hochtief fell as much as 6.05 euros, or 8 percent, to 69.95
euros in the biggest intraday decline since May 17. That pared
the stock’s gain this year to 10 percent.  The changes in Leighton’s forecast are likely to have
“significant adverse effects” on Hochtief’s 2011 results,
while the company doesn’t expect any impact on 2012 or 2013
figures, the Essen-based building company said today in a
statement. Hochtief generated 41 percent of its revenue in
 Australia  last year, up from 31 percent five years ago.  Hochtief’s business in the Asia-Pacific region, which is
mainly from Leighton, contributes the majority of the company’s
pretax profit, as growth in infrastructure and mining projects
in Australia outpaces other regions. In 2010, the region’s
contribution was 512.7 million euros ($732 million), or 68
percent of pretax profit, up from 432.9 million euros in 2009.  Leighton, 54 percent owned by Hochtief, asked for trading
in its shares to be suspended today and tomorrow in advance of
the review of a Feb. 14 forecast. The Sydney-based company said
at the time that net income in the year through June 2011 would
amount to A$480 million ($503 million) on sales of almost A$20
billion.  Project Delays  The Hochtief unit has faced delays in completing a
desalination plant in Australia’s Victoria state, poor weather
in regions where it has mining contracts and higher-than-
expected costs for building the Airport Link road in Brisbane,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Leighton intends to release details of its earnings review
before trading resumes on April 11, Hochtief said.  Hochtief has been resisting a takeover by Actividades de
Construccion y Servicios AS. The Spanish company increased its
holding to 43 percent as of March 31 and plans to top 50
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
