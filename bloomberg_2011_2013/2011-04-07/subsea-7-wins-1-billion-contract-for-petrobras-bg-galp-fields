Subsea 7 SA, formerly called Acergy
SA, won a $1 billion contract from  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to
develop the Lula and Guara fields in deep waters off Brazil.  The project involves the supply and installation of four
riser systems, which include four submerged buoys each of 1,900
metric tons to be installed at approximately 250 meters (820
feet) below sea level, Subsea said today in a  statement .  “The offshore installation is scheduled to commence in the
second half of 2012, supportive of our expectations of earnings
growth next year,” Egle Domataite, an analyst at Terra Markets
AS, wrote in an e-mail.  Petrobras, together with partners  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Repsol YPF
SA (REP)  and  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) ,  is developing  the Lula field, the
Americas’ second-largest oil discovery in more than 30 years,
and the Guara deposit in  Brazil . Acergy agreed to buy Subsea for
about $2.5 billion in June to take advantage of growing demand
for oilfield services and to bid on larger contracts.  Subsea shares rose 0.5 percent to 144 kroner in Oslo.  “We look forward to developing further our local content
facilities and expertise and build on our already strong
presence in Brazil,” Subsea Chief Executive Officer Jean Cahuzac said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
