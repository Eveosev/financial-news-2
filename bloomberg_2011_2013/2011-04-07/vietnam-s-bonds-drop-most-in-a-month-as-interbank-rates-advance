Vietnam ’s government bonds fell the
most in a month, sending the benchmark five-year yield to the
highest level in almost 11 months, as lenders’ borrowing costs
climbed. The dong was little changed.  The yield on the notes advanced eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 12 percent, the highest since May 10, 2010,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The overnight interbank deposit rate increased six
basis points to 12.95 percent, the highest since Bloomberg data
started in June 2009.  “Bond yields have to go up, following deposit and
interbank rates,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh City-
based money-market dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank.  The State Treasury failed to sell any debt in the last two
auctions on March 24 and March 31, when it offered 2 trillion
dong ($96 million) and 3 trillion dong of bonds, respectively,
according to the Hanoi Stock Exchange.  “In order for the next government bond sales to succeed,
offered rates will have to be higher,” Danh said.  The dong traded at 20,915 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,913 yesterday, according to prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,713 today,
compared with 20,708 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
