Treasury 10-year notes pared losses
as speculation eased that the  European Central Bank  will
continue to raise borrowing costs, lessening the potential
interest rate advantage of European debt.  Yields on the benchmark U.S. security earlier reached the
highest level in a month as the ECB raised the bank’s main
refinance rate for the first time in almost three years,
boosting it to 1.25 percent. Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
subsequently said policy makers didn’t decide it was the first
of a series of boosts.  “Trichet basically sent the signal out that it might be
one-and-done just to slow the rate of inflation,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading at
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York.  Benchmark 10-year note yields were little changed at 3.55
percent at 10:04 a.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. They earlier reached 3.57 percent, the most since
March 4. The price of the 3.625 percent security due in February
2021 fell 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 5/8.  The Treasury will announce at 11 a.m. it will sell $66
billion in notes and bonds next week, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.
The auctions, scheduled for April 12-14, will proceed even if a
deadlock in Congress shuts down the government, an official told
Bloomberg News on April 4.  Futures show traders don’t expect the  Federal Open Market
Committee  to boost its benchmark rate from a record-low zero to
0.25 percent until 2012.  ‘Pressure’ on Fed  “The FOMC is a ways off from tightening, although it’s
pressure for them to look at inflation,” said  Brian Edmonds ,
head of  interest rates  at primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
New York.  Policy makers are “ watching carefully” for signs oil and
commodity prices are affecting U.S. prices, Cleveland Fed
President  Sandra Pianalto  said today.  “A key to preventing this spillover is to keep long-run
inflation expectations anchored,” Pianalto said today in Rome.  U.S. 10-year note yields earlier rose as a government
report showed initial jobless claims dropped last week, fueling
optimism the economic recovery is strengthening.  Applications for jobless benefits fell 10,000 in the week
ended April 2 to 382,000, the fewest since Feb. 26, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists projected claims
would be little changed at 385,000, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of people on
unemployment benefit rolls and those collecting extended
payments decreased.  The Fed will buy $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion today in
maturities ranging from April 2015 to September 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
