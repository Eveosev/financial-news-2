Ukraine needs a “fully fledged”
market for farmland to boost the agricultural industry’s
efficiency, President  Viktor Yanukovych  said.  “Steps to introduce a regulated market of agricultural
land have to be prior and urgent,” Yanukovych told lawmakers
today during a speech to parliament in the capital, Kiev. The
president said Feb. 25 that Ukraine will allow farmland sales
next year for the first time to stimulate investment.  Ukraine currently prohibits the sale of agricultural land,
and food production companies lease plots from individual
owners. Ukraine has 41.6 million hectares (102.7 million acres)
of agricultural land, according to the Agriculture Ministry
data, of which arable land accounts for 32.48 million hectares.
About 7 million plots of land are individually owned, according
to the Ukrainian Grain Association.  The land-sales ban “hampers development of the
agricultural sector,” Yanukovych said. Efficient agriculture
needs “concentrated land ownership,” he added.  Yanukovych said lawmakers should legislate to ensure that
agricultural land is used only for farming.  Ukraine and neighboring countries would be able to increase
their agriculture production with more private investment,
according to a 2008 report by the  United Nations ’  Food and
Agriculture Organization  and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
