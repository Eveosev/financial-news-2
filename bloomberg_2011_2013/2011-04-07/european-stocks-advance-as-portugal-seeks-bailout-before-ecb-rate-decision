European stocks gained as Portugal
said it will seek a European Union bailout and before the
 European Central Bank  is forecast to raise  interest rates . U.S.
futures and Asian stocks were little changed.  Clariant AG rose 1.5 percent after saying it will launch a
rights offer to partially fund its acquisition of Sued-Chemie.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.3 percent to 282.37 as
of 8:08 a.m. in London. The benchmark has increased 7.7 percent
from this year’s low on March 16 as investors speculated that
the economic recovery will withstand Japan’s worst earthquake on
record and popular revolts in the Middle East and north Africa.
Futures contracts expiring in June on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index were little changed and the MSCI Asia Pacific advanced 0.1
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
