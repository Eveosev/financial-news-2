What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, on signs that the doubling
of prices in the past year has yet to slow demand from makers of
animal feed or ethanol, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that U.S. farmers will cut planting this
year by more than the government forecast, as they switch to
more profitable crops including corn and cotton, Gerlach said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 0.1 cent to up 0.1
cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open steady to
up $1 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange , as hot, dry weather threatens to reduce
production in the U.S., the biggest exporter, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
