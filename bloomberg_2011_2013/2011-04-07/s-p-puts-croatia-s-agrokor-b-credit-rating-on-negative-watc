Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
put Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s biggest company, on negative watch,
saying its interest in Slovenian supermarket operator Mercator
Poslovni Sistem d.d. may hurt its liquidity.  Closely held Agrokor, which owns Croatian supermarket chain
Konzum d.d., currently has a ‘B’ rating by S&P.  “The CreditWatch placement reflects the potentially
negative effect of Agrokor’s planned acquisition of a 23 percent
interest in Slovenia-based Mercator and our uncertainty about
further investments in the company,” the rating agency said
today in an emailed statement.  Agrokor is vying against Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa
Partners Ltd. for the Mercator stake offered by Pivovarna Lasko
Group d.d. Mercator on March 31 called on shareholders to form a
group to sell a majority stake in the largest publicly traded
retail chain in the Balkans.  “Agrokor’s liquidity position has improved over the past
two years, but remains weak as the company continues to depend
on rolling over its short-term debt and has limited headroom
under financial covenants,” it said.  “In our view, the company has limited financial
flexibility for acquisitions at the current rating level,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
