Shui On Construction & Materials
Ltd. plans to exit cement production, possibly by selling its
stake in venture Lafarge Shui On Cement to partner  Lafarge SA (LG) ,
the Standard said, citing Chief Executive Officer Philip Wong.  Profit at the venture dropped 80 percent last year even as
rivalsâ€™ earnings increased on rising demand, the Hong Kong-based
English-language newspaper reported today.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
