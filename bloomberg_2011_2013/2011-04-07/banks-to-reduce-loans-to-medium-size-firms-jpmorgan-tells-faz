Banks will become more reluctant to
provide financing to small and medium-size companies as Basel
III rules classify them as more risky, Klaus Diederichs, head of
European  investment banking  at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , told
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  in an interview.  Companies that are not publicly traded and have low credit
ratings will be especially regarded as risky borrowers,
Diederichs told the newspaper. Loans to medium-size firms will
therefore become disproportionately expensive and lenders will
use their capital elsewhere, FAZ cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
