Namibia  may tap South African debt
markets to raise the equivalent of as much as 2.76 billion
Namibian dollars ($411 million) in a debut international bond
issue this year, the country’s finance ministry said.  “We would prefer rand denominated bonds but must still
receive and consider proposals in this regard,” Chris Claassen,
director of asset, cash and debt management at the Windhoek-
based Finance Ministry, said in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg. The country has asked banks to propose
options for an international issue, he said.  The southern African country plans to issue a combination
of fixed-interest, inflation-linked and retail bonds as well as
treasury bills to plug a 10.1 billion Namibian dollar budget gap
this year, Finance Minister Saara Kuungongelwa-Amadhila told
investors April 5. The country plans to raise 26.4 billion
Namibian dollars over the next three years, she said.  Namibia may seek a new sovereign debt rating before the
international  bond issue , Claassen said. The country’s long-term
foreign-currency debt was rated BBB-, the lowest investment-
grade rating, by  Fitch Ratings  in 2005.  The extra yield investors pay to hold Namibia’s 13 percent
bonds maturing in 2015 over comparable South African debt was 90
basis points today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
difference was 60 basis points on Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
