India ’s clean-energy fund, which
draws on a carbon tax on coal, will provide as much as 40
percent of the total cost of projects it finances.  Both government organizations and companies are eligible to
apply for loans from the fund to set up renewable-energy
projects or use the money for research, the  Finance Ministry 
said yesterday in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
