Blue Dart Express Ltd. (BDE) , an Indian
courier company controlled by DHL Worldwide Express, is set for
the highest close since it began trading in 1994 on speculation
the parent may buy the rest of the company it doesn’t own.  The stock surged as much as 20 percent and climbed 15
percent to 1,275 rupees as of 11:31 a.m. local time. A close at
that level would be the highest price since November 1994. The
stock is the best performer on the BSE Mid-Cap Index. More than
50 times the six-month daily average volume was traded.  “We’re hearing that DHL may announce a delisting plan for
Blue Dart,” Hardik Chheda, a trader on the National Stock
Exchange, said by telephone.  DHL Express  Singapore  Pte. owns 81 percent of Blue Dart,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Two telephone calls to Anita Gupta, senior vice president
of corporate communications at DHL AsiaPacific in Singapore,
weren’t answered. Calls made to the office and mobile phone of
Belinda Tan, director of media relations, at DHL AsiaPacific,
and a text message seeking comment, were also unanswered.  Calls made to Sheba Varghese, a press contact officer at
DHL Express India, weren’t received. An e-mail seeking comment
to all the three officials was unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
