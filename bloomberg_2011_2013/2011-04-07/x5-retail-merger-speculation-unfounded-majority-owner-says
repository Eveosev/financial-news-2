X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) ’s majority
shareholder said newspaper speculation that it may seek to merge
the company with an international retailer is “unfounded.”  Billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s Alfa Group issued a statement
today denying a report in Kommersant that X5, Russia’s largest
retailer, may plan to merge with Germany’s  Metro AG. (MEO)   “Press speculation about merging X5 with international
retailers is unfounded,” Fridman said in the statement. “We
have stated many times that Alfa-Group is a long-term investor
in X5 Retail Group. We see tremendous growth potential for the
company and strongly support its focus on development in the
still immature and fragmented Russian retail market.”  X5 Chief Executive Officer Lev Khasis is due to leave the
retailer this year and be replaced by his deputy Andrei Gusev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
