Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  shut a unit at
its Catlettsburg refinery in Kentucky after a leak of hydrogen
fluoride late yesterday, according to a  filing  with the National
Response Center.  Hydrogen fluoride was released from a pinhole leak in
piping, according to the filing. The unit was shut, and workers
were isolating it and planning repairs.  “The Catlettsburg refinery experienced a small HF release
yesterday,” Shane Pochard, a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail. “There was no offsite impact and the issue is being
addressed.” He declined to disclose any more information.  Hydrogen fluoride is used as a catalyst in alkylation
units, which produce blending components to raise the octane
value of gasoline.  U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  The refinery has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
