South African stocks fell for the
first time in five days after platinum and gold decreased and
copper fluctuated, curbing mining stocks.  The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index retreated 0.2 percent
to 32,825.92 at 9:37 a.m. in Johannesburg.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , the
world’s biggest mining company, led declines, slipping 1 percent
to 275 rand, the first drop in eight days. Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd., the second-largest producer of the metal, slumped
as much as 1.3 percent while Gold Fields Ltd., Africa’s second-
biggest gold producer, lost 1 percent.  Gold declined as much as 0.3 percent on speculation that
investors are locking in gains after the price rose to a record
earlier, and as central bank efforts to combat inflation curbed
demand for precious metals. Platinum declined 1.1 percent to
$1,780.88 an ounce. Copper for three-month delivery was 0.4
percent stronger at $9,640 a metric ton after earlier falling as
much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
