African Alliance Group , a brokerage
and asset manager operating in 12 locations on the continent, is
planning to open a securities office in Lagos,  Nigeria  with up
to eight staff by year end, Chief Executive Officer Patrick O’Flaherty said.  “We will start off with securities and the idea would be
to develop into a fully fledged investment bank over time,”
Johannesburg-based O’Flaherty said in a phone interview today.
“I tend to start in a market fairly small and build it up as
time goes by. I’m certainly not someone who puts 30 people into
markets straight away.”  African Alliance was issued a license last year to operate
in  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous country, he said.
The company has been offering services in Nigeria for a number
of years through partner brokers in the west African nation,
O’Flaherty said.  The company has offices in  South Africa , Swaziland,  Kenya ,
 Ghana , Mauritius, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi,
Uganda and Rwanda. African Alliance has been operating since
1992, according to its website.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index rallied 0.6
percent to 24,746.88 by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according
to an e-mailed statement from the bourse.  Nigeria is “under-serviced” and “the biggest sub-Saharan
African market at the moment ex-South Africa,” said O’Flaherty.
African Alliance will initially “focus more on the
international client base and slowly but surely build out local
client base by putting in a strong research product into the
market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
