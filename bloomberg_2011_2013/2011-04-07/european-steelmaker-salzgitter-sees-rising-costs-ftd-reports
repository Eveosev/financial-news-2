BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  wants customers to
accept monthly, instead of quarterly, contracts for coking coal

 Salzgitter AG (SZG)  Chief Executive Officer Heinz Joerg Fuhrmann.  The change will likely mean higher costs for steelmakers,
the newspaper cited Fuhrmann as saying in an interview in a
preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
