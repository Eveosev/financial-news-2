Rubber climbed to near a one-month
high as a weakening Japanese yen improved the appeal of the
commodity used in tires and gloves, amid concern flooding in
Thailand, the world’s largest producer, may lower supply.  The September-delivery contract gained as much as 1.5
percent to 464.8 yen a kilogram ($5,444 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange before trading at 460 yen at 10:44 a.m.
local time. The most-active contract touched 466.8 yen on April
5, the highest level since March 7.  “The main factor today is the weakening yen,” Roka Komiya,
a rubber trader at Marubeni Corp., said by phone from  Singapore .
Demand for nearby contracts from Japanese and U.S. manufacturers
rose after Thailand’s southern provinces were inundated, he said.  The yen tumbled against all of its major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg on speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
expand economic stimulus as the nation recovers from its worst
earthquake on record, and on speculation the  European Central
Bank  will increase borrowing costs.  The yen weakened to as low as 85.50 a dollar, compared with
85.27 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.  Thai supply falls seasonally as farmers reduce tree-tapping
during the so-called wintering season from February to May.  Rainfall may continue to spread across southern provinces
this week, the Thai Meteorological Department said on its
 website  today. Fourteen provinces in the south represent about
80 percent of the country’s rubber output.  Flooding in 10 southern Thai provinces has killed 51 people
and affected 2 million, the Department of Disaster Prevention &
Mitigation said in a  statement  on its website. About 50,000 rai
(19,641 acres) of rubber plantations have been damaged. Flooding
has eased and the government is rebuilding infrastructure in
three flooded provinces, it said.  The physical price of Thai rubber surged 3 percent to 180
baht ($5.96) a kilogram on April 5 amid damage to plantations
from floods, lowering production, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand .  Rubber for September delivery gained for a second day,
rising as much as 0.9 percent to 36,245 yuan ($5,539) a ton on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
