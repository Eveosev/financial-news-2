Bulgaria ’s central bank Governor
Ivan Iskrov proposed to parliament giving Dimitar Kostov another
six-year term as deputy governor, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  Kostov, 57, oversees the banking department, which acts as
lender of last resort in the case of systemic risk. His term in
office ends on June 11, according to the central bank  website .  Bulgaria has run a currency board system since 1997, which
pegs the lev to the euro and requires foreign exchange reserves
to cover all lev in circulation. Foreign-exchange reserves stood
at the equivalent of 23.9 billion lev ($17.5 billion).  Lenders based in other EU countries control 85 percent of
banking assets in the Balkan nation. The five biggest banks are
UniCredit Bulbank; DSK Bank, a unit of OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s
largest bank; United Bulgarian Bank, owned by  National Bank of
Greece SA (ETE) ; Raiffeisenbank Bulgaria and Eurobank EFG Bulgaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
