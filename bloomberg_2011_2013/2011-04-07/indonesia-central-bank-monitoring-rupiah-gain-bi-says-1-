Indonesia ’s rupiah may continue
recent gains, and the  central bank  is monitoring its
appreciation, Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told
reporters at a conference in Bali today.  “We need to monitor the speed of the rupiah’s gain,”
Nasution said. “We do many things to curb strengthening of the
rupiah but we don’t specify the level.”  The rupiah fell 0.29 percent to 8,678 per dollar as of 1:26
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupiah has advanced 3.6 percent this year.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy rose
6.65 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with a
6.84 percent gain in February, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said in Jakarta on April 1.  Indonesia’s  core inflation  may not rise significantly, due
to the rupiah’s gain, Nasution said. Core inflation accelerated
to 4.45 percent in March from 4.36 percent in February, the
country’s Central Bureau of Statistics said April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
