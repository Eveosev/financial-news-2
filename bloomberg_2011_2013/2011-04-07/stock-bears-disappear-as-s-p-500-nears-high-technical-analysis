The biggest first-quarter rally by
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 1998 has driven
bearishness down to levels that warrant caution on U.S. stocks,
according to analysts who uses charts to predict markets.  The proportion of pessimistic newsletter writers in
 Investors Intelligence’s  latest weekly survey dropped to 15.7
percent, close to the 15.6 percent reading in December 2009 that
was the lowest since April 1987. The figure fell from 23.1
percent, the biggest drop since 1993. Optimistic newsletters
amounted to 57.3 percent. The ratio of bullish-to-bearish
publications of 3.65-to-1 was the largest since June 2003.  “That’s a warning flag,” said  Edward Yardeni , president
of Yardeni Research Inc., who founded his own firm in Great
Neck,  New York , after working for Prudential Securities and
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. “That means a lot of
investors are already in the market. The  bull market  is more
sustainable when everyone is bearish and pessimistic.”  To some investors who view sentiment as a contrarian
indicator, less pessimism suggests the S&P 500 is at risk of
falling because investors may be close to running out of cash to
buy more shares. The benchmark measure of U.S. equities has
surged 97 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009, including a
5.4 percent gain in the first quarter, after the government
introduced measures to spur economic growth and corporate
earnings beat analysts’ estimate for eight straight quarters.  32-Month High  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent 1,335.54 yesterday, meaning it
needs to climb 0.6 percent to surpass its 32-month high of
1,343.01 on Feb. 18.  Newsletter writers predicting a correction, or 10 percent
decline in stocks, increased to 27 percent from 25.3 percent
during the week ended April 5, according to Investors
Intelligence, which has run the survey since the 1960s.  Investors such as  John Carey  at Pioneer Investments said
bullish sentiment by itself isn’t a reason to sell stocks. The
highest bull-bear ratio in the past two decades, 3.74, occurred
in June 2003, three months into a bull market that continued for
another four years.  “You’re not in a minority any longer if you’re bullish and
everybody else is bullish,” said Carey, a Boston-based money
manager at Pioneer, which oversees about $250 billion. “While
it might be something to think about, I wouldn’t necessarily act
on that. You can have a prolonged period of general bullishness
just as you can have a prolonged period of general
bearishness.”  Individuals  Individual investors are becoming more bullish, too. The
 American Association  of Individual Investors’ latest weekly
survey showed 41.8 percent of the respondents were optimistic,
up from 37.8 percent the previous week. Bears dropped to 31
percent from 35 percent.  Retail investors are returning to stocks after shunning
equities in favor of bonds during most of the bull market. U.S.
equity funds attracted about $12 billion of inflows since
December, compared with $134 billion of redemptions during the
previous six quarters, according to  Investment Company Institute 
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 32 percent drop in the proportion of bearish advisers
marked the 16th time since 1975 that bearish sentiment
experienced a weekly decline of more than 30 percent, according
to  Bespoke Investment Group LLC . In the previous 15 occasions,
while the  S&P 500  rose 0.8 percent on average in the next three
months, the gain trailed the average three-month return of 2.3
percent for all periods since 1975, Bespoke data show.  “Once the public sentiment shifts so far, it means
everybody is in the pool,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of
Harrison, New York-based Bespoke. “It takes time to digest
those gains before the market can continue to rally.”  While the absence of bears may not spell the end to the
bull market, it does add to evidence that the market is due for
a pullback, said Dan Wantrobski, the Philadelphia-based director
of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.  “I don’t think we’re at a sentiment level that can induce
a major top,” Wantrobski said. “It’s probably an argument for
a healthy correction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
