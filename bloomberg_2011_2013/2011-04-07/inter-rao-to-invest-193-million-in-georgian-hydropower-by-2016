OAO Inter RAO UES, a Russian state-
controlled utility, will invest $193 million by 2016 to develop
hydropower projects in  Georgia  after agreeing to buy existing
plants for $104 million, said Energy Minister Alexandre Khetaguri.  Inter RAO plans to build at least three plants with total
capacity of 100 megawatts in the Black Sea country, Khetaguri
said today in comments broadcast on Rustavi 2 television.  Moscow-based Inter RAO invests about $15 million in Georgia
a year, Yuri Pimonov, head of the Telasi electricity utility,
said in an interview last year. Inter RAO holds 75 percent of
Telasi, according to the Georgian company’s website.  Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri said in an interview
in December that he’s “confident” the country will receive as
much as $5 billion in investments in hydropower over “the next
few years” after signing 42 preliminary deals with foreign
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
