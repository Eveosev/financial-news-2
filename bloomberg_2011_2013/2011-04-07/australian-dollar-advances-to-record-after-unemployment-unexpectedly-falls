The Australian dollar rose to the
strongest since it started trading freely in 1983 after a
government report showed the unemployment rate unexpectedly
fell.  The currency reached $1.0476 and traded at $1.0469 as of
11:34 a.m. in Sydney, from $1.0428 before the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
