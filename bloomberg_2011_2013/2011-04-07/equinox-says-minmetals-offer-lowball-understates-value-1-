Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , subject of an
unsolicited C$6.04 billion ($6.3 billion) offer from  China ’s
 Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) , said the proposal is “opportunistic”
and aimed to thwart Equinox’s bid for  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN)   The C$7 a share offer was a “lowball price” and
“understates our value and disregards the potential of this
company, especially in light of the continuing strength in
copper prices,” Peter Tomsett, chairman of Perth-based Equinox,
said yesterday in a statement.  The planned deal, China’s biggest minerals takeover, would
give Hong Kong-based Minmetals control of the Lumwana mine in
Zambia and Saudi Arabia’s biggest copper deposit. Miners are
competing to secure assets after a dearth of new projects and
demand from China drove copper prices to a record this year.  Minmetals’ offer for Equinox, whose share price fell after
bidding C$4.8 billion in cash and shares last month to buy
Canada’s Lundin, represented a “nominal” premium of about 9
percent to Equinox’s 20-day volume weighted average share price
on the Toronto stock exchange before the Lundin offer, Equinox
Chief Executive Officer  Craig Williams  said in the statement.  “Such a low premium is a fraction of premiums paid in
recent acquisitions of base metal mining companies,” he said.  A vote on the proposal by Minmetals shareholders isn’t
expected until sometime in June, Equinox said in the statement.  Equinox fell 0.5 percent to C$7.50 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading yesterday in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
