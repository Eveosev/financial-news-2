Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  said it is
in talks with regulators about four warrants that were suspended
from  Hong Kong  trading last week because of a misprinted
settlement formula, and details will be announced “as soon as
possible.”  Four warrants linked to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average Index
were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on March 31. The
formula for the cash settlement amount per board lot for
European-style  put  and call warrants due Sept. 9 and Dec. 9 was
wrong in the listing and announcement documents, Goldman Sachs
said on March 31.  According to the original  document , the formula for
calculating the cash settlement included multiplying by the
 exchange rate . In the  amendment , the formula is calculated by
dividing by the exchange rate.  Trading in the warrants will continue to be suspended until
further notice, Goldman said in a statement to the exchange
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
