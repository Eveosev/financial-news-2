The rupiah touched the strongest
level in almost four years on speculation slowing inflation is
boosting the appeal of the nation’s assets.  Consumer prices in  Indonesia  may continue to ease because
of the current rice harvest, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor
Hartadi Sarwono said yesterday. Global funds bought $106 million
more of the country’s stocks than they sold this month through
yesterday, exchange data show. Overseas investors increased
holdings of government debt to 213.4 trillion rupiah ($24.7
billion) as of April 5, from 211.6 trillion at the end of last
month, according to finance ministry data.  “With the harvesting season and softer commodity prices,
inflation concern has diminished,” said Wiwig Santoso, head of
treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta. “The
better economic data has resulted in foreigners purchasing
Indonesian assets including the currency, bonds and stocks.”  The rupiah was unchanged at 8,653 against the dollar as of
9:06 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,645 earlier, the strongest level since May 2007.
The currency has rallied 3.7 percent this year  Consumer prices rose 6.65 percent last month from a year
earlier, after a gain of 6.84 percent in February, according to
official data released April 1. The economy may expand 6.6
percent in the first quarter, compared with an earlier forecast
of 6.4 percent, Sarwono said last month. The main rice harvest
in Indonesia runs from March through May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
