Abengoa SA (ABG) ,  Spain ’s largest solar-
thermal developer, reiterated an earnings target for 2013 and
said it expects no new corporate debt sales this year.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will rise to 1.5 billion euros ($2.15 billion) in
that year from 942 million euros last year, the Seville-based
company said today in an investor  presentation .  The 1.5 billion-euro Ebitda target represents a compounded
annual growth of 17 percent in the three years through 2013,
compared with a 43 percent rate in the previous three-year
period, as engineering and construction contribute less to
income, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Abengoa, which competes with  Germany ’s Solar Millennium AG,
is branching out further from its traditional businesses into
biofuels, desalination and solar-thermal plants, which can store
heat to generate power after sunset, unlike most photovoltaic
systems.  This year Ebitda will increase in “low double digits,”
the company forecast. The shares were little changed at 22.93
euros at 4:26 p.m. in  Madrid .  The company’s shares have gained about 25 percent this
year, beating the 16 percent advance of the 37-member Bloomberg
Global Leaders Solar Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
