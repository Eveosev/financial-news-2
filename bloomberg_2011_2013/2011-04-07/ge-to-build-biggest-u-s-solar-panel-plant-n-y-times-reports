General Electric plans to disclose 
today a project to build the biggest solar panel plant in the

president for the company’s renewable energy business.  The plant’s location hasn’t yet been decided, the newspaper

thin-film photovoltaic panels made from cadmium telluride that
would generate 400 megawatts energy as of 2013, the newspaper
