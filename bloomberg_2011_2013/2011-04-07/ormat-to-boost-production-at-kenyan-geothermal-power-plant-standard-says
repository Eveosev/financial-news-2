Ormat Techologies Inc. plans to
increase output at its Olkaria III geothermal-power facility in
 Kenya  to 84 megawatts from 48 megawatts, the Standard reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki.  A new plant is being built next to the companyâ€™s existing
facility at Olkaria, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of the
capital, Nairobi, the newspaper said.  Orpower 4 Inc., a subsidiary of Ormat, yesterday signed a
power-purchase agreement with Kenya Power & Lighting Co. that
includes an option to increase combined output to 100 megawatts
in future, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
