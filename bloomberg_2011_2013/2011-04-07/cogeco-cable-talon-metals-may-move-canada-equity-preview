Canadian stocks fell the most in a
month, led by energy producers, after the  International Monetary
Fund  cut its growth forecast for the U.S. and oil and metals
prices dropped.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, lost 3.6 percent as
crude retreated from a 30-month high.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ,
 Canada ’s third-biggest gold producer, decreased 3.3 percent as
the metal dropped for the first time in six days.  First Quantum
Minerals Ltd. (FM) , the country’s second-largest publicly traded
copper producer, slumped 3.7 percent as that metal fell.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index lost 211.57
points, or 1.5 percent, the most since March 10, to 13,996.86.  “Oil is at a pretty high price given the global growth
outlook,” said Murray Leith, who helps manage about C$6.5
billion ($6.8 billion) as a money manager at Odlum Brown Ltd. in
 Vancouver . “You’ve got to expect pullback. There’s fiscal drag
now around the world as new stimulus just fades away.”  Coming into this week, the S&P/TSX had gained four straight
weeks, the longest streak since October. Over that time, oil
surged 12 percent while gold stocks rallied 7.4 percent as the
conflict in  Libya  intensified and the  U.S. dollar  dropped to a
16-month low against a basket of world currencies.  Higher  oil prices  will limit U.S. economic growth to 2.8
percent this year, the IMF said in a report today. The
organization had earlier forecast 3 percent growth.  Crude declined 2.5 percent in  New York , the most since
March 15. The S&P/TSX Energy Index tumbled 2.3 percent, the most
in eight months.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
lost 2.6 percent to C$43.51. Canadian Natural decreased 3.6
percent to C$45.56.  Encana Corp. (ECA) , the country’s biggest natural
gas producer, slumped 3.3 percent to C$31.85.  Cease-Fire  Gold fell from a record after the  African Union  said Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  agreed to a cease-fire. All 33 gold
companies in the S&P/TSX declined.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, dropped 2.7 percent to C$50.66. Kinross slipped 3.3
percent to C$15.37.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest
gold-mining company by market value, lost 2.1 percent to
C$51.06.  Silver Wheaton  Silver reseller  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  decreased 6.1 percent
to C$42.18 as that metal retreated in electronic trading after
the close of floor trading in New York.  First Majestic Silver
Corp. (FR) , which mines in  Mexico , sank 8.1 percent to C$21.64.  Copper dropped for the first time in a week on concern
 China  might raise  interest rates . The country, the world’s
largest consumer of industrial metals, reported faster growth in
exports and imports than most economists had forecast.  First Quantum declined 3.7 percent to C$131.67.  Teck
Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal producer,
lost 2 percent to C$53.83. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is
developing a copper and gold mine in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto
Group, decreased 2.2 percent to C$26.38.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, retreated 1.6 percent to
C$54.72 after the Fertiliser Association of India said that
country does not need to import potash for the monsoon season.
The shares have fallen for five-straight days.  Lumber producer  TimberWest Forest Corp. (TWF-U)  soared a record 19
percent to C$6.46 after agreeing to be bought by British
Columbia Investment Management Corp. and the federal Public
Sector Pension Investment Board. The funds will pay C$6.48 in
cash for each so-called stapled unit.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which makes natural-gas engines,
plunged 13 percent to C$22.45 after Ann Duignan, an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., began coverage of the company with a
“neutral” rating. The shares had jumped 21 percent this month
through April 8 on speculation the U.S. government will provide
incentives for vehicles fueled by natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
