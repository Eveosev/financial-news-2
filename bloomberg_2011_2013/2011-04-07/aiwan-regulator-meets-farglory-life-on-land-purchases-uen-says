Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory
Commission has asked Farglory Life Insurance Co. to have a
meeting on the insurer’s land purchases, the United Evening News
reported, citing Huang Tien-mu, director-generator at the
insurance bureau under the commission.  The insurer and affiliate Farglory Land Development Co.
last month won bids to buy land in New Taipei City for
NT$12.3 billion, according to the newspaper. Hsu Hsiu-yi, a
spokeswoman for Farglory Life, didn’t answer two calls to her
mobile phones for comments.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
