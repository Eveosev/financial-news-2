Mauritius’s annual inflation rate
rose to 7.2 percent in March, the highest in more than two
years, on increased transport and food prices, the  Central
Statistics Office  said.  Inflation quickened from 6.8 percent a month earlier and
prices advanced 0.6 percent in the month, the Port Louis-based
data agency said in a statement on its website today.  “On this trend, annual inflation might range between 9 to
10 percent by the end of June, which is a matter of concern,”
Vishal Ragoobur, a senior economist at the Ebene-based Mauritius
Employers’ Federation, said by phone.  The central bank and government will work together to
contain inflation, Bank of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said on March 29. The benchmark interest rate was
increased by half a percentage point to 5.25 percent on March 28
and Bheenick warned more effort may be needed to “normalize”
rates. Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth announced a day later
that the tax on fuel would fall to allow for a cut in gasoline
and diesel costs.  “Such measures, including price controls on basic
commodities, will slow down inflation, not reverse the trend,”
Ragoobur said. “Being a net importer of food and fuel,
Mauritius has limited leeway” to contain rising prices, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
