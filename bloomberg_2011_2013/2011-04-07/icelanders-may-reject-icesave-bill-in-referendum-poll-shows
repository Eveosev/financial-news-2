A majority of Icelanders will block
an accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands on depositor
guarantees, a Capacent Gallup poll published by RUV  showed .  The poll showed 52 percent of voters will reject the bill
in the April 9 referendum, compared to 54.8 percent in a
 Frettabladid  newspaper poll published earlier today. Forty-eight
percent of voters will support the pact on April 9, Capacent’s
poll showed, compared to 45.2 percent of voters in the
Frettabladid poll.  Capacent polled 1,900 people on March 31 through April 7.
Of those polled, 59 percent responded. No margin of error was
provided.  The April 9 plebiscite will decide whether the north
Atlantic island’s government can ratify an agreement with the
U.K. and the Netherlands that compensates depositors from the
two countries for losses stemming from the 2008 failure of
Landsbanki Islands hf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
