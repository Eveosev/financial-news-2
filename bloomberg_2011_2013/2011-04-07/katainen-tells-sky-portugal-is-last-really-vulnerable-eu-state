Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen told Sky News in an interview  Portugal  is the last
“really vulnerable” European country.  Spain  has “done a good
job” in introducing measures to tackle its fiscal crisis and
has “regained” the confidence of the markets, Katainen said.  He said he believes the situation “will become calmer,”
and is “quite optimistic” about Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
