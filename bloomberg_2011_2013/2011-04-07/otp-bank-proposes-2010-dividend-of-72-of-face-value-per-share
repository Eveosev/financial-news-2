OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, said it proposes to pay a dividend of 72 percent of face
value per share from 2010 earnings.  The lender will distribute dividends to shareholders after
allocating those due on treasury shares held by the bank, OTP
said in a statement posted on the Budapest Stock Exchange’s
 website  today.  OTP, which has subsidiaries in nine countries in central
and eastern  Europe , is resuming dividend payments after a three-
year break, as the financial crises forced it to increase
provisions for bad loans. The bank reported consolidated net
income of 118 billion forint ($639 million) in 2010.  The bank’s shares surged 5.2 percent to 6,258 forint, the
highest level since last May, in Budapest yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
