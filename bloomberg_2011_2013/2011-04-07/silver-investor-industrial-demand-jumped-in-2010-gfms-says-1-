Silver demand climbed 15 percent to
the highest level in at least 20 years in 2010 as investment
jumped to a record and industrial usage rebounded from a five-
year low, researcher  GFMS Ltd . said.  Total demand climbed to 1,06 billion ounces as world
investment surged 40 percent to 279.3 million ounces, GFMS said
in a report published by the Washington-based  Silver Institute .
Industrial consumption gained 21 percent to 487.4 million ounces
and is “seeing pronounced advances” this year, GFMS said.
Prices may climb to $50 an ounce by the end of the year, GFMS
analyst Philip Newman said by e-mail today, indicating a 27
percent increase.  Silver climbed to a 31-year high of $39.7625 an ounce in
London yesterday. Prices more than doubled the past year as
concerns about rising inflation, debasement of currencies and
European debt boosted demand for precious metals, while the
metal also benefited from its use in industry. Silver is used in
solar panels, plasma screens and chemical catalysts.  “ Monetary policy  is unlikely to be tightened that much in
2011 and inflation and sovereign debt concerns will most
probably grow further,” London-based GFMS said in the report.
“This will encourage investment demand for silver. Additional
support should also flow through from solid gains in industrial
demand.”  Silver Forecast  Prices averaged $20.24 last year, compared with $14.70 in
2009, and reached a record $50.35 in  New York  in January 1980.
The metal for immediate delivery traded at $39.665 by 3 p.m. in
London today.  GFMS’s forecast for $50 is based in part on the “strong
probability” that gold will climb above $1,600 an ounce,
according to a GFMS presentation in New York. Gold last traded
at $1,463.30 in  London .  Coin and medal purchases gained 28 percent to an all-time
high of 101.3 million ounces, GFMS said. Silver held in
exchange-traded products climbed 21 percent the past year and
reached a record 494.98 million ounces on April 4, data compiled
by Bloomberg from four providers show.  Jewelry purchases increased 5.1 percent to a five-year high
of 167 million ounces, helping push total fabrication demand to
a 10-year high of 878.8 million ounces, GFMS said. Photographic
usage declined 8.3 percent to 72.7 million ounces, the smallest
drop in six years, as medical users deferred conversions to
digital systems, GFMS said.  Silver Outperforms  Silver has outperformed gold’s 27 percent gain the past
year, and beat platinum’s 4.5 percent increase and palladium’s
53 percent surge. Silver’s surplus, defined by the difference
between supply and fabrication demand, narrowed 12 percent last
year to 173.4 million ounces, GFMS said.  “We are conscious of the fact that a fair proportion of
the recent investment in silver is from more speculative money
that could exit the market rapidly if conditions were to
change,” GFMS said. “We would be wary of any signs that
industrial demand is faltering as this could be a trigger for a
major short-term correction.”  Mine output rose 2.5 percent to a record 735.9 million
ounces, as  Mexico  surpassed  Peru  as the biggest producer, the
researcher said. Primary silver mining cash costs were little
changed at $5.27 an ounce in 2010, it said. Scrap supplies
climbed 14 percent to a record 215 million ounces, the first
increase in four years, as prices gained, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
