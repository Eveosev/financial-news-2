Omen International Ltd., the second-
highest bidder for Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd. last year,
asked for more time to revalidate offer for the state-owned
company,  ThisDay  said, citing a letter from Omen to the asset-
sale agency.  Omen International called for an extension until after a
new government is inaugurated on May 29, the Lagos-based
newspaper said.  Nigeria ’s privatization agency invited Omen International
to confirm its bid on March 14 after the New Generation Group
was unable to meet payments on its winning bid for the phone
company. Omen International had bid $956 million for Nitel, as
the company is known, in February 2010, behind New Generation
Group’s $2.5 billion offer, ThisDay reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
