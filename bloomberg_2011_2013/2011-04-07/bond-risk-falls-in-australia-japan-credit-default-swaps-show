The cost of protecting bonds from
non-payment declined in Australia and  Japan , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1 basis point to 137
basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG. The benchmark hit a nine-month high of 147 basis points
on March 16, according to data provider CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 102
basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 102.5 basis points
as of 8:32 a.m. in Singapore, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
