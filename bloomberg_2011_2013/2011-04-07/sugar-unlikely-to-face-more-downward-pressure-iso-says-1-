Sugar prices are unlikely to
experience further “significant bearish” pressure before
supplies from the 2011-12 harvest reach the market, according to
the  International Sugar Organization .  Prices for the sweetener fell 8.5 percent in  London  and 16
percent in New York in the first quarter on better-than-expected
production from  Thailand , the world’s second-largest exporter,
and additional exports from  India , the second-largest grower.  “A ‘neutral’ world balance -- neatly balanced world
production and consumption as well as export availability and
import demand -- in a low stock environment is unlikely to put
significant additional bearish pressure on prices before the
arrival of 2011-12 sugar to the market,” the ISO said in a
monthly report.  The chances that prices will repeat the pattern seen last
year, when they more than halved in about three months, are
“small,” the ISO said. Sugar fell from 30.40 cents a pound on
Feb. 1, 2010, in  New York  to the year-low of 13 cents a pound on
May 7, data on Bloomberg show.  Output in Thailand this season reached 7.778 million metric
tons as of March 23, up 13 percent from the previous year,
according to the report. “Four months ago the official sugar
production forecast did not exceed 6.8 million tons,” the ISO
said. India allowed additional exports of 500,000 tons of sugar
last month, “another factor with a distinctive bearish
flavor,” the organization added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
