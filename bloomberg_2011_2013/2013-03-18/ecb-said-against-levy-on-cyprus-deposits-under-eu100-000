The  European Central Bank  opposed
taxing Cypriot savings accounts under 100,000 euros ($129,450),
a person familiar with the discussions said.  The structure of an unprecedented proposal to take 6.75
percent from every savings account under 100,000 euros to lower
the cost of the Mediterranean island’s bailout was designed by
Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the Cypriot finance
ministry, said the person, who asked not to be named as the
discussions are not public. The agreement was announced on March
16 after all-night talks.  ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said in Berlin
today that the Frankfurt-based central bank had “not insisted”
on the structure of the levy. The Cypriot government can decide
to change the design of the levy as long as the planned amount
of 5.8 billion euros is raised, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
