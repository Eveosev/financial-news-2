The yield on Philippine 25-year
bonds dropped to the lowest level in at least a decade on
speculation investors are switching to debt after a cut in
interest rates on the central bank’s special-deposit accounts.  Policy makers lowered the rate on those accounts for a
second time this year on March 14 to 2.5 percent from 3 percent
to deter currency speculators. Funds in the deposits amounted to
1.86 trillion pesos ($45.7 billion) as of Feb. 22, official data
show. The peso has strengthened 5.8 percent in the past year,
the best performance in  emerging markets .  “Yields are dropping after the SDA rate cut,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the
equivalent of $18 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in Manila.
“Liquidity is driving market players to just continue buying
bonds.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent securities due October 2037
slid 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 4.42 percent,
according to noon fixing prices from Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. That was the lowest level for a benchmark 25-year
note since Bloomberg started compiling the data in November 2000.  The government will probably increase domestic debt sales
next quarter after the central bank lowered borrowing costs,
Treasurer Rosalia de Leon said on March 15. The  Philippines  will
sell 25 billion pesos of 2033 bonds tomorrow.  The Treasury will boost debt auctions to 50 billion pesos
per month in the second quarter, de Leon said in a memo to
dealers today. Each offering will be 30 billion pesos of bonds
maturing in three, five and seven years, and 20 billion pesos of
bills, she said. Monthly debt sales this quarter included 25
billion pesos of bonds and 15 billion pesos of bills.  Philippine fixed-income securities returned 8.3 percent in
2013, the most among 10 Asian indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings
Plc ahead of a 2.8 percent gain in  India .  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 40.715 per dollar in
 Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, increased 13 basis points to 3.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
