Credit rating companies are falling
short of standards set by European Union, the bloc’s chief
markets regulator said.  The regulator highlighted failings in the “process of
disclosure and implementation of changes” to the methodology
used to rate the creditworthiness of  Europe ’s banks, the Paris-
based European Securities and Markets Authority said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Considering the continued importance of credit ratings in
financial markets it is extremely important that  credit rating
agencies  identify and remedy those issues in their businesses
which may undermine the independence, objectivity and the
quality of credit ratings,” Steven Maijoor, ESMA’s chairman
said in the statement.  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings registered with ESMA in 2011, becoming directly
supervised by a single EU regulator for the first time. The U.S.
 Justice Department  last month filed a civil complaint accusing
McGraw-Hill Cos.’s and its S&P unit of three types of fraud, the
first federal case against a ratings company for grades related
to the 2008 financial crisis.  ESMA focused its review on the links between bank and
sovereign credit ratings and found that for one or more of the
credit ratings companies, “the information used for certain
rating actions referred to significantly outdated data,”
according to the regulator.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
