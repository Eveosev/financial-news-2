AngloGold Ashanti  Ltd., the world’s
third-largest producer of the metal, said a  power failure  that
cut electricity supply to some of its South African operations
will reduce first-quarter output and raise costs.  A fire at the Midas substation near Carletonville, west of
Johannesburg, left AngloGold’s Mponeng and Tau Tona mines idle
from March 13 to March 15, the company said in a statement.  “The total adverse impact from this incident on first-
quarter 2013 gold production is likely to be in the region of
20,000 ounces, with consequential impact on unit costs,”
Johannesburg-based AngloGold said today.  Mines that account for more than 20 percent of  South
Africa ’s gold output, including Sibanye Gold Ltd.’s Driefontein
mining complex, were idled after the blaze at the substation,
owned by the country’s state-run power utility Eskom Holdings
SOC Ltd., cut supply to parts of two provinces.  The company is building the world’s third- and fourth-
largest coal-fired  power plants  as part of plans to overcome an
electricity deficit that halted factories and mines for five
days in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
