The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away
an appeal by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in an investor lawsuit
over mortgage-backed securities whose value plummeted during the
2008 financial crisis.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that partially backed the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare
Fund, which is pressing the case.  At issue was whether NECA, which bought certificates from
two of 17 disputed Goldman Sachs trusts, had legal “standing”
to sue on behalf of investors in the other 15 offerings.  The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
NECA’s claims were similar to those stemming from five other
offerings, all of which contained loans made by a  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  unit and GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. The appeals court
said NECA had standing to press those claims, though not any
claims concerning the other 10 trusts.  The standing issue is separate from the question of class
action status, which the lower courts haven’t yet considered.  The case is Goldman Sachs v. NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare
Fund, 12-528.  To contact the reporter on this story:
