Comments questioning  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL Pipeline Project by members of the federal
opposition New Democratic Party are “dangerously dogmatic,”
Alberta Premier Alison Redford said today.  NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said last week that while he
wouldn’t have made Keystone a priority, it’s up to the U.S. to
make a decision in its own interest, in an interview at
Bloomberg’s  New York  headquarters. Mulcair also spoke to
congressional leaders about the project and gave a speech in
Washington.   Having Mulcair “undermine the months of good work by
premiers of every persuasion, along with the federal government,
industry and trade unions, quite simply, is a fundamental
betrayal of Canada’s long-term economic interests,” Redford
said in the prepared text of a speech she’s giving today in
Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
