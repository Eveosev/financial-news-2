Gibraltar ’s Financial Services
Minister Gilbert Licudi said the U.K. territory on the Iberian
peninsula is a better place for Latin American funds to tap
European investors than Dublin or Luxembourg.  “This trip is to develop a Latin American strategy,”
Licudi said at an event in Rio de Janeiro. “We see ourselves as
an EU alternative to Dublin and Luxembourg. We are very flexible
and malleable and can introduce legislation quickly.”  Gibraltar, which has a corporate tax rate of 10 percent,
grew 6.5 percent last year, Licudi said. The territory has about
100 funds that have access to the European Union’s population of
500 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
