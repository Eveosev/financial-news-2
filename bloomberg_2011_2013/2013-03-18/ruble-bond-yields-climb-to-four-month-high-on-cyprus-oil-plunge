The ruble fell the most in two
weeks against the central bank’s target basket and government
bond yields reached the highest since November as a levy on
Cyprus’s bank savings threatened to throw  Europe  back into
crisis.  Russian companies and individuals have $31 billion of
deposits in Cyprus, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Oil
in New York tumbled from a three-week high after euro-area
finance ministers in the reached an agreement on March 16
forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share in the cost of the
latest bailout. The oil and gas industry provides about 50
percent of  Russia ’s budget revenue.  “At least at the initial stage ruble assets are more
likely to suffer because they are more sensitive to global risk
sentiment, rather than because of exposure to Cyprus,” Vladimir Kolychev, head of research at  Societe Generale (GLE) ’s SA Moscow-based
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit, said by e-mail.  The Russian currency weakened 0.3 percent against the
central bank’s target basket of dollars and euros to 34.9743 by
3:03 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on OFZ bonds due February 2027
increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.51
percent, the highest level since Nov. 20.  Oil dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $92.14 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
ruble dropped as much as 0.9 percent against the dollar to
30.9185 before trading at 30.8695, heading for the lowest
closing level since Dec. 17.  Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the penalty
imposed on Cyprus bank deposits, saying at a government meeting
today that the decision “if it is adopted, will be unfair,
unprofessional and dangerous,” according to a statement posted
on the Kremlin website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
