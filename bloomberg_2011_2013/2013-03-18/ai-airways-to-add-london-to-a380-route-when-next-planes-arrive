Thai Airways  International Pcl said
it plans to operate the Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo to  London ’s
Heathrow airport following delivery of its fifth and sixth
aircraft later this year.  Thai can’t be more specific about when the A380 will serve
Europe’s busiest air hub because delivery dates from Airbus
aren’t certain, U.K. and Ireland General Manager Khun Wit
Kitchathorn said in an interview yesterday in London.  The A380s will substitute for one of two services provided
by  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-400s that will return to the London route this
month after a year’s gap for refurbishment, he said. The 747’s
cargo flexibility makes retention of one service desirable, with
the jumbo regularly carrying outsize items such as Porsche and
Ferrari sports cars that the Airbus would struggle to handle.  “Frequencies are the most important thing, and from that
point of view I’d rather have three 747s serving London,”
Kitchathorn said. “But the A380 is also a prestige aircraft so
we’d welcome it of course.”  Thai’s next A380s are slated to arrive in October or
November, Serena Kelly, its deputy sales manager, said in London
at an event to publicize the  747 refurbishment , reiterating that
the timings aren’t definite.  More Frequencies  Thai will reintroduce the Boeing jets to London from March
31, returning capacity on the route to almost 750 seats a day
from 534 during a year of operations by Airbus A340-600s. Two
planes are required to provide a single frequency because of the
distance involved. A 747-A380 combination could seat 881 people.  London might even be able to support four daily frequencies
if the aircraft deployed including smaller Boeing 777 planes,
Kitchathorn said. A service to Manchester is another option.  Two daily flights to London split between an A380 and 747
would match Thai’s service to  Frankfurt , the main focus for the
carrier’s European transfer traffic via the network of Star
Alliance partner  Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA)  Thai’s first two A380s
were deployed to provide the German service.  The Bangkok-based carrier will also operate a daily A380
service to Paris using its third and fourth A380s from the end
of this month. The service is being cut from 10 frequencies a
week because of the greater number of seats available on the
double-decker superjumbo.  Thai’s Southeast Asian rivals  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and
 Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)  already fly the A380 to London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
