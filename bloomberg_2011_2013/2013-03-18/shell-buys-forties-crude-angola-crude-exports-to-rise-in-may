Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which
chartered supertankers to load  North Sea  crude from Hound Point
in the U.K. in mid-March and early April, bought two Forties
cargoes as the price of the benchmark grade rose to the highest
in more than two weeks.  Angola,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will raise
exports in May to the most in nine months, according to a
preliminary loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  North Sea  Shell purchased Forties lot F0406 from Vitol Group for
loading April 8 to April 10 at 10 cents less Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That’s the highest since March 1,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  It also bought consignment F0321 from BP Plc at 40 cents a
barrel less than Dated Brent for loading March 30 to April 1,
the survey showed. That’s 15 cents less than a trade for the
same cargo in the previous session.  The company booked the very large crude carrier Al Salmi to
load on March 15 and Abqaiq on April 1 from Hound Point to  South
Korea , according to a shipbroker report on March 6.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 21 cents to a discount of 28 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the smallest discount since March 7.  Brent for May settlement traded at $109 a barrel on the ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the window,
compared with $109.78 in the previous session. The June contract
was at $108.51, a discount of 49 cents to May.  The Oseberg field resumed production after a gas leak
resulted in a three-day halt, operator  Statoil ASA (STL)  said in a
statement on its website.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total SA failed to buy Russian Urals crude at a discount of
$1.35 a barrel to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,
 Italy , the Platts survey showed. That’s the least since Feb. 15,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 6 cents to $1.60 a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the smallest differential since Feb. 22.
In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.88 a barrel,
compared with $1.85 in the previous session.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 2 cents to $3.29
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest since Feb. 28.  Angola  will ship 59 cargoes of crude in May compared with
55 lots next month. Exports will increase to 56.74 million
barrels,or 1.83 million barrels a day, the plan shows. That
compares with 52.9 million barrels, or 1.76 million barrels a
day, in April, according to a separate schedule. The West
African nation loaded 1.831 million barrels in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
