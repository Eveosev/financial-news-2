Egypt’s wheat harvest may be 9.48
million metric tons this season, the Middle East  News Agency 
reported, citing Egyptian Agriculture Minister Abdel Momen.  Total area planted with wheat was 3.46 million feddans, the
state-run agency Mena said. Egypt needs at least 9 million tons
of wheat a year for subsidized bread, which sells for 5 piasters
each, Abdel Monem said. There are 100 piasters in one Egyptian
pound (15 U.S. cents).  To contact the reporter on this story:
