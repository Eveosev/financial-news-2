European Union PresidentHerman Van Rompuy said the  euro  is out of danger and called the 27-nation
EU “still sexy” as policy makers negotiated the final touches
of a bailout package for Cyprus.  “The euro is no longer in danger, but the work is not over
yet -- not at all,” Van Rompuy said in an online video response
to questions recorded on March 8 and posted on the Internet
today.  The euro declined as much as 1.5 percent against the U.S.
dollar today as the proposed imposition of an unprecedented bank
tax in Cyprus threatened to disrupt the nation’s bailout and
renewed concerns about other debt-strapped euro countries. The
euro traded at $1.2969, at 6:12 p.m. in Brussels, down 0.8
percent on the day.  Van Rompuy  said the euro isn’t to blame for imbalances
facing individual countries that have required difficult budget
choices and austerity policies.  “Don’t forget that  Europe  is not responsible for the
deficits and debts created in the  member states ,” he said.
“These faults had to be corrected in any way, with or without
the euro area and with or without the euro.”  When asked whether the EU would continue to expand, he said
Croatia would soon be a full-fledged member state and other
countries also want to join.  “Many countries in Europe still want to join us, so the
European Union is still sexy, if I can say so,” Van Rompuy
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
