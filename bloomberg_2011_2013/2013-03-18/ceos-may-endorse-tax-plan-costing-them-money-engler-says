Some U.S. chief executive officers
may ultimately support a rewrite of the corporate tax system
though it would cost their companies money, said John Engler,
president of the Business Roundtable, a Washington group that
represents CEOs.  A revenue-neutral overhaul of the U.S. tax code, as the
group seeks, would mean that some companies would win and others
would lose.  “To get this done, you’re really going to have to think
about what’s the better system for the country,” Engler, a
former Republican governor of  Michigan , told reporters today.  He spoke as the Business Roundtable announced a national
media campaign to build support for overhauling the corporate
income tax system. The group, whose members include executives
from  Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) ,  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET) ,
wants Congress to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent
from 35 percent and eliminate most taxes on U.S. companies’
foreign income.  Paying for that rate reduction would require eliminating or
curtailing corporate tax breaks. Once the details become clear
and companies can calculate the potential effects, coalitions
may fracture.  “Most things are on the table for conversation,” Engler
said.  That “fairly dramatic simplification” would have broader
economic benefits, Engler said, even for companies that lose
some tax breaks as part of what he called a “short-term
dislocation.”  Lawmakers in both parties have endorsed the idea of a
revenue-neutral corporate tax overhaul although they haven’t
discussed details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
