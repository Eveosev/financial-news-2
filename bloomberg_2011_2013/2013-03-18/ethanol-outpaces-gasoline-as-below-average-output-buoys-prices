Ethanol outpaced gasoline on
speculation that low production rates will stem price declines,
tightening its discount to the motor fuel to the lowest level in
more than two weeks.  The price difference, or spread, narrowed 3.69 cents to
49.79 cents a gallon. Production averaged 797,000 barrels a day
in the week ended March 8, according to the Energy Information
Administration, down 11 percent from a year earlier and the
lowest level for this time of year in records begun in June
2010.  “Production in the biofuel markets isn’t rebounding as
much as we thought,” said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity
analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 0.2 cent to
settle at $2.631 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
have gained 20 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery declined 3.49 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $3.1289 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Companies reduced output after production costs soared
because drought in the Midwest baked crops and reduced yields.  Corn for May delivery advanced 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.20 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
3 cents a gallon, unchanged from March 15. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  That compares to minus 35 cents a gallon as recently as
Dec. 31.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, has resumed output at its plant in Bloomingburg,  Ohio ,
because returns have improved and plans to restart operations at
its Linden, Indiana, mill “in the next couple of weeks,”  Bill
Day , a company spokesman said in a March 15 telephone interview.  Stockpiles of the biofuel slid a for record sixth straight
week to 18.7 million barrels, the least since Nov. 23 and 15
percent below a year earlier, data from the Energy Department’s
analytical arm showed.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, down from 94 percent the
previous week, EIA data show.  No Imports  The U.S. didn’t  import  any of the fuel for a second week,
the first time that’s happened since June, the March 13 EIA
report showed.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.37 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 1.5 cents to
$2.755 a gallon in  New York , 1.5 cents to $2.645 in Chicago, 1
cent to $2.70 a gallon on the  Gulf Coast  and 0.5 cent to $2.865
on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed to
16.5 cents from 17 cents. Chicago’s discount to New York was
unchanged at 11 cents.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
that refiners submit to the Environmental Protection Agency to
show compliance with the U.S. biofuels law, for the  corn-based
ethanol variety  rose 1.5 cents, or 2 percent, to 77 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Advanced RINs jumped 2 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 83 cents.
Both grades of the certificates reached record on March 8.  The supply of the corn-based RIN could be depleted by the
middle of next year if gasoline demand remains stagnant and the
U.S. mandate calls for higher amounts of biofuel to be used, Sam
Margolin, an analyst at Cowen Securities LLC in New York wrote
in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
