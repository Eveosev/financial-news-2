Lucara Diamond Corp. (LUC) , a Canadian
gem miner with assets in southern  Africa , jumped the most in
five months after reporting the finding a  239.2-carat stone  from
its Karowe mine in  Botswana .  The shares  rose  9.3 percent to 59 Canadian cents in
Toronto, the biggest gain since Oct. 10.  The stone measures about 5 centimeters (2 inches) by 2.5
centimeters by 1.5 centimeters, Vancouver-based Lucara’s Chief
Executive Officer William Lamb said today by phone. That’s
roughly the size of a household 9-volt battery. Large diamonds
are valuable because of their rarity, Lamb said.  “There will always be a market for it because people who
have way more money than we have are looking for things which
are exceptional and that nobody else is going to have,” he
said. Lamb said it’s too early to speculate on what it may be
worth.  The diamond may sell for $10 million to $15 million, Edward Sterck, a London-based analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said
today in a note. Sterck says his estimate assumes the diamond is
similar in quality to a 236-carat stone discovered by De Beers.
A 101.7-carat gem cut from that rough diamond is due to be
auctioned by Christie’s International.  The stone will be analyzed and valued before Lucara sells
the rough stone, probably as part of its tender that closes May
13. The proceeds of the sale will give Lucara more flexibility
in its operations, Lamb said.  Lucara recovered two other large stones from Kurowe, one
weighing 124 carats and the other 71.1 carats. The three
diamonds may yield total revenue of about $12.5 million based on
conservative estimates, resulting in a boost of about 50 percent
to Lucara’s estimated 2013  earnings , BMO’s Sterck said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
