China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , the country’s biggest developer by market value listed in
Hong Kong, said 2012 profit climbed 21 percent on gains from
property revaluations and the sales of stakes in some projects.  Net income  rose to HK$18.7 billion ($2.4 billion), or
HK$2.29 a share, from a restated HK$15.5 billion, or $HK1.89 a
share, a year earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing today. That compares with the HK$16.9 billion
average  estimate  of three analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News. Sales rose 26 percent to HK$64.6 billion.  The state-owned developer benefited from focusing on so-
called first-tier cities, which include Beijing and  Shanghai , as
home prices rebounded in the second half after  interest rates 
eased. Prices in Beijing rose 5.9 percent last month from a year
ago, the biggest gain since February 2011, while those in
Shanghai jumped 3.4 percent, a government data today showed.  The Hong Kong-traded stock  fell 2.1 percent to HK$21.10 at
the close of trading, after the earnings were announced during
the midday break. That extends its losses this year to 8.7
percent, compared with a 6.3 percent decline in the  Hang Seng
Property Index (HSP) , which tracks the nine-biggest Hong Kong-listed
builders, including  China  Overseas.  Toughest Curbs  China on March 1 imposed its toughest curbs in a year,
ordering the central bank to raise down-payment requirements and
interest rates for second mortgages in cities with excessive
price gains. It also enforced a property sales tax and told
local governments with the biggest price pressures to tighten
home-purchase limits.  China’s new  home prices  posted the broadest advance since
December 2011, with 62 out of 70 cities the government tracked
in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said today.  China Overseas, which  builds  homes and offices in 34 cities
in the mainland, said operating profit from its property
development business in China rose 17 percent to HK$21.6 billion,
accounting for 80 percent of the group’s total profit.  Profit excluding revaluations, or core profit, increased 21
percent to HK$15.8 billion from 2011, China Overseas said.  The developer’s contracted sales rose 49 percent in the
first two months of this year from the same period in 2011 to
HK$25.5 billion, it said in an e-mailed statement on March 8.
 Hong Kong  and Chinese developers begin selling properties while
they’re still in construction and book profit upon completion.  Selling Properties  The company targets to sell no less than HK$100 billion
worth of properties this year, Chairman Kong Qingping said at a
briefing in Hong Kong today. It will build projects in three or
four cities for the first time this year, he said.  The company sold a total of HK$111.5 billion worth of
properties during 2012, up 28 percent from a year earlier, it
said today. That compared with the 30 percent growth in 2011.  It bought 20 parcels of land with a total gross floor area
of 6.6 million square meters (71 million square feet) during the
year, it said.  China Overseas said it will pay a final  dividend  of 24 Hong
Kong cents per share, more than the 20 Hong Kong cents a year
earlier.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
