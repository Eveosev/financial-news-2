Berkeley Group Holdings Plc, (BKG)  the
U.K.’s third-largest homebuilder by market value, acquired three
sites in southeast England since November to gain from a
shortage of supply.  The purchase of sites in the  London  neighborhoods of
Finchley and Mill Hill and in the town of Maidenhead will help
Berkeley achieve a target of increasing its land by 10 percent
in fiscal 2013, the company said in a statement today.  “The market for new homes in London and the Southeast is
still characterized by a shortage of supply at all price levels,
albeit that this market is affected by the drag on demand caused
by restrictions of mortgage availability and increased
regulation,” Berkeley said in the statement.  The housing market in Southeast  England  escaped the worst
effects of the housing market collapse during the global
recession in 2008. The biggest U.K. homebuilders are competing
to acquire land in the region, where mortgage lending is less
constrained and they can sell homes at higher prices.  Berkeley said it was on course to return 568 million pounds
($857 million) to shareholders by Sept. 30, 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
