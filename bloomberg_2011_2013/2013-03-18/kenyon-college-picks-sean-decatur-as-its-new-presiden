Kenyon College, the liberal arts
school in Gambier, Ohio, named Sean Decatur, dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences at Oberlin College, as its next president,
effective July 1.  Decatur, 44, will replace  S. Georgia Nugent , a Classics
scholar who is stepping down after a decade at the helm, Kenyon
said today in a statement.  Decatur, who will be Kenyon’s first black president, has
spent most of his career at liberal arts schools, including
positions as an associate dean, department chair and professor
of chemistry at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.  “All evidence points to a liberal arts education as being
a successful platform for a full range of careers and that we
graduate students who think critically, who communicate well,
and who can solve problems,” Decatur said in the statement.  He holds a bachelor’s degree from Swarthmore College and a
doctorate in biophysical chemistry from Stanford University.  Kenyon, founded in 1824, has a student body of about 1,600.
Its endowment was valued at  $185 million  as of June 2012,
according to Commonfund and the National Association of College
and University Business Officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
