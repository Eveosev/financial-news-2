Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
largest brokerage, eliminated three foreign exchange trading
jobs in Dubai as the firm seeks to reduce costs by about $1
billion, said a person briefed on the plan.  The traders left the bank last week, the person said, 
asking not to be identified because the matter hasn’t been 
made public. A spokeswoman for Nomura in  London , who asked 
not to be named citing corporate policy, declined to comment.  Nomura is seeking to pare costs after it bought Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s European and Asian units in 2008. The
bank is overhauling its operations to make all overseas
businesses profitable by the year ending March 2015, Chief
Executive Officer Koji Nagai said in December.  The cuts come after the bank trimmed staff at a business
that allows foreigners to invest in Saudi Arabia’s equities
market, a person familiar with the matter said. John Phizackerley, chief executive officer for Europe,  Africa  and 
the  Middle East , is also said to have left the bank this month.  The stock dropped 2.9 percent in Tokyo trading yesterday,
bringing a gain this year to 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
