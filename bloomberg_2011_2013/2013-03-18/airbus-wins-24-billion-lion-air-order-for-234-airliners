PT Lion Mentari Airlines ordered
234 planes from Airbus SAS, its second order of more than 200
aircraft in two years, as  Indonesia ’s biggest budget carrier
expands its fleet to meet rising travel demand.  The order is the third major commitment for A320s in recent
weeks, Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said yesterday.  Lion Mentari Air, which serves more than 36 destinations,
is establishing a low-cost carrier in Malaysia to challenge
 AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , Airbus’s biggest A320 customer. The carrier, which
ordered 230  Boeing Co. (BA)  planes last year, needs aircraft as it
adds flights in a region where  air travel  is expected to grow
more than 6.4 percent annually through 2031.  Lion Air already has 700 planes on order and expects to
have ordered 1,000 planes within “two to three years,”
President Rusdi Kirana said yesterday.  Airbus said it may boost production rates for the single-
aisle jetliners beyond 42 a month following the order, which
includes 60 current-generation A320s, 109 A320neos and 65
A321neos worth about $24 billion at list prices.  “It’s getting tight for deliveries,”Leahy said in an
interview yesterday. “I have only a handful of delivery slots
left for 2019. We’re looking at whether we can increase the
rate.”  Airbus had held off on plans to accelerate output because
of concerns about suppliers keeping up, he said.  Leahy said no firm decisions will be required for two years
or so, and that Airbus would prefer to accelerate output after
the ramp-up to all-Neo production from late 2015 through 2017.  Budget Airlines  Leahy declined to comment on pricing for the Lion order
yesterday. Customers typically buy planes at discounts. The
order pushes the carrier into the ranks of the top five A320
operators, after AirAsia,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , India’s IndiGo
and EasyJet Plc.  More than a dozen budget airlines began operations in Asia-
Pacific in the past 15 years as economic growth in China, India
and  Southeast Asia  enables more people to fly for the first time.
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  started Scoot and Tiger Airways Ltd. and
 Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  started Jetstar Airways Pty.  AirAsia has grown into Asia’s biggest discount airline since
its takeover by  Tony Fernandes  and partners in 2001. The carrier,
based in Sepang, Malaysia, has since set up ventures in the
Philippines, Japan, Thailand, India and Indonesia.  In 2011, AirAsia ordered 200 Airbus A320neo aircraft valued
at $18 billion in the biggest order for the planemaker.  Lion vs AirAsia  Discount carriers have secured about a quarter of the
region’s air travel market in the past decade. The region will
account for 33 percent of global passengers in 2016, according
to the  International Air Transport Association , and HSBC
Holdings Plc has said four out of five airports in Asia are
operating at or above their designated capacity.  Lion Air started operations from Indonesia in 2000 with one
aircraft, according to the airline’s website. The airline was
the launch customer for Boeing’s 737-900ER, it said.  Lion Air-backed Malindo Airways will sell tickets at prices
matching “or maybe lower” than AirAsia’s, Kirana, Lion Air’s
founder, said last year. Malindo will draw its fleet from
aircraft ordered by Lion Air Group, including 787s for possible
Europe flights, Kirana said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
