The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell, halting two days of gains, after an unprecedented
levy on Cypriot banks raised concern a new round in  Europe ’s
debt crisis will damp demand for higher-yielding assets.  Australia ’s currency touched a one-week low against the yen
and local bonds rallied after Cypriot President Nicos
Anastasiades bowed to demands by euro-area finance ministers to
raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) by taking a piece of
every bank account in Cyprus. Losses in the so-called Aussie
were limited before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia releases
minutes of its latest meeting tomorrow.  “Aussie, kiwi opened this week’s trade quite a bit
lower,” said Peter Dragicevich, a Sydney-based currency
economist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s
largest lender. “Whilst there are no direct linkages between
Australia, New Zealand and Cyprus, the currencies are reacting
to changes in  market sentiment . There could be some fears in the
market that if another sovereign required a bailout, they may
tax the deposits of that particular country as well.”  The Australian currency fell 0.5 percent to $1.0358 as of
4:19 p.m. in Sydney from March 15, when it touched $1.0415, the
highest since Feb. 5. It dropped 1.1 percent to 98.06 yen, after
earlier touching 97.06, the lowest since March 7.  The New Zealand dollar weakened 0.4 percent to 82.37 U.S.
cents. The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, touched 77.01 yen, the
lowest since March 5, before trading at 77.96, down 1.1 percent
from last week.  Australia’s  three-year bond  yield fell 18 basis points, or
0.18 percentage point, to 2.94 percent. The 10-year yield
declined 16 basis points to 3.47 percent. New Zealand’s 10-year
rate slid nine basis points to 3.71 percent.  Cyprus Turmoil  While Cyprus accounts for less than half a percent of the
17-nation euro economy, the raid on bank accounts risks
triggering new convulsions in the financial crisis that began in
2009 in  Greece .  The development in Cyprus is credit negative for depositors
across Europe, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report today.
Implications for sovereign creditors are more finely balanced
and less clear, the company said.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.2 percent on March
15. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.8 percent today.  In Australia, new vehicle sales held steady in February
from the previous month, when they fell a revised 2.2 percent,
the government statistics agency said in Sydney today.  RBA Minutes  The RBA will release tomorrow minutes of its March 5
meeting when policy makers left the developed world’s highest
 benchmark interest rate  unchanged.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see an 81 percent chance the central bank will refrain from
cutting the benchmark rate at the next meeting on April 2.  “It will be more of the offshore development that will
drive the Aussie this week,” said Commonwealth Bank’s
Dragicevich. “Regardless, we can’t see any reason why the
Aussie will break out of its recent trading range. We’ve seen it
struggle above $1.04, but find solid support when it gets below
$1.03.”  In New Zealand, an  index  of household sentiment fell to
110.8 in the first quarter from 111.1 in the previous three-
month period,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and McDermott Miller Ltd.
said in an e-mailed statement today.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a flowing rate, fell 3 1/2 basis points to 2.84 percent,
after earlier touching 2.81 percent, the lowest since Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
