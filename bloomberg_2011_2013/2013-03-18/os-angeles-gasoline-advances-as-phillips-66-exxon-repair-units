The premium for spot gasoline in
 Los Angeles  gained against futures as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
Torrance refinery reported repairs on a unit and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  was
said to shut equipment to fix a leak.  Exxon’s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery in  Southern
California  is scheduled to flare gases through March 20 related
to unit maintenance after a mechanical upset last week, Gesuina Paras, a company spokeswoman in Torrance, said by e-mail today.
The work isn’t expected to affect production, she said.  Phillips 66’s 139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles plant was
said to shut an isomerization unit today after discovering a
leak, a person with direct knowledge of the work said. The unit,
which makes unleaded gasoline components, may remain down until
tomorrow for line repairs, the person said.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
strengthened 1.5 cents to 10.5 cents a gallon under futures

the fuel dropped 1.99 cents to $3.0239 a gallon.  The same fuel in San Francisco gained 3.5 cents against
Nymex gasoline futures to a discount of 11 cents.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said last week that the crude unit at its
Richmond refinery, Northern California’s largest, is expected to
be back in operation in the second quarter. The 240,000-barrel-
a-day plant had planned to restart the equipment, shut since an
Aug. 6 fire, by the end of March.  Valero Benicia  A hydrocracker at  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s 170,000-barrel-a-
day Benicia refinery in Northern California has also been shut
since March 10 for repairs on a hydrogen plant.  The  spread  between  San Francisco  and Los Angeles Carbob
narrowed 2 cents to 0.5 cent a gallon. San Francisco
strengthened to a premium against Los Angeles last week for the
first time in more than five months.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles rose a
second day against Nymex heating oil futures, increasing 1 cent
to a premium of 8 cents a gallon, a one-week high. In San
Francisco, the fuel gained a third day against futures,
advancing 0.5 cent to a premium of 13.5 cents a gallon.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  low-sulfur diesel  fell by 0.5 cent to

straight decline. Conventional, 84-octane gasoline in Portland

19 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
