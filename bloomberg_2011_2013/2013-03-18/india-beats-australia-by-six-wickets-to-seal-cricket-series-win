India  beat  Australia  by six wickets
in the third cricket Test to go 3-0 up in their best-of-four
contest and regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.  Virat Kohli top scored with 34 and home captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed three straight boundaries to help guide
India past the victory target of 133 with 15 balls to spare on
day five in Mohali. Australia was earlier dismissed for 223 in
its second innings.  India will now seek to avenge its 4-0 sweep of losses in
Australia in 2011-12 by winning the final Test, which starts
March 22 in Delhi. The Australians have lost six straight elite
five-day matches in India.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
