Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the nation’s fifth-largest lender, paid Chief Executive Officer
Gerald McCaughey C$9.24 million ($9.04 million) in compensation
last year, down 7.6 percent from 2011.  McCaughey received a salary of C$1.5 million, a C$2.94
million cash bonus and C$4.8 million in shares, stock options
and long-term incentives, Toronto-based CIBC said today in a
filing. That compared with C$10 million in compensation in 2011.
The amounts exclude pension costs.  Under McCaughey, the bank posted record profit of C$3.3
billion for the year ended Oct. 31, a 14 percent increase from
the prior year, according to financial statements. CIBC is the
fifth of the country’s six biggest banks to report 2012
compensation for its top executives.  CIBC also awarded Richard Nesbitt, group head of wholesale,
international, and technology and operations C$7.14 million,
down 7.5 percent from 2011. David Williamson, group head of
retail and business banking, was awarded C$3.95 million, up from
C$3.45 million in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
