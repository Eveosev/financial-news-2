Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. (SBGI) , a
television broadcaster, is seeking $1 billion in loans to
refinance debt, the company said today in statement distributed
by PR Newswire.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the transaction, according
to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the deal is private. The financing includes a
$500 million  term loan  A expiring in April 2018, a $400 million
term loan B that comes due in April 2020 and a $100 million
revolving line of credit that will mature in April 2018,
according to the statement.  Proceeds of the loan will refinance debt and support the
acquisitions of Barrington Broadcasting Group and certain Cox
Media Group stations, according to  Hunt Valley , Maryland-based
Sinclair.  The company is also selling $600 million of bonds that will
expire in 2021, proceeds of which will be used to pay down debt
under Sinclair’s loan pact, the company said in a separate
statement.  Sinclair had $2.27 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, it said
in a March 12 regulatory filing.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . A term loan A is sold mainly to banks. In a
revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
