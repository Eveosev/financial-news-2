German commuter and high-speed rail
services are suffering delays and cancellations as  Deutsche Bahn 
AG is affected by warning strikes organized by a labor union for
6.5 percent more pay.  Deutsche Bahn has cancelled 15 long-distance trains today
because of the strike and commuter services are affected almost
everywhere on the network, Juergen Kornmann, a Deutsche Bahn
spokesman, said by telephone. Deutsche Bahn called the action
“excessive´´ in a statement.  Members of tthe Eisenbahn- und Verkehrsgewerkschaft union
walked out from 3 a.m. to 8 a.m. in almost all German states.
That caused the cancellation of a high-speed service from
Frankfurt to Paris and halted service between the eastern German
cities of Leipzig, Erfurt and Chemnitz, the union said on its
website. Signal towers, shop floors and other sites were
affected, the union said. Deutsche Bahn said the strike also
affected cargo operations.  Deutsche Bahn and  EVG  are negotiating pay rises for 130,000
employees. Deutsch Bahn has offered raises of 2.4 percent for
this year and 2 percent next year, plus one-time payments and
higher pension benefits. EVG said the increases don’t cover all
employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
