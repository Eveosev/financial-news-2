Morgans Hotel Group Co.’s (MHGC)  largest
shareholder said it is seeking to overhaul the board, aiming to
return the company to profitability or have it pursue strategic
alternatives. The stock rose the most in 16 months.  OTK Associates, the owner of 4.5 million Morgans shares, or
a 13.9 percent stake, plans to nominate seven directors to the
boutique-hotel operator’s board, the investor said in a
statement today. The current board has “engaged in a number of
self-serving” deals and “questionable employment decisions,”
the company said.  “OTK has observed as various management teams and board
members squandered resources and failed to capitalize on the
extraordinary brand value of the company,” OTK said in a letter
to shareholders, included in the statement. “The board has
allowed management to pursue a litany of transactions that have
destroyed significant equity capital and collectively generated
negative returns to stockholders.”  Morgans, based in  New York , has reported losses for every
quarter since 2007, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares have fallen 56 percent in the past five years, compared
with a 2 percent decline in the Bloomberg U.S. Lodging Index.  The stock gained 11 percent today to $5.67, the biggest
increase since Oct. 27, 2011.  A telephone message left with Rich Szymanski, chief
financial officer of Morgans, wasn’t returned. The company
operates properties such as the Mondrian in  Los Angeles  and the
Delano South Beach in  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
