Canadian  stocks  dropped for the
first time in three days after an unprecedented levy on Cypriot
bank deposits threatened to worsen Europe’s debt crisis and hurt
raw-materials demand.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
retreated at least 1.2 percent as the oil fell from a three-week
high. Teck Resources Ltd. and  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) 
declined more than 1.2 percent after copper slid to a four-month
low. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. retreated 2.1 percent
after employees of Israel Chemicals Ltd. went on strike to
protest a possible takeover by the Canadian company.  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  gained 2.3 percent as gold rallied.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 29.53
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,800.50 at 10:15 a.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX has risen 2.7 percent this year.  European policy makers demanded Cyprus, a Mediterranean
island nation, raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.6 billion) through a
bank tax in order to secure 10 billion euros in rescue loans.
The move sparked concern the euro-region’s debt crisis is
intensifying. Global markets slumped, as the  MSCI World Index (MXWO) 
fell 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
