Euro-area exports increased in
January, led by Germany and  Italy , adding to signs that the
currency bloc is beginning to emerge from a recession.  Exports rose a seasonally adjusted 2 percent from December,
when they decreased 2 percent, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. Imports increased 3.1 percent
and the  trade surplus  narrowed to 9 billion euros ($11.7
billion) from 10.3 billion euros in the previous month.  The euro-area economy has  contracted  for five straight
quarters and is forecast to shrink 0.1 percent in the first
three months of 2013 before returning to growth, the median of
24 economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows. The
 European Central Bank  forecasts the economy will contract 0.5
percent this year.  While Europe’s common currency has weakened 1.8 percent
against the dollar this year, it’s up from a two-year low of
$1.2043 on July 24. That was just days before ECB President
 Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever it takes to preserve the
currency union. The European currency traded at $1.2962 at 10:35
a.m. in Brussels, down 0.9 percent on the day.  German exports increased 3.3 percent in January from a
month earlier, today’s report showed. Shipments from France
declined 0.8 percent, while Italian exports were up 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
