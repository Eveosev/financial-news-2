Gasoline and heating oil sank along
with crude oil as the euro slid on concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis may worsen after a levy on Cyprus bank savings.  Gasoline futures tumbled as much as 2 percent and heating
oil fell as much as 1.6 percent as the euro lost the most since
December 2011 against the dollar after the euro area forced
depositors in Cyprus to share in the cost of the country’s
bailout. A stronger dollar reduces the investment appeal of
commodities.  “I’m pegging this decline all toward the dollar because
this Cyprus issue seems to have pushed the dollar up and the
euro down,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for April delivery fell 4.19 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.1219 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 39 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day. The contract is for
reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB.  The April  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
oil narrowed 52 cents to $38.91 a barrel. The May  spread  against
Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe Exchange fell 20 cents to
$22.29.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades bowed to demands by
regional finance ministers to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.48
billion) by imposing losses on depositors in the island’s banks.  “There’s concern that the crisis in Cypress would have a
ripple effect throughout other countries in Europe and we’re
seeing a selloff in equities and commodities,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for April delivery declined 3.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.904 a gallon on volume that was 41 percent below
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1 cent to
$3.685 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 15.3
cents below a year ago and have dropped 10.1 cents from the
year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
