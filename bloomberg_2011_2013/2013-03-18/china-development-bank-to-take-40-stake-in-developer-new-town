China  Development Bank 
International Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy 40 percent of  China
New Town Development Co. (1278) , a land infrastructure developer.  The unit of the world’s largest policy lender signed a non-
binding agreement to subscribe for 3 billion shares in the
company at 24.6 Hong Kong cents each, China New Town Development
said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. The
stake of controlling shareholder SRE Investment Holding Ltd.
will fall to 20 percent from 33 percent, according to the
statement.  China Development Bank International could make the company
more competitive by combining the bank’s financial background
and network with China New Town’s experience and management
team, the statement said.  The stock, which also trades in  Singapore , was  listed  in
Hong Kong in October 2010. The shares fell 2.5 percent to 79
Hong Kong cents today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
