European money managers including
 Valartis Asset Management  and LGT Capital Management said they
dropped Russian brokerages including  Alfa Bank  and  Renaissance
Capital  as counterparties, citing the increased risk of doing
business with non-state companies operating in Cyprus.  “I will stop trading with brokers using Cyprus trading
hubs until the dust settles,”  Tim McCarthy , who oversees more
than $1 billion of assets in  Russia  and other  emerging markets 
at Valartis in Geneva, said in e-mailed comments.  Finance ministers in the euro area reached an agreement on
March 16 that will impose a tax on depositors in Cypriot banks,
which are estimated by Moody’s Investors Service to have held
about $31 billion in Russian funds as of the end of last year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin today called the proposal
“unfair, unprofessional and dangerous.”  RenCap said accounts with its Cypriot unit are “entirely
unaffected” by the plan because all client funds are held
outside the country, according to an e-mailed statement. Leonid Ignat, a spokesman for Alfa, didn’t answer repeated calls to his
mobile phone for comment. Both companies are based in Moscow.  Though the levy is aimed at  savings accounts , Russian
brokers operating in Cyprus are being affected by perceived
contagion risk, according to Simon Knight, general manager of
the Nicosia, Cyprus-based unit of Ukraine’s Dragon Capital.  “Some investors are looking at the sovereign risk and are
concerned, even if the investment firms are not affected by the
levy,” said Knight, who previously set up an offshore brokerage
in Cyprus for Gazprombank.  ‘Reputational Damage’  He said some brokerages may shift money to  London  or move
to another low-tax jurisdiction, such as Malta.  President Nicos Anastasiades is trying to persuade Cypriot
lawmakers to back the tax on savings accounts as part of a 10
billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout aimed at preventing a
financial collapse and a possible departure from the euro area.
A vote on the bill was delayed for a second day today.  “Independent managers with significant footprint in Cyprus
have been removed from our counterparty list, such as RenCap and
Alfa,” Egon Vavrek, who helps manage $200 million at LGT
Capital Management, said in e-mailed comments. LGT, which
oversees about $40 billion, is owned by LGT Bank AG, which is
based in  Liechtenstein .  Sergey Dergachev, who helps manage $8.5 billion of
emerging-market assets at Union Investment Privatfonds in
 Frankfurt , said he’s “temporarily” suspending dealing with
Russian counterparties that have Cyprus-based operations.  “The big problem is reputational damage and change in
investor perception for Russian brokers,” Dergachev said in e-
mailed comments. “On that front, material aggravation has
already occurred.”  Biggest Risks  State-controlled VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest bank,
appears to be the “most exposed” to risks in Cyprus because
its local unit manages about $13.8 billion of assets, Moody’s
said. Other Russian brokerages with Cypriot units include
Sberbank Investment Banking and Gazprombank, both state-
controlled, Otkritie Capital, part-owned by VTB, as well as Aton
Capital and BCS Financial Group.  BCS Financial said on its website that it won’t be affected
by the levy, as it doesn’t keep its own money or client money in
Cypriot banks. VTB Capital’s press service in Moscow said it was
“monitoring the situation in Cyprus.” Peter Westin, chief
strategist at Aton in Moscow, said he hadn’t received any
feedback from clients.  UralSib Financial Corp. said cash balances held on behalf
of clients with its Cypriot unit, NKB Investments Ltd., are
“entirely ring-fenced and will not be impacted in any way by
the proposed deposit tax.”  “Trading with NKB as a counterparty will not be
affected,” director John Lewin wrote in an emailed statement.
