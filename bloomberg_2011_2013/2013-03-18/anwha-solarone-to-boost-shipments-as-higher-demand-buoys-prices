Hanwha SolarOne Co. (HSOL) , a Chinese
solar-panel producer, expects to increase shipments as much as
81 percent this year as higher demand in  South Africa  and Japan
bolsters prices.  Hanwha SolarOne plans to ship 1,300 megawatts to 1,500
megawatts in 2013, compared with 829.8 megawatts last year, the
Qidong-based manufacturer said today in a statement. Demand is
also rising in the U.S., the  Middle East  and at home, it said.  An increase in deliveries may help buoy revenue at Hanwha
SolarOne, which posted a wider full-year loss today. Government-
backed solar programs in Japan and South Africa are set to boost
demand for panels after a glut eroded prices the past two years,
tipping manufacturers including Solyndra LLC into bankruptcy and
leading China’s  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  to default on bonds.  “Industry prices seem to have stabilized,” Ki-Joon Hong,
chief executive officer of Hanwha SolarOne, said in the
statement. “Profitability will remain challenging for most if
not all of 2013, but we feel confident that we are making good
progress on the return to a path of profitability.”  The company, which expects to ship at least 300 megawatts
in the first quarter, plans capital expenditures of $50 million
for this year and has no immediate plans to add production
capacity. Its net loss widened to 1.56 billion  yuan  ($251
million) last year from 930 million yuan, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
