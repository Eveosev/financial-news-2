Pier Luigi Bersani, who commands
the most seats in  Italy ’s parliament, presented new lawmakers
with a conflicts-of-interest proposal as he looks beyond  Silvio Berlusconi  to build support for a government.  “Let’s bring morality back to politics,” Bersani’s
 Democratic Party  said today in an e-mailed statement. The party,
known as the PD in Italy, is seeking to limit the business
activities of government leaders and strengthen laws that curb
the ability of convicted criminals to run for office.  Bersani is pushing forward with his campaign promises even
as he lacks the majority needed in Italy’s Senate to pass laws.
The conflicts proposal showed the PD continuing to spurn
Berlusconi’s offer of support and reaching out instead to Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement.  Berlusconi, a billionaire media magnate, was convicted in
two criminal trials in the past six months and faces a verdict
in a Milan case where he’s charged with paying for sex with a
minor and abusing the power of his office. Berlusconi was
sentenced to four years in prison in October for  tax fraud  and
one year this month in a wire-tapping case. He has denied all
charges and remains free pending appeal.  Bersani’s plans include a proposal to bar the election of
anyone convicted of crimes including abuse of office when the
appeals process has been exhausted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
