Syria ’s main political opposition
is meeting in Istanbul to form an interim government that will
administer areas inside Syria held by rebels fighting to
overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.  Nine candidates, including a former minister of
agriculture, are vying for the post of prime minister, Arabiya
television reported. The establishment of an alternative
government was included in the agreement that led to the
formation of the opposition Syrian National Coalition in Qatar’s
capital, Doha, in November.  The pro-Assad Al Watan newspaper said the coalition is
“detached from reality and developments on the ground.”  Peaceful anti-Assad protests that began in 2011 have
developed into a civil war that has killed at least 70,000
people, according to the United Nations. Attempts by the U.S.,
 France  and Britain to force Security Council action against
Assad have been stymied by Russia and  China .  To contact the reporters on this story:
