Affiliates of  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN) , the world’s largest publicly traded commodity
supplier, entered into sales contracts last year with entities
controlled by Iran, according to Century Aluminum Corp.  Non-U.S. affiliates of Glencore, Century’s largest
shareholder, entered into sales contracts for wheat and coal and
sale and purchase contracts for metals and metal oxides,
Monterey, California-based Century said today in filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “All transactions were conducted in compliance with
applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary
prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities,”
Century said in the filing.  Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore, declined to comment on the filing.  Century was spun off from Glencore in 1996. Glencore owned
47 percent of Century as of Dec. 31, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
