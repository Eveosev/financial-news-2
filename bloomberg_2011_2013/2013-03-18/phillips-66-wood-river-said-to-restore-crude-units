Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River refinery
in Illinois returned a crude unit to full rates after completing
planned work, a person familiar with the turnaround said.  The refinery’s  120,000-barrel-a-day crude distillation
unit, which had been shut, is running at capacity, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public. A 150,000-barrel-a-day unit is operating at 50
percent of capacity and will return to full rates in the next
seven days, the person said.  A third unit, which can process about 60,000 barrels of
crude a day, is at capacity. Work is planned on that unit for
six days in late March.  Rich Johnson, a company spokesman based in Houston, said
that work remains under way at the refinery.  Planned work was also expected on a hydrocracker from late
February to late March, a diesel hydrotreater and delayed coker
for six days each in March and two desulfurization units for a
combined 24 days.  The Wood River refinery, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast
of St. Louis, can process as much as 356,000 barrels of crude
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s a joint
venture of Phillips and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
