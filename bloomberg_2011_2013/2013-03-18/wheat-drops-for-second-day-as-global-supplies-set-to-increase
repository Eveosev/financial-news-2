Wheat declined for a second day on
speculation supply may increase from  Russia  and the European
Union, and as commodities fell on concern that a levy on  bank
deposits  in Cyprus may deepen Europe’s debt crisis.  The contract for May lost as much as 1.4 percent to $7.1325
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest intra-day
loss since March 6. Futures were at $7.175 at 11:50 a.m. in
 Singapore  with volume more than double the 100-day average.  Russia, the third-largest shipper last year, targets a crop
increase to 40 million metric tons to 50 million tons this year
from 37.7 million tons a year earlier, the government says. Soft
wheat output in the European Union may rise 2.6 percent to
127.77 million tons, Coceral said March 15. Commodities measured
by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index fell as much as 0.9 percent
after Euro finance ministers agreed to force depositors in
Cypriot banks to share the cost of a bailout.  “Expectations of higher supply from the EU and Russia are
pushing prices lower,”  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for
research at  Tokyo  based Nihon Unicom Inc., said in an e-mail.
“The Cyprus problem is also triggering a risk-off attitude
across financial markets.”  Soybeans for May delivery lost as much as 1.1 percent to
$14.10 a bushel, the cheapest for the most-active contract since
Feb. 15, and traded at $14.125. Corn lost 0.7 percent to $7.1175
a bushel. That makes soybeans 1.99 times more expensive than
corn, compared with an average of 2.43 times in the past decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
