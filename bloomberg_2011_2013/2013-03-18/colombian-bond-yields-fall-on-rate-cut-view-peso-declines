Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell on
speculation the central bank will lower borrowing costs for  a
fifth straight meeting this week to boost the slowest growth in
the Andean region.  Yields on Colombia’s benchmark peso bonds due 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.90 percent at 9:09
a.m. in Bogota, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
rose 0.227 centavo to 143.553 centavos per peso.  “The market is positioning itself for another cut” in the
central bank’s March 22 meeting, said Daniel Escobar, head
analyst at Global Securities brokerage in Bogota. “We likely
won’t see any more cuts after this one.”  Banco de la Republica will lower the  overnight lending rate 
a quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent this week, according
to the majority of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers
have cut borrowing costs 1.5 percentage point since June, as
growth cooled and inflation slowed below target.  With inflation at 1.8 percent, its lowest in six decades,
Colombia has space to keep cutting rates Finance Minister

board, told reporters March 15.  Colombia’s economy expanded 3 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the median estimate of 19 economists in a
Bloomberg survey, slower than Chile, Peru and  Mexico . The
national statistics agency is slated to release the gross
domestic report March. 21.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 1,810.66 per  U.S. dollar ,
