Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy
Governor Philip Lowe said the European Union’s decision to force
Cypriot savers into a bailout was a “step back” for the region
and could increase instability in the financial system.  “The fact that this approach of haircutting depositors has
been sanctioned could lead the public to think it could happen
again,” Lowe said in response to audience questions following a
speech in Sydney. “It could make the system more susceptible to
bank runs and that’s something that the authorities in  Europe 
will have to watch very, very carefully.”  The Cypriot government announced an unprecedented tax on
deposits three days ago, seeking European aid after its banks
lost 4.5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) on Greek sovereign debt
and failed to meet European capital requirements. With Cypriot
lawmakers voting today on how to spread the burden among account
holders and the proposed tax roiling markets, the U.S. called
for a “responsible and fair” resolution to the financial
crisis in Cyprus, the fifth euro country to seek a bailout since
2010.  The proposed levy sparked outrage in the island nation and
concern among investors about setting a precedent by breaking
the taboo against raiding bank accounts.  “What we’ve seen in the last couple of days is a step
back,” Lowe said. “The idea that you would go and effectively
haircut small depositors to help a government fiscal situation
was not something that had really been countenanced by the
international community before.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
