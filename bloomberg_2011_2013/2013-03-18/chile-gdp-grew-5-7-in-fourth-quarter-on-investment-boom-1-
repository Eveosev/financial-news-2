Chile’s  gross domestic product 
expanded faster than forecast last year as a boom in the mining
and real estate industries boosted investment and sparked an
increase in consumer spending.  GDP grew 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 2011, the
central bank said in a report on its website today, exceeding
analyst estimates of 5.6 percent. The economy expanded 5.6
percent in all of 2012, compared with the 5.5 percent forecast
by policy makers in December for the world’s top copper
producer.  Copper prices exceeded central bank forecasts in 2012,
fueling an increase in mining investment as companies such as
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and state-owned Codelco build new production
capacity. The mining boom has fueled near full employment and
stimulated  consumer spending , helping delay an economic slowdown
until 2013, economist Sebastian Senzacqua said.  “Last year turned out to be positive for our economy,”
Senzacqua, an economist at Bice Inversiones, said by phone from
Santiago. “The economy should decelerate this year, although it
probably will be a healthy slowdown without an abrupt
moderation. It will slow toward its potential growth rate that
is closer to 5 percent.”  Economic growth exceeded analyst estimates in nine separate
months last year as retail sales expanded more than three times
faster than manufacturing. Private spending grew 7.3 percent in
the fourth quarter, while investment increased 18 percent,
according to today’s report.  Growth Outlook  GDP will expand 4.75 percent this year, surpassing the
average for Latin American nations by more than one percentage
point, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The economy as
measured by the Imacec index, which is a proxy for GDP,
increased 6.5 percent in the first month of the year.  Imports surged 4.9 percent in 2012 as consumers stepped up
purchases of foreign-made goods, according to the report.
Exports increased 1 percent as copper prices averaged $3.64 a
pound, exceeding the central bank forecast by $0.03. The current
account deficit expanded to $9.5 billion from $3.3 billion in
2011.  The peso, which has gained 2.1 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  in the past 12 months, fell 0.2 percent to 472.48 per
dollar at 9:59 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
