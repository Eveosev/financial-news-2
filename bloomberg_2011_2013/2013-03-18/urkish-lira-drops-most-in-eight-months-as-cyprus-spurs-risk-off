The lira weakened to the lowest
level in more than five months as a levy on Cyprus’s bank
savings threatened to throw Turkey’s biggest trading partner
 Europe  back into crisis.  The Turkish currency depreciated as much as 0.9 percent as
finance ministers in the euro area reached an agreement on March
16, forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share in the cost of
the latest euro-zone bailout. The euro fell 1 percent to $1.2952
at 5:02 p.m. in  London . The MSCI All- Country World (MXWO)  Index dropped
0.8 percent, retreating from the highest level since June 2008,
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5 percent.  “Despite having almost zero commercial link to the Greek
Cypriot side, due to contagion, there is risk-off mood to
surrender Turkish assets as well,” Sinan Goksen, head of
research at EkspresInvest in Istanbul, wrote by e-mail.  Turkey  doesn’t recognize European Union-member Cyprus,
which has been divided into Turkish and Greek Cypriot sectors
since Turkey invaded the northern third of the island in 1974.  The lira depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.8120 per dollar by
5:33 p.m. in Istanbul, the lowest level since October. Yields on
the country’s two-year benchmark notes rose six basis points to
5.99 percent, the highest since Jan. 17.  Volatility on the lira surged to 5.3 percent, the highest
since Dec. 5. The currency appreciated for the first time in
three days against the euro, gaining 0.5 percent to 2.3474.  “The Turkish central bank will be among the first central
banks in Europe, the  Middle East  and  Africa  to stop a lira slide
if it persists,”  Roderick Ngotho , a currency strategist at the
 Royal Bank of Scotland , said in e-mailed comments today. “We
don’t think the central bank minds gradual currency weakness,
but we do think they mind abrupt currency weakness.”  Debt Sale  Turkey’s Treasury sold 687.8 million liras of five-year
fixed-coupon bonds at 6.54 percent at an auction today, higher
than 6.30 percent in the previous sale of the same debt on Feb.
18. The Treasury also sold 972.3 million liras of seven-year
floating rate notes at 3.40 percent average yields in a separate
auction in the first sale of such instruments since January
2012.  “The yields were higher than expected,” Ali Cakiroglu, a
strategist at HSBC Asset Management, said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
