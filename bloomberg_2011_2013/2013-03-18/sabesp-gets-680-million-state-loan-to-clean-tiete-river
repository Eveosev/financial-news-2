Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Latin America ’s largest publicly traded water
utility, has been approved for a 1.35 billion-real ($680
million) loan from state-owned Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social to clean the Tiete River.  The project will expand wastewater collection and treatment
in 27 municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo,  Brazil ’s most
populous, according to BNDES, as the bank is known. It will cost
2.9 billion reais and boost the portion of sewage treated in the
region to 84 percent.  Sabesp will also use the funds to expand three sewage-
treatment plants, according to the March 15 statement. The
program to clean the Tiete River started in 1992 and is now in
its third phase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
