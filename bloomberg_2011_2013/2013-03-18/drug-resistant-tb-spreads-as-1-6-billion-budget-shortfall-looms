Low and middle-income countries
need an additional $1.6 billion a year to fight tuberculosis,
threatening progress made against the world’s second-deadliest
infectious disease, health officials said.  About $3.2 billion will be spent annually through 2016
combating the disease in 118 such nations and $4.8 billion is
needed, the  World Health Organization  and the Global Fund to
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria said in a joint statement
today. The additional funds may enable treatment for 17 million
people and save 6 million lives from 2014 to 2016, they said.  Tuberculosis killed 1.4 million people in 2011, the two
Geneva-based organizations said. Among infectious diseases, only
AIDS killed more. While TB can be cured with antibiotics,
strains of the bacterium that resist most drugs afflict about
630,000 people globally, threatening to undermine a target of
halving the TB death rate between 1990 and 2015.  “If we don’t act now, our costs could skyrocket,” Mark Dybul, the Global Fund’s executive director, said in the
statement. “It is invest now or pay forever.”  About $2.6 billion is needed annually to expand diagnosis
and treatment of TB, of which about $2 billion was available in
2011, according to the statement. There’s also a shortfall of
$800,000 for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB, which will
require the greatest funding increase in the next few years.  In a study published in August, almost half of TB patients
who had received prior treatment were resistant to a second-line
drug, suggesting the disease may become “virtually
untreatable.”  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  won U.S. approval in December for its
tuberculosis tablet Sirturo, the first new TB drug in 40 years.
Otsuka Holdings Co. is also developing a new TB medicine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
