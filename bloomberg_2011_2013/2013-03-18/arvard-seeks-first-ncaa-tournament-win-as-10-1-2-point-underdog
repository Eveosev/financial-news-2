Harvard University  is back among
college basketball’s elite for the second straight time after a
66-year absence. Getting a first National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament win may prove a bigger challenge.  Harvard, the  Ivy League  champion, is seeded 14th in the
West Regional and is listed by Las Vegas oddsmakers as a 10 1/2-
point underdog for its opening game against the University of
 New Mexico  on March 21 in  Salt Lake City .  New Mexico, which won the Mountain West Conference title
with a 29-5 record and is coached by former Indiana University
standout Steve Alford, is seeded third in the region behind No.
1 Gonzaga and No. 2 Ohio State. The winner advances to play
 Arizona  (25-7) or Belmont (26-6) on March 23.  “New Mexico as a three seed is one of those teams that
maybe hasn’t gotten the attention and love it deserves,” CBS
Sports college basketball analyst Clark Kellogg said on a
conference call. “Really good speed, good guards, well coached.
That’s one game I would probably consider New Mexico a pretty
healthy favorite. It’ll take a yeoman’s effort from the Crimson
to deal with the Lobos.”  Harvard (19-9) last year made the NCAA tournament for the
first time since 1946 and lost its opening game to Vanderbilt
79-70 as a 12th seed. The Crimson trailed by 18 points with less
than eight minutes remaining and fell to 0-3 all-time in the
NCAA tournament.  Ivy League  History is against the champions from the Ivy League, whose
teams have a 40-76 record in the NCAA tournament. Since 2000,
Ivy League schools are 2-13.  Teams seeded 14th at the NCAA tournament are 18-112 all-
time, including a 1-24 record over the past six years.  New Mexico will also have a significant geographic
advantage, Turner network analyst  Steve Kerr  said, as the
Albuquerque-based school is about 1,800 miles closer to Salt
Lake City than Harvard’s campus in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  “It’s a trip across the country for Harvard and New Mexico
has a great fan base which will be out in full force in Salt
Lake,” Kerr said. “They’ve got their hands full, but Harvard
is a good team. The gap has definitely gotten closer with all
these games, so they’ve got a shot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
