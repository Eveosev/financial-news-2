Natural gas climbed for a fourth
day in New York, closing at the highest price in almost four
months, on speculation that a cold start to spring will buoy
demand for heating fuel.  Gas rose 0.3 percent as MDA Weather Services predicted that
below-normal temperatures will linger in most of the lower 48
states through April 1. The futures have climbed 23 percent from
a one-month low on Feb. 15 as unusually cold weather helped
reduce a  stockpile glut .  “It doesn’t look like this rally is done yet,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The next two weeks, they’re calling for
below-normal temperatures. In this push up to $4, we have
basically seen a lot of shorts run out of the market.”  Gas for April delivery rose 1 cent to $3.882 per million
British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement price since Nov. 23. Prices earlier jumped to
$3.965, the highest intraday price since Oct. 31, 2011. Trading
volume was 48 percent above the 100-day average at 2:54 p.m. The
futures, which have increased 16 percent this year, last traded
at $4 in September 2011.  The discount of April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, eased 0.9 cent to 13.2 cents, the
narrowest spread for the contracts on record, based on closing
prices.  Options Trading  May $4 calls were the most active gas options in electronic
trading. They fell 0.5 cents to 12 cents per million Btu on
volume of 994 contracts as of 2:57 p.m. Calls accounted for 59
percent of the volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in May
was 32.48 percent, up from 31.51 percent on March 15.  Hedge funds  boosted bets on U.S. natural gas to the highest
level on record amid forecasts of colder-than-normal March
weather that would stoke demand for the heating fuel, according
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s March 15
Commitments of Traders report.  Net-long positions, or  wagers  on rising prices, on four
U.S. natural gas contracts rose by 52,809 futures equivalents,
or 27 percent, to 246,306 in the week ended March 12, CFTC data
show.  “Colder-than-normal March temperatures mean the 2012/2013
winter will likely end up close to normal, despite the mild
weather in December,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by
Johan Spetz in New York said in a note to clients yesterday.  Price Outlook  This amplified the tightening of the supply-and-demand
balance that began last April, he said.  “We see increased upside risk to our price forecasts of
$3.75 per million Btu for the second and third quarters of 2013
and $4.25 per million Btu for 2014,” he said.  The low temperature in  Chicago  on March 20 may be 16
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 9 Celsius), 16 lower than the usual
reading, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania .  New York City ’s low on April 1 may be 31 degrees,
9 below normal.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Gas demand  typically slumps
between the peak heating-demand season and before hot weather
drives power demand to run air conditioners.  Gas inventories  declined by 145 billion cubic feet to 1.938
trillion in the week ended March 13, falling below 2 trillion
for the first time since May 2011, EIA data show. The five-year
average drop for the period is 74 billion.  Inventory Decline  A  supply surplus  to the five-year average fell to 11.4
percent from 14.8 percent the previous week. A  deficit  versus
year-earlier levels widened to 18.5 percent, the most since
April 2008, from 14.8 percent a week earlier.  The previous winter was the fourth-warmest on record in the
contiguous states, cutting demand for heating fuels amid surging
gas production.  Gas futures, which rose as much as 2.4 percent today, pared
gains late in the trading day on concern that at $4, a “more
significant share” of electricity generators will start burning
coal instead of gas, said Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  New York . This loss of
power demand would reverse the progress made this winter in
creating a storage deficit, she said.  “It appears that the persistent cold weather for the
balance of the winter is insufficient to keep the summer curve
supported above $4,” Viswanath said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
