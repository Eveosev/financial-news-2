into crisis, curbing demand for metals. Aluminum, nickel, tin,

percent to $7,545.75 a metric ton, the lowest level since Nov.

p.m. in  Tokyo .  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose above $1,600 an ounce for the first time this
month, widening its premium over platinum, as an unprecedented
levy on Cyprus bank deposits reignited concern over Europe’s
debt crisis and boosted haven demand.  Gold for immediate delivery jumped as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,608.60 an ounce, the most expensive since Feb. 27, and
traded at $1,605.35 at 3:42 p.m. in Singapore. One ounce of
platinum bought as little as 0.9835 ounce of gold today, the
least since Jan. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot platinum fell as much as 1.1 percent to $1,572.75 an
ounce, before trading at $1,579, dropping for a fifth day in the

loss. Palladium sank 2 percent to $760.45 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat declined for a second day on speculation supply may
increase from  Russia  and the European Union, and as commodities
fell on concern that a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus may
deepen Europe’s debt crisis.  The contract for May lost as much as 1.4 percent to $7.1325
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest intra-day

$14.10 a bushel, the cheapest for the most-active contract since

$7.1075 a bushel. That makes soybeans 1.99 times as costly as
corn, compared with an average of 2.43 times in the past decade.  Palm oil  dropped on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia 
will hold near a record as an export tax curbs demand and on
concern that a levy on Cyprus’s bank deposits may throw Europe
back into crisis.  The contract for May delivery, with the most open interest,
declined as much as 0.8 percent to 2,395 ringgit ($765) a metric
ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning
session at 2,399 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . The June contract,
with the highest volume, fell 0.7 percent to 2,399 ringgit.  Rubber declined the most in eight months amid high
stockpiles in  China  and as Europe braced for renewed turmoil
over bank deposits in Cyprus, which strengthened the Japanese
currency and reduced the appeal of contracts in yen.  The contract for delivery in August plunged 4.2 percent,
the most since July 23, to end at 270.9 yen a kilogram ($2,863 a
