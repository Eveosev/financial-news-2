(Corrects spelling of CEO name in second, last paragraph.)  Marex Spectron Group, a closely
held commodities broker, said Gavin Prentice, its managing
director and global head of sales, is leaving the firm.  “Gavin is a part of the core DNA of Marex Spectron, a 20-
year veteran and a huge figure in the metals trading industry,”
 John Wall , chief executive officer of the company, said in an e-
mailed statement. “We will miss him greatly but we respect his
decision to take a break to plan the next stage of his career.”  Prentice, 49, a former head of metals at Refco Overseas
Ltd. in London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, was
appointed to an advisory group of the London Metal Exchange
after it was acquired in December by  Hong Kong Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd. (388)  for 1.39 billion pounds ($2.1 billion).  Marex, a London-based firm which describes itself as the
world’s largest privately owned commodities broker, has offices
in  Hong Kong  and Singapore as well as U.S. operations in New
York, Connecticut and Washington state.  Marex is controlled by JRJ Group, the London-based
investment firm set up by former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

this month.
