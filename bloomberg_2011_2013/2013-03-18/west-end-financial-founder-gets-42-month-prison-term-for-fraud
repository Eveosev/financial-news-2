William Landberg, the founder of
the bankrupt New York-based investment firm West End Financial
Advisors LLC, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison
for his role in an $8.7 million fraud scheme.  Landberg, 61, of New York, pleaded guilty in 2011 in
federal court in  Manhattan  to a scheme in which he obtained the
money from the German bank West LB AG for purposes not permitted
by credit agreements.  West End was a boutique financial services firm that
specialized in alternative investment opportunities for
institutions and high net worth clients, the U.S. said.  In one of three transactions cited by prosecutors, Landberg
received $3.9 million from West LB for a loan to develop
property on New Yorkâ€™s Long Island. He used $2 million of the
proceeds for fund commitments, paid $350,000 to investors as
purported earnings and kept more than $100,000 for personal use,
prosecutors said.  As part of the sentence, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who presided over the case, today ordered Landberg to
serve 18 months of home confinement and to forfeit $8.7 million
he obtained as a result of the scheme. She also ordered him to
pay $1.13 million in restitution.  West End Financial filed a plan of liquidation in
bankruptcy court in New York in August after seeking Chapter 11
creditor protection in March.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Landberg, 10-cr-00538, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
bankruptcy case is West End Financial Advisors LLC, 11-11152,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
