Incyte Corp., the maker of the drug
Jakafi for bone marrow disease, fell the most in three months
after a patient on the drug developed a viral infection.  Incyte dropped 4.2 percent to $23.79 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since Dec. 12. The shares have gained
32 percent in the past 12 months.  Incyte said it hadn’t determined yet whether the sometimes-
fatal viral infection, called PML or  progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy , was caused by the drug. The Wilmington,
Delaware company disclosed the infection in a filing today. The
case shouldn’t be a major worry for investors,  Eric Schmidt , an
analyst with Cowen & Co. in New York, said in a note to clients.  “The causal connection to Jakafi is not established, and
the event rate appears very low relative to the severity of the
diseases that Jakafi treats,” Schmidt said.  The medicine, also known as ruxolitinib, is used to treat
myelofibrosis, which occurs when a patient’s bone marrow scars
and can’t produce new blood cells. In response, the liver and
spleen try to compensate and end up swelling, according to the
National Institutes of Health. Myelofibrosis can kill people in
about five years.  An independent assessment will determine whether Jakafi
caused the infection in the 75-year-old man in the U.K., the
company said. It was the only known such case in about 9,800
patients who’ve been treated with the drug, Incyte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
