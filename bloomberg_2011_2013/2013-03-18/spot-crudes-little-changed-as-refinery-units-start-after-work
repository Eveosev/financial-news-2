Crude oils on the  spot market  were
little changed against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate as
refineries in the Midwest and  Gulf Coast  restarted units.  On the Gulf Coast, offshore oils Light Louisiana Sweet and
Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened, with LLS gaining 10 cents to
a $21.30 premium over U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
oil, as of 3:44 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. HLS widened its premium by 15 cents to $22.35.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s  Port Arthur , Texas, refinery
restarted its 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker over the weekend
after it had been shut since March 7 for repairs, a spokesman
said by e-mail.  In the Midwest,  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River refinery has
returned a 120,000-barrel-a-day crude unit to full rates, a
person familiar with the matter said. A 150,000-barrel-a-day
unit at the plant is at half-capacity and expected to return to
full rates within a week.  Other offshore oils weakened as the  spread  between WTI and
Brent crude narrowed, putting pressure on grades priced off of
Brent, the benchmark for seaborne crudes.  Poseidon’s premium lost 20 cents to $17.20 a barrel. Mars
Blend’s premium slipped 20 cents to $16.80.  Thunder Horse  shaved
35 cents off its premium to $19.50.  In Texas’s Permian Basin, West Texas Sour oil strengthened
by 20 cents to trade at an 80-cent discount to WTI.  Magellan
Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  said in its earnings statement in February
that it will begin partial operations of its Longhorn pipeline
carrying Permian grades to Houston in Mid-April.  In  Canada , the prices of Western Canada Select and Syncrude
grades were unchanged. Index trading for April delivery for the
grades ended on March 15. The majority of the volume in Canadian
grades is traded during the index period, which begins on the
first of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
