TMM Real Estate Development Plc (TR61) ,
Ukraine’s largest property developer, plans to boost revenue to
500 million hryvnia ($61.5 million) this year by diversifying
its portfolio, Chief Executive Officer Mykola Tolmachov said.  While the strategy last year, when the country was mired in
a recession, was to keep TMM stable, 2013 will be more active,
Tolmachov said in an interview at his office in Kiev. Annual
revenue didn’t exceed $51.3 million from 2009 through 2011, when
the company posted a net loss of $19.5 million.  “Now the task is growth,” he said. “We expect to
complete 2013 year with a good increase.”  The Ukrainian government is trying to spur economic
expansion to 3 percent this year after the former Soviet
republic slipped into a recession in 2012 as global demand fell
for steel, the country’s main export. The government said it
will support projects to upgrade industry and infrastructure and
allocated 2.6 billion hryvnia in the 2013 budget to support bank
loans for investment projects, Finance Minister Yuriy Kolobov
said Feb. 27.  Because of that, there will be an increase in demand for
industrial properties, Tolmachov said.  TMM “is prepared to very seriously consider everything on
this market,” he said. Hydro dams, nuclear power stations or
waste treatment facilities are among types of projects in which
the company would take part and TMM intends to participate in
large tenders this year, Tolmachov said, without giving details.  Contract Work  TMM, which has completed 32 mostly residential projects
since 1994, took up contracting work for infrastructure and
other facilities because of a lack of its own funds.  In 2012, contracted work accounted for 26 percent of
revenue, compared with around 1 percent in 2011, Tolmachov said.  Several such projects are in the pipeline now and TMM is in
talks with banks, he said. The company is also considering
infrastructure projects financed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development or the  World Bank , he said.  Cash collections from sales of proprieties increased 24
percent in 2012, Tolmachov said. If that trend is sustained, the
same increase in  cash flow  is planned for the current year, he
said.  “Cash flow means more than profit these days,” he said.  Bank loans rates in Ukraine are “unreasonable, and the
money is very dear,” said Tolmachov. His company pays an annual
15 percent on hryvnia loans. TMM may consider offering more
shares in a consolidated package with local partners in the
coming years, he said.  “Our dream is that the  capital market  will come back and
the share price will be fair,” Tolmachov said.  Share Price  TMM’s share price is not fair now for many reasons, mainly
because of the country’s lost rating and a lack of investment
attractiveness, he said.  TMM shares fell to 0.13 euro on Dec. 5 in  Frankfurt , the
lowest since February 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company sold 13.11 percent of its stock in 2007
in the form of global depositary receipts at $15.45 each and
raised $104.9 million. Shares declined 0.55 euro today from
0.564 on March 15.  TMM portfolio is valued at $400 million, half of which is
income-generating real estate, the CEO said.  Tolmachov expects demand for property to increase should
banks reduce deposit rates to at least 10 percent, which would
stimulate people to invest in residential property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
