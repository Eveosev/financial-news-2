U.S. stocks pared declines after
European markets closed, with the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
erasing most of an almost 110-point drop triggered by concerns
about the euro-region debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,557.21 at 12:08 p.m. in  New York  after losing 1 percent
earlier. The Dow was down 10.44 points at 14,503.67.  U.S. equities followed European shares lower earlier
following an unprecedented levy on deposits in Cyprus banks.
Lenders in Cyprus will close for two days after Finance
ministers in the euro area reached an agreement on March 16
forcing depositors to share in the cost of the latest bailout.
Bank creditworthiness deteriorated the most since inconclusive
Italian elections three weeks ago as Moody’s Investors Service
said today the Cypriot levy is negative for bank depositors
across  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
