Desarrolladora Homex (HXM) ,  Mexico ’s
largest publicly-traded homebuilder by market value, tumbled to
a four-year low in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended selling the stock.  American depositary receipts of Homex dropped 5.6 percent
to $11.20 at the close of trading, the lowest since March 2009.
The Mexican stock exchange was closed today for a holiday.  Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jason Mollin reduced the
rating on Culiacan-based Homex to sell from neutral. The company
faces “poor expected near-term results, possible debt covenant
renegotiation, and lack of positive catalysts,” they wrote in a
report dated today.  “We expect the disappointing cash burn to continue in the
near term, possibly forcing a debt covenant renegotiation or
waiver,” the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report.  Credit Suisse reiterated a rating equivalent to sell. Homex
will continue to post negative free cash flow in the next two
years, Credit Suisse analysts Eugenio Amador, Julian Bravo
Lozano and  Vanessa Quiroga  wrote in a report dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
