China for the first time published
a complete  list  of goods that form the basis for the  consumer
price index , a step toward improving data transparency in the
world’s second-biggest economy.  The list running about 30 pages from the  National Bureau of
Statistics  released today includes chicken, duck and pigeon eggs,
horse, donkey and camel meat, as well as wine and non-alcoholic
beer. Previously, the agency had only given broad categories of
products. It still doesn’t disclose the weighting of items, in
contrast with the U.S.  “It should be welcomed as it increases transparency in
China’s data,” said Joy Yang, chief  Greater China  economist at
Mirae Asset Financial Group in Hong Kong, who previously worked
at the  International Monetary Fund . At the same time, the lack
of weightings of groups or items and the omission of how prices
are collected make it difficult for independent economists to
gauge inflation, Yang said.  China’s new economic team under Premier  Li Keqiang  is
grappling with the task of sustaining a recovery from the
slowest growth in 13 years while keeping prices in check.  Zhou Xiaochuan , reappointed as central bank governor last week, said
the nation should be on “high alert” over  inflation  after
February’s figure reached a 10-month-high of 3.2 percent.  The statistics bureau said in 2010 that it has about 4,000
people collecting information around the country for the CPI and
solicits prices from 50,000 retail outlets, markets, hospitals
and cinemas in 500 cities and counties.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
