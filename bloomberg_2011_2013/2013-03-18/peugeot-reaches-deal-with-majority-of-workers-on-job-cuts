PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, struck a deal with French unions over
plans to reduce its headcount in the country by 17 percent.  Five unions representing 76 percent of workers have agreed
to the severance packages that Peugeot will offer as it seeks to
eliminate 11,200 posts, Denis Martin, industrial operations
chief, said today at a press conference at the company’s Paris
headquarters. The automaker will also close a factory in Aulnay.  Peugeot, which reported a 576 million-euro ($747 million)
operating loss last year, suffers from a reliance on the
European car market, which is set to decline for a sixth
straight year in 2013, and higher production costs in  France ,
where the automaker employs close to 50 percent of its workers.  The agreement with unions will be signed “very quickly,”
Martin said today. The full implementation of the restructuring
plan requires a final works council meeting that will take place
soon, Martin said, without specifying a date.  The shares gained 9 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 6.63 euros at
the close of trading in Paris today. The stock has advanced 21
percent this year, valuing the company at 2.35 billion euros.  Renault SA (RNO)  last week finalized a deal with unions to cut
its French workforce and freeze wages in exchange for not
closing any plants in the country for three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
