BNK Petroleum Inc. (BKX) , the oil
explorer whose biggest holder is  George Soros , climbed the most
in more than three years a day after Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to
buy an Oklahoma oilfield.  BNK increased 43 percent to 80 Canadian cents at the close
in Toronto. Earlier, the shares rose 46 percent, the largest
 intraday  advance since May 2009.  Exxon, the worldâ€™s biggest energy company by market value,
agreed yesterday to acquire most of the Tishomingo Field from
Camarillo, California-based BNK for $147.5 million. BNK plans to
spend proceeds from the sale on drilling in the U.S. and Europe,
and to repay a credit facility, the company said in a statement
yesterday.  BNK lost 71 percent of its market value since Soros
purchased his initial stake for C$2.54 a share in October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
