U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s largest
regional bank, agreed to buy  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s municipal bond
trustee business. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal, expected to be completed in the third quarter,
will add about $57 billion to the $3 trillion in assets under
administration by U.S. Bancorp’s corporate-trust division, the
Minneapolis-based lender said today in a statement. The
transaction will build on the bank’s trust business in
California, Mississippi, New York, Tennessee and Texas,
according to the statement.  U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis , 55, has
said part of the firm’s acquisition strategy will be focused on
its payments and trust businesses. The company added about $25
billion in hedge-fund assets under administration through the
purchase of AIS Fund Administration in November. Trust and
investment-management fees increased 5.5 percent last year to
$1.06 billion from 2011.  “This acquisition is consistent with U.S. Bank’s ongoing
commitment to continued strategic business investments and its
commitment to corporate-trust services,” Bryan Calder,
president of U.S. Bancorp’s global corporate-trust services,
said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
