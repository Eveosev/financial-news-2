Serbia ’s current-account deficit
widened in 2012 from a year earlier, meeting the central bank’s
full-year forecast.  The deficit expanded to 3.15 billion euros ($4.1 billion)
or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product, after the shortfall
in December rose to 405.5 million euros, the second-highest
monthly reading in 2012, according to the balance of payments
report published by the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije
today.  The trade deficit, traditionally the main component of the
current-account gap, widened on the year to 5.45 billion euros.
Remittances, which finance the gap, fell 5.7 percent on year to
1.98 billion euros.  Net foreign direct investments dropped 87 percent on the
year to 232 million euros. Portfolio investments, mainly in
Serbian Treasury bills and bonds, rose 2.83 percent on the year
to 1.66 billion euros after Serbia sold two Eurobonds in
September and December 2012 totaling $1.75 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
