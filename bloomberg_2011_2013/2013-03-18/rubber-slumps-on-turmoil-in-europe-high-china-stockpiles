Rubber declined amid high
stockpiles in  China  and as  Europe  braced for renewed turmoil
over bank deposits in Cyprus, which strengthened the Japanese
currency and reduced investor appetite for yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange retreated as much as 3.5 percent to 272.9 yen a
kilogram ($2,879 a metric ton), before trading at 273.9 at 10:47
a.m. Futures fell 5.1 percent last week and lost 9.5 percent
this year. The yen rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to 94.77.  The Japanese currency strengthened against all major
currencies, reducing the appeal of yen-based contracts, as
outrage in Cyprus over the levy on bank deposits threatened to
derail the nation’s bailout. Inventories in China climbed to
113,803 tons, the highest level since January 2010, based on a
survey of nine warehouses in  Shanghai , Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan
and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said on March 15.  “Cyprus renewed concerns about the  European debt crisis ,
strengthening the yen and pressuring the rubber market,” said
Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades bowed to demands by
euro-area finance ministers to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5
billion) by taking a piece of every bank account in Cyprus.
Anastasiades delayed a vote on the measure in parliament until
today, a day later than planned, as he seeks more time to
convince lawmakers to back him.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange slumped 3.5 percent to 23,310  yuan  ($3,749) a ton in
Shanghai. Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 86.30 baht
($2.91) a kilogram on March 15, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
