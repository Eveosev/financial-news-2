U.K. stocks  retreated, sending the
FTSE 100 Index lower for a second day, after the euro area
forced Cyprus to adopt an unprecedented levy on  bank deposits ,
threatening to reignite the region’s debt crisis.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Prudential Plc (PRU)  led a selloff in financial
firms, both falling more than 3 percent. Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. lost 7.2 percent as base metals declined and a
newspaper said the company may write down more than $1 billion
this week.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  paced advancing shares.  The FTSE 100 lost 31.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,457.92
at the close in  London  for its first back to back loss since
January. The gauge earlier lost as much as 1.6 percent. The FTSE
100 is still up 9.5 percent so far this year. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index also lost 0.5 percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ
Index climbed 1.4 percent.  “The question that everyone is now going to ask themselves
is ‘who is next?’”  Andy Lynch , who helps manage about $1.6
billion as portfolio manager at Schroder Investment Management
Ltd. said on Bloomberg Television in London. “If we start
seeing deposits moving out from the periphery, then banks can
get themselves in a situation very quickly again where they are
dependent on emergency liquidity.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 5.9 percent higher than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Cyprus Bailout  Euro-area finance ministers reached an agreement on March
16 that forces depositors in Cypriot banks to share the cost of
the latest euro-zone bailout. Cypriot President Nicos
Anastasiades, who bowed to demands to raise 5.8 billion euros
($7.6 billion) by taking a piece of every bank account in
Cyprus, appealed to lawmakers to ratify the levy.  The vote has been delayed for a second day amid opposition
in Cyprus to the proposal. Moody’s Investors Service said today
the levy is negative for bank depositors across  Europe , while
 Bill Gross  at Pacific Investment Management Co. said it moves
“risk-on” trades to the back seat.  “The bailout will have to change,” Lynch told Caroline
Hyde on Bloomberg Television. “When they look at it in the cold
light of day, they will say yes we got that one wrong. They have
got time before parliament today to make adjustments.”  Bank Shares  Barclays led a gauge of  U.K. banks  lower, losing 4.4
percent to 305.95 pence.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  slid
3.4 percent to 297.3 pence and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  dropped
1.3 percent to 49.85 pence.  Prudential paced declines among insurance companies,
falling 3.4 percent to 1,115 pence. Aviva Plc retreated 0.9
percent to 323.3 pence and Legal & General Group Plc slipped 0.5
percent to 172.4 pence.  Legal & General also today entered a joint venture to
acquire Scottish homebuilder Cala Group Ltd. from Lloyds for 210
million pounds ($317 million).  ENRC tumbled 7.2 percent to 321.9 pence, the biggest
decline in seven months. The company may announce a  writedown  on
operations this week, the Independent on Sunday reported, citing
figures from Deutsche Bank AG. The German lender expects ENRC to
announce writedowns of between $550 million to $1.05 billion,
according to the newspaper.  Kazakhmys fell 6.1 percent to 505.5 pence as copper
declined to a four-month low on the London Metal Exchange.
 Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  slid 1.5 percent to 1,066 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
dropped 2.5 percent to 1,135.5 pence.  Elsewhere, Marks & Spencer surged 6.9 percent to 398.1
pence, for the biggest advance on the FTSE 100 today, after the
Sunday Times yesterday reported the Qatar Investment Authority
may make an 8 billion-pound offer for the retailer.  The newspaper said that QIA had approached banks and
private equity houses to help make a move on the London-based
company, citing senior sources in London’s financial district.  Even so, a person close to the wealth fund today said QIA
is not considering a bid for M&S. The retailer declined to
comment.  Torotrak Plc (TRK)  surged 20 percent to 28.75 pence, the biggest
advance on the FTSE All-Share Index, after Allison Transmission
Holdings Inc., a former General Motors Co. unit, agreed to renew
a license and increase its stake in the maker of transmission
systems.  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  declined 2.2 percent to 144.5 pence after the
U.K.’s Financial Services Authority fined the oil-rig
manufacturer 2.4 million pounds for not telling investors
quickly enough about its faltering finances in early 2012. The
stock had climbed 7 percent the past four sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
