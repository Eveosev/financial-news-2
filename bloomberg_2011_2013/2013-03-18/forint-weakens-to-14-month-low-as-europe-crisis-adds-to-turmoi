The forint weakened to the lowest
level in 14 months as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will escalate
added to a turmoil in Hungarian markets caused by the
government’s plan to cut borrowing costs.  The currency of the European Union’s most indebted eastern
member depreciated for a second day after a levy on Cyprus’s
bank savings threatened to throw the continent back in a crisis
mode. The forint lost 1.9 percent last week as Prime Minister
Viktor Orban called for lower interest rates and for measures to
help foreign-currency borrowers. Nomura Holdings Plc said
Orban’s comments suggest plans are under way to devalue the
currency.  “Domestic policy risks and the deterioration of the euro
area sentiment are weighing on local assets,” Sandor Jobbagy, a
Budapest-based analyst at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s CIB unit, wrote
in a research report today.  The forint slid as much as 1.1 percent before paring loss
to 0.8 percent at 307.63 per euro by 11:14 a.m. in Budapest,
extending its slump this month to 4 percent, the worst
performance among more than 100 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Yields on the government’s benchmark forint-denominated 10-year
bonds rose 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.605
percent.  Constitutional changes passed by  Hungary ’s parliament on
March 11, which limited the authority of courts and were
criticized by the European Commission, the U.S. and  Germany ,
worsened the rout in Hungarian assets.  “Non-economic issues burdening Hungary’s EU-relations also
boost the negative pressure on the forint,” Jobbagy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
