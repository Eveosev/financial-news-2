Sugar fell to the lowest level in
almost a week in New York after prices failed to rally even as
speculators reduced bets on lower prices. Cocoa slid.  Small and large speculators excluding  index funds  reduced
bets on lower prices of raw sugar traded in New York by 62
percent in the week ended March 12, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Net-short
positions were 30,175 contracts, down from 79,044 contracts in
the previous 7-day period, the Washington-based commission said.
Raw sugar futures climbed 0.7 percent last week.  “The interpretation of this news is bearish,” Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting,
said in a report e-mailed March 16. “The market rose only 100
points despite the large volume of reduction in short
positions.”  Raw sugar for May delivery fell 1.7 percent to 18.56 cents
a pound by 6:56 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the lowest
since March 12. White sugar for May delivery was down 1.1
percent to $533.30 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Sugar prices failed to rally as prices that climbed to more
than 19 cents a pound on March 15 attracted sales from
producers, Lausanne, Switzerland-based researcher Kingsman SA,
owned by the McGraw-Hill Cos., said in an e-mail today.  “The outlook is still mixed,” Tom McNeill, a director at
Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty.
said in a report e-mailed today. “Surplus worries are on-going,
particularly as center south  Brazil  gets sugar production under
way over the next month,” he said, adding that  Thailand  still
has a lot of the sweetener to sell and that the premium that
white sugar commands over the raw variety “appears
attractive.”  The white sugar  premium  over the raw variety is $124 a ton,
the highest since Oct. 9  Cocoa for May delivery fell 0.8 percent to $2,099 a ton in
New York. Cocoa for delivery the same month dropped 0.6 percent
to 1,418 pounds ($2,146) a ton in  London .  Arabica coffee for delivery in May declined 0.3 percent to
$1.3715 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in May was
down 0.4 percent at $2,184 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
