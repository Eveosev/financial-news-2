Steve Davis, the quarterback on two
national championship football teams at the University of
 Oklahoma , was one of two people killed in the crash of a small
plane, the school said.  Davis, 60, and Wesley Caves, 58, died yesterday when their
Beechcraft Premier I twin-jet crashed into a house in South
Bend,  Indiana , the  Associated Press  reported, citing the St.
Joseph County Coroner’s office.  The cause of the crash is unknown, Mike Daigle, executive
director of the St. Joseph County Airport Authority, told AP.
The  National Transportation Safety Board  is investigating the
crash.  Pete Moris, a spokesman for Oklahoma football, confirmed
Davis’s death and said the school plans to issue a statement.  The plane was owned by Caves, who had a pilot’s license, AP
reported. Two other people aboard the plane survived the crash,
while a woman who was injured on the ground was in fair
condition, AP reported, citing Maggie Scroope, a South Bend
Memorial Hospital spokeswoman. Scroope didn’t immediately return
a phone message seeking additional details.  Davis went 32-1-1 as a starter for the Sooners from 1973 to
1975. He started every game during the first three seasons of
coach Barry Switzer’s tenure at the Norman, Oklahoma-based
school, leading the Sooners to national titles in 1974 and 1975.  “I’m saddened by the loss of  Steve Davis ,” Switzer said
on his Twitter account. “Great role model for young people on &
off the field. He was my 1st QB & had an outstanding career.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
