West Texas Intermediate crude
advanced to the highest level in almost a month after European
policy makers signaled flexibility on the application of an
unprecedented bank tax in Cyprus.  Futures rose for a third day as European officials said
Cyprus could ease the cost of the bank-savings levy to small
depositors. Outrage over the tax threatened to derail a bailout
and worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis. It sent crude down 1.8 percent
in intraday trading before the rebound. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  trimmed a 100-point loss and the euro reduced a decline
against the dollar. Oil also gained after failing to sustain a
move below its 100- and 200-day moving averages.  “It’s not the end of the world for Europe,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors. “People are waiting to see how it plays out. The
equity market has come back pretty strong and the dollar is off
its highs.”  WTI for April delivery rose 29 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$93.74 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Feb. 20. It fell to $91.76 earlier. Volume was
4.6 percent below the 100-day average for the time of day at 4
p.m.  Brent for May settlement dropped 31 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to end the session at $109.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 16 percent below the 100-day
average. The European benchmark grade was at a premium of $15.40
to WTI for the same month. That’s down from $16 on March 15 and
is the lowest level since January.  ‘No Fundamentals’  “Oil, equities and the dollar are very heavily correlated
right now, and oil is just going along with what the equities
and what the euro is doing,” said  Stephen Schork , president of
the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “There are no
fundamentals for oil per se.”  The Dow average was down 62.05 points at 14,452.06 at 4:03
p.m. in New York after falling as much as 109.90 points. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.6 percent. It was down as
much as 1 percent earlier.  The euro weakened 1.1 percent after declining 1.5 percent
to as low as $1.2882, the least since Dec. 10 and the biggest
decrease since Jan. 13, 2012. A weaker euro reduces dollar-
denominated oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  “We are following equities and currencies,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago.
“The 200-day and 100-day moving averages all set around $92,
and there’s been a lot of support there.”  The April WTI contract’s 200-day moving average was at
$92.08 today, and the 100-day average was $92.02.  Cypriot Banks  Finance ministers in the euro area reached an agreement on
March 16 forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share in the
cost of the latest bailout estimated at 5.8 billion euros ($7.6
billion). A vote on the tax in Cyprus was delayed for a second
day until tomorrow.  “It is important that Cyprus and its euro-area partners
work to resolve the situation in a way that is responsible and
fair and ensures financial stability,” the U.S. Treasury
Department said in an e-mailed statement today  Banks in the island nation will remain shut tomorrow and
March 20, a government official said, asking not to be
identified. Cyprus accounts for less than half a percent of the
17-nation euro economy.  Vote Delayed  “People realized that Cyprus is a very small part of the
EU economy,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the
Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The tax is not a done deal
yet, and Cyprus just delayed the vote again.”  The European sovereign debt crisis began in  Greece  three
years ago and has reduced economic growth and fuel demand as it
spread to Ireland,  Portugal ,  Italy ,  Spain  and Cyprus.  Crude prices will stay at current levels for the
“foreseeable future,” Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali Al-Naimi 
said in comments reported by the official Saudi Press Agency
today. The kingdom is concerned about global economic growth,
not  oil prices , he said.  Any suggestion that Saudi Arabia is trying to keep oil
prices at certain levels to finance domestic spending is “not
realistic,” Al-Naimi said.  Mideast Exports  Saudi Arabia  and  Iraq  raised crude exports in January for
the first time in three months as demand from Asian countries
climbed, according to data on the website of the Joint
Organizations Data Initiative yesterday.  Oil also pared losses after Oil Minister Abdulbari al-Arusi
said Waha Oil Co.’s pipeline in  Libya  was shut because of a
strike at its Gialo field, cutting the country’s crude output by
120,000 barrels a day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was at 17.5 percent at 3:10 p.m. in New York,
little changed from 17.3 percent March 15. The figures are down
from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 455,419
contracts as of 4 p.m. It totaled 491,903 contracts on March 15,
9.3 percent below the three-month average. Open interest was
1.68 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
