The U.S. Justice Department said
it’s open to changing a part of a 1986 law allowing authorities
to obtain e-mails more than 180 days old without a search
warrant.  There is “no principled basis” to treat e-mail
differently if it’s less than or more than 180 days old, Elana
Tyrangiel, acting assistant attorney general said  in written
testimony  for a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing tomorrow.  Google Inc. is one of several companies and trade groups
advocating for the law to be changed. Richard Salgado, director
of law enforcement and information security for the Mountain
View, California-based search engine owner, said in written
testimony the law “needs to be brought in line with
how people use the Internet today, provide them with the privacy
they reasonably should expect, and allow the growth of the
Internet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
