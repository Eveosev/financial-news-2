ClearEdge Power Inc., a closely
held maker of stationary fuel cells, raised $36 million in
financing to expand manufacturing and sales operations.  The funding “enables us to make decisions that ensure
profitable growth,” David B. Wright, chief executive officer of
Hillsboro, Oregon-based ClearEdge, said in a statement today.  ClearEdge last month completed its acquisition of UTC
Power, a fuel-cell producer, from  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the
Hartford, Connecticut-based maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines
and Otis elevators.  ClearEdge’s fuel cells primarily use natural gas to produce
heat and electricity, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
