Argentina’s tax agency accused the
local unit of  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  of conspiracy to hide bank
accounts, thereby helping private companies evade tax payments
and launder money.  The Buenos Aires-based agency investigated accounts at the
bank over a six-month period and discovered tax evasion of 224
million pesos ($44 million) and 392 million pesos in  money
laundering , it said. According to agency Director Ricardo Echegaray, the bank set up a system to help companies hide bank
accounts.  “It’s clear to us that there was a conspiracy between HSBC
and private companies,” Echegaray told reporters today in
Buenos Aires. “The first thing they have to do is to pay the
state what it’s owed and dismantle a gang of swindlers.”  Federal Judge Javier Lopez Biscayart of the tax crimes
court in  Buenos Aires  has received the agency’s file against the
bank, Echegaray said.  “The allegations made by regulators in Argentina are of
great concern,” Lyssette Bravo, an HSBC spokeswoman for Latin
America, said in an e-mailed response to  Bloomberg News . “We
are committed to working cooperatively with authorities to
ensure a thorough review and appropriate resolution of the
matter.”  HSBC is the seventh-largest bank by deposits in Argentina,
according to the  central bank website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
