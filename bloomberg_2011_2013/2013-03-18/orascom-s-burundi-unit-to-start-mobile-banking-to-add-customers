Leo Burundi, a unit of  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , wants to quadruple subscribers to its
mobile phone cash-transfer platform by the end of the year as it
introduces financial-services products.  A partnership with Interbank Burundi SA will allow clients
to deposit money into  savings accounts  and make withdrawals
using their mobile phones, Laurent Ndayikeza, a manager, said.
U.S.-based Obopay Inc., has been hired to provide a secure
Internet connection and servers to process transactions, he told
reporters today in the capital, Bujumbura.  “This will help Leo Burundi and the Burundian government
to increase the financial inclusion rate,” Ndayikeza said. The
company is aiming for 200,000 customers on its Leo Manoti
mobile-phone payment service by end-December, from 55,000 now.  The coffee-exporting nation of 8 million people has a
mobile phone penetration rate of about 24 percent, and Leo
Burundi has a 60 percent market share, according to the
telecommunications regulatory authority. Competitors include
Econet Wireless Holdings’ Burundian unit, state-owned  Onatel (ONTBF) ,
Lacell SU and Africell Holding SAL, a unit of VTEL Holdings Ltd.
