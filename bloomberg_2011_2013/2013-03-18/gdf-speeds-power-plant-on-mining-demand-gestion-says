GDF Suez SA (GSZ) ’s Peruvian unit plans
to complete a 460-megawatt power plant sooner than previously
scheduled as mining projects boost electricity demand,  Gestion 
reported.  Enersur SA (ENERSUC1)  General Manager Alex Keisser said the diesel-
fired plant in the southern port of Ilo will begin operating in
June, four months earlier than scheduled, the Lima-based
newspaper reported. Enersur has also proposed adding 100
megawatts of generating capacity in the area, according to
Gestion.  Keisser said Peru has lined up $25 billion in mining
investment commitments in the southern Andes, which will more
than double electricity demand to 2,200 megawatts by 2016, the
newspaper reported.  Enersur, which plans to invest $1.5 billion in power plants
through 2016, has signed supply contracts with  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ’s Las
Bambas copper mine,  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO)  and Cia. Minera
Antamina SA, Gestion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
