Six men arrested over the alleged
gang rape of a 39-year-old Swiss woman as she camped with her
husband in a forest in central  India  will appear in court today.  The assault comes three months after the rape and murder of
a medical student in the Indian capital triggered nationwide
protests and spurred tougher laws to curb sex crimes. In India a
woman was raped every 22 minutes in 2011, the most recent
 National Crime Records Bureau  data show.  Four of the men have been charged with rape and assault and
two others with aiding them, said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector
general of police for the Chambal area of  Madhya Pradesh . All
have confessed to the crime, Arya said. A mobile phone, laptop
computer and other belongings of the Swiss couple were recovered
from the accused, he said.  The gang attacked on the night of March 15 at Jharia
village, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from  Datia  town, where the
couple had decided to camp during a cycling holiday. The men
first overpowered the husband and four of the accused then raped
the woman, police said.  December’s brutal attack on the 23-year-old medical student
in New Delhi shocked India and reverberated around the world,
triggering street protests and drawing attention to the scale of
sexual violence against women in the world’s largest democracy.
India’s government has toughened sentences for sexual assaults
amid the public outcry.  The Swiss couple are in New Delhi for further treatment,
Arya said. Police will seek custody of the six men when they
appear in court in Datia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
