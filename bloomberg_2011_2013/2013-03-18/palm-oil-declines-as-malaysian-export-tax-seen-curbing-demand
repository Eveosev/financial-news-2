Palm oil  dropped on speculation
that stockpiles in Malaysia will hold near a record as an export
tax curbs demand and on concern that a levy on Cyprus’s bank
deposits may throw Europe back into crisis.  The contract for May delivery, with the most open interest,
declined 1.2 percent to close at 2,386 ringgit ($762) a metric
ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. The June contract,
with the highest volume, fell 1.4 percent to 2,383 ringgit.  Commodities measured by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index
fell as much as 1.1 percent today after Euro finance ministers
agreed to force depositors in Cypriot banks to share the cost of
a bailout. While Cyprus accounts for less than half a percent of
the euro economy, the concern is that the one-time tax may
trigger bank runs across  Europe .  “Prices are likely to show weakness on Cyprus fears,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said today by
phone from Singapore. “Crude palm oil prices are likely to
track the overall market at least for this coming week.”  Malaysia’s exports may be unchanged in March after the
government retained a 4.5 percent tax for a second month in
April, Ker said. Shipments fell 14 percent to 1.4 million tons
in February, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. While
 inventories  dropped to 2.44 million tons, they were near an all-
time high of 2.63 million tons reached in December.  Soybean oil  for May delivery lost 0.8 percent to 49.51
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans
declined 1.1 percent to $14.11 a bushel. Refined palm oil for
September fell 1.4 percent to close at 6,276  yuan  ($1,010) a ton
on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil retreated 1.1
percent to end at 8,050 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
