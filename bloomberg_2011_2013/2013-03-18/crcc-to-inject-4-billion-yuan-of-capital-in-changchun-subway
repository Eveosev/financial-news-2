China Railway Construction Corp. (1186) 
will inject as much as 4 billion  yuan  of capital into the subway
operator in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun as part
of a “build and transfer” project.  CRCC will make the investment in three phases over as much
as two years, it said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange yesterday. The company’s stake will remain below 20
percent and later be repurchased by subway operator, according
to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
