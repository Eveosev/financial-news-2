Japan â€™s feed-wheat imports may
decrease 12 percent for the year starting in April, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  The government plans to cut imports to as much as 1.07
million metric tons from 1.21 million tons estimated in
September for this fiscal year, the ministry said in a statement.
The ministry controls overseas purchases and domestic sales of
wheat to stabilize supply.  Japan expects feed-barley imports may be unchanged at 1.29
million tons next fiscal year, according to the statement.
