HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, agreed to sell its Canadian store card unit to Toronto-
Dominion Bank as it closes its consumer-finance business in the
country.  The gross value of the loans was C$495 million ($484
million) on Feb. 28, London-based HSBC said today in a
statement. No value for the deal was disclosed and HSBC’s own-
branded credit card business isn’t part of the sale.  Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  has closed or sold
at least 47 businesses since he took the top job in 2011,
sacrificing revenue and targeting 30,000 job cuts. The company
has cut $3.6 billion of costs and could make $1 billion in
further savings in 2013, it said earlier this month.  HSBC will focus on commercial, investment and retail
banking and wealth management in  Canada , it said. The sale needs
to be approved by regulators and will close in the third quarter
of this year, it said.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
