Gold pared gains to the highest
level this month as prices above $1,600 an ounce cooled physical
demand. Bullion’s premium over platinum widened to a two-month
high as an unprecedented levy on Cyprus bank deposits reignited
concern over Europe’s debt crisis.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,596.95
at 10:19 a.m. in Singapore, after jumping as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,608.60, the most expensive since Feb. 27. One ounce of
platinum bought as little as 0.9848 ounce of gold today, the
least since Jan. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gold, which has fallen 4.7 percent this year as an
improving U.S. economy boosted the  dollar , climbed for a third
day even as the greenback strengthened 0.6 percent against a
six-currency basket. Volume for the benchmark cash contract in
Shanghai dipped below 10,000 kilograms for the past three days
as prices rose. Still, it has been more than double the 2012
daily average since Feb. 18, when it reached a record 22,024
kilograms, according to exchange data.  “A knee-jerk reaction to Cyprus drove gold over $1,600,
but physical buying that has been supporting the market in the
past few weeks disappears at these levels,” said Sun Yonggang,
a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright Futures Co., a unit of
one of China’s largest state-owned investment companies.
“Inflation worries seem to be coming back into the market,
however, investors are cautious ahead of the Fed meeting.”  Gold last week had the first back-to-back weekly gain since
January on concern about rising inflation. Data for February
showed the U.S. consumer-price index rose more than projected,
while inflation reached a 10-month high in China. Federal
Reserve policy makers, meeting tomorrow, are divided on the pace
of stimulus that helped gold to rally for the past 12 years.  Cyprus Vote  Bullion for April delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$1,607.60 on the Comex in New York, also the highest price since
Feb. 27, before trading at $1,595.60. Cyprus turmoil “must be
very good for gold,” Lars Seier Christensen, CEO of Denmark-
based Saxo Bank A/S, wrote on his  blog .  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades is seeking to persuade
lawmakers to back a plan to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5
billion) by taking a piece of every bank account in the country,
as part of a bailout agreement with euro-area finance ministers.
Cyprus lawmakers vote on the legislation today, a day after
originally planned.  Spot platinum fell as much as 1.1 percent to $1,572.75 an
ounce, before trading at $1,575.75, dropping for a fifth day in
the longest losing streak this year. Cash silver was at $28.765
an ounce, after earlier climbing as much as 1.3 percent.
Palladium sank 2.7 percent to $755.15 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
