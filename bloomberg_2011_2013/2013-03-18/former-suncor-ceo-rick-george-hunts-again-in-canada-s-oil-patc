Rick George, the former chief
executive officer of  Suncor (SU)  Energy Inc., is seeking to raise as
much as C$400 million ($391 million) for investment in Canadian
oil-sands companies and other onshore producers.  “The stuff we’re looking at now is entrepreneurial,”
George, the founder of Calgary-based Novo Investment Group Ltd.,
said in an interview today in  New York . “It’s in some ways a
lot of fun at looking at things that are possible.”  George, 62, was CEO of Suncor,  Canada ’s largest energy
company, for 21 years until his retirement in May. While CEO,
George led Suncor through Canada’s biggest energy takeover, the
C$19.3 billion acquisition of Petro-Canada in 2009. He formed
Novo Investment with former Suncor Executive Vice President Jay Thornton last year.  In the new venture, George is interested in Canadian
companies that have the technology to address challenges facing
oil and natural gas producers. Over the next decade, that may
include more effective horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, better solvents to extract bitumen from  oil sands ,
improved pumps and driver-less trucks at project sites, he said.  “The key for this industry generally but particularly in
Canada, is technology,” George said. “Not one technology, but
technology across a broad spectrum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
