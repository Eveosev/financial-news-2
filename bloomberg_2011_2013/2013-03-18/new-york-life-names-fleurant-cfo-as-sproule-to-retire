New York  Life Insurance Co., the
biggest U.S. life insurer owned by policyholders, named John Fleurant as chief financial officer.  Fleurant, currently deputy CFO, will replace Michael Sproule, 65, after he retires on June 30, the New York-based
company said today in a statement.  New York Life, led by Chief Executive Officer Ted Mathas,
45, has an investment portfolio of more than $170 billion,
mostly in bonds, to back obligations to policyholders. Fleurant,
50, joined New York Life in 2010 from Prudential Financial Inc.,
where he was controller and CFO for the domestic business.  “John has the right combination of experience, skill and
insight for the complex role of CFO,” Mathas said in the
statement.  Fleurant became deputy CFO last year, after working as
senior vice president for finance and controller. He was hired
by  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential, the second-largest U.S.
life insurer, in 1995. He earlier worked at  Deloitte & Touche
LLP  after studying accounting at Pennsylvania’s  Widener
University , according to the statement.  Sproule joined New York Life in 1999 to oversee mergers and
acquisitions, and became CFO in 2002. He’s also a member of the
Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
