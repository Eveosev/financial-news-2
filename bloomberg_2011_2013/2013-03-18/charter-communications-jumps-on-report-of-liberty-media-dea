Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, surged as much as 10 percent
after Dow Jones reported that Liberty Media is close to a deal
to buy 25 percent of the company for about $2.5 billion.  Charter rose 6 percent to $95.45 at 12:58 p.m. in  New York 
after jumping to $99.50.  Dow Jones cited people familiar with the deal it didn’t
identify.  Anita Lamont , a spokeswoman for Charter, didn’t immediately
respond to a voice mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
