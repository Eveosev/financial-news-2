Libya’s Economic and Social
Development Fund is showing a deficit of $4.7 billion as its
revenue from investments declined following the 2011 revolution
that toppled Muammar Qaddafi, Chairman Mahmoud Badi said.  The fund, tasked with providing support to needy families,
has yet to receive dividends from most of the companies and
projects in which it has investments in Libya, Badi said in an
interview yesterday in Tripoli.  “Current average income received from the fund is at $390
million per year while payments amount to $936 million per
year,” he said. “We are facing a difficult period.”  The fund is part of the  Libyan Investment Authority , the
North African nation’s sovereign wealth fund. Badi said the ESDF
liquidated most investments abroad at the end of last year,
incurring a loss of $450 million. Two portfolios with an
original value of $375 million remain in  Europe . These are part
of the LIA and subject to sanctions. “Their monetary value
could be less,” said Badi.  All other ESDF assets are worth about $9 billion to $10
billion and in Libya, according to Badi. ESDF holds shares in
Wahda Bank, Sahara Bank, Libyan Gulf First Bank, Libyan
Insurance Co, Libyan Tobacco Co. and other industrial companies,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
