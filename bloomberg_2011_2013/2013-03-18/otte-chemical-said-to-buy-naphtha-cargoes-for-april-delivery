Lotte Chemical Corp. (011170)  bought four
naphtha cargoes totaling about 100,000 metric tons for second-
half April delivery to South Korea, according to two traders who
participate in the market.  The company bought the cargoes last week from an
unidentified seller at a premium of $25 to $26 a ton to Japan
benchmark prices, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
