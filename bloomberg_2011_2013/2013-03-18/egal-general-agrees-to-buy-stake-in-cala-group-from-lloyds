Legal & General Group (LGEN)  Plc, the
biggest manager of U.K. pension assets, said it entered a joint-
venture to acquire Scottish homebuilder Cala Group Ltd. from
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  for 210 million pounds ($317 million).  Legal & General and property investor Patron Capital
Advisers LLP will each take a 46.5 percent stake in the
business, with Cala’s management acquiring 7 percent, the
London-based company said in a statement today. The deal, which
is financed with 140 million pounds of equity and 70 million
pounds of debt, will contribute to earnings in the first year.  “At our preliminary results, we identified direct
investment as one of our five drivers of growth,” Wadham Downing, group mergers and acquisitions and strategy director at
Legal & General, said in a statement. “We will continue our
evolution as a group by combining our strength in organic growth
with selected bolt-on acquisitions.”  Cala had gross assets of 354 million pounds at the end of
June and a full-year pretax profit of 11.4 million pounds.  Legal & General on March 6 raised its dividend 20 percent
after sales, cash flow and operating profit increased on demand
for retirement products. The Cala deal forms part of a strategy
to target “socially useful projects” such as housing and
transport that deliver high rates of return, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
