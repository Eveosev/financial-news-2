Von Roll Holding AG (ROL)  declined the
most in two months as the Swiss maker of electrical insulation
and transformers said its 2015 forecasts would need to be
adjusted due to worsening conditions.  The stock fell as much as 6 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since Jan. 18. Shares of the Waedenswil-based company
traded 4.2 percent lower at 2.05 Swiss francs as of of 11:17
a.m. in Zurich. Trading volume was 15 percent above the three-
month daily average.  Von Roll said a full-year operating loss of 50.1 million
francs ($53.1 million) was mainly due to writedowns at two
acquired companies. Margins at the transformer business in
 Israel  and the Shenzhen insulations unit in  China  fell short of
assumptions at the time of purchase, Von Roll said in a
 statement .  “Confidence in the new management and the turnaround is
gone,” Andy Schnyder, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich
said in a note to clients. “The future of Von Roll is uncertain
and the stock is not cheap,” he added. Schnyder has a hold
rating on the stock.  The manufacturer said it will have to change the timeframe
of targets  announced  last year, which include reaching 800
million francs in sales and increasing the margin on gross
profit to 24 percent by 2015.  Von Roll appointed Achim Klotz as chief executive officer
on Dec. 18. His predecessor, Matthias Oppermann, left after just
nine months at the helm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
