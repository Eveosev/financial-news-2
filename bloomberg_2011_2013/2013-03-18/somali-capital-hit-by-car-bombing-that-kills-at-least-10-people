A car loaded with explosives blew
up in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 10 people
in an attack the country’s al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabaab, said
was an attempt to kill the government’s spy chief.  The car hit a passenger bus traveling in Hamar Weyne, close
to the presidential palace and national theater, Prime Minister
Abdi Farah Shirdon said in an e-mailed statement. Another 15
people were wounded, according the statement. Most were
civilians, police officer Colonel Hassan Mohamed said by phone.  “One of our Martyrs’ Brigade targeted a suicide attack on
the head of intelligence for the apostate government Khalif
Ahmed Erig,” al-Shabaab said in statement posted on the
somalimemo.com website.  The al-Qaeda linked Islamist group has been driven from
most of its main strongholds in the country by African Union and
Somali soldiers. The combined forces started an offensive in
2011, to create the necessary security for a transitional
government to become a permanent one.  The Horn of  Africa  nation in September elected Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud president, marking the 16th attempt to establish
an effective national administration since 1991. Previous
efforts failed to stem clan-based infighting, rampant piracy off
Africa’s longest coastline and al-Shabaab’s insurgency, which
has been fighting since at least 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
