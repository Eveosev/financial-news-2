Lithuania’s ruling coalition
increased its majority in the country’s 141-member parliament by
winning repeat votes for three mandates yesterday.  Premier Algirdas Butkevicius’s Social Democrat Party won
ballots in two of the contested districts, boosting its total to
40 seats, the Electoral Commission in the capital Vilnius said
today on its website. Order & Justice won in the third district,
giving it 10 seats in the legislature.  After parliamentary elections in October, the Baltic
nation’s highest court said votes in two single-mandate
districts were invalid due to violations. Repeat voting in a
third district was needed due to the death of a lawmaker from
the Order & Justice party.  Butkevicius’s government, which also includes the Labor
Party, with 29 seats, and the Lithuanian Polish Election Action,
with eight, took office on Dec. 13. The coalition holds 87 seats
in the chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
