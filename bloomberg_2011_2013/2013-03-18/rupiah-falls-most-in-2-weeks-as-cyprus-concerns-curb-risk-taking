Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
two weeks as investors favored safer bets than emerging-market
assets amid concern an unprecedented levy on bank deposits in
Cyprus will reignite  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
10 most-active Asian currencies excluding the yen, sank to a
five-month low after European finance ministers reached an
agreement on March 16 to force depositors in Cypriot banks to
share the cost of the latest bailout. Indonesia’s exchange rate
can be managed through intervention, controlling the supply of
foreign currency and forming an onshore spot reference, Perry
Warjiyo, who was approved by lawmakers to become a deputy
governor at the central bank, said on March 15.  “The rupiah is weighed by across-the-board declines in
Asian currencies due to short-term risk aversion,” said
Suriyanto Chang, the head of treasury at PT Bank QNB Kesawan in
Jakarta. “There is huge potential that if the rupiah dips below
9,730 per dollar that the central bank may step in and try to
smoothen the weakening.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 9,723 per dollar as of
9:34 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. That is the biggest decline since March 4. One-
month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.2 percent to 9,758,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,704 per dollar on March 15 by the Association of Banks in
 Singapore , compared with 9,702 the previous day. Today’s rate
will be published at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 38 basis
points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 5.81 percent.  The yield on the government’s bonds maturing in May 2023
was steady at 5.47 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield on notes due in 2033 lost nine basis
points today to 6.24 percent, the most since Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
