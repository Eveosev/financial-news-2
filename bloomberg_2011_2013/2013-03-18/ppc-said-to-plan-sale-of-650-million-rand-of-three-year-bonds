PPC Ltd. (PPC) ,  South Africa ’s largest
cement maker, is planning to sell three-year bonds later this
month, according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  The auction of 650 million rand ($70.65 million) worth of
securities is scheduled for March 28, said the people, who asked
not to be identified as details of the sale haven’t been made
public. The issue is part of a medium-term note issue program
“which will be utilized towards the company’s funding
requirements,” the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement last month.  The cement maker, which is facing increased competition in
South Africa, is expanding outside its domestic market and is
looking for acquisitions. The company plans to announce two
deals this year, its Chief Executive Officer Ketso Gordhan said
in an interview in January.  PPC declined as much as 2.8 percent to 32.55 rand, the
lowest in almost a month, and was 1.8 percent lower by 2.47 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The stock has fallen 3.7 percent this year,
compared with a 3 percent gain for the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share
Index (JALSH) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Azola Lowan, an investor relations manager at PPC, didn’t
immediately answer a call to her office in Johannesburg or reply
to an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
