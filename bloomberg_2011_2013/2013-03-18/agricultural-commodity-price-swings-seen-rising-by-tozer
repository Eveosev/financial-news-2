Farm-commodity price swings are set
to increase on tight supply, said Bruce Tozer, a consultant at
De Novo Agricultura and former head of EMEA sales for soft and
agricultural products at  Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)  He spoke at a
commodity-industry meeting in Geneva organized by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  On speculation in agricultural commodities, price swings and
regulation:  “If you took away all derivatives you would still have
volatility, as you see in commodities that don’t have futures
markets. Physical markets without futures markets are
experiencing high levels of price volatility, so there is
something happening over and above financialization.  ‘‘Evidence for and against is contradictory and view-
dependent. So regulation is likely to be view-dependent and
based on the strongest voice. Beware of polemical debates and
easy conclusions. If we drive liquidity out of these markets, we
risk driving finance out.  ‘‘If you want to reduce volatility in the agricultural
market, you have to increase supply. Volatility is likely to
rise, not reduce. Supply-side issues are getting more acute, not
less acute.’’  On water as a commodity:  ‘‘I don’t think you’ll see a global commodity market in
water. It’s too regionalized, too dependent on local watersheds,
too strategic. There has to be a huge effort of pricing water in
local markets better, so it isn’t wasted. It’s going to be more
valuable than oil.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
