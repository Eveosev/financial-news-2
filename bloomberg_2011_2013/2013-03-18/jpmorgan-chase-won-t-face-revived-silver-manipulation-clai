JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  won a judge’s
ruling rejecting a bid to revive claims that it manipulated
silver futures and options prices in violation of U.S. antitrust
law.  U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in  Manhattan  said
yesterday that a group of investors suing the bank can’t file a
new complaint in the case, ruling that they failed to address
legal shortcomings that convinced him to dismiss the case in
December.  “None of the allegations added by plaintiffs in the
proposed amended complaint cure the pleading deficiencies that
led to the dismissal of plaintiffs’ first complaint for failure
to state a claim,” Patterson wrote in a 12-page ruling today.  The investors claimed that JPMorgan conspired to suppress
silver futures so that  call options , or the right to buy, would
decline, and put options for the right to sell would increase.
They sought to represent a class of thousands of people and
companies that held or traded silver futures and options on June
26, 2007, or from March 17, 2008, to Oct. 27, 2010.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on yesterday’s ruling. Christopher Lovell, a lawyer for
the investors, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message
seeking comment after regular business hours.  The case is In re Commodity Exchange Inc. Silver Futures
and Options Trading Litigation, 11-cv-2213, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
