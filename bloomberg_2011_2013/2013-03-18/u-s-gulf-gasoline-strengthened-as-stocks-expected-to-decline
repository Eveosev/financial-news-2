U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened against futures as analysts projected stockpiles of
the motor fuel would decline for a sixth week.  Stocks are expected to drop nationwide by 1.75 million
barrels in the week ended March 15, according to six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Motor fuel inventories  on the
Gulf  reached the lowest level last week since Oct. 26 as
Phillips 66â€™s 247,000-barrel-a-day Sweeny refinery was in the
process of restarting units following a  power failure .  Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, on the Gulf strengthened 1
cent to a discount of  17.5 cents  a gallon against futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:54 p.m. Conventional,
87-octane gasoline on the Gulf strengthened 0.5 cent to a
discount of  21.25 cents  a gallon.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a measure of  refining
profitability  for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slid 0.78 cent to $30.50 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
