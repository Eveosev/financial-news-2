AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  will cut about
1,600 jobs as it overhauls research and development, leading to
$1.4 billion in costs as new Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot tries to revive the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker.  AstraZeneca will focus research in Cambridge,  England ;
Gaithersburg,  Maryland ; and Moelndal,  Sweden , the company said
in a  statement  today. Astra also will move its corporate
headquarters from London to Cambridge, where it plans to spend
$500 million on a new facility.  The jobs to be eliminated equal roughly 3.1 percent of
AstraZeneca’s workforce of about 51,700 at the end of December.
The plan will help improve research productivity at AstraZeneca,
said Soriot, who was named CEO last year, replacing  David Brennan , after a series of drug-development setbacks.  The announcement means “a strong commitment to the U.K.”
and “that we believe the science is strong in Cambridge,”
Soriot said in a telephone interview today. “We wanted to come
closer to outstanding science.”  Soriot said another priority of the reorganization is to
“bring closer to one another” researchers working on drugs
made from human cells, known as biologicals, with those working
on medicines based on chemical compounds.  The overhaul shows the influence of MedImmune Inc., the
American biotechnology company acquired by AstraZeneca in 2007,
according to Eric Le Berrigaud, an analyst at Bryan Garnier &
Co. in Paris. MedImmune, based in Gaithersburg, had a research
site in Cambridge.  Strategy Update  “MedImmune is becoming central in AstraZeneca’s R&D
organization,” he said by phone. “The initial impressions --
that MedImmune people are gaining power within the company, that
Astra wants to grow bigger in biologics --seem to be
confirmed.” He recommends buying AstraZeneca shares.  The stock fell 0.7 percent to close at 3,049.50 pence in
 London  today.  AstraZeneca will discuss the plan with employees in coming
days before it briefs investors and analysts on strategy in  New
York  on March 21, Soriot said in the interview. The
restructuring, which will be completed by 2016, will lead to
$1.4 billion in one-time charges, of which $800 million will be
cash expenses, AstraZeneca said.  The company predicted cost savings of about $190 million a
year by 2016 from the measures.  Life Sciences  AstraZeneca forecast in January that sales will fall by a
“mid- to high-single digit” percentage this year on increasing
competition from lower-priced generic medicines. Profit will
decline “significantly” more than revenue, the company said.
AstraZeneca in October suspended its share buyback program so it
would have more funds to invest in the business.  Drugs that account for more than 40 percent of
AstraZeneca’s sales lose patent protection by the end of next
year, and the company suffered setbacks in developing new
products in recent years.  AstraZeneca’s U.K. research will be consolidated in
Cambridge, a “world-renowned center for life sciences,” the
company said. About 1,600 jobs will be moved from Alderley Park
in Cheshire, with the bulk of those going to Cambridge, the
company said. It will keep at least 700 non-research jobs at
Alderley Park.  Acquisition Hunt  Gaithersburg will be home to much of the company’s U.S.-
based drug development, as well as jobs in global marketing and
sales of U.S. specialty-care drugs. About 1,200 jobs will be
moved from Wilmington,  Delaware , which will remain North
American commercial headquarters, with about 2,000 people.  Moelndal, near Gothenburg in Sweden, will continue to be a
global research center focusing on chemical compounds, the
 company  said. Of the total 1,600 job cuts, about 650 will be in
the U.S.  The reorganization shouldn’t be interpreted as a step
leading to a big acquisition, Soriot said.  “We are still open to the idea of a larger deal” if the
company were to find something “that makes sense, but it’s a
low probability,” the 53-year-old CEO said during the
interview. “We can return to growth with what we have in our
hands.”  AstraZeneca will complement the existing assets with “a
series of business development deals and small, bolt-on
acquisitions,” Soriot added. “From now on I will be spending
an enormous amount of time working on this, because it is one of
our priorities,” Soriot said, referring to partnerships and
acquisitions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
