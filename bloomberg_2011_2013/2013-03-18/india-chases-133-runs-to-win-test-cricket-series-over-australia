India  needs 133 runs to secure a
Test series cricket victory against  Australia  after bowling out
the touring team for 223 after lunch on the final day of the
third match in Mohali.  India, which is seeking to regain the Border-Gavaskar
trophy after a 4-0 sweep of losses in Australia in 2011-12, has
a minimum of 27 overs in which to get the runs and go 3-0 up in
the four-match contest.  Bhuvneshwar Kumar finished as India’s best bowler, taking
3-31, with left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja picking up 3-35.
Phil Hughes top scored with 69 for Australia, which had resumed
at 75-3 in its second innings.  Mitchell Starc was out for 35 after combining with Xavier
Doherty to hold up India’s victory push with a 44-run stand for
the last wicket, the biggest partnership of the innings.  Cricket Australia said vice-captain  Shane Watson , who
returned home for the birth of his first child after being among
a group of four players suspended for the match for disciplinary
reasons, will rejoin the squad for the final Test, which starts
March 22 in Delhi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
