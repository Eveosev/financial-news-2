Airbus SAS is set to announce an
order from  Indonesia ’s PT Lion Mentari Airlines for more than
200 single-aisle aircraft valued at more than $20 billion, two
people familiar with the agreement said.  The order, to be unveiled at a ceremony this morning at the
French presidential palace in Paris, will include current-
generation A320s as well as planes from the newer A320neo
series, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the accord hasn’t been made public.  The Indonesian carrier needs more aircraft as it adds
flights in a region where air travel is expected to grow more
than 6.4 percent annually through 2031. Lion Air, which flies to
more than 36 destinations within Indonesia and overseas, is
establishing a low-cost carrier in Malaysia to challenge  AirAsia
Bhd. (AIRA) , Airbus’s biggest A320 customer.  Airbus spokeswoman Marcella Muratore declined to comment.
Officials at Lion Air couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment. French newspaper Les Echos earlier reported that Airbus
is set to announce the order, without saying where it obtained
the information.  The Asian airline had already signed a record order with
 Boeing Co. (BA)  for 230 additional 737s in February last year. That
deal was worth $22.4 billion at list prices. The purchase, which
also included 150 options, was Boeing’s biggest in dollar value
and plane numbers at the time.  Major Orders  Airbus has won major orders for its bestselling A320 family
of planes in the past week, including 100 purchases from
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and an order from  Turkish Airlines (THYAO)  for 82
A320-series planes worth $9.3 billion at list price. Customers
typically buy aircraft at discount.  An order in excess of 200 aircraft from Lion Air would help
the carrier break into the ranks of the Top 5 operators of
Airbus single-aisle planes, after AirAsia BHD, Lufthansa,
India’s IndiGo and EasyJet Plc.  Surging demand has allowed Airbus to take in about half the
number of orders in the first quarter alone that it captured in
all of 2012 for its A320 and A320neo series. Airbus won orders
for 305 of the A320 series and another 478 for the A320neo last
year.  The neo variant will offer a choice between engines by
 United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney or by CFM
International, a joint venture between  General Electric Co. (GE)  and
 Safran SA (SAF)  of France.  To contact the reporters on this story:
