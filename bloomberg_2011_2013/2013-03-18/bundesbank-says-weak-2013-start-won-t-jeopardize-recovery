The German economy’s recovery
hasn’t been jeopardized by a weak start to the year, the
 Bundesbank  said.  “At the beginning of the year, the German economy fell
short of expectations, which were raised by calmer financial
markets and an improvement of confidence among businesses,” the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report
published today. At the same time, “the slow start into 2013
doesn’t put the outlook for an economic recovery into
question,” it said.  Stagnating industrial production and a slump in factory
orders at the beginning of the year stand in contrast to four
months of improving  business confidence . The Bundesbank last
month predicted the German economy will return to growth in the
current quarter after a 0.6 percent contraction in the final
three months of last year.  While survey data suggest that exports and factory output
may help the German economy gather momentum, businesses are
still hesitant to spend money, the Bundesbank said. “There’s no
significant improvement on the horizon when it comes to
companies’ investment activity,” it said.  The Bundesbank expects the economy to grow 0.4 percent this
year, according to its December projections. For the euro area,
 Germany ’s largest export market, the  European Central Bank  this
month cut its forecasts and now predicts a 0.5 contraction in
2013 and growth of 1 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
