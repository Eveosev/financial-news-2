Hungary  should take back a
government award granted to television journalist Ferenc
Szaniszlo because of anti-Semitic remarks he made, Israel’s
Ambassador to Budapest Ilan Mor said.  Human Resources Minister Zoltan Balog awarded the Tancsics
prize on March 14 to Szaniszlo, a television journalist on
private television station Echo TV. The media regulator in 2010
 ordered  the temporary suspension of the station after ruling
that Szaniszlo’s “broad anti-Hungarian conspiracies” incited
hatred against minorities including Jews.  “This man and his ideas must be rejected and should not
have been awarded,” Mor said in an e-mailed statement today,
adding that Szaniszlo’s remarks were part of “new
antisemitism” in  Europe  which Hungary risked legitimizing.  Balog said he didn’t know about Szaniszlo’s remarks when
awarding the prize to him and said they were “irreconcilable”
with his beliefs, MTI state news service reported on March 14,
citing the minister’s statement. Balog said that while he
wouldn’t give it to Szaniszlo again, he had no way to revoke the
award, MTI said.  “While  Israel  and Hungary are cooperating in fighting
against antisemitism, such awards might cause negative
impression and lead us to the wrong direction,” Mor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
