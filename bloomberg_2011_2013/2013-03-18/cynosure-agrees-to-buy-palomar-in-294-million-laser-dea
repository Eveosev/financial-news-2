Cynosure Inc. (CYNO) , which makes lasers
for medical and cosmetic treatments, agreed to acquire
competitor  Palomar Medical Technologies Inc. (PMTI)  for $294 million in
cash and shares.  The deal will give investors of Burlington, Massachusetts-
based Palomar $13.65 a share, half in cash and half in stock of
Westford, Massachusetts-based Cynosure, the companies said in a
statement today. That represents an 8.2 percent premium to the
March 15 closing price of Palomar  shares .  Cynosure will have more than 20,000 cosmetic laser systems
installed in 100 countries after the acquisition is complete,
the companies said. Often located in doctors’ offices, the
devices are used for hair and tattoo removal, scar treatment,
and laser liposuction, according to the companies’ websites.  “Combining with Palomar complements our product portfolio
and customer base, adding new product and service revenues,
strengthening our global distribution network, creating new
cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our intellectual
property position,” Cynosure Chief Executive Officer Michael Davin said in the statement.  The acquisition should be completed in the third quarter
and lead to $8 million to $10 million in cost savings, the
company said.  Cynosure fell 4.8 percent to $27.10 at the close in  New
York . Palomar  shares  gained 4.4 percent to $13.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
