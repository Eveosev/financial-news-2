The Canadian dollar posted its
biggest drop in more than a week against its U.S. peer as an
unprecedented levy on deposits in Cyprus’s banks threatened to
throw  Europe  back into crisis and soured risk appetite.  The currency fell against the majority of its 16 most-
traded peers as Cypriot lawmakers delayed voting on a 5.8
billion euro ($7.5 billion) levy demanded by fellow euro-zone
countries to secure a bailout aimed at preventing financial
collapse and a possible exit from the shared currency. Crude
oil,  Canada ’s biggest export, fell along with global stocks.  “We seem to be back to the good old risk-on, risk-off
trading,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank, said by phone from Toronto. “The correlation
between the Canadian dollar and risk assets weakened
substantially in the beginning of the year, but those
correlations seem to have picked up substantially over the
course of the past few weeks, and I think the clear focus is the
uncertainty of this situation in Cyprus.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the C$1 coin, fell 0.4 percent to C$1.0233 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:06  a.m. in Toronto, after earlier falling 0.6 percent, it’s
biggest intraday drop since March 6. One loonie buys 97.72 U.S.
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
