Midland Holdings Ltd. (1200) , the biggest
realtor listed in  Hong Kong , headed for its biggest decline in
more than four months after saying the city’s property brokers
may close as many as one third of their branches.  Midland  fell  as much as 5.1 percent to HK$3.34 and traded
at HK$3.35 as of 10:38 a.m. in Hong Kong. The stock headed for
its biggest drop since Oct. 29. The shares have lost 9.5 percent
this year, compared with a 2.5 percent decline in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index .  Hong Kong’s property brokers may cut as many as a third of
their branches and agents if government curbs on  home prices 
continue, the company’s chief analyst Buggle Lau said in an
interview yesterday. The city’s government has imposed a raft of
measures including a tax on foreign buyers and higher mortgage
down payment requirement in the past six months to contain
 prices  that have doubled since early 2009.  Midland had its rating cut to sell from neutral by Bocom
International Holdings Co. analyst Alfred Lau. Overall property
transaction volume will decelerate because of government
measures, Lau said in a note to clients today.  Only one transaction of existing homes was recorded in 10
of Hong Kong’s biggest private residential development tracked
by Centaline Property Agency Ltd. over the weekend of March 16
and 17, the realtor said.  About 12,000 agents could lose their jobs, said Lau. The
comments were first made by Midland Deputy Chairman Angela Wong
at a March 15 briefing, according to local media including the
 South China Morning Post .  Midland on March 15 reported 2012 net income nearly doubled
to HK$250 million ($32 million) on higher commission fees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
