SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) , the Indian discount
carrier operating an all-Boeing Co. fleet, said it may consider
a full switch to  Airbus SAS  aircraft as it weighs options for a
new generation of planes.  “As long as you can manage the implications and the risks
that you’re taking and there’s enough money in it” the company
would consider the switch, Chief Executive Officer Neil Mills
said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday. The carrier currently
has 37 Boeing 737 aircraft and plans to add seven more of the
planes this year, he said.  A switch by SpiceJet would further tilt  India ’s budget
airline fleet market share in favor of Airbus, whose planes are
used by IndiGo, India’s biggest domestic carrier by market share,
and Go Airlines (India) Ltd. Such a move could further hurt
 Boeing (BA)  as it works to implement safety upgrades to its 787
Dreamliner to end a two-month grounding of the fleet after a
smoking battery forced an emergency landing Jan. 16.  Mills was part of the EasyJet Plc team that in 2002 oversaw
the start of a transition at the U.K. carrier from an all-Boeing
fleet to Airbus aircraft. EasyJet had 75 aircraft when it
started the transition toward an Airbus fleet, Mills said.  SpiceJet will consider Airbus A320neos to replace its
Boeing fleet, he said. “It’s the new generation of aircraft
that offers the next level of technology,” Mills said.  737 Max  Shares of the budget airline fell 1.2 percent to 33.5
rupees as of 11:10 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock has declined 24
percent this year.  Boeing, based in  Chicago , didn’t offer an immediate
response to an e-mail seeking comments.  The planemaker said last month it’s in talks with SpiceJet
and Jet Airways (India) Ltd. to sell its 737 Max single-aisle
aircraft as the plane maker forecast Indian carriers would need
1,450 new planes through 2031.  Boeing has 1,064 firm orders globally for the 737 Max
single-aisle planes, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president for
India and Asia Pacific sales, said last month. In comparison,
Airbus had 1,734 firm orders for the A320neos as of Dec. 31.  In 2011, IndiGo firmed up an order for 150 A320neos and 30
of the existing version of the A320, while GoAir confirmed a
deal for 72 A320neos.  SpiceJet’s Mills said the carrier will separately consider
adding as many as five  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  Q400 turboprops to expand
its regional flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
