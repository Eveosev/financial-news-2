Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, will soon
announce where it will make new cigarettes that it says pose a
lower health risk, said Chief Financial Officer Jacek Olczak.  “We are very close to making a decision on where to place
our manufacturing facility,” he told analysts at a conference
in  London  today, without elaborating further. “We should be
ready with the commercialization in 2016-2017.”  The company is developing three products that would be sold
under existing brands such as Marlboro, and the most advanced is
a product that heats tobacco rather than burning it. Still, it
may be beaten to the market by  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ,
which on Feb. 28 said it may sell an alternative nicotine
product in the U.K. as early as next year.  Tobacco companies have spent decades trying to develop a
safer alternative to smoking, including a 1988 test of Premier,
a heated-tobacco smokeless cigarette that its maker, now called
 Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) , dropped in about a year. Philip Morris
and BAT are accelerating the development of such products amid
stricter government constraints on smoking.  Olczak said Philip Morris will increase invest 500 million
euros ($647 million) to 600 million euros in capital expenditure
over three years for the new products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
