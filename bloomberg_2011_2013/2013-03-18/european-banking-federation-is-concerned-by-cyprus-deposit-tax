The European Banking Federation
said the levy planned for bank savings in Cyprus may spark
uncertainty and hurt small depositors.  The group, representing 4,500 European banks, is “very
concerned” that the agreement to tax Cyprus deposits includes
those falling within the European deposit guarantee threshold of
100,000 euros ($129,380), the Brussels-based organization said
in a statement today.  “This decision could harm small depositors and may
generate the kind of uncertainty our economy does not need in
the current circumstances,” EBF Chief Executive Officer Guido Ravoet said.  Finance ministers in the euro area reached an agreement on
March 16 forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share the costs
of the region’s latest bailout. The measures would raise 5.8
billion euros by taking a piece of every bank account in the
country. The euro weakened to its lowest level this year, while
the  Stoxx 600 Banks Index (SX7P)  dropped as much as 2.4 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since March 1.  The planned levy -- 6.75 percent on all deposits of as much
as 100,000 euros and 9.9 percent above that -- would whittle
down the euro area’s bailout of Cyprus to 10 billion euros from
17 billion euros, near the size of the nation’s 18-billion-euro
economy. Deposits of less than 100,000 euros fall under European
account insurance.  Ravoet said Cyprus is in a “particular situation due to
the importance of the banking sector in its economy.”  European policy makers signaled flexibility on the
application of the levy as long as the targeted amount is
raised, leaving room to ease costs for smaller savers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
