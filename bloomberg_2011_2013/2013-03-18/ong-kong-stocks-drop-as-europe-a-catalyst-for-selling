Hong Kong  stocks  dropped, with the
city’s benchmark index falling to the lowest in almost four
months, as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  led declines among financial shares
after Cyprus agreed to an unprecedented tax on  bank deposits  to
fund a euro-zone bailout.  The Hang Seng Index slipped 2 percent to 22,083.36, the
lowest close since Dec. 4. More than four shares fell for each
that rose in the 50-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies lost 2.1 percent. The
measure fell 12 percent from a Feb. 1 high, entering a so-called
correction, on heightened concern China will introduce more
property curbs after  home prices  posted the broadest advance
since December 2011.  HSBC, Europe’s biggest lender, slid 2.3 percent, the
biggest decrease in a month.  Tingyi (322)  (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp., PepsiCo Inc.’s bottling partner in China, sank 3.8
percent after posting full-year profit that trailed estimates.
Trading volume on the Hang Seng Index was 27 percent above the
30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The inevitable bailout of Cyprus has come and that’s
setting a precedent that isn’t great,” said  Angus Gluskie ,
managing director at Sydney-based White Funds Management, which
oversees more than $350 million. “Its financial impact is
negligible but markets are reacting negatively because people
have been looking for a reason to sell. The Chinese situation is
a much more pertinent issue.”  Housing Curbs  The Hang Seng Index retreated 2.4 percent last week after
inflation rose at the fastest pace in 10 months and People’s
Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said monetary policy is
“no longer relaxed.”  The  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP)  fell 7.5 percent in the past
five days after the city’s lenders increased  mortgage rates  and
amid reports some of China’s biggest cities are doing more to
curb property-price increases.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures slid 1.3 percent to 22,047. The  HSI
Volatility Index (VHSI)  jumped 18 percent to 18.01, the most since July
23 and indicating traders expect a swing of 5.2 percent for the
equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  The Hang Seng Index, the worst performing developed-market
benchmark gauge this year outside of Italy, retreated 7.3
percent from a 21-month high on Jan. 30.  The benchmark equity measure traded at 10.7 times  estimated
earnings , compared with 14.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cypriot Bailout  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades bowed to demands by
euro-area finance ministers to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5
billion) to help fund a bailout by taking a piece of every bank
account in Cyprus. The president delayed a vote on the measure
in parliament until today, a day later than planned, as he seeks
more time to persuade lawmakers to back him.  Companies that do business in Europe declined.  HSBC (5)  slid
2.3 percent to HK$84.15.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-based
clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market, dropped 2.2
percent to HK$9.10. Li & Fung decreased 3.4 percent to HK$10.30.  China’s property developers extended losses as data showing
rising new home prices fanned speculation the government will
impose more property curbs.  “Fast-rising home prices have put the government under a
lot of pressure,” said Ding Shuang, a senior China economist
with Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong. “We are expecting more
property policies in the next couple of months.”  Developers Drop  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , controlled by billionaire
Hui Wing Mao, slid 1.4 percent to HK$12.96. Guangzhou R&F
Properties Co. lost 2.4 percent to HK$11.32. Agile Property
Holdings Ltd. dropped 1.6 percent to HK$8.88.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., the biggest Chinese
developer by market value listed in  Hong Kong , slipped 2.1
percent to HK$21.10, paring losses of as much as 4.2 percent.
The company said during the midday break that 2012 profit
climbed 21 percent on gains from property revaluations and the
sales of stakes in some projects.  Midland Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest realtor, plunged
4 percent to HK$3.38, after saying the city’s property brokers
may cut as much as a third of their branches and agents if
government curbs on home prices continue.  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., Hong Kong’s second-biggest
real estate company by market value, fell 1.7 percent to
HK$111.10. New World Development Co., the Hong Kong builder
controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , slipped 1.7 percent to
HK$13.04. Sino Land Co. dropped 3.8 percent to HK$12.68.  Challenging Environment  JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its recommendation on China’s
shares to underweight from neutral. The nation’s policy
environment is challenging amid slower growth and concern about
inflation,  Adrian Mowat , the investment bank’s Asia and
emerging-market strategist, wrote in a report dated today.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  fell 1 percent. The U.S. equity
gauge last week rose to within two points of its record high as
government data showed jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to
the lowest level in almost two months.  Tingyi, which also makes instant noodles, dropped 3.8
percent to HK$19.96. The company reported a full-year net profit
of $455 million, missing the average estimate of $530.6 million
by 20 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the government-backed
partner of brewer SABMiller Plc, declined 3 percent to HK$23.90.
The company is expected to report on March 21 a full-year
adjusted net income of HK$1.88 billion ($242 million), according
to the average estimate of 14 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
That compares with HK$2.83 billion in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
