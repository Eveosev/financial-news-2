Global cocoa demand will outstrip
supply until 2014-2015 because of pests, disease and aging
plantations, said the International Cocoa Organization.  “We now have what we call a structural deficit because
cocoa trees are old, farmers are old,” Executive Director Jean- Marc Anga said at a conference in  Indonesia  today. “We will
find ourselves in five to 10 years where cocoa producers are too
old to tend to their farms without the youth taking over.” The
organization expects a deficit of 45,000 metric tons in the
2012-2013 year ending September.  The shortage may support prices that fell 5.4 percent this
year in  New York  and dropped to a nine-month low on March 7.
Processors are expanding capacity to grind beans for use in
chocolate in response to demand. The market is expanding 2
percent to 3 percent a year, says Zurich-based  Barry Callebaut
AG (BARN) , the biggest maker of bulk chocolate. Demand has exceeded
supply in 10 of the past 20 years, ICCO data show.  Consumers in producing countries are also realizing the
benefit of eating chocolate, said Anga. The content of cocoa in
confectionery has also increased in the past 10 years in
traditional markets such as  Europe  and the U.S., he said.  World grindings will climb 1.5 percent in 2012-2013 from a
year earlier as production drops 1.8 percent,  ICCO  data show.
The market had a surplus of 86,000 tons in 2011-2012.  Futures in New York dropped 0.7 percent to close at $2,115
a ton on March 15 on ICE Futures US.  To contact the reporters on this story:
