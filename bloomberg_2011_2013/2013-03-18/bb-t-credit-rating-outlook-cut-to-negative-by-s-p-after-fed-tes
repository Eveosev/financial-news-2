BB&T Corp., North Carolina’s
second-biggest bank, had the outlook on its  credit rating  cut to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor’s after the Federal
Reserve objected to the lender’s capital plan.  The Fed’s rejection “reflected unanticipated weaknesses in
certain of BB&T’s risk-management processes,” S&P said today in
a statement. BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, said last week it
will resubmit its plan “as soon as feasible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
