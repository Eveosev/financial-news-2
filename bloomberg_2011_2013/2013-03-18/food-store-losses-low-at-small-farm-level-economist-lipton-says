Food-storage losses for small-
holder farmers in developing markets are “extremely low,”
according to Michael Lipton, a development economist and
research professor at the U.K.’s  Sussex University .  “On the storage question, there is a great gap between the
general belief and the scientific reality,” Lipton said at a
commodity-industry conference in Geneva. “The general belief is
that small households have enormous food storage losses.”  Studies in  Bangladesh ,  India  and sub-Saharan Africa found
“extremely low” storage losses at small-holder farmers for
commodities including corn, sorghum, millet and rice, in the
order of 5 percent to 8 percent, according to Lipton.  The “very big losses” happen at big accumulators such as
the Food Corp. of India and in railway transport to end users,
Lipton said at the meeting, organized by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
