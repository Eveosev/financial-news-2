Commodities fell by the most in two
weeks as outrage in Cyprus rekindled concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis may deepen, hurting demand prospects for raw materials
from oil to copper. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24
raw materials fell 0.3 percent to 650.3, the first decline in
three days.  BASE METALS  Copper fell to a four-month low in  New York  as a levy on
 bank deposits  in Cyprus stoked concern that Europe’s debt crisis
will worsen.  Depositors in Cypriot banks will be forced to share the
cost of the latest bailout under an accord reached March 16 by
euro-area finance ministers. Copper also slid as inventories
tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange climbed for a 23rd session.  Copper futures for delivery in May tumbled 2.6 percent to
settle at $3.428 a pound on the Comex in New York after touching
$3.4175, the lowest level since Nov. 9.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months slumped 2.3
