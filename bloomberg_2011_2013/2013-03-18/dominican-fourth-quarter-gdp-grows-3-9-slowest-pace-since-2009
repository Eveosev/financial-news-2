The  Dominican Republic ’s  economy 
grew at the slowest pace in three years in 2012 as manufacturing
and construction nearly stagnated in the Caribbean’s biggest
economy.  The Dominican Republic’s gross domestic product expanded
3.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the
central bank reported, led by a 42 percent surge in mining as
Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp (ABX) ’s $4 billion Pueblo Viejo mine
neared completion. Manufacturing rose 1 percent and construction
0.7 percent.  To trim a deficit estimated at 8.5 percent of GDP after the
previous government boosted spending ahead of a May election,
the legislature backed a plan to raise taxes to narrow the gap.
Most of the tariffs, which include a value-added tax increase to
18 percent from 16 percent, went into effect this year.  “Over the past two years, economic activity has
decelerated and macroeconomic imbalances have increased,” the
IMF said in a March 8 statement. “The large fiscal expansion
combined with the easing of monetary policy, and limited
exchange rate flexibility increased public sector debt, kept the
external current account deficit high, and fueled losses in
international reserves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
