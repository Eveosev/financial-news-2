Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the offshore rig
contractor criticized by billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , said
the board wants investors to vote against his dividend proposal
and three director nominees.  “The board believes the dividend proposed by Mr. Icahn
would adversely affect the company’s ability to operate and
compete effectively in a cyclical and capital-intensive
industry,” Transocean said today in a statement. “The election
of Mr. Icahn’s candidates -- who are hand-picked to pursue his
potentially damaging short-term agenda -- is not in the best
interest of the company and all of its stakeholders.”  Icahn, the largest shareholder in the Vernier, Switzerland-
based company, proposed March 7 that John Lipinski, Jose Maria Alapont and Samuel Merksamer be added to the board. He will also
ask investors at the annual meeting on May 17 to vote in favor
of a $4-a-share annual dividend, which he first proposed in
January.  Transocean said March 4 that the board would recommend
reinstating its dividend at $2.24 and boosting debt repayment.
The company also has defended its 13 board members and called
Icahn’s plan “overly aggressive.”  Today’s comments were the first recommendations from the
board on Icahn’s proposals. The board declined to make a
recommendation to shareholders regarding Icahn’s proposal to do
away with staggered terms for directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
