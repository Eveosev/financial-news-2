Thailand ’s baht fell by the most in
two weeks after a technical indicator signaled the dollar was
poised to rebound. Government bonds rose.  The currency retreated from its highest level since July
1997 as the greenback’s 14-day relative-strength index against
the baht reached 29.3 on March 15, below the 30 threshold that
suggested the Southeast Asian currency will reverse. It also
weakened as outrage in Cyprus over an unprecedented levy on  bank
deposits  threatened to plunge  Europe  back into crisis and
reduced demand for emerging-market assets.  “Some investors probably took profit” from recent gains
and “used the news on Cyprus as an excuse,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL) 
“The market is concerned about how it will handle the situation
in Cyprus but it may be only a short-term move.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 29.68 per dollar as of 9:15
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
earlier touched the 1997 high of 29.45. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.99 percent.  BNP Paribas SA entered a position of buying the  Singapore
dollar  versus the baht on March 15 at 23.68, targeting a gain to
24, because the Thai currency had overshot regional peers,
according to a research report dated the same day. The city-
state’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to 23.72 today. Thailand’s
central bank won’t “easily” allow the greenback to drop below
29.50 against the baht, it said.  Government bonds  advanced for a fifth day as international
investors increased holdings. The yield on Thailand’s 3.625
percent notes due June 2023 declined one basis point to 3.61
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 27, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Global funds  bought  almost $2 billion more sovereign
securities than they sold last week, compared with $2.7 billion
net purchases for the whole of February, according to data from
the Thai Bond Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
