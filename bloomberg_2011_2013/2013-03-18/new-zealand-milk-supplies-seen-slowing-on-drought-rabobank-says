Milk production in  New Zealand , the
world’s biggest exporter, will continue to slow as the most
widespread drought in at least three decades curbs supplies,
according to Rabobank International.  Supplies may be as much as 15 percent to 20 percent below a
year earlier through the third quarter, the bank said in a
report e-mailed today, without giving a specific forecast.
Production growth may be below 2 percent in the second half of
2013, it said.  A  drought  declared across the entire  North Island  may cost
NZ$2 billion ($1.6 billion) as the dry conditions threaten
economic growth, the government estimates. About 61 percent of
the country’s milk is produced on the North Island, Rabobank
estimates. Whole-milk powder prices have climbed 39 percent this
year amid supply concerns, while the government said March 15 it
is also watching parts of the  South Island  that are very dry.  “Milk supply has been falling below prior year levels
since February by an increasing margin with each week that
passes,” Rabobank said. Production will fall even further over
the remainder of the season, it said.  Cow slaughter increased almost 40 percent in the four
months to January from a year earlier, the bank said.  Growth in milk volumes will probably slow to 1 percent this
year after expanding 6 percent at the start of the season as the
drought hurts production,  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG)  chief
executive officer Theo Spierings said Feb. 27. The Auckland-
based company last month maintained its forecast payment to
10,500 farmer shareholders at NZ$5.50 per kilograms of milk
solids in the 2012-2013 season, citing the drought.  Whole milk  powder  for May delivery rose 19.3 percent, the
most since Sept. 1, 2010, according to a trade-weighted index on
Fonterra’s GlobalDairyTrade website on March 5. The near-term
contract for New Zealand product rose to $4,343 a ton, the
highest price since March 1, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
