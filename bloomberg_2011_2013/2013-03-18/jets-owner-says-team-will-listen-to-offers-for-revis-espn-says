New York  Jets owner Woody Johnson
said the team would listen to trade offers for All-Pro
cornerback Darrelle Revis, yet maintains they’re not actively
shopping their best defensive player, ESPN reported.  “If somebody wants to make an offer, for any of our
players, we’d always listen,” ESPN cited Johnson as telling
reporters at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix. “We’re not
actively beating the bushes.”  Revis, 27, played only two National Football League games
last year before tearing a knee ligament. He’s been seeking a
contract worth $16 million annually and ESPN said Revis received
a $1 million roster bonus over the weekend because he’s still on
the Jets’ roster. Jets General Manager John Idzik wouldn’t say
yesterday if he’s currently talking with other teams about a
trade for Revis, ESPN said.  “Any move that we contemplate with any player will be done
with the sole purpose of helping the New York Jets,” Idzik was
quoted as saying by ESPN. “So if there’s merit to that, we’ll
contemplate it. And if not, we’ll move on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
