Serbian police arrested the local
manager of Harsco Metals and 12 others on charges of illegally
selling steel scrap in Romania and Albania and causing 5.7
million euros ($7.4 million) of damages to  Serbia ’s sole steel
plant.  Instead of processing 200,000 tons of scrap as a contractor
for  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , the accused allegedly sold the
material abroad and returned “worthless tailing” to the
Smederevo-based steelworks, the government said on its  website
today.   A secretary at Harsco Metals said she couldn’t comment on
the charges when contacted by Bloomberg News. None of the
accused were immediately available, she said.  The move, involving forged documents, took place after the
government took the unprofitable steel plant back from  U.S.
Steel Corp. (X)  for $1 more than a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
