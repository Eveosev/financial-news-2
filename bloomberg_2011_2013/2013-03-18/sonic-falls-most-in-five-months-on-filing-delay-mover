Sonic Automotive Inc. (SAH) , the third-
largest public U.S. auto-dealership group, plunged the most in
three weeks after telling regulators it delayed the filing of
its annual report because of accounting at its dealerships.  Sonic fell 3.1 percent to $23.60 at the close in New York,
the biggest one-day decline since Feb. 25. The shares dropped as
much as 8.4 percent, the biggest intraday slide since Oct. 15.  Sonic said in a regulatory filing it believes that
financial results will be the same as reported on Feb. 20, when
the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company said that 2012
adjusted profit climbed 20 percent to $1.71 a share. U.S. auto
dealerships last year benefited from a 13 percent increase in
new light-vehicle sales, the biggest annual gain since 1984,
according to researcher Autodata Corp.  “The company has determined that a material weakness
existed in the effectiveness of controls over its dealership
level accounting processes resulting from the aggregation of
control deficiencies,” Sonic said today in the filing. The
company said that it plans to file its annual report within a
15-day extension period.  Sonic rose 13 percent this year through today, exceeding
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 8.8 percent increase.  AutoNation Inc. (AN)  and  Penske Automotive Group Inc. (PAG)  are the
two largest U.S. auto-dealership groups by number of new
vehicles sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
