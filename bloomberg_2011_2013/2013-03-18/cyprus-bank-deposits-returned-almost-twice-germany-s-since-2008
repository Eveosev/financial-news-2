Cyprus bank deposits returned more
than 24 percent over the past five years, almost double the
returns on comparable German accounts.  An investor who put $1,000 in a savings account in Cyprus
in January of 2008 and kept the funds there would have earned at
least $242 over five years, according to data from the Central
Bank of Cyprus. A comparable account in  Germany  would have
returned about $130, calculations based on Bundesbank data show.  “Banks in countries like Cyprus and  Greece  can pay higher
interest rates as they also earn more on loans,” Dirk Becker,
head of banking industry research at Kepler Capital Markets in
Frankfurt, said by phone. “In addition, Cyprus banks invested a
lot in high-yielding Greek debt in the past.”  Now Cypriot account holders may be forced to give money
back, as the government considers a deposit tax to raise 5.8
billion euros ($7.5 billion) and lessen the cost of a European
Union bailout of the banking system. A vote on the tax, needed
to secure 10 billion euros in rescue loans, was delayed for a
second day until tomorrow. Banks will remain shut through March
20 after a holiday today, a government official said.  German deposit rates fell to 1.5 percent in January of this
year from 4 percent five years earlier, Bundesbank data show, as
the European Central Bank lowered interest rates. Deposit rates
in Cyprus increased over the same period to 4.45 percent from
4.25 percent.  The ECB has lowered its main refinancing rate to 0.75
percent from 4 percent in January 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
