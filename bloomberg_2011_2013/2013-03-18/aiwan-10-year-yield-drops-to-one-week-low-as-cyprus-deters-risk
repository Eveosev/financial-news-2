Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
pushing the 10-year yield to a one-week low, as investors
favored the safest assets after an unprecedented levy on  bank
deposits  in Cyprus threatened to escalate  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The  Taiex index  dropped for a third day after euro-area
finance ministers reached an agreement on March 16 forcing
depositors in Cypriot banks to share in the cost of a 10 billion
euro ($13 billion) rescue plan. Taiwan sold NT$40 billion ($1.3
billion) of 20-year notes today at 1.847 percent, compared with
the 1.80 percent median estimate of fixed-income traders in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Cyprus is a relatively long-term risk to the market,”
said Stanford Chen, a fixed-income manager at KGI Securities Co.
in Taipei. “Insurers, who used to be the major buyers of long
bonds, have been quite eager to go overseas to diversify their
assets this year.”  The yield on the island’s 1.125 percent securities due
March 2023 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 1.28 percent in Taipei, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the lowest level since March 8.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.2 percent to NT$29.815 against its
U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.825 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 10, and
was trading 0.1 percent stronger two minutes before the 4 p.m.
close.  The monetary authority has sold the local currency in the
run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. Taiwan’s central bank
hasn’t devalued the local dollar continuously in the past 15
years, Governor Perng Fai-nan said today in response to
lawmakers’ questions.  One-month  non-deliverable forwards  fell 0.1 percent to
NT$29.74 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  over a month used to price options, rose 14 basis points to
3.46 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at
0.388 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
