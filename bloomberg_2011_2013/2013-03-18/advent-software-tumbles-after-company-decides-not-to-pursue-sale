Advent Software Inc. (ADVS) , a developer
of software and services for money managers, fell 5.2 percent in
 New York  trading after deciding not to pursue a sale of the
company.  After a strategic review, the board determined it was in
the best interest of Advent and investors to remain an
independent company, according to a statement today. Advent had
evaluated its options with financial adviser Qatalyst Partners
and the law firm  Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati .  “We engaged in a thorough process and carefully considered
various alternatives,” Chief Executive Officer Pete Hess said
in the statement. “The board believes we can best maximize
 shareholder value  through pursuing our current strategic plan.”  The move disappointed some shareholders, who were
anticipating a windfall from the company being acquired. Before
today’s tumble, the shares had climbed 35 percent this year.
Advent, which was founded in 1983, sells its financial software
to more than 4,500 firms in 60 countries.  Shares of the San Francisco-based company fell to $27.36 at
the close in New York, marking the biggest one-day decline since
Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
