Hedge funds  and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the fifth week to
the lowest in almost three months, according to  data  from the
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered long positions by 119,432 lots in
the week ended March 12, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. That’s down 11,796
contracts, or 9 percent, from 131,228 the previous week and is
the lowest since Dec. 18.  Brent crude declined 1.8 percent to $109.65 a barrel in the
week to March 12 after declining for three weeks from mid-
February. Futures for May delivery fell 1.2 percent to $108.49
as of 12:09 p.m. London time on ICE.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 203,802, up from
200,246 the previous week.  Swaps dealers were net-long 110,243 lots, up 8 percent from
a week earlier.  Money managers’ net-long bets on gasoil dropped for the
third week to 70,483 contracts, the  data  show. That’s the lowest
