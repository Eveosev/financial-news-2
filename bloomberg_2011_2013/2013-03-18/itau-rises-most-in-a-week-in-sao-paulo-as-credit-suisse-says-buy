Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s biggest bank by market value, gained the most in a
week after Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation to
the equivalent of buy.  Shares advanced 1.1 percent to 35.97 reais at 1:30 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Trading volume was 44 percent of the full-day average
of the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
benchmark Bovespa index slipped 0.4 percent.  Credit Suisse raised the stock from the equivalent of hold,
citing a better outlook for loan provisions and costs in 2014
and evidence of reduced government intervention in the industry.
The  MSCI Brazil/Financials Index (MXBR0FN)  has dropped 10 percent in the
past year as President Dilma Rousseff pushed banks to lower
borrowing costs and reduce profits to “civilized levels” as
part of policies intended to boost growth that last year was the
slowest since 2009.  “From our conversation with banks and other industry
players, banks’ relationship with the government and the
discussion on credit spreads is better at the margin,” Credit
Suisse analysts including  Marcelo Telles  wrote in a research
note dated yesterday. Easing government pressure is “allowing
banks to buy more time and reduce the rate on the revolving
credit lines on a more gradual basis,” the analysts wrote.  Itau shares have dropped 6.9 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
