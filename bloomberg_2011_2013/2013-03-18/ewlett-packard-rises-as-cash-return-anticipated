Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  rose to the
highest price in 10 months after Morgan Stanley upgraded the
shares, citing the potential for the company to return more cash
to investors.  The shares advanced 2.9 percent to $22.83 at the close in
New York, the highest since May 14. The  stock  has gained 60
percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent increase for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Hewlett-Packard may generate free  cash flow  of about $6.7
billion in the 2013 fiscal year, almost 35 percent more than the
company’s $5 billion forecast, according to Katy Huberty, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley. As Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  works to revive growth amid a slump in sales of
personal-computers, restructuring may result in $2.2 billion in
savings by the end of fiscal 2014, Huberty said.  “Cash return in the form of a buyback or higher dividend
is a likely scenario,” Huberty wrote in a research report
today. She upgraded the shares with a buy recommendation and a
$27 target price. “Even without revenue growth, we expect HP to
grow earnings per share and free cash flow over the next three
years.”  Hewlett-Packard’s core personal-computer business is
shrinking because of competition from lower-priced rivals such
as China’s  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  and demand for mobile devices made
by companies including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise business also is being undermined
as companies look for more Internet-based cloud services.  Whitman last September said the  Palo Alto , California-based
company planned to cut 29,000 jobs through the end of the 2014
fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
