U.S. auto-safety regulators are
examining the safety of lithium-ion batteries that power all
plug-in electric vehicles after a  General Motors Co. (GM)  Chevrolet
Volt caught fire, people familiar with the probe said.  The regulators have asked automakers, including GM, Nissan
Motor Co. and  Ford Motor Co. (F) , that sell or have plans to sell
vehicles with lithium-ion batteries about the batteries’ fire
risk, four people familiar with the inquiry said.  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,
 South Korea ’s biggest chemical maker, supplies Volt batteries.  The Volt caught fire while parked at a National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration testing center in Wisconsin, three
weeks after a side-impact crash test May 12, said an agency
official. The official and the three other people familiar with
the inquiry declined to be identified because the investigation
isn’t public.  “I want to make this very clear: the Volt is a safe car,”
Jim Federico, GM’s chief engineer, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. “We are working cooperatively with NHTSA as it
completes its investigation. However, NHTSA has stated that
based on available data, there’s no greater risk of fire with a
Volt than a traditional gas-powered car.”  President Barack Obama’s goal of putting 1 million electric
vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015 is part of his strategy to reduce
dependence on foreign oil. Nissan is among companies that have
received financing assistance from the U.S. Energy Department
and European Investment Bank to develop electric vehicles and
 lithium-ion batteries . GM in January withdrew a request for
$14.4 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.  Battery Supplier  LG Chem “is fully aware of the situation and is working
closely with GM and NHTSA on the investigation,” the Seoul-
based company said in an e-mailed statement distributed by Dick
Pacini of the Millerschin Group, a public relations firm that
represents it in the U.S.  Through Oct. 31, 13,051 Leafs and Volts were sold in the
U.S. this year, according to Autodata Corp.  Automakers are looking to expand plug-in offerings beyond
the Volt and Nissan’s Leaf, which went on sale in the 2011 model
year as the first mass-market plug-in electric cars in the U.S.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius, the world’s best-selling hybrid,
uses a nickel-metal battery. A plug-in Prius and an electric
version of the RAV4 sport-utility vehicle will use lithium
batteries.  “The people who are looking at EVs and plug-in hybrids are
already committed to the technology,” said  Eric Noble ,
president of The CarLab, an auto-industry consulting firm in
Orange,  California . The Volt fire and investigation probably
won’t affect sales of plug-in cars unless something more dire
happens, he said.  Market Reaction  GM fell 0.8 percent to $22.51 at the close in  New York 
yesterday. Nissan’s American depositary receipts, each equal to
two ordinary shares, rose 2 percent to $18.39. LG Chem shares
aren’t traded in the U.S.  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , which has a contract to supply batteries
for GM’s electric Chevrolet Spark, fell 1.7 percent to $2.92.
 Polypore International Inc. (PPO) , which makes battery components,
rose 1.8 percent to $54.95 and  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the maker of
luxury electric cars, rose 7.4 percent, to $33.64, the highest
since December 2010.  NHTSA’s normal practice is to open formal auto-safety
investigations, which it publicizes, following consumer
complaints. In this case, it had no such complaints and decided
to probe based on its observations from the one fire, which
occurred in a Volt it bought for the test, the official said.  Trying to Replicate  In June, GM and NHTSA both crashed a Volt and couldn’t
replicate the May fire, said  Greg Martin , a spokesman for the
automaker. GM has safety procedures for handling the Volt and
its battery after an accident. Had those been followed, there
wouldn’t have been a fire, he said in a phone interview.  “There are safety protocols for conventional cars,”
Martin said. “As we develop new technology, we need to ensure
that safety protocols match the technology.”  NHTSA and the Energy Department next week plan to test Volt
battery modules that have been removed from the cars to see if
they can replicate the condition that led to the fire, the NHTSA
official said. The agencies will study the batteries immediately
and continue to observe them in the coming weeks, he said.  Dan Borgasano, a spokesman for A123 Systems, based in
Waltham, Massachusetts, declined to comment. Brian Sinderson, a
spokesman for New York-based battery maker Ener1, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  ‘Really Hot’  Carmakers have engineered electric vehicles using lithium
batteries to withstand serious accidents because the element is
flammable, said Sandy Munro, president of Munro and Associates,
an engineering consulting firm in Troy, Michigan.  Lithium batteries could catch on fire if the battery case
and some of the internal cells that store electricity are
pierced by steel or another ferrous metal, he said.  “Lithium burns really hot,” Munro said in a phone
interview. “But it doesn’t happen often. You have to do
something pretty dramatic to make it catch fire.”  If a lithium battery is pierced by steel, a chemical
reaction will start raising the temperature and can result in a
fire, he said. If the piercing is small, that reaction can take
days or weeks to occur, he said.  Nissan, Tesla  There hasn’t been a reported fire involving the more than
8,000 Leafs on U.S. roads,  Katherine Zachary , a spokeswoman for
Nissan’s U.S. unit, said in an e-mail.  “The Nissan Leaf battery pack has been designed with
multiple safety systems in place to help ensure its safety in
the real world. All of our systems have been thoroughly tested
to ensure real-world performance,” she said.  Tesla vehicles have been driven more than 16 million miles
without having a post-crash fire or battery-safety incident,
Ricardo Reyes, a spokesman for the Palo Alto, California-based
company, said in an e-mailed statement.  “A fully charged Roadster battery carries the energy
content equivalent of less than 3 gallons of gasoline,” he
said. Tesla has worked with first responders to develop
procedures for handling crashed electric vehicles, he said.  Unlike the batteries in the Volt and Nissan’s Leaf, Tesla
uses cells about the size of those used in  laptop computers , he
said. Such cells “carry much less energy per cell than the
larger prismatic cells preferred by other manufacturers,
providing an additional layer of safety,” Reyes said.  Crash-Test Rating  NHTSA this year gave the Leaf and Volt its top crash-test
rating, following a “good” rating in April by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.  In the simulated side-impact crash test, a new U.S. safety
test for the 2011 model year, metal punctured the battery, the
official said.  The fire in May was severe enough to burn vehicles parked
near the Volt, the agency official said. Investigators
determined the battery was the source of the fire, the official
said.  NHTSA also sent a team of investigators this week to
Mooresville,  North Carolina , to probe a fire in a residential
garage where a Volt was charging. That investigation is
continuing, the agency official said.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , which had installed a charging station
in the home as part of a pilot program, has told the 25 users of
stations in North Carolina and  South Carolina  to stop using them
until the investigation is completed.  Cargo-Plane Crash  The Federal Aviation Administration, in an advisory to
airlines in October 2010, warned that lithium batteries used in
cell phones, digital cameras and other devices are “highly
flammable and capable of ignition,” adding that fire-
suppression systems aren’t effective when that happens.  It issued the advisory after a United Parcel Service Inc.
cargo plane carrying thousands of lithium batteries crashed in
Dubai after catching fire, killing both pilots.  “As manufacturers continue to develop vehicles of any kind
-- electric, gasoline, or diesel -- it is critical that they
take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of drivers and
first responders both during and after a crash,” NHTSA said in
an e-mailed statement.  “Based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe the
Volt or other electric vehicles are at a greater risk of fire
than gasoline-powered vehicles. In fact, all vehicles -- both
electric and gasoline-powered -- have some risk of fire in the
event of a serious crash.”  First Responders  Regulators want to use information collected from
automakers to educate emergency responders, tow-truck operators
and salvage yards about how to handle plug-in electric cars
involved in crashes that may penetrate the battery compartment,
the official said.  NHTSA will use the information from the automakers, which
also include Toyota and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , for a
three-year $8.8 million electric-vehicle safety study it
announced in June, the official said.  “I don’t think lithium battery-pack safety will prove a
significant safety hazard, at least compared to dangers of
gasoline fuel,” Chris Paine, producer of the documentary film
“Revenge of the Electric Car” about the Volt, Leaf and Tesla,
said in an interview. “The technology has really stabilized in
recent years.”  Range Anxiety  LMC Automotive, a forecasting firm based in Oxford,
 England , predicts electric vehicles will make up 1 percent of
the U.S. car market in 2020. Along with safety, concerns about
the short distance electric vehicles can go on one charge --
called range anxiety -- will keep some buyers away, Mike
Omotoso, a LMC analyst, said.  “We think it will take two to three generations of EVs
before the price comes down enough to get people to buy them,”
Omotoso said in a phone interview. “It will take that much time
for consumers to overcome fears of safety aspects and range
anxiety. By 2020 we expect enough public and private charging
stations so that people will be able to drive an EV almost
anywhere in the country.”  Fifteen electric-car or battery-powered models will be
available in the U.S. by the end of 2014, according to LMC
Automotive, which forecasts a glut of electric cars given that
hybrid-electric sales were only 2 percent of the car market so
far this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
