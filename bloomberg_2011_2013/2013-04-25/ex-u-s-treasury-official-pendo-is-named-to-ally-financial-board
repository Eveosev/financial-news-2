Mathew Pendo, a former chief
investment officer of the U.S. Treasury Department, has joined
the board at  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto lender majority-owned
by taxpayers.  The Treasury, which owns 74 percent of the Detroit-based
auto lender, appointed Pendo to the board, the company said
today in a regulatory filing. Pendo replaces Kim Fennebresque as
one of the government-appointed directors. Fennebresque remains
as a board-appointed director, replacing John Stack, who stepped
down to focus on Ally Bank, the firmâ€™s online lender, according
to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
