The world harvest of wheat and
coarse grains such as corn is predicted to jump 7 percent in the
2013-14 season on increased planting and better yields, the
International Grains Council said.  Output may rise to 1.91 billion metric tons from an
estimated 1.78 billion tons in 2012-13, the London-based IGC
wrote in its monthly grain market report today. Increased
production will rebuild stocks depleted this season, it said.  Drought in the U.S. as well as in Ukraine and  Russia  hurt
corn and wheat production last year. This year, U.S. farmers
will sow the most acres of corn in 77 years, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture reported in March.  For corn, “output is forecast to increase 10 percent year-
on-year, with harvested area and average yields both projected
to be higher,” the IGC wrote. “Closing stocks will be very
tight at the end of 2012-13, but are set to increase sharply,
rising to above-average levels in 2013-14.”  World corn production may jump to 939 million tons in
2013-14 from 851 million tons a year earlier, according to the
report. Stocks will climb to 143 million tons at the end of the
season from 117 million tons, the IGC forecast.  Corn prices in  Chicago  have dropped from a record in August
on expectations of increased U.S. production, while wheat has
declined from a July peak.  Farmers across the world may harvest 680 million tons of
wheat, from 655 million tons in 2012-13, led by gains in the
European Union and the former Soviet Union on increased planting
and better yields, the IGC said. Stocks are seen advancing to
181 million tons from 179 million tons.  For wheat, “a small fall in feed use in 2013-14 is likely
to be outweighed by higher food and industrial use, with total
consumption up 1 percent,” the IGC said. “Only a slight rise
in global stocks is forecast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
