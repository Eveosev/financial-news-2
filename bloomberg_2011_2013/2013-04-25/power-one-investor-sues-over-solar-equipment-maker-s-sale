A  Power-One Inc. (PWER)  shareholder sued
company directors, claiming  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ’s $1 billion takeover offer
for the solar-equipment maker is too low.  The shareholder, Alejandro Becerra-Arteaga, said Power-
One’s board breached its fiduciary duty by accepting ABB’s
proposal to pay $6.35 a share.  “Given PowerOne’s recent strong performance, as well as
its future growth prospects, the consideration shareholders will
receive is inadequate and undervalues the company,” Becerra-
Arteaga said in the complaint, filed today in Delaware Chancery
Court.  ABB’s purchase would give the Carmillo, California-based
company, the world’s biggest electricity-networks builder,
access to inverters that allow solar power to be fed into grids.  The agreement was announced April 22 and includes
protections for Zurich-based ABB, including a $20 million
breakup fee that will keep out competitors, according to the
complaint.  Larry Clark, with Power-One’s investor relations
department, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the suit.  The case is Becerra-Arteaga v. Thompson, 8506, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
