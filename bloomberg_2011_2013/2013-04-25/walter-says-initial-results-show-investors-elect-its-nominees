Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  investors
rejected five nominees to its board proposed by activist
shareholder Audley Capital Advisors LLP, according to
preliminary results from Walter’s shareholder meeting today.  The results indicate that all of Walter’s nominees were
elected, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a
statement.  Audley had called on the producer of metallurgical coal to
reduce debt and corporate expenses to boost profit. It was the
second attempt by London-based Audley’s co-founder and Managing
Partner Julian Treger to compel change at Walter, which has
posted two consecutive quarterly losses and seen its shares drop
73 percent in the past year. Walter rose 0.9 percent to $17.98
in New York.  “Our campaign was critically important and highlighted the
issues facing the company, stimulated dialogue with stockholders
and has already resulted in some improvements at Walter,”
Treger said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
