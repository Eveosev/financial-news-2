The  U.S. Treasury  sold $29 billion
of seven-year notes to the highest demand this year, even with
yields on the securities at almost four-month lows, amid
speculation the U.S. faces further slowing in economic growth.  The government’s auction of the notes yesterday drew a so-
called  high yield  of 1.155 percent, the least since the Nov. 29
sale of the maturity. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand for the issue by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.71, the strongest since December. The
ratio averaged 2.66 at the past 10 offerings.  “It was a pretty solid auction,” said Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, one of
the 21 primary dealers that are obligated to bid U.S. debt
sales. “If you take the whole of the March data, most of it’s
been weaker. The market is concerned perhaps about the
recurrence of this summer soft-patch pattern that we’ve observed
over the past three years.”  Yields on  current  seven-year notes were little changed at
1.12 percent in New York after rising as much as two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.14 percent.  The  Federal Reserve ’s monthly purchases of $45 billion of
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities to spur
the economy have damped volatility and helped keep Treasury
yields at almost historic lows, Simons said.  Borrowing of Treasuries by Wall Street’s biggest bond
dealers from the Fed’s daily lending facility is 40 percent
higher than last year as the central bank’s bond buying squeezes
the available supply.  Volatility Falls  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 49.75 basis points
yesterday, dropping below the low of 50.04 basis points reached
on April 23. The data stretches back to 1988.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  39.3 percent of the seven-year
notes auctioned yesterday, also the highest level since
December. They purchased 35.5 percent at the March sale. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 38.6 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 19.7 percent
yesterday, versus 19.5 percent at last month’s auction. The
average at the past 10 sales is 16.7 percent.  Yesterday’s auction was the final of three note sales this
week totaling $99 billion.  Seven-year notes have returned 1.1 percent this year,
compared with a 0.7 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-
year securities advanced 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall added 2.2 percent.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$721 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.01 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
