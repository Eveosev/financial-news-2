     April 25 (Bloomberg) --Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advancing for a second day to its
highest since 2008, before a  Bank of Japan (8301)  meeting.  Canon Inc. (7751) 
and Nintendo Co. fell on disappointing earnings.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest
lender, advanced 2.2 percent. Nippon Electric Glass Co. jumped
7.1 percent after industry bellwether Corning Inc. forecast
growth for a product used in smartphones. Canon tumbled the most
on the Nikkei 225 after projecting net income lower than analyst
estimates on slumping demand for compact cameras. Nintendo lost
5.9 percent after the world’s biggest maker of video-game
consoles posted profit that missed analyst estimates.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.6 percent to close at 13,926.08 in
 Tokyo . Volume on the measure was about 15 percent above than the
30-day average. The  Topix Index (TPX)  rose 0.7 percent to 1,172.78,
with twice the number of stocks gaining as falling on the 1,698-
member gauge.  “A weaker yen is helping Japanese companies, but you need
to look at each stock to figure out if the yen’s drop is coming
on top of a company’s solid business,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno ,
a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co., a unit
of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value.  The Topix advanced 62 percent since mid-November as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge trades at 1.3
times book value compared with 2.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation Outlook  The central bank may upgrade its view on price gains
excluding fresh food to at least 1.5 percent from 0.9 percent
for fiscal 2014 in its next forecast update tomorrow, people
familiar with the central bank’s discussions said.  Japan ’s three biggest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. were
among the biggest boosts to the Topix. BNP Paribas SA raised its
outlook on the Japanese banking sector to “improving,” citing
gains in sales of equity holdings as stocks rally.  The Topix sub-group tracking banks advanced 2.3 percent,
the third-biggest gain among the gauge’s 33 industry groups.  Nippon Electric Glass, Japan’s second-biggest glassmaker by
market value, jumped 7.1 percent to 525. U.S.-based Corning, a
leading maker of glass for flat-panel televisions, phones and
tablets, forecast growth in its telecommunications products as
it benefits from surging sales of smartphones and tablets.  Honda Motor Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. are among more
than 100 companies on the Topix due to report earnings tomorrow,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 233 companies
that have posted results so far this month and for which
Bloomberg has estimates, 47 percent have missed projections,
while 44 beat them, the  data  show.  Canon and Nintendo were the two biggest drags on the Topix,
countering gains by Toyota Motor Corp. Of the 233 companies
that have posted results so far this month and for which
Bloomberg has estimates, 47 percent have missed projections,
while 44 beat them, the  data  show.  Smartphone Pressure  Canon dropped 6.4 percent to 3,595 yen, its biggest drop
since July, after forecasting net income of 290 billion yen
($2.9 billion) in 2013, missing the 308 billion-yen average of
20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Canon cut its sales
target for compact cameras because consumers increasingly use
smartphones to snap pictures.  Nintendo slumped 5.9 percent to 11,240 yen, its biggest
drop since September 2011 after the game maker reported its
second straight operating loss as it sold less than its 4
million-unit sales target for Wii U consoles.  Foreigners, which account for about 55 percent of volume
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, were net sellers of Japanese
stocks in the week ended April 19, just the second time overseas
investors sold more than they bought since mid-November. The
Topix sank 1.9 percent last week, and is headed for a 3.5
percent gain this week.  “Foreign capital is likely to keep flowing into Japanese
stocks on optimism the market will keep rising,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “It’s unlikely earnings will boost the
whole market because they’re mostly in-line with expectations.”  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index gained 0.6
percent to 25.79 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 7.4 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
