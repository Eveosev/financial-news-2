Orix Corp. (8591) ,  NEC Corp. (6701) , and Epco
Inc. will begin a storage battery rental service for Japanese
houses.  The system will use cloud data links to connect batteries
made by NEC with a smart house application developed by EPCO
that allows users to check electricity usage via smartphones,
the companies said in a statement today.  Rental fees will vary between 3,045 yen ($31) to 5,145 yen
a month, according to the statement. The companies target 10,000
households by March 2014 to provide the service and 100,000 by
March 2016.  The battery system has 5.53 kilowatt hour of storage
capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
