Pernod Ricard SA (RI) ,  France ’s biggest
distiller, said it expects fiscal 2013 earnings to benefit from
foreign-exchange movements this year as the dollar strengthens
against the euro.  So-called profit from recurring operations, or operating
profit excluding some items, will increase by about 25 million
euros ($32.7 million) this year due to currency impacts, Pernod
said today, based on an exchange rate of $1.29 per euro.  “Our foreign exchange is largely linked to the dollar and
pegged currencies to the dollar,” Chief Financial Officer
Gilles Bogaert said today in a telephone interview. “The
stronger the dollar is, the better the forex impact is.”
Pernod, which sells brands from Absolut vodka to Chivas Regal
whisky in countries from the U.S. to  China , states its results
in euros. Its fiscal year ends June 30.  The Paris-based company, which reported third-quarter sales
today, had anticipated a “slightly positive” improvement this
year at the time of its first-half results in February.  “The beauty of our business model is that we have very
high margins and strong pricing power,” Bogaert said. “We have
the ability to absorb currency fluctuations.” The company has
seen the dollar range from about $1.18 to about $1.60 to the
euro in the past four or five years, he said, and “we have been
able to operate quite well within that range.”  Bogaert said that the current euro-dollar rate “probably
reflects our views on the normal parity between the euro and
dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
