Treasuries declined after a report
showed fewer Americans than forecast filed first-time jobless
claims last week, pointing to an improving labor market and
sapping demand for haven assets.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose from almost four-month lows
as the U.S. prepared to auction $29 billion of seven-year debt
after auctioning $35 billion of five-year notes yesterday at the
lowest yield since November. Applications for jobless benefits
decreased by 16,000 to 339,000 in the week ended April 20, the
lowest since March 9, according to Labor Department data
released in  Washington . Volatility in the Treasuries market
reached a record low for a third day.  “It’s a period of seasonal volatility -- the market is
selling off because it likes the optics of the numbers,” Tom Simons, an economist in  New York  at Jefferies LLC, one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve , said of the
jobless-claims numbers.  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 11:55 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield fell to 1.64
percent on April 23, the  lowest  since Dec. 12. The price of the
2 percent note due February 2023 fell 1/8, ore $2.50 per $1,000
face value, to 102 17/32.  The  30-year bond  gained two basis points to 2.91 percent
after falling to 2.82 percent on April 23, the lowest since Dec.
11.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 49.75 basis points
yesterday, below the low of 50.04 basis points reached April 23.
The data stretches back to 1988.  Treasury Auctions  The yield on current  seven-year notes  rose one basis point
to 1.14 percent, after dropping to 1.06 percent two days ago,
the least since Dec. 12.  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.160 percent
in pre-auction trading, down from 1.248 percent at the previous
sale of similar-maturity debt on March 28.  “There will be no particular difficulty in finding demand
for Treasuries, even with these low yields,” said  Michael Markovich , head of global interest-rate research at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “We have seen some weaker data and
that helped bring yields down. We do not expect to see a further
strong rally.”  Bidding Slows  Seven-year notes have gained 1.1 percent this year,
compared with a 0.7 percent return by Treasuries of all
maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The seven-year securities returned 3.9 percent in 2012, while
Treasuries overall advanced 2.2 percent.  The auction is the final of three note sales this week
totaling $99 billion.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$702 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.98 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Economists had projected 350,000 jobless claims, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 49 economists,
with estimates ranging from 340,000 to 370,000. The Labor
Department revised the previous week’s figure up to 355,000,
from an initially reported 352,000. A spokesman said the claims
data typically bounce around this time of year.  ‘Soft Data’  “We’re going to be in a period of somewhat soft data for a
little while,” said Jefferies’s Simons. “Q3 is when it starts
to pick up; the economic data is going to improve a little
bit.”  Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 3
percent in the first quarter after growing 0.4 percent in the
final three months of 2012, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Commerce Department
issues the data tomorrow.  Policy makers are on guard for a slowdown in the second
quarter after job growth fell to 88,000 in March from 268,000
the previous month. Reports this month showed retail sales
dropped in March by the most in nine months, while demand for
durable goods slumped.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs. At their meeting last month, several members of
the  Federal Open Market Committee  advocated slowing purchases
and stopping them by year-end.  Since then, seven have voiced support for maintaining the
current pace, including five who vote on the policy-making
panel: Governor  Daniel Tarullo , New York Fed President William
C. Dudley,  James Bullard  of  St. Louis ,  Chicago ’s  Charles Evans 
and  Boston ’s  Eric Rosengren .  To contact the reporter on this story:
