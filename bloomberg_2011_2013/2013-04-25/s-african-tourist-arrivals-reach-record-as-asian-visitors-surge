Tourist arrivals in  South Africa 
rose 10 percent to a record 9.19 million last year, as the
government boosted efforts to promote the country as a holiday
destination and attracted more visitors from Asia.  “A few years ago we took the decision to begin actively
marketing South Africa in  emerging markets , which has yielded
extremely positive results,” President  Jacob Zuma  told
reporters in Cape Town today. “This phenomenal tourism growth
is evidence that we are successfully setting ourselves apart in
a competitive marketplace.”  South Africa is targeting income of 500 billion rand ($55
billion) a year from tourism by 2020 and 225,000 new jobs as it
seeks to cut a 25 percent  unemployment  rate. In 1993, the year
before apartheid ended, 3.2 million foreigners visited the
country.  The U.K. retained its position as South Africa’s biggest
source of tourists, with 438,023 of its nationals visiting last
year. The U.S. followed with 326,643 travelers and  Germany  with
266,333, Zuma said.  Arrivals from China surged 56 percent to 132,334 after the
introduction of direct flights between Johannesburg and Beijing,
while those from Brazil jumped 45 percent to 78,376.  Foreign tourists spent 76.4 billion rand in South Africa
last year, up 7.6 percent from 2011, Zuma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
