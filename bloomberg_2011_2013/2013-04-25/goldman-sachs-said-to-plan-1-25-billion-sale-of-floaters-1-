Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the Wall
Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
from trading, sold $1.25 billion of five-year, floating-rate
notes.  The bonds pay 120 basis points more than the quarterly
 London interbank offered rate , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of 125 basis points for
$700 million of similar-maturity floating-rate debt that the New
York-based lender issued in February.  Those securities, rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
A- at Standard & Poor’s, traded yesterday at 100.6 cents on the
dollar.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, was set at 27.6 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
