The euro weakened against most
major counterparts on speculation the  European Central Bank  will
cut its record-low benchmark  interest rate  further next week as
the region’s economy slumps.  The yen pared its first gain in three days versus the
dollar as an increase in risk appetite damped the Japanese
currency’s appeal as a haven. U.S. stocks rose after fewer
Americans than forecast filed first-time claims for jobless
benefits last week, pointing to an improving labor market. The
pound climbed after data showed the U.K. economy expanded last
quarter, ensuring the nation avoided a triple-dip recession.  “The economic data in Europe, and specifically in  Germany ,
has been pretty disappointing,” Eric Viloria, a senior currency
strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in  New York , said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch Money” with Julie Hyman.  More ECB easing “could weigh on the euro, even though
it’s likely to have a minimal impact on real economic
activity.”  The euro fell as much as 0.2 percent to $1.2989 before
trading little changed at $1.3011 at 5 p.m. in New York. It
strengthened 0.6 percent earlier. The Japanese currency
appreciated 0.3 percent to 99.26 per dollar after gaining 0.5
percent earlier. It touched 99.95 on April 11, the weakest level
in four years. The euro declined 0.3 percent to 129.14 yen.  The 17-nation currency slid 1.1 percent versus the pound to
84.30 pence. It touched 84.10 pence, the lowest since Jan. 24.  Currency Options  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $32 billion, compared with total turnover yesterday of
$61 billion, according to data reported by U.S. banks to the
Depository Trust Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume
in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $9.1
billion, the largest share of trades at 29 percent. Options on
the euro-Swiss franc were the second most actively traded, at
$4.3 billion, or 14 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was about 35 percent below the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Turnover in euro-Swiss
options exceeded average readings, by more than 800 percent.  The ECB has kept its main refinancing rate at 0.75 percent
since July 2012. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today in a note
it expects a quarter-percentage-point cut to 0.5 percent at the
central bank’s meeting on May 2.  Banks including Nomura International Plc, UBS AG and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc also forecast this week the ECB will
cut the rate after gauges of European manufacturing and services
for April underscored weakness. German business confidence fell
after winter weather hindered the recovery in  Europe ’s largest
economy. Spanish unemployment rose in the first quarter to 27.2
percent, the highest in at least 37 years, data showed today.  BOJ Meeting  The yen strengthened against the dollar as Japanese
investors cut their holdings of overseas bonds for a sixth week,
damping speculation they’re sending more funds abroad.  Bank of Japan (8301)  policy makers meet tomorrow and will release
an outlook for the economy and inflation. The central bank may
raise its forecast for price gains for fiscal 2014, according to
people familiar with the discussions. The BOJ unveiled April 4 a
plan to double holdings of government bonds and stock funds in
the next two years to end 15 years of deflation.  Japan  will use its foreign-exchange reserves to buy
holdings of listed mutual funds that invest in Asian  government
bonds , Nikkei reported today without attribution. The proposal
will be announced May 3, the newspaper reported.  Risk Appetite  The dollar remained lower versus major peers as risk
appetite improved after Labor Department data showed
applications for  jobless benefits  fell by 16,000 to 339,000 in
the week ended April 20, the lowest since March 9. Economists in
a Bloomberg survey projected 350,000 claims.  Stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advancing
as much as 0.9 percent before ending the day up 0.4 percent.  Sterling advanced against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts after the  Office for National Statistics  said gross
domestic product increased 0.3 percent in the first quarter. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for
growth of 0.1 percent.  The pound gained 1.1 percent to $1.5434 and reached
$1.5480, the strongest level since Feb. 19.  “Sterling is trading higher, and I would expect further
gains,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “The data puts another
nail in the coffin for further money printing.”  The pound strengthened 2.2 percent in the past month
against nine developed-nation peers monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. It was the best performance. The
 U.S. dollar  rose 0.2 percent, the euro gained 1.5 percent and
the yen slid 5.2 percent.  Forint Falls  Hungary’s currency dropped against 31 most-traded peers
amid bets the country’s central bank will reduce interest rates
further. The forint fell for a seventh day against the euro, the
longest stretch since August, declining 0.3 percent to 301.09.  South Africa ’s rand gained for a third day against the
dollar as precious-metals prices rebounded and after South
African producer-price inflation accelerated 5.7 percent last
month, more than forecast. Spot gold rose 2.5 percent to
$1,467.90 an ounce after tumbling to $1,322.06 on April 16.  The rand appreciated 0.4 percent to 9.0966 per dollar.  The krone gained the most in almost three weeks against the
dollar as this week’s advance in  oil prices  boosted the outlook
for the nation’s exports. Crude oil for June delivery has gained
5.9 percent since April 19 to $93.24 a barrel in New York.  Norway’s currency climbed as much as 0.9 percent, the most
since April 5, to 5.8432 per dollar before trading at 5.8714, up
0.5 percent. The krone advanced 0.5 percent to 7.6397 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
