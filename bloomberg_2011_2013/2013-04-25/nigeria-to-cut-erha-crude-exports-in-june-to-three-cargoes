Nigeria,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to reduce exports of its Erha crude in June to
three cargoes of 997,500 barrels, one less than in May,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
