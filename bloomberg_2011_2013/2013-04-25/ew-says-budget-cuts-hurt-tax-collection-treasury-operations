U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration will
reduce tax collection and hurt the department by forcing it to
cut back on training and postpone contracts.  “We are doing everything we can to absorb these cuts
without reducing services,” Lew told a  House Appropriations
subcommittee  in testimony prepared for a hearing today. “We
have scaled back training, delayed contracts and limited
purchases.”  Workers at the  Internal Revenue Service , which is part of
the Treasury Department, will have to stay home without pay for
as many as seven days between now and September, Lew said.  “The cuts imposed by sequestration erode our ability to
provide quality service by forcing the IRS to answer fewer calls
and creating unexpected delays in responding to taxpayer
questions,” Lew said. “It will also lead to fewer enforcement
actions and reduce revenue collection.”  On financial regulation, Lew told the House panel “it is
critically important that we complete the process of
implementing” the Dodd-Frank law. He said it’s “a matter of
urgency to me that we get this done and we get it done
quickly.”  Lew also said  China  is making “some progress” on allowing
the  yuan  to strengthen and he is watching the country’s currency
movements “very carefully.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
