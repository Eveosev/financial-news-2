Scotland  set up a 15 million-pound
($23 million) fund to develop foundations that will support  wind
turbines  in deep waters in a bid to cut the technology’s costs.  The Scottish Innovative Foundation Technologies Fund seeks
to encourage development of prototypes for use in water more
than 30 meters (98 feet) deep, the government said today in an
e-mailed statement that invited applications for funding.  Foundation structures account for about 16 percent of total
offshore wind project costs and innovation in the field could
drive a 9 percent saving, according to the statement. Scotland,
seeking to get all its power from renewables by the end of the
decade from more than third in 2011, has about a quarter of the
European Union’s offshore wind resources, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
