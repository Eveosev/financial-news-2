 Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
fourth-largest lender by assets, posted 8.2% growth in first-
quarter profit as its lending margin widened and asset quality
improved.  Net income climbed to 39.8 billion  yuan  ($6.5 billion) from
36.8 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based lender said
in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That compared
with the 39.2 billion-yuan median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  China’s five biggest commercial lenders delivered profit
growth and return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2012,
even as the economy grew at the slowest pace in 13 years.
Lenders may struggle to maintain the pace as interest-rate
deregulation and borrowers’ migration to the  bond market  put
pressure on lending margins.  Bank of Communications Co. , the nation’s fifth-largest,
today reported profit of 17.7 billion yuan, compared with a
consensus estimate of 16.8 billion yuan.  Shares of the nine Hong Kong-listed Chinese banks gained an
average 0.8 percent in the first quarter, beating the 1.6
percent decline in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Bank of China  rose 0.6 percent in  Hong Kong  today to close
at HK$3.53 before the earnings announcement, bringing this
year’s gain to 2 percent. BoCom advanced 2 percent to close at
HK$6.03.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
