The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
found in audits of Harvard University and 33 other colleges that
many are failing to pay sufficient taxes on businesses they own,
as well as on employee compensation.  The IRS, which began a study of private nonprofit and
public universities in 2008, said it has collected more than $7
million in payroll taxes and fines after examining the
institutions, which it didn’t identify. Harvard and a number of
other schools disclosed that they were selected for audit as
part of what is known as a compliance project.  Kevin Galvin, a spokesman for Harvard, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment. Other schools that said they
were audited include Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and
the University of Texas in Austin.  In addition to about $7 million in employment taxes and
penalties, the IRS said it may end up collecting about $60
million in unrelated business income taxes from the
universities. The agency said it has instructed a number of the
institutions to make changes in the way they account for
operations such as golf courses and fitness centers that
generate taxable income when they are used by the public.  To contact the reporters on this story:
