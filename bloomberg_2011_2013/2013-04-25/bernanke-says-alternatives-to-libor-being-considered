Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
Bernanke  said today that “a new issue this year pertains to
reference interest rates, which recent investigations have
demonstrated were manipulated, particularly in the case of
Libor.”  “The international regulatory community is taking actions
to address the governance and the integrity of Libor and to
consider transitions toward alternative benchmarks,” Bernanke
said today during a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight
Council. He said the U.S. needs to cooperate in those efforts.  “Wholesale funding markets remain vulnerable to runs that
could in turn trigger destabilizing fire sales,” Bernanke said.
“To address such concerns the council recommends that the SEC
consider regulatory action to improve the loss-absorption
capacity of  money market funds  and mitigate run risk associated
with those funds.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
