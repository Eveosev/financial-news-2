China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) ,
Asia’s biggest refiner, reported a 25 percent gain in first-
quarter profit after ending refining losses and increasing oil
and natural gas output.  Net income rose to 16.7 billion  yuan  ($2.7 billion), or
0.19 yuan a share, in the three months to March 31 from a
restated 13.4 billion yuan, or 0.15 yuan, in the previous
period, the Beijing-based company said today in a statement to
the  Shanghai Stock Exchange . That compares with an 18.9 billion-
yuan average estimate of six analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News .  The refiner, known as Sinopec, earned a profit from its
refining business for the first time since 2011 as China moved
to more closely link domestic fuel prices to international crude
rates. Operating profit in refining reached 2.2 billion million
yuan in the quarter, the company said in the statement. It made
an operating loss of 11.9 billion yuan in 2012 and 37.6 billion
yuan in 2011 because of government control over retail fuel
prices.  Crude oil output rose 0.8 percent to 82.2 million metric
tons in the quarter, while its realized oil price declined 6.9
percent to $98.83 yuan per barrel, according to the statement.
Gas output climbed 14 percent to 163 billion cubic feet, and
crude oil processing rose 5.9 percent to 58.7 million tons, it
said.  The shares gained 2 percent to close at HK$8.53, before the
earnings announcement. The stock has climbed 4.7 percent in the
past year, compared with an 8.5 percent gain in  Hong Kong ’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
