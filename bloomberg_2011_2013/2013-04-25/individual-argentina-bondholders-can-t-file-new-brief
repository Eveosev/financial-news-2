A group of individual holders of
defaulted Argentine bonds can’t file a new brief in a New York
case over the repayment of another group of bondholders, a
federal appeals court said.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  Manhattan  denied the request
by a group calling itself the “Duane Morris Individual
Plaintiffs,” named after the  law firm  representing them, to
file an additional amicus, or friend-of-the-court brief.  The denial in a one-sentence order today avoids a possible
delay in deciding the case, which was argued in February. Both
sides submitted additional briefs after the arguments, at the
request of the court.  The Duane Morris bondholders, who aren’t parties in the
case before the appeals court, asked April 22 for permission to
file a brief responding to  Argentina ’s proposal to force the
investors in the appeal to accept an 85 percent discount on
their bonds.  The lower court case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of
Argentina, 08-cv-06978, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). The appeal is NML Capital Ltd. v.
Republic of Argentina, 12-00105,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Second Circuit (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
