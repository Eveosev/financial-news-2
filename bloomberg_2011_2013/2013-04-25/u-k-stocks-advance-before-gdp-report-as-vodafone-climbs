  U.K. stocks  climbed, with the  FTSE
100 (UKX)  Index extending its highest level in three weeks, as a
report showed Britain avoided a  triple-dip recession .  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  climbed to an 11-year high after a
report that Verizon Communications Inc. may offer $100 billion
to take control of Verizon Wireless. Unilever lost 3 percent
after the world’s second-largest consumer-goods company posted
the slowest quarterly revenue growth in two years.  AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN)  slid 1.9 percent as first-quarter sales missed estimates.  The FTSE 100 added 10.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,442.59 at the close in London, after gaining as much as 0.6
percent and losing as much as 0.3 percent. The gauge yesterday
completed its biggest two-day rally since Jan. 3 as companies
reported sales that beat estimates and commodity producers rose.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.3 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.1 percent.  “There’s still no end to the debate on the primary cause
of the slow growth in the U.K.,” said Tom Elliott, global
market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in London, which
oversees $1.5 trillion globally. “Is it austerity or is it weak
growth in the euro zone? I saw Unilever reporting very weak
growth largely because of  Europe , so there’s undoubtedly an
element there.”  U.K. Growth  Britain’s gross domestic product grew 0.3 percent in the
first quarter, according to a report from the Office for
National Statistics. That beat the 0.1 percent  median estimate 
of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The economy avoided
entering its  third recession  since 2008 by rebounding from a
contraction of 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2012.
Economists define a recession as two successive quarters of
shrinking output.  “I don’t think we should be ‘hurrahing’ too much,”
Elliott said. “These numbers can be revised all over the place.
When estimates are based on a subjective view of the effect of
weather, you have to treat them with a pinch of salt.”  In the U.S.,  applications  for jobless benefits decreased by
16,000 to 339,000 in the week ended April 20, the lowest number
in six weeks, according to a Labor Department report.  Economists
had predicted  350,000 claims, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  Vodafone, the second-biggest stock on the FTSE 100,
advanced 1.7 percent to 196.4 pence, its highest price since
January 2002. New York-based Verizon has hired advisers to
prepare a possible $100 billion cash-and-stock bid for
Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, Reuters said,
citing two people it didn’t identify.  Brenda Raney , a
spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, declined to comment to
Bloomberg News.  BAT Rises  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  gained 1.2 percent to 3,591
pence. The maker of Pall Mall and Dunhill cigarettes said first-
quarter sales excluding currency shifts rose 5 percent,
exceeding the 3.7 percent average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  A gauge of London-listed commodity  producers  rose for a
third day.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  and  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , which both
operate mines in  Africa , rallied 5.4 percent to 5,315 pence and
6.4 percent to 291.2 pence, respectively. U.K. mining stocks
have still fallen 13 percent this year.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the online grocer that sells products from
Waitrose Ltd., surged 12 percent to 168.1 pence, its biggest
advance in six weeks. Ocado may soon sign a deal to become the
online distributor for Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified sources.  Unilever lost 3 percent to 2,760 pence. Sales excluding
acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations, rose 4.9
percent from a year earlier, the maker of Dove soap said. The
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had called
for a gain of 5.5 percent.  AstraZeneca dropped 1.9 percent to 3,325.5 pence, its
biggest decline in two months. The U.K.’s second-largest
pharmaceutical company said  quarterly revenue  fell 13 percent to
$6.39 billion, missing the $6.55 billion  average analyst
prediction .  To contact the reporter on this story:
