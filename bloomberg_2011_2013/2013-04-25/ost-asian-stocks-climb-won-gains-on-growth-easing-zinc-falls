U.S.  stocks  rose as jobless claims
fell and earnings topped forecasts, while the pound strengthened
against the dollar after data showed the U.K. economy avoided a
triple-dip recession. Gold rallied for a second day.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent,
approaching its record high, at 4 p.m. in  New York . The Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index jumped for a fifth straight day, gaining 0.8
percent. Britain’s currency appreciated 1.1 percent to $1.5431,
the most since March 14, and the 10-year U.K. yield advanced
four basis points to 1.73 percent. Gold led a rally in
commodities, posting its biggest increase since June. Copper,
silver and oil each surged more than 2 percent.  Earnings from United Parcel Services Inc. to Dow Chemical
Co. topped estimates. Applications for jobless benefits fell to
the lowest since March 9, according to the Labor Department.
Britain’s economy grew a more-than-estimated 0.3 percent in the
first quarter after contracting 0.3 percent in the previous
period, the  Office for National Statistics  said.  “The majority of companies are continuing to beat
expectations, so that’s a good sign,”  Peter Jankovskis , who
helps oversee $3 billion as co-chief investment officer of
Lisle, Illinois-based Oakbrook Investments LLC, said by
telephone. “The jobless claims were better-than-expected, so
that’s providing some support. We do have the possibility of
additional gains in the second half of the year, particularly if
we see growth begin to pick up.”  U.S. jobless claims decreased by 16,000 to 339,000 in the
week ended April 20, less than 350,000 figure in a Bloomberg
survey, according to Labor Department data. Earnings beat
estimates at  73 percent  of the 236 companies in the  S&P 500  that
posted results so far this season, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  UPS, 3M  UPS gained 2.3 percent after posting higher earnings than
estimated as the world’s largest package-delivery company
carried more purchases to online shoppers. Dow Chemical, the
largest U.S. chemical maker by sales, jumped 5.6 percent as
corn-seed sales rose and lower prices for natural gas boosted
earnings from plastics.  3M Co. slid 2.8 percent. The maker of products ranging from
 Scotch tape  to dental braces cut its annual earnings forecast
after quarterly profit trailed estimates for the first time in 1
1/2 years amid a slowing global economy.  Exxon Mobil (XOM)  Corp., the
world’s largest company by market value, dropped 1.5 percent as
sales fell 12 percent on lower crude production and prices.  Fed Stimulus  The S&P 500 has  surged  134 percent from a 12-year low in
2009 as corporate earnings beat analyst estimates and the
 Federal Reserve  embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to
spur economic growth. The gauge has risen 2.8 percent since
April 18. It is less than 10 points away from a record 1,593.37
reached on April 11.  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange  opened for trading
three-and-a-half hours late today after a problem with its
computer systems shut the  derivatives market . Ed Provost, chief
business development officer for CBOE Holdings Inc., said a
“software glitch” caused the outtage. The CBOE Volatility
Index, or VIX, rose 0.1 percent to 13.62.  Treasuries fell, with 10-year note yields gaining one basis
point to 1.72 percent. The yield fell to 1.64 percent on April
23, the lowest since Dec. 12.  The pound strengthened at least 0.6 percent against all of
its 16 major peers, appreciating 1.1 percent to 84.29 pence per
euro. Today’s advance trimmed this year’s decline versus the
dollar to 5.1 percent.  ‘Another Nail’  “Sterling is trading higher and I would expect further
gains,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “The data puts another
nail in the coffin for further money printing.”  The yen climbed 0.1 percent to 99.37 per dollar after the
Ministry of Finance said Japanese investors were net sellers of
overseas debt for a sixth week through April 19. Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe said before a central bank review of policy tomorrow
that monetary easing has produced good results.  Central banks, guardians of the world’s $11 trillion in
foreign-exchange reserves, are buying stocks in record amounts
as falling bond yields push even risk-averse investors toward
equities.  In a survey of 60 central bankers this month by Central
Banking Publications and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, 23
percent said they own shares or plan to buy them. The  Bank of
Japan (8301) , holder of the second-biggest reserves, said April 4 it
will more than double investments in equity exchange-traded
funds to 3.5 trillion yen ($35.2 billion) by 2014. The  Bank of
Israel  bought stocks for the first time last year while the
 Swiss National Bank  and the Czech National Bank have boosted
their holdings to at least 10 percent of reserves.  Fed Timing  In the U.S., debate among central bank policy makers is
shifting away from the timing of a reduction in bond buying to
the need to extend record stimulus as inflation cools and 11.7
million Americans remain jobless. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  will meet April 30-May 1.  “The market is really looking at continued easing by the
Fed,” Greg Woodard, a portfolio strategist at Manning & Napier
in Fairport, New York, said by phone. His firm had $45.2 billion
under management at the end of 2012. “They’re looking for
signals of when the Fed is going to start to reverse that. Our
view is that probably it’s going to be some time away.”  Almost three shares rose for every one that declined in the
 Stoxx 600. (SXXP)  The index climbed for a fifth straight day, the
longest string of advances since December. It has rallied 4.6
percent since April 18.  BAT, KPN  British American Tobacco Plc climbed 1.2 percent as
Europe’s largest cigarette maker reported revenue growth that
beat estimates.  Royal KPN NV (KPN)  sank 6.8 percent as the Dutch phone
company set the terms of a 3 billion-euro ($3.9 billion) share
sale at a discount of 62 percent from the stock’s market value.  Gold rallied 2.7 percent to $1,462 an ounce, the biggest
jump since June 29. Russia’s gold reserves climbed by 4.7 metric
tons to 981.6 tons in March and Kazakhstan’s holdings climbed
1.2 tons to 122.9 tons, according to International Monetary Fund
data released overnight. Futures have rebounded 11 percent since
dropping to a two-year low on April 16.  Silver climbed 5.7 percent, the biggest rise since January
2012.  Commodities Rally  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose 1.5 percent, its
biggest gain since Nov. 19, after climbing yesterday 1.2
percent. West Texas Intermediate oil advanced for a sixth day,
the longest rally in nine months, rising 2.4 percent to $93.64 a
barrel. Copper jumped 2.4 percent, the most in seven months and
its second consecutive advance.  Italy ’s government bonds declined for a second day amid
speculation a rally that took the nation’s 10-year yield below 4
percent for the first time since November 2010 had gone too far.
Pacific Investment Management Co. said yesterday it reduced its
holdings of Italian and Spanish debt. The yield on Italy’s 10-
year note climbed five basis points to 4.06 percent.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 1 percent, gaining for
a second day and reaching a two-week high. South Korea’s Kospi
climbed 0.8 percent and the won appreciated 0.5 percent versus
the dollar after the economy grew by a faster-than-estimated 0.9
percent last quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
