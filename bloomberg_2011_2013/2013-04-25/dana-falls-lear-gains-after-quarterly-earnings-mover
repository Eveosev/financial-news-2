Lear Corp. (LEA)  rose the most in more
than a year while  Dana Holding Corp. (DAN)  fell after the auto-parts
suppliers reported quarterly earnings.  Lear, which makes seats and electrical parts, climbed
6.4 percent to $57.38 at the close in  New York , its largest
daily gain since February 2012. Dana, a maker of axles for cars,
trucks and construction equipment, slid 2.7 percent to $16.84
after falling 6.4 percent, the most intraday since July.  Lear, based in Southfield,  Michigan , reported first-quarter
net income of $108.5 million compared with $134.1 million a year
earlier. Excluding what the company considers one-time items,
per-share profit was $1.30, exceeding the $1.10 average of
17 analysts’ estimates.  Lear said it reached an agreement with a Citigroup Inc.
unit to repurchase $800 million of Lear stock. The company said
it will retire about 12 million shares within the next week.  Lear previously reached an agreement with dissident
shareholders Marcato Capital Management LLC and Oskie Capital
Management LLC that includes expanding a stock buyback. Marcato
and Oskie have withdrawn their slate of nominees for election to
Lear’s board at the 2013 annual meeting and agreed to vote their
shares in support of the company’s nominees.  Dana’s Results  Dana, based in Maumee,  Ohio , said first-quarter net income
totaled $42 million, compared with $70 million a year earlier.
Excluding what the company considers one-time items, profit was
28 cents a share, down from 44 cents a year earlier. That
trailed the 42-cent average of 13 analysts’ estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales fell 15 percent to $1.68 billion,
compared with $1.75 billion, the average of 10 estimates.  Lower sales in the North American truck market and for off-
highway vehicles in Europe and  Asia  hurt sales in the quarter,
Dana said in a statement.  “Demand levels in a number of our key markets provided a
bit of a headwind for us in the first quarter, but overall
results were in line with our expectations,” Chief Executive
Officer  Roger Wood  said in the statement.  The company reaffirmed its 2013 forecast for adjusted
profit of $1.88 to $1.95 a share on sales of $7.1 billion.
Thirteen analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated profit of
$1.92 a share on sales of $7.2 billion, the average of 12
analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
