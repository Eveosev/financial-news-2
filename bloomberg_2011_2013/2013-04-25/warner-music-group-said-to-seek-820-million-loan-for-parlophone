Warner Music Group Corp., the
third-largest global music content company, is seeking $820
million in loans to support its acquisition of Parlophone Label
Group and for general corporate purposes, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing, which
includes a $710 million term portion and a $110 million piece,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal
is private. The bank is hosting a lender meeting at 3 p.m. today
in New York.  Warner is buying Parlophone, home to Coldplay, the Pet Shop
Boys and Tina Turner, from Universal Music Group for about 487
million pounds ($752.6 million), Santa Monica, California-based
Universal said in a Feb. 7 statement distributed by PR Newswire.
Vivendi SA-owned Universal, the worldâ€™s biggest record company,
has been selling EMI assets to meet antitrust requirements after
receiving approval from the European Commission in September for
its 1.2 billion-pound acquisition of EMI from Citigroup Inc.  The debt, to expire in seven years, will pay interest at
3.25 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate with a 1 percent minimum on the lending benchmark, the
person said. It will be offered to lenders at 99.5 cents on the
dollar.  Lenders must let the bank know by May 1 if they will
participate in the loan transaction, the person said.  Warner is also looking to use about $175 million of cash to
redeem about $72 million of 6 percent senior notes due in 2021
and 6.25 percent bonds due in 2021, according to a regulatory
filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
