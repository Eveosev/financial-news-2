Militants of the separatist
Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) will start withdrawing from
 Turkey  on May 8, the pro-Kurdish  Firat news agency  said today,
citing senior PKK commander Murat Karayilan.  Karayilan, addressing dozens of journalists on the main PKK
camp on Mount Qandil in northern  Iraq , said the withdrawal would
be gradual as long as there are no attacks on his militants,
Firat reported.  The announcement came as Turkey’s civilian and military
leaders gathered for a National Security Council meeting in
Ankara, NTV television said.  PKK separatists have rejected a call by Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to lay down their weapons during
the withdrawal.  Turkey is in dialogue with the PKK’s imprisoned chief,
Abdullah Ocalan, in an effort to end fighting by the PKK that
has killed tens of thousands of people since 1984.
