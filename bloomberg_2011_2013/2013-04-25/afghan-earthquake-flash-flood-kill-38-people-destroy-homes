An earthquake and a flash flood in
 Afghanistan  killed at least 38 people yesterday in separate
incidents that destroyed homes and businesses.  The temblor killed 18 people and left hundreds injured in
the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar, the government
said in an e-mailed statement today. The flooding in the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif left 20 people dead and
displaced more than 1,800 from their homes, it said.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  reported a 5.6 magnitude
earthquake struck at 1.55 p.m. local time yesterday, 25
kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Jalalabad.  The tremor was the latest to buffet Asia this month. A
quake hit Iran and  Pakistan  last week, shaking buildings as far
away as Dubai and New Delhi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
