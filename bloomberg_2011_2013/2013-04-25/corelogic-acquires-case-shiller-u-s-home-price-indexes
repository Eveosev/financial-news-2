CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)  said it acquired the
Case-Shiller home-price indexes for $6 million, adding a widely
used measure of U.S. property values to its real estate data.  Case-Shiller, founded by Wellesley College Professor
Emeritus Karl Case and Yale University Economics Professor
 Robert Shiller , is best known for its gauge of repeat  home sales 
in 20 U.S. cities. CoreLogic, which also issues a monthly home-
price index based on repeat sales, will continue to produce
separate reports, the  Irvine , California-based real estate
information service said in a statement today.  “Case-Shiller, one of the most widely recognized brands in
home-price trends and property valuation services, is the highly
complementary addition to CoreLogic’s existing residential
property insights platform,” CoreLogic Chief Executive Anand Nallathambi said during an earnings conference call today. The
deal was completed March 20, CoreLogic said.  Fiserv Inc. (FISV) , a financial-technology company based in
Brookfield, Wisconsin, owned the Case-Shiller indexes and
licensed a portion to  Standard & Poor’s . The S&P/Case-Shiller
Home Price Indices will retain their brand name, according to
CoreLogic’s statement.  The deal was in line with a plan to sell businesses that
are “no longer consistent with our market, product or financial
strategies,” Judy DeRango Wicks, a Fiserv spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail.  CoreLogic rose 7.4 percent to $26.52, its biggest gain
since July 24. The company reported earnings after the close of
trading yesterday that beat analysts’ estimates. Fiserv climbed
0.9 percent to $90.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
