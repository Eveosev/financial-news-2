  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker
of Swiss watches, is increasing pressure on rivals by
introducing so-called automatic timepieces under its namesake
brand at a fraction of the prices offered by many competitors.  The new line, called the Sistem51, will go on sale in
October, and prices for most models will be at the lower end of
a 100 Swiss franc ($106) to 200 franc range, Chief Executive
Officer Nick Hayek said at a press conference in Basel today.  Automatic watches work without batteries as they gather
energy from movements of the wearer’s wrist. The mechanism that
makes the Sistem51 run has 51 components, while most automatic
watches have more than 100 and cost thousands of dollars. This
is the cheapest automatic watch the Swatch label has designed.  “Strategically it is keenly priced, which puts some
pressure on those offering automatic watches in price points of
$1,000,” said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in
Zurich. It also shows that from a technical and efficiency
perspective the company is a class above everyone else in terms
of mass production of Swiss-made watches, he said.  The Sistem51 has a power reserve of 90 hours, meaning that
it will keep running for that long even if it’s not moving on a
wearer’s wrist. That’s more than some luxury automatic watches.  This is the first time the Biel-based company, which owns
the Omega and Breguet luxury watch brands, has showcased its
namesake brand of less expensive plastic timepieces at the
Baselworld trade fair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
