Lonza Group AG (LONN)  said it will close a
factory in Ireland as Chief Executive Officer Richard Ridinger
continues to streamline the global manufacturing base of the
drug-ingredients maker.  Lonza will close a plant in June at Swords in Ireland that
makes marine anti-fouling paints and metal-working fluids, it
said in a  statement . Lonza has cut 140 jobs since the end of
last year as it works through plans to reduce operations at a
plant in Visp, Switzerland, Ridinger said on a conference call.  First-quarter results were in line with expectations,
Ridinger said, reiterating guidance for further growth in sales
and earnings before interest and taxes for the full year. Lonza,
based in  Basel ,  Switzerland , doesn’t publish financial results
for the first quarter.  Lonza’s chief is undertaking a global review of
manufacturing sites, as he tackles net debt that spiralled from
1.1 billion francs ($1.2 billion) at the end of 2010 to more
than 2.6 billion francs a year later when the company bought
water-treatment chemicals-maker Arch Chemicals for $1.35
billion.  Lonza shares fell 0.6 percent to 64.95 Swiss francs at
10:57 a.m. in Zurich trading.  The company will cut debt by about 200 million francs
annually over the next years after cutting net debt 13 percent
in 2012 to 2.3 billion francs, Chief Financial Officer Toralf Haag said April 9.  The Swords plant, which has 32 employees and 11
contractors, was part of the Arch Chemicals business acquired by
Lonza in October 2011. Manufacturing of the plant’s products
will be moved to the U.S. and  China ,  Lonza said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
