ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW) ,
the Israeli maker of workplace software, is rebounding from a
five-month low after reiterating sales will rise as much as 25
percent as businesses boost spending on phone applications.  Shares of ClickSoftware jumped 2.3 percent to $7.21 in New
York, after slumping to the lowest price since Nov. 19 last
week. The Petach Tikva, Israel-based developer said yesterday
that sales will rise to as much as $125 million this year, after
posting first-quarter revenue 6.8 percent below analysts’
projections. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  added 1
percent.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  fell 9.3 percent at 5:48
p.m. in New York as its sales forecast trailed estimates.  “We still have the potential to accelerate growth,” Moshe BenBassat, ClickSoftware’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said by phone from  Tel Aviv  yesterday. “We are starting to see
revenue from mobile.”  ClickSoftware announced a plan in January to bolster
revenue by focusing on software apps for smartphones, expanding
into regions including  Latin America  and enhancing its cloud
computing services. Sales of mobile software will drive results
in the second half of the year, BenBassat said yesterday. Global
 spending  on corporate software will rise 6.4 percent to $297
billion in 2013, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Sales for ClickSoftware will rise 21 percent to $121.3
million, according to the mean of four analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s within the company’s target growth
range of 20 percent to 25 percent and would mean the highest
revenue since at least 1997, the data show.  ‘Throwaway Year’  ClickSoftware’s strategy to accelerate growth implies
higher costs from research to hiring and marketing, which makes
2013 a “throwaway year” for earnings, according to Roth
Capital Partners LLC, which downgraded the software maker after
it announced its plan on Jan. 8.  “Since they came in short in Q1, their guidance looks
difficult to achieve,” Nathan Schneiderman, an analyst at Roth
Capital, with a hold rating on ClickSoftware, said in a
telephone interview yesterday from  Newport Beach ,  California .
“Even though they repeated the guidance, there’s more of a risk
that it’ll fall short for the year.”  ClickSoftware’s dividend yield of 4.5 percent is the
highest among the 25 companies on the Israel-US Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s board approved an 8
cent-a-share dividend to be paid on May 22, according to
yesterday’s statement. The shares rose the most since March 7.  Mellanox Results  The Israel-US gauge of the 25 largest Israeli companies
traded in New York had the biggest advance since March 12 to
89.59.  Israel ’s benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  slipped 0.8 percent to
1,205.09 in Tel Aviv.  Mellanox slumped to $56.08 after the close of the market.
Shares in Tel Aviv fell 7.9 today, the most since Jan. 24. The
Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company forecast second-quarter
revenue of as much as $97.5 million, trailing the $108 million
average estimate of 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The start of the year has been challenging,” Chief
Executive Officer Eyal Waldman said in a conference call, adding
the company didn’t expect any “large deal” in the current
quarter. The shares rose 0.9 percent to $61.83 in regular
trading.  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  had the biggest gain on the gauge,
surging 8.4 percent to $6.32. Opko Health Inc. agreed to buy the
Israeli drugmaker for $480 million to combine two companies that
count U.S. pharmaceutical billionaire  Phillip Frost  as their
largest shareholder. Shares in Tel Aviv this morning fell 2.8
