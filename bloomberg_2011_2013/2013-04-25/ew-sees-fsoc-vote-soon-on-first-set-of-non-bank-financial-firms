The Financial Stability Oversight
Council will “soon” vote on designations on an initial set of
non-bank financial companies that will determine which are
systemically important, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said in a statement.  The U.S. needs to strengthen markets that may be
susceptible to destabilizing runs and fire sales, increase
vigilance to operational risks and attract private capital to
the housing finance system, Lew said.  The committee, meeting in  Washington  today, discussed
“continued analysis” of a plan to designate non-bank financial
companies as systemically important, Lew said. “It is
critically important that the council take the time to get the
analysis right, and we expect to vote on designations of an
initial set of non-bank financial companies soon,” he said in
the statement.  Treasury Undersecretary  Mary Miller  said on March 4 that 
the FSOC may vote “in the next few months” on whether to 
designate some companies as systemically important, which puts 
them under Federal Reserve supervision.  American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial
Inc. and General Electric Co.’s finance unit have all said they
are in the final stage of review by the oversight council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
