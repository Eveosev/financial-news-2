The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  will
have to break above 296 to avoid surrendering its recent gains,
according to a technical analyst at ING Groep NV.  The Stoxx 600’s moving average convergence-divergence, or
MACD, climbed above a supporting trend line called a signal line
yesterday. The crossover signals an upward momentum for the
European equity benchmark. The Stoxx 600 will consolidate its
advance over the last week if it breaks through a resistance
level of 296 set in mid March and early April, Roelof-Jan van den Akker said in a telephone interview from Amsterdam.  The Stoxx 600 fell 5 percent from its March 14 high through
April 17. The gauge has subsequently rebounded 4.2 percent. It
added 0.4 percent to 295.67 at 2:21 p.m. in  London .  “It’s positive and it signals the upward bias within the
price chart, but it should be followed by a break above 296,”
Van den Akker said.“I would like to see a break above this line
to confirm that the correction has definitely ended which should
see a resumption of the longer-term uptrend. Until then, the
downside risks have not disappeared.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study graphs
