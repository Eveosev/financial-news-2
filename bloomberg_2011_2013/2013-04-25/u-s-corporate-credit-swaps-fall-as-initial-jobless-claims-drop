A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk declined as fewer Americans filed first-time claims for
unemployment insurance payments last week.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.2
basis points to a mid-price of 78.8 basis points at 8:40 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge
has fallen for five straight days.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 16,000 to
339,000 in the week ended April 20, the lowest since March 9,
according to Labor Department  data  released today in  Washington .
Economists projected 350,000 claims, according to the median
 estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. An improving employment outlook
may ease investor concern that companies will struggle to repay
their debts.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
