Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
businesses and luxury homes, said first-quarter profit rose
about 30 percent on better underwriting margins.  Net income advanced to $656 million, or $2.48 a share, from
$506 million, or $1.83, a year earlier, the Warren, New Jersey-

excludes some investment results, was $2.14 a share, beating the
$1.74 average  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chubb joins  Travelers Cos. (TRV)  in reporting better earnings

margin expansion,” Josh Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., said by phone before today’s statement. Chubb

shrinking while they drive higher pricing and tighter terms.”  Chubb fell 9 cents to $89.05 today in New York before the
company’s statement. The insurer has gained about 18 percent

collected for the quarter, up from 9.8 cents a year earlier.
