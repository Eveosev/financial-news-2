Smiles SA, the frequent-flier
program for  Brazil ’s  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) , is
raising as much as 1.13 billion reais ($565 million) in an
initial public offering.  Smiles and its shareholders are selling as many as 52.2
million shares in the primary offering for the Sao Paulo-based
company at 21.70 reais each, according to a filing today. That
was within the projected range of 20.70 to 25.80 reais a share.  Gol will use the proceeds to help repay debt of 5.2 billion
reais, the global industry’s highest as measured by the ratio of
net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. The airline is seeking to replicate the success of
 Multiplus SA (MPLU3) , the mileage-rewards plan that was spun off by
 Latam Airlines Group SA (LFL)  and has doubled since its IPO in 2010.  Smiles is the sixth IPO in Brazil this year, and the third
this week.  BB Seguridade Participacoes SA (BBSE3) ,  Banco do Brasil SA ’s
insurance unit, is raising $4.2 billion today, and  Alupar
Investimento SA (ALUP11)  raised $421 million on April 23.  Gol has jumped  23 percent  since Dec. 20, the day before
saying it was separating Smiles and considering an IPO. Sao
Paulo-based Multiplus fell after the announcement and has
tumbled 32 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
