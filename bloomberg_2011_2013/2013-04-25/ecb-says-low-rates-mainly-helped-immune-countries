The  European Central Bank  said the
reduction of borrowing costs to a historic low has mainly helped
financial institutions in more stable countries.  “The competition for higher yields triggered by the low
interest-rate environment appears to have benefited mainly
counterparties and financial instruments with relatively high
ratings, located in countries relatively immune from market
tensions,” the ECB said in its annual financial integration
report published today.  The Frankfurt-based ECB in July lowered its  benchmark rate 
to 0.75 percent and in September presented details of an
unlimited bond-buying plan, dubbed Outright Monetary
Transactions. Banks including Nomura International Plc, UBS AG
and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  forecast the ECB will cut
rates next week after policy makers hinted that they’d reduce
borrowing costs in response to disappointing economic data.  Another interest-rate cut would only have a limited effect
on countries in the periphery, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said in  London  today. “ Interest rates  that are too low
for too long can eventually lead to distortions.”  While decisions by European leaders to set up a banking
union and the ECB’s non-standard measures have helped restore
confidence in financial markets, “the recovery of banking
markets is proving to be slower and less vigorous than that of
other market segments,” the ECB said.  ECB officials are scheduled to meet in Bratislava on May 2
for their monthly policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
