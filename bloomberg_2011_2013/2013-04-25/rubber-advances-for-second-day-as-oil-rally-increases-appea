Rubber climbed for a second day to
the highest level in more than a week as a rally in oil boosted
the appeal of the commodity as an alternative to synthetic
products used to make tires.  Rubber for delivery in October advanced as much as 2.5
percent to 263.1 yen a kilogram ($2,644 a metric ton), the
highest level since April 16, before trading at 259.8 yen on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:39 a.m. The rally pared this
year’s loss for the most-active contract to 14 percent.  West Texas Intermediate crude traded near the highest level
in almost two weeks after surging the most this year, as a
government report showed that U.S. gasoline stockpiles tumbled.
Stronger oil prices add to costs of making synthetic rubber.  “Rubber was bought back along with oil and metals amid
expectations that monetary stimulus will support economic
recovery,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki
Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  The Bank of Japan will hold a policy meeting tomorrow after
unveiling a plan earlier this month to double its holdings of
government bonds in the next two years to end deflation. It may
upgrade its outlook on consumer-price gains excluding fresh food
to at least 1.5 percent from 0.9 percent for fiscal 2014,
according to people familiar with the central bank’s
discussions.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.2 percent to 19,000  yuan  ($3,075) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained for a third day, rising 0.6 percent
to 81.80 baht ($2.83) a kilogram yesterday, according to Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
