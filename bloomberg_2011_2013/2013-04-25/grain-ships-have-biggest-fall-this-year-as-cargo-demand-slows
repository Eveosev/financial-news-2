Rates for dry bulk carriers hauling
grains and minerals fell the most in a single session this year
as demand for cargoes slowed.  Day  rates  for Panamaxes, 750-foot-long ships capable of
hauling about 75,000 metric tons of cargo, slid 3.8 percent to
$8,955, the most since Dec. 20, according to the  Baltic Exchange 
in London, which publishes shipping prices on more than 50
maritime routes. Today’s decrease, the third in a row, means
costs plunged to the lowest since April 12, exchange data show.  Rates for grain-carrying Panamaxes declined 6.7 percent
over the last three sessions, as charterers appeared to “step
back” from booking ships ahead of a public holiday in parts of
 Asia , investment bank RS Platou AS said today. April 29 through
May 1 are public holidays in  China , the world’s biggest producer
and consumer of wheat, according to data from the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture .  “The Panamax market, which had a run up toward the $10,000
mark last week, is falling slightly back due to limited
requirements in both the Atlantic and the Pacific,” according
to an e-mailed report from Fearnley Securities AS. “Current
average rates are in the $9,000 to $10,000 a day range.”  The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure of commodity shipping
costs lost 0.8 percent to 872 points, the lowest since April 11,
according to the exchange.  Earnings for Capesize vessels, which are about twice the
size of Panamaxes and haul iron ore and coal, added 2 percent to
$4,289 a day, the bourse said. That capped a series of eight
successive losses, the data show.  Rates for Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller than
Panamaxes, were little changed at $9,455. Handysizes, the
smallest vessels tracked by the gauge, gained 0.2 percent to
$8,043, exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
