Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the
cruise operator which saw guests affected by a stomach virus on
one of its ships last month, advanced the most in six months
after reaffirming its 2013 profit forecast.  The stock  advanced  5.2 percent to $36.07 at the close in
New York, for the biggest one-day increase since Oct. 25. The
shares have gained 6.1 percent this year, compared with an 11
percent gain for the Russell 1000 Index.  The cruise industry has been beset by issues in recent
months. Royal Caribbean in March said 105 passengers on its
Vision of the Seas vessel were sickened with a bug thought to be
norovirus. Rival  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  said this month it will spend as
much as $700 million on fire protection and backup systems after
at least three incidents on ships at sea this year.  “The company expects that negative effects from the
adverse industry media coverage in March” will be offset by
favorable performance in the first quarter, according to a
statement from Miami-based Royal Caribbean today. “Despite the
difficult economic news in the EU, demand from European-sourced
guests strengthened in early February,” the company said.  Annual earnings per share will be $2.30 to $2.50, Royal
Caribbean reiterated today. Analysts projected $2.44, according
to the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  First-quarter net income rose 62 percent to $76.2 million,
or 35 cents a share, from $46.9 million, or 21 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 4.2 percent to $1.91 billion, topping
estimates for $1.90 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
