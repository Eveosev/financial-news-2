Soybeans rose the most in five
weeks on signs of increased demand for U.S. products made from
the oilseed amid tightening supplies. Corn and wheat also
advanced.  In the week ended April 18, U.S. exporters sold 193,320
metric tons of soybean meal for delivery before Oct. 1, the
Department of Agriculture said today. Since the start of the
crop year,  sales  have climbed 37 percent from a year earlier.
Soybean processors in central Illinois are paying as much as
$1.15 a bushel more than the price of July futures to acquire
supplies, said Greg Grow at Archer Financial Services Inc.  “The basis is at a record and a sign that processors can’t
source soybeans,” Grow, Archer’s director of agribusiness, said
in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “Farmers are not selling
or have already sold all the soybeans left from the drought-
reduced crop last year.”  Soybean futures for delivery in July added 2 percent to
close at $13.7225 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since March 21. July soybean-meal
futures climbed 2.4 percent to $400.10 for 2,000 pounds of the
 animal feed , the biggest increase since Feb. 19.  Yesterday, the USDA said exporters sold 116,000 metric tons
to unknown buyers for delivery in the 12 months that start Sept.
1, after reporting a sale of 392,000 tons to  China  a day
earlier.  Corn advanced on signs of rising demand from ethanol
producers and overseas buyers.  U.S. ethanol  production  rose 2.5 percent in the week ended
April 19, a report from the Energy Information Administration
showed yesterday. U.S. exporters sold 540,000 tons of corn for
delivery after Sept. 1, including 300,000 to China, the USDA
said today.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1 percent to $6.245 a
bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, prices increased 0.7 percent after
falling to $6.10, the lowest since June 26. Wheat futures for
delivery in July climbed 1.7 percent to $7.0375 a bushel on the
CBOT, the biggest gain since April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
