French President Francois Hollande,
speaking after a meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping, called on  China  to ease market access to narrow its
trade surplus with France.  While France needs to improve its competitiveness, Hollande
said he wanted more partnerships between the two countries
beyond ones that have been signed in nuclear power and civil
aviation. The plane deal involved 60  Airbus (EAD)  jets, which will be
mainly built in China.  “I brought up the question frankly with the Chinese
president, who is also aware that it’s not sustainable,”
Hollande told reporters today. “This means that we need to be
engaged, that our competitiveness improves and that Europe
returns to growth. But it also means more opening of the Chinese
market, trade on more than just nuclear plants and aircraft.”  France  runs a 26 billion-euro ($34 billion) trade deficit
with China, according to French officials. Its trade deficit in
2012 totaled 67 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
