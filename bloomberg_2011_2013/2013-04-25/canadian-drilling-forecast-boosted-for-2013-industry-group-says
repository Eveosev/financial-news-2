Canadian oil and natural gas
drilling will rise 9 percent this year, an industry group said,
boosting its estimates from November.  The higher forecast was attributed to an increase in gas
drilling in British Columbia and more oil drilling in  Alberta ,
the  Petroleum Services Association of Canada  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Companies are expected to drill 12,000 wells, a
600-well increase from the group’s prior projection.  “Drilling activity is keeping on a steady pace this year,
and we anticipate another pick up in activity” in the third and
fourth quarters, Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the
Calgary-based organization, said in the statement.  Natural gas prices gained 39 percent in New York during the
first quarter of 2013, compared with a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
