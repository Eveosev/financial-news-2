Intuit Inc. (INTU) , a provider of tax and
personal-finance software, tumbled the most in a decade after a
decline in  Internal Revenue Service  returns received in the
recent tax season prompted it to cut sales and profit forecasts.  The stock fell 11 percent to $57.09 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day decline since March 2003. At least
three  analysts  reduced their ratings for the  Mountain View ,
California-based company.  Intuit, which makes QuickBooks and TurboTax software used
by consumers to file taxes, said it expects sales of the latter
product to increase 4 percent in fiscal 2013 after IRS returns
received through April 12 fell 2 percent from a year earlier.
The company previously forecast as much as 10 percent annual
sales growth for the consumer tax business, which generates
about 45 percent of Intuit’s operating income, according to
Wayne Johnson, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc.  “Any slowdown in that highly profitable business will slow
profitability growth for the rest of the company,” Johnson
wrote in a report today. The Atlanta-based analyst cut his
rating on Intuit stock to market perform, the equivalent of a
hold, from outperform.  Third Quarter  Intuit reduced its forecast for net income in the fiscal
third quarter -- when the company brings in about half its
annual revenue -- to $2.79 to $2.81 a share, from a prior
projection for as much as $2.88 a share, according to a
statement issued yesterday after the close of regular trading.  Sales in the period, which ends April 30, will be $2.17
billion to $2.18 billion, compared with an earlier forecast for
as much as $2.28 billion. Analysts on average had  estimated 
revenue would be $2.25 billion.  Revenue for the year ending on July 31 will be $4.5 billion
to $4.52 billion, compared with a prior forecast of $4.55
billion to $4.65 billion, Intuit said. Analysts had been
predicting $4.59 billion on average.  “This was a tough tax season overall,” Chief Executive
Officer  Brad Smith  said in the statement.  Today’s drop wiped out Intuit’s gains for the past year,
leaving the shares little changed. By comparison, the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index has gained 14 percent in 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
