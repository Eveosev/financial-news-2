China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) 
said its newly developed aviation biofuel was successfully used
on a test flight by a  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) â€™ Airbus 320
plane yesterday.  Its unit Sinopec Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Co. produced
the biofuel with  palm oil  and recycled cooking oil, Sinopec, as
the Chinese petroleum refiner and crude oil producer is known,
said in a statement on its website.  China joins the U.S.,  France  and Finland in developing
biofuel for aircraft, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
