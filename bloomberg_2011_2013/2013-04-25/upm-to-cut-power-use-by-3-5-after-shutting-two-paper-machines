UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ’s closing of two
paper machines in  Finland  and  Germany  to save money may cut its
annual global power use by 3.5 percent, according to data from
Europe’s second-biggest  paper maker .  UPM’s annual electricity consumption in Finland may fall
329 gigawatt-hours, and by 235 gigawatt-hours in Germany, based
on data in its 2011 environmental report. The Helsinki-based
company’s global electricity use was 15,900 gigawatt-hours in
2011, according to its annual report.  Finland’s biggest electricity user is closing newsprint
machine number 3 in Rauma, and magazine paper machine number 4
in Ettringen, Germany to cut costs amid falling demand, UPM said
today in its first-quarter earnings statement. Power use in
Finland’s forestry sector slumped 28 percent to 20,100 gigawatt-
hours last year after producers including UPM and  Stora Enso Oyj (STERV) 
shut unprofitable plants.  UPM’s machine closures will cut annual production capacity
by 275,000 metric tons in Finland and 175,000 tons in Germany.
The company used 1.34 megawatt-hours of power on average to
produce one ton of paper, according to its 2011 environmental
report.  Antti Ylitalo, a spokesman for the Helsinki-based paper
maker, declined to comment on UPM’s energy use, citing company
policy.  The paper maker is Finland’s second-biggest electricity
producer, and a net seller of power in Finland and Uruguay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
