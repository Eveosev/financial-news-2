Li & Fung Ltd. (494)  had its credit
rating lowered one level by  Standard & Poor’s  because growth at
the world’s largest supplier of clothes and toys to retailers
may be slower than needed to meet earnings targets.  The rating on Li & Fung’s outstanding senior unsecured
notes was cut to BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade rating,
from A-, S&P said in a statement.  Li & Fung has declined 26 percent this year, the biggest
percentage decline on the  Hang Seng Index  in Hong Kong. Growth
at the trading and logistics businesses of the  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and  Target Corp. (TGT)  supplier is “likely to be weaker” than
needed to meet its three-year earnings targets, the ratings
company said.  “We do not expect the company’s financial strength to be
restored to a level that supports an ’A-’ rating,” Bei Fu, a
credit analyst at S&P, said in the statement. “Li & Fung faced
greater challenges while executing its expansion strategy than
it had expected, especially amid a weak global economy in the
past two years.”  S&P also cited the $39 million operating loss last year for
the distribution unit, which licenses and supplies branded goods
to retailers.  The Hong Kong-based outsourcer’s Chief Executive Officer
 Bruce Rockowitz  last month said the company will miss its 2013
profit target after net income dropped for the first time in
four years as a sluggish  U.S. economy  damped demand. He had in
2010 set a goal of $1.5 billion operating profit for 2013.  Shares of Li & Fung rose 1.1 percent to HK$10.06 in Hong
Kong. The benchmark Hang Seng Index advanced 1 percent.  Fu, who had placed the Hong Kong-based company on credit
watch negative on Jan. 14, said Li & Fung is expected to adopt a
more conservative acquisition strategy in 2013, and will make
fewer purchases versus the last two years.  S&P first initiated its A- rating of Li & Fung in 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
