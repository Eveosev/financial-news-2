Gasoline futures rose as positive
economic news out of the U.S. and U.K. increased optimism that
demand for transportation fuels will climb. Crack spreads
widened.  Futures gained as much as 1.1 percent. The fuel’s  premium 
over June West Texas Intermediate grew 40 cents to $24.55 a
barrel, while the  spread  versus Brent widened 19 cents to
$14.04. Britain’s economy expanded more than forecast in the
first quarter. Fewer Americans than expected filed first-time
claims for unemployment insurance payments last week.  “Everyone was really focused on  London  this morning,
fearing economic data that could put us into triple-dip
recession,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for the
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Instead the numbers blew away
expectations.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 1.39 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.7613 a gallon at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on volume that was 8.8 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.512 a gallon, AAA said on its website today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery rose 1.58 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.8571 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume
