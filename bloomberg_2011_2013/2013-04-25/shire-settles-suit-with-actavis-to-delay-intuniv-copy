Shire Plc (SHP)  agreed to a legal
settlement preventing  Actavis Inc. (ACT)  from introducing a low-cost
copy of Shire’s Intuniv drug for attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder until December 2014.  Actavis will get a license from Shire to sell the copy
beginning Dec. 1, 2014, or earlier in certain circumstances,
Dublin-based Shire said in a statement today. In return, Actavis
will pay a royalty of 25 percent of gross profit for the first
180 days that the generic is on the market, Shire said.  Actavis, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , in October won
U.S. approval for a generic version of the pill, which generated
revenue of $287.8 million last year for Shire. Shire sued,
saying it has valid patents on the drug. As part of their
agreement, Actavis conceded that its products infringed two
valid Shire patents that expire in 2020 and 2022.  The agreement “removes some near-term forecast risk” for
Shire, said Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in
 London .  Shire, the world’s largest maker of ADHD drugs, fell 0.8
percent to close at 1,997 pence in London. Actavis climbed less
than 1 percent to $98.89 at 4 p.m. in New York.  The agreement must be submitted to the U.S. Justice
Department and Federal Trade Commission for review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
