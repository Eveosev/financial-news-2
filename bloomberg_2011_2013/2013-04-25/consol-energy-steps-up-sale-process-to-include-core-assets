Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the largest
U.S. coal producer by market value, said it stepped up the sale
of assets to include “core” assets such its coal- and gas-
transportation infrastructure.  “We have a process in place to evaluate and potentially
monetize several assets this year as long as we receive fair
value for those assets,” Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Consol
said today in its first-quarter earnings statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
