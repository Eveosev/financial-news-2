CaixaBank SA,  Spain ’s third-largest
lender, said first-quarter profit jumped after booking a one-
time gain of 1.77 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from the purchase
of nationalized  Banco de Valencia SA .  Net income climbed to 335 million euros from 48 million
euros a year ago, the Barcelona-based bank said in a filing to
regulators today. The profit beat the 220 million-euro average
estimate in a  Bloomberg (CABK)  survey of eight analysts.  Spanish banks are anticipating earnings growth this year
after carrying out the bulk of a real estate cleanup that
required recognizing 84 billion euros of losses on assets that
soured during the country’s property crash. Firms including
CaixaBank still face rising defaults for company and consumer
loans in a weak Spanish economy that is sapping credit demand.  CaixaBank posted a total of 2.22 billion euros of  capital
gains , including negative goodwill for Banco de Valencia, which
it agreed to buy for 1 euro from Spain’s bailout fund in
November. Negative goodwill is a gain occurring when the price
paid for an asset is less than the stated fair value.  Loan-loss provisioning rose to 16.8 billion euros from 12.1
billion euros at the end of 2012 and tripled from 6.2 billion
euros a year earlier, it said. Bad loans as a proportion of
total loans at the bank’s 6,400 branches rose to 9.4 percent
from 8.6 percent in December as loans to real estate developers
deteriorated, CaixaBank said.  The core Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, fell to 10.6 percent from 11 percent a year ago. The
ratio of loans to deposits dropped to 126 percent from 129
percent, it said.  Net interest income, revenue from interest after
subtracting interest paid, rose 12.3 percent in the first
quarter from a year ago to 992 million euros after the bank
purchased Banco de Valencia and Banca Civica SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
