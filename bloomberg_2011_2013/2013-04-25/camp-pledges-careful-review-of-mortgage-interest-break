The top Republican tax writer in
Congress pledged a “careful, thoughtful review” of tax breaks
for homeowners, including the mortgage interest deduction.  “Not every credit or deduction is a loophole,”
Representative  Dave Camp  of Michigan, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, said at a hearing today in Washington.  In 2012, the home mortgage interest deduction cost the
government $68 billion, according to the congressional  Joint
Committee on Taxation .  Critics of the deduction, including Eric Toder of the
nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center , say it does little to encourage
homeownership and instead provides a benefit to higher-income
households to purchase larger homes.  The deduction is available only to the one-third of
taxpayers who itemize their deductions and tend to have higher
incomes. More than three-quarters of the benefit in 2012 went to
households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000.  “The key is really to focus the tax benefits more
carefully,” said  Phillip Swagel , a public policy professor at
the  University of Maryland  who was a Treasury Department
official under President  George W. Bush .  Camp is pursuing a rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would
curtail tax breaks and lower rates.  At today’s hearing, the committee is also examining other
tax breaks for housing, including the ability to deduct property
taxes, which cost the government $24 billion in 2012 in forgone
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
