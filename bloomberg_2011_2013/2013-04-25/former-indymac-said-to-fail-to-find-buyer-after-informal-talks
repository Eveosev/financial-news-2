OneWest Bank FSB, the lender once
known as IndyMac Bancorp Inc., failed to find a buyer after
holding informal talks with at least three suitors, according to
people familiar with the matter.  OneWest’s owners had sought to determine whether they could
best recoup their investment through a sale or an IPO, said the
people, who asked not to be named as the process was private.
UnionBanCal Corp. and  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  both held talks with OneWest,
people familiar with the matter said in February.  New York 
Community Bancorp Inc. also spoke with OneWest, one person said.  “The company is focused on its business plan and becoming
a public company in 2014,” said  Charles Sipkins , a spokesman
for the Pasadena, California-based lender at Sard Verbinnen &
Co. A spokesman for New York Community declined to comment,
while representatives at UnionBanCal and U.S. Bancorp didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment.  OneWest joins other banks with less than $50 billion in
assets such as First NBC Bank Holding Co., First Northwest
Bancorp and Tristate Capital Holdings Inc. in planning U.S.
IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A bank hasn’t
raised more than $100 million in a U.S. IPO since Capital Bank
Financial Corp. completed a $189 million sale in September, the
data show.  OneWest had almost 80 branches and about $26 billion in
assets as of Dec. 31, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. The FDIC seized IndyMac after a run on the bank in 2008
and sold it to an investor group led by OneWest Chairman Steve Mnuchin, a former partner with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Mnuchin’s consortium included Dell Inc. founder  Michael Dell , financier J.C. Flowers and billionaires  George Soros  and
 John Paulson . The group invested $1.55 billion in IndyMac and
renamed it OneWest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
