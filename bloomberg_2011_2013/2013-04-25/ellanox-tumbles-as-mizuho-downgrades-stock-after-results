Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  sank the
most since January in  New York  as Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and
Needham & Co. downgraded the stock after the Israeli company
forecast revenue that was below analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the maker of data transferral and storage
software fell 13 percent to $53.61 by 12:11 p.m. in New York,
set for the biggest one-day drop since Jan. 3. The company led a
0.8 percent decline in the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of
the 25 largest Israeli companies traded in the U.S. Mellanox
slid 7.9 percent in  Tel Aviv  to 203.10 shekels, or $56.30.  Needham and Mizuho cut their  recommendations  on the Yokneam
Elit, Israel-based company, boosting the tally of analysts
rating Mellanox the equivalent of hold to 10 of 18, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Second-quarter sales will be as much
as $97.5 million, the company said yesterday after markets
closed, trailing the $108 million average of 14 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s some disappointment as far as outlook was
concerned,”  Rajesh Ghai , a Dallas-based analyst at Craig-Hallum
Capital Group Ltd. who has a hold rating on Mellanox, said by
phone. “Demand is weak and visibility doesn’t seem too high.”  Mellanox does not expect any “large deal” in the current
quarter, Chief Executive Officer Eyal Waldman said on a
conference call yesterday.  Shares have slumped about 55 percent in New York from a
record-high reached Sept. 6. Mellanox, which  gained  83 percent
in 2012, reported earnings that beat estimates every quarter
since its initial public offering in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
