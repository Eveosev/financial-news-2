MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer whose shares more than doubled this year, said it
settled part of a dispute with Bank of America Corp. over loans
that it covered.  The accord excludes a disagreement over the curtailment of
some coverage, and the parties plan to mediate the dispute and
enter arbitration if necessary, Milwaukee-based MGIC said today
in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
