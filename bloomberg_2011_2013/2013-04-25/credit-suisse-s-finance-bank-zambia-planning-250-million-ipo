Story was originally published on April 25.)  Finance Bank Zambia Ltd., which is
40 percent owned by  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , plans to raise $250
million selling stock on the Lusaka Stock Exchange in October,
Chairman Rajan Mahtani said.  The funds will be used to expand to benefit from banking
industry growth of more than 30 percent a year, he said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. The initial public offering
will be followed by an international listing in 2014, Mahtani
said in a copy of a speech dated April 23. Finance Bank will
list shares in Johannesburg and London, the Lusaka-based Daily
Mail said, citing Mahtani.  “Raising $250 million on the local market would be pretty
tricky,” Chenge Besa, an analyst at Stockbrokers Zambia Ltd.,
said by phone from Lusaka. “Is it feasible on the local market?
Probably not.”  Zambian lenders are benefiting from an economy that grew
7.3 percent last year, according to the central bank. Only 37
percent of the so-called bankable population have accounts,
Zambia National Commercial Bank Plc said April 9.  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Standard Bank (SBK)  Group Ltd., and  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  have
operations in the country. President  Michael Sata  canceled the
sale of Finance Bank to Johannesburg-based FirstRand a month
after coming into power in September 2011.  Finance Bank made 51 million kwacha ($9.5 million) in
after-tax profit in 2012, Mahtani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
