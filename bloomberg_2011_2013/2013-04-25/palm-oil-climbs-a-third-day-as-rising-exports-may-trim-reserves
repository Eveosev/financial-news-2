Palm oil advanced for a third day
to the highest level in almost two weeks on speculation that
rising exports from  Malaysia  may help pare stockpiles in the
world’s largest producer after Indonesia.  The contract for July delivery climbed as much as 1.6
percent to 2,326 ringgit ($765) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for the most-active
futures since April 12, before trading at 2,315 ringgit at 12:23
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The gain trimmed losses for the most-
active contract to 5 percent this year.  Exports from Malaysia increased 5.3 percent to 1.12 million
tons in the first 25 days of this month from the same period in
March, surveyor Intertek said today. Reserves dropped to a
seven-month low of 2.17 million tons last month as exports
advanced, according to Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board data. Output,
which gained 2.2 percent last month, typically picks up in the
second quarter.  “If production is not growing that fast, and exports
improve, there’s a good chance that stocks may come down,” said
Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “Malaysian
production on a month-on-month basis may not grow that much.”  Soybean oil  for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to 49.10
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans
gained 0.6 percent to $13.53 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery advanced 1.5
percent to 6,022  yuan  ($976) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , after closing at the lowest price since October 2009
yesterday. Soybean oil climbed 0.7 percent to 7,366 yuan a ton,
rebounding from the lowest close since February 2010 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
