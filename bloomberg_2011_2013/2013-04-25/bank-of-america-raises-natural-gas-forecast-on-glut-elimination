Bank of America Corp. raised its
forecast for U.S. natural gas prices in 2013 after the biggest
drawdown from storage in a decade left inventories below the
five-year average.  Natural gas will trade at an average $3.90 per million
British thermal units, Sabine Schels, an analyst at the bank in
 London , said in an e-mailed report dated yesterday, raising her
prediction from $3.75. Prices will drop to $3.50 this summer,
she said. The bank maintained its 2014 forecast at $4.20. Month-
ahead gas rose 25 percent this year to trade at $4.19 per
million Btu at 6:28 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The use of gas in power generation in place of coal is
still needed to support prices as inventories are at the fourth-
highest level on record for the time of year, Schels said.  “A key risk stems from reversing coal-to-gas switching in
power generation too sharply as some coal substitution is still
required to balance the market,” she said. “Coal substitution
remains an important price driver this summer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
