Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell for
a fourth week, with the 15-year average hitting a record low,
helping to strengthen the housing recovery.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.40
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.41 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate dropped to 2.61 percent from 2.64 percent.  Buyers competing for a tight supply of available homes are
pushing up prices, while low mortgage rates fuel demand. U.S.
house  prices jumped  7.1 percent in the year through February,
the biggest gain since 2006, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency 
said this week.  “The housing recovery does seem to be in place,” Celia Chen, a housing economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West
Chester , Pennsylvania, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  Purchases of  new homes  rose 1.5 percent in March from the
previous month to a 417,000 annual pace, more than economists
estimated, data from the Commerce Department showed this week.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
