The Republic of Congo is set to
reduce crude exports in June to seven lots, one less than next
month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The country will ship six 920,000-barrel consignments of
Djeno grade, the same as in May, as well as one cargo of
N’Kossa, according to the plan. There are two lots of N’Kossa
grade scheduled to be exported next month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
