Braskem SA (BRKM5) , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker, rose to a 19-month high as Banco Santander
SA joined Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in raising the
stock to buy after Brazil cut the industry’s taxes.  The shares gained for a sixth day, rallying 2.6 percent to
16.77 reais at 12:48 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a
closing basis since September 2011. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  benchmark rose
0.8 percent.  Santander’s analysts raised the stock to buy from hold,
citing Brazil’s move to reduce taxes known as PIS and Cofins on
raw materials used in the chemical industry. The measure, which
cuts the levy to 1 percent from 5.6 percent, takes effect on May
1 and will be gradually restored through 2018, Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  told reporters in Brasilia on April 23.  “We do not believe this week’s positive PIS/Cofins measure
announcement is fully priced in,” the Santander analysts wrote
in a note to clients dated today. The government aid should
support operating results, they wrote.  Shares of the Sao Paulo-based company have surged 31
percent this year as the Ibovespa slumped 8.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
