Vinci SA (ALO) , Europe’s biggest builder,
said first-quarter sales rose 3.4 percent as acquisitions and
new contracts offset a construction slowdown in some markets.  First-quarter sales climbed to 8.4 billion euros ($10.9
billion), the company, based in Rueil-Malmaison near Paris, said
in a statement today. In France, Vinci’s biggest market, sales
dropped 0.3 percent to 5.3 billion euros.  The company faces a slowdown in traffic at its French
Autoroutes highway infrastructure business amid rising
unemployment while cash-strapped European governments and
utilities hesitate to spend more on public projects. To counter
that, Vinci agreed in December to buy Portuguese airport
operator ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA for 3.1 billion euros to
benefit from growing travel to  Latin America  and Africa.  “The group is expecting business to be at least stable
in 2013, before taking the ANA or any other new acquisitions
into account,” Vinci said today. The company also predicts a
“small increase” at its Autoroutes unit.  The company’s order intake in the first quarter was  9.1
billion euros, an increase of 5.5 percent from a year earlier.  Significant contracts booked in the quarter include the
Atlantic Bridge in  Panama , the East End Crossing of the Ohio
River Bridges Project in Kentucky and a water engineering
contract in  Jamaica , the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
