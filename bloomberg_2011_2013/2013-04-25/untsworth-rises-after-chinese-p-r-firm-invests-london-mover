Huntsworth Plc (HNT)  rose the most in
four years after investors bet that the backing of a Chinese
company will help the operator of the Citigate public relations
firm boost business in the world’s second-largest economy.  Huntsworth  gained  16 percent to 61 pence in  London , the
biggest advance since December 2008 and the best performance
today on the FTSE All-Share Index.  China ’s BlueFocus
Communication Group agreed to invest 36.5 million pounds
($56.4 million) through a subscription of new shares as part
of a global strategic alliance, London-based Huntsworth said
in a statement.  “Both groups will be able to tap into each other’s client
base, skill sets and people while further expansion can be
undertaken jointly,”  Paul Richards , an analyst at Numis
Securities Ltd., said in a note. The deal is “transforming”
for both companies, said Richards, who increased his target
price for Huntsworth to 80 pence from 65 pence.  BlueFocus intends to buy 63 million new shares in
Huntsworth at a price of 58 pence each, a premium of 10 percent
over yesterday’s closing price. Huntsworth will use the proceeds
to “significantly reduce” debt and invest in growth, it said.  BlueFocus,  Asia ’s largest public relations company, will
take a 19.8 percent stake and CEO Oscar Zhao will join the U.K.
company’s board, Huntsworth said today. “BlueFocus provides
impetus for organic revenue growth driven by digital, startups
in fast-growing geographies, and talent,” it said.  The U.K. P.R. firm got just 6 percent of its revenue last
year from outside  Europe  and the U.S. It served about 2,200
clients last year including 83 Fortune 500 companies and 44
businesses on the FTSE 100 Index. Customers include Tullow Oil
Plc and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc.  Huntsworth also said today that pretax profit rose 17
percent in 2012 to 22.5 million pounds, while revenue declined
1.8 percent to 173 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
