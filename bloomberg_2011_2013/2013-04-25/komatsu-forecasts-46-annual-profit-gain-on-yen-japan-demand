Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s top
producer of excavators, forecast annual profit will rise 46
percent this fiscal year as a weaker yen makes its products more
attractive to customers outside  Japan .  Net income will probably rise to 184 billion yen ($1.86
billion) in the year started April 1 from the 126 billion yen in
profit reported today, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement. Komatsu’s fourth-quarter  profit  fell 6.5 percent to
35.2 billion yen from 37.6 billion yen a year ago.  Komatsu expects this year to be its best since the 12
months ended in March 2008, reflecting the benefit some
exporters are seeing following the Japanese currency’s 13
percent drop against the dollar this year. Demand for
construction machinery in Japan and  North America  will support
earnings, the company said.  Industry demand in China is expected to recover in the
current year with growth ranging from 3 percent to 8 percent,
the statement said. Komatsu’s sales volume will probably be flat
in the year started April while revenue by value is forecast to
increase 16.7 percent aided by the yen, CFO Mikio Fujitsuka
said.  Shares in Komatsu, the biggest maker of construction and
mining equipment after Caterpillar Inc. of the U.S., rose 0.2
percent to a more than 21-month high of 2,587 yen in  Tokyo 
before the release of earnings. That was the highest since July
6, 2011.  Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar cut its 2013 forecast
and lowered “significantly” its outlook for demand from
commodities producers. Profit in 2013 will be about $7 a share,
compared with a January projection of $7 to $9, the U.S. company
said April 22.  For the year ended March 31, profit at Komatsu fell 24
percent on lower demand in  China . Total sales declined 4.9
percent.  The yen traded at 99.07 yen to the dollar as of 3:15 p.m.
in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
