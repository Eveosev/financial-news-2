Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near the lowest level in more than four months,
as iron ore prices retreated to the lowest since March 21 and
high output weighed on the market.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,625  yuan  ($587) a
metric ton and was at 3,632 yuan at 10:09 a.m. local time.
Futures touched 3,578 yuan yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 5.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port fell 1 percent to $135.10 a
dry ton yesterday, Steel Index Ltd. data show. The  China  Iron
and Steel Association will release its production estimate
tomorrow for the mid-April period. Output should have increased,
Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone from
Xi’an today.  “The market is still quite bearish given the high output
and declining raw-material prices,” Dang said. “Futures could
test the 3,500 yuan support level in the next few days.”  China’s daily crude steel output in early April was
estimated to have risen 2.5 percent from late March, Custeel.com
analyst Hu Yanping said on April 18.  The average  spot price  for rebar dropped 0.2 percent to
3,570 yuan a ton yesterday, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
