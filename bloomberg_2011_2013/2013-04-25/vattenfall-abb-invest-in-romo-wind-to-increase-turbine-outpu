Yellow&Blue Investment Management
BV, a clean energy investor backed by Vattenfall AB, led a 4.8
million-euro ($6.2 million) investment in Romo Wind to benefit
from its development of technology to boost wind-farm output.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  unit ABB Technology Ventures, b-to-v Partners AG
and Romoâ€™s founders also contributed to the investment, Zug,
Switzerland-based Romo said today in an e-mailed statement.  Romo sells services to increase farm output 2 percent to 8
percent by improving the operation of turbine rotors, according
to its website. Its technology measures the speed and direction
of breezes, so rotors can be best aligned with the wind. The
company has signed contracts with utilities owning about 18
gigawatts of wind-power capacity, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
