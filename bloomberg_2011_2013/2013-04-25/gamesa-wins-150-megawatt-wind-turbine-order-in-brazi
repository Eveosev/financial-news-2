Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,
Spainâ€™s biggest wind turbine maker, won a 150-megawatt order to
supply, install and maintain devices in  Brazil .  Gamesa will supply 75 G97 2-megawatt machines for five 30-
megawatt wind farms in the town of Campo Formoso, Bahia state,
the Zamudio-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
It won the order from a group comprising of Atlantic Energias
Renovaveis SA and Casa dos Ventos.  Gamesa, which last year posted its first loss since selling
shares to the public in 2000, is seeking to tap demand outside
its home market of Spain, where the government last year ended
subsidies to new renewables projects. The company began
production in Brazil about two years ago and has secured
contracts totaling 936 megawatts in the Latin American nation.  Installation of the  wind turbines  is due to begin in the
second half of 2014 and end the following year, Gamesa said. The
manufacturer will also handle operations and maintenance at the
wind farms for 15 years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
