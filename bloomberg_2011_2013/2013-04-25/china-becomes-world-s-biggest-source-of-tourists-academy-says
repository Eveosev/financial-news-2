China  overtook  Germany  and the U.S.
to become the world’s biggest source of tourists after the
number of outbound trips taken by its citizens increased 18.4
percent last year.  Outbound travel from China climbed to 83.2 million trips
last year, Ma Yiliang, a researcher at the Beijing-based China
Tourism Academy said today. That number has surged more than
eight-fold from 2000, according to the official Xinhua News
Agency, which earlier reported the figures.  China is now also the biggest source of tourism
expenditure, up from third place in 2011 and seventh in 2005,
according to Xinhua.  China’s economy  grew an annual average of
10.5 percent over the past decade, helping boost incomes and
spur  consumer spending  by its citizens at home and abroad.  Mainland travelers spent $102 billion overseas in 2012, of
which about 65 percent was on shopping, Ma said, citing a report
released by the academy yesterday. Total spending by Chinese
tourists was about $73 billion in 2011, according to Xinhua.  Chinese visitors to Europe,  Hong Kong  or Singapore spent
11,000 euros ($14,351) on shopping per trip, according to a
survey published last year by Global Blue, the world’s biggest
operator of tax-refund points for tourists.  Almost 60 million people visited China last year, making
the country the third-most visited destination, Xinhua News
Agency reported on April 4, citing Taleb Rifai, general
secretary of the United Nations World Tourism Organization.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
