PetroChina Co. (857) ,  China ’s biggest oil
and gas producer, posted an 8 percent decline in first-quarter
profit as a weakening economy reduced demand for oil products.  Net income fell to 36 billion  yuan  ($5.84 billion), or 0.20
yuan a share, in the three months ended March 31 from 39.2
billion yuan, or 0.21 a share, a year ago, the Beijing-based
energy explorer and refiner said today in a statement to the
Shanghai Stock Exchange. The average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 34.3 billion yuan.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, shortened
its price-adjustment window to 10 days from 22 to help refiners
more closely reflect price changes in the global crude market.
PetroChina, the country’s second-biggest refiner behind  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , reported a 4.74 billion yuan
refining loss in the first quarter, compared with a 10.8 billion
yuan loss a year ago.  “Due to the macroeconomic situation, there was weak demand
for refined products and chemicals market remains in a
downturn,” PetroChina said in the statement.  Oil and gas output climbed 2.8 percent to 355.3 million
barrels of oil equivalent in the first quarter. Crude oil output
reached 231 million barrels in the three months, an increase of
1.8 percent from last year, according to the statement. Average
realized crude price was $103.08 a barrel, down 2.3 percent.  The shares gained 1.4 percent to close at HK$9.69, before
the earnings announcement. The stock has declined 13 percent in
the past year, compared with a 8.5 percent gain in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
