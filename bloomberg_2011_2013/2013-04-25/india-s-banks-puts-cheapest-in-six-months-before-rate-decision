The cost of bearish options on
Indian lenders dropped to the lowest level in six months amid
expectation the central bank will lower  interest rates  next week
to revive economic growth.  The CNX Bank Nifty Index’s skew spread, a measure of how
expensive puts, or bearish bets, are relative to calls, was at
minus 4.07, the lowest reading since Nov. 2 when the gap was
minus 5.92, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The bank gauge
comprises 12 lenders including  State Bank of India , the largest
by assets.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  may pare its benchmark rate by 25
basis points at a May 3 policy review, according to 14 of 16
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The bank index has jumped 14
percent in April, poised for the biggest monthly advance since
September, amid speculation a cut in borrowing costs would help
lenders boost lending and profitability.  “Investors are bullish on banks even after the runaway
rally,” Aditya Agarwal, a derivatives analyst at Way2Wealth
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone today. “Improving
fundamentals and expectation of a 50-basis point rate cut is
lending support to the bank index.”  The ratio of outstanding puts to sell the CNX Bank index
versus calls to buy was at 1.62 at 12:44 p.m., higher than its
12-month average of 0.93, the data show. April call options with
a strike price of 13,000 rupees and put options with a 12,500-
rupee strike have the largest ownership among bullish and
bearish contracts, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Puts give the right to sell a security for a certain
amount, called the strike price, by a given date. Calls convey
the right to buy.  The CNX Bank Nifty jumped 1.4 percent to 12,722 at 12:46
p.m., headed for highest close since Jan. 30. The markets were
closed yesterday for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
