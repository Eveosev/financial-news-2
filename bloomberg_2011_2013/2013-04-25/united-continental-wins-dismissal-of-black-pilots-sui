United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
won dismissal of a discrimination lawsuit by black pilots who
alleged that the airline offers minority employees fewer
promotions to upper management than whites.  U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco said
the pilots could file an amended complaint by May 20 to fix
deficiencies in the lawsuit that led to the dismissal, according
to an order yesterday. The plaintiffs failed to present enough
information to support claims that black pilots are adversely
affected when the Chicago-based company doesn’t post some
positions and were precluded from applying to certain positions,
she said.  Twenty-three African-Americans, most of whom are captains,
sued the airline last year alleging “highly subjective decision
making” about promotions discriminated against minority
captains.  Black pilots are subject to a “dual employment track” and
given part-time jobs with less job security and opportunity for
promotions, while non-minority employees get full-time, higher-
wage positions, according to the the complaint.  Dow Patten, an attorney for the pilots, didn’t immediately
respond after regular business hours yesterday to an e-mail
message seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Johnson v. United Continental Holdings Inc.,
12-2730, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California 
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
