Open Text  Corp.,  Canada ’s second-
biggest software services company by market value, surged the
most in more than two years after it said yesterday it will pay
a dividend for the first time.  Open Text, based in Waterloo, Ontario, rose 12 percent to
C$64.91 at 4 p.m in Toronto today, the biggest jump since August
2010.  The shares have  gained  17 percent this year, for a market
value of C$3.8 billion ($3.7 billion), compared with a 0.8
percent loss for the Standard & Poor’s TSX/Composite index.  Open Text declared an initial quarterly  dividend  of 30
Canadian cents a share, payable June 21, giving it an indicated
yield of 1.9 percent. The company also reported adjusted first-
quarter  earnings  of $1.26 a share, short of average estimates of
$1.30, according to a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Tom Liston, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, raised his
 rating  for Open Text to buy and increased his price target to
$68 from $60 on revenue license growth and “strong”  cash flow .
The stock has nine buys, three holds and three sells for the
stock with an average 12-month price target of C$69.66,
according to data  compiled  by Bloomberg.  “The dividend expands the universe of potential investors
and we expect that it will be well-received,” Liston said in a
note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
