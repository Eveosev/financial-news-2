Robusta coffee rebounded in London,
supported by a second day of gains in arabica futures, as
shipments from  Vietnam  are forecast to drop. Sugar slid.  Coffee exports from Vietnam, the biggest grower of the
robusta variety used in instant drinks and espresso, will
probably fall 35 percent in April to 110,000 metric tons,
according to a forecast by the General Statistics Office in
Hanoi. Shipments are down 17 percent this year. Arabica coffee
is heading for a second day of gains in New York after prices
fell as much as 4.6 percent on April 23.  “Sentiment will remain bullish for robusta, supported by
depreciating stock-levels,” Mathijs Deguelle, a soft
commodities analyst at ABN Amro Bank NV, said in a report e-
mailed today. “We expect robusta to appreciate to a level of
$2,300 a ton at the end of 2013, with significant risk on the
upside should markets perceive a shift to a deficit in the
2013-14 season.”  Robusta futures for delivery in July rose 0.1 percent to
$1,993 a ton by 11:21 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Arabica
futures for delivery in July gained 0.6 percent to $1.392 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Trading in arabica was 61
percent below the average for the past 100 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Robusta climbed 3.6 percent this year and arabica fell 3.2
percent. While speculators are betting on robusta price gains,
they hold wagers on lower prices for the arabica variety, data
from NYSE Liffe and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission on Bloomberg show.  ‘Soft Landing’  Arabica will make “a soft landing” at about $1.25 a
pound, ABN Amro forecast. That will result in the price
difference between the two coffee varieties being low enough to
spur roasters to use more arabica, Deguelle said. Arabica
futures were 49 cents a pound more expensive than robusta beans
at the time of writing,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The magic number for a sizeable switch is widely regarded
to be around 20 cents to 25 cents a pounds,” he said.  White sugar for August delivery was down 0.3 percent to
$497.80 a ton in London. Raw sugar for July delivery slid as
much as 0.7 percent to 17.25 cents a pound, the lowest since
July 19, 2010.  Cocoa for July delivery declined 0.4 percent to 1,544
pounds ($2,382) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa futures for July
delivery rose 0.5 percent to $2,337 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
