U.K. lawmaker Richard Ottaway who
chairs Parliament’s cross-party Foreign Affairs Committee wrote
to Foreign Secretary William Hague asking him to clarify whether
he agrees with U.S. policy to “do whatever is necessary” to
prevent  Iran  from accessing nuclear weapons.  The letter says the U.K. should establish whether Iran has
the capacity or intention to weaponize as it will be a key
concern in determining what further action to take, and asks the
foreign secretary to set out the government’s view on when Iran
would have “crossed the line.”  There is “a growing consensus that 2013 will be the year
in which the current deadlock over Iran’s program will, one way
or another, be broken,” Ottaway wrote, according to the letter
released by his committee today.  It also asks Hague to clarify is there has been a “shift”
in the negotiating positions of either Iran or the E3+3 group of
nations since a deadlock in talks last year. That grouping
refers to the U.K.,  France  and  Germany  in Europe alongside the
U.S.,  Russia  and China.  The Foreign Office did not immediately have a response to
the letter when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
