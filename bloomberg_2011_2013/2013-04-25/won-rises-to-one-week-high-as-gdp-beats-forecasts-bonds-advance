The won rose to the highest level
in more than a week after  South Korea ’s gross domestic product
increased the most in two years, beating forecasts.  Government
bonds  gained, pushing the five-year yield to a two-week low.  Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 0.9 percent in the
first quarter from the previous three months, when it grew 0.3
percent, the  Bank of Korea  said today. That exceeded the 0.7
percent median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The Kospi index advanced to a three-week high as
investors bought more constituent shares, exchange data show.  The won climbed 0.5 percent to 1,112.14 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,111.24, the strongest level since April 17. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, dropped 35 basis points, or 0.35
percentage point, to 7.45 percent.  “Sentiment is bolstered by the better-than-expected GDP
data, providing some impetus to the won,” said Hong Seok Chan,
a Seoul-based currency analyst at Daishin Economic Research
Institute. “Still, it seems to be hard for the won to break
through the 1,110 level amid concern the government may step in
to prevent rapid gains given the yen’s weakness.”  A slide in the yen has only started to affect the South
Korean economy, central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said
yesterday, adding that policy makers are closely looking at the
Japanese currency’s movement. The strong won and the weak yen
are still concerns, according to Lee Won Hee, chief financial
officer at  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , which today reported a 15 percent
drop in net income for the first quarter.  The Japanese currency fell 13 percent against the dollar
this year, while the won dropped 4.2 percent per dollar and
climbed 10 percent against the yen, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government bonds due March
2018 fell six basis points to 2.62 percent, the lowest since
April 10, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
