Serbian President  Tomislav Nikolic 
apologized for all crimes committed by Serbs during the violent
breakup of former  Yugoslavia , including the massacre in
Srebrenica, which he stopped short of calling a genocide.  Asked about the massacre of almost 8,000 men and boys in
Srebrenica, a Muslim-populated town in Serb-controlled
territory, after Dutch troops failed to protect the so-called UN
safe haven during the 1992-95 war with Bosnia, Nikolic said in
an interview on the Bosnian BHT television show Interview 20:
“I am kneeling and asking for forgiveness for the crimes
committed by any individual on behalf of our state.”  Nikolic, who was elected president in May 2012 general
elections, said last July that the deaths in Srebrenica, the
bloodiest chapter of Yugoslavia’s collapse, shouldn’t be
described as genocide. He stuck to that line in the excerpt of
the interview released today. The full version will be broadcast
on May 7.  A “genocide needs to be proven” as “everything that was
happening during the wars in the former Yugoslavia had a
character of a genocide,” Nikolic, who was a member of the
Serbian Radical Party between 1991 and 2008, which ruled
together with former President  Slobodan Milosevic ’s Socialists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
