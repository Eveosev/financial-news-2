Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
camera maker, was the worst performer in the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average after forecasting earnings below analyst estimates amid
slumping demand for compact models.  The stock  fell  6.4 percent to 3,595 yen at the close of
trading in Tokyo, the biggest decline since July 26.  Net income 
will probably be 290 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in 2013, the
Tokyo-based company said in a  statement  yesterday, missing the
308 billion-yen  average  of 20 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The maker of office printers, cameras and lenses cut its
full-year sales target for compact cameras by 15 percent to 14.5
million units as consumers increasingly use smartphones to snap
shots. Canon raised its net income projection as the yen’s
weakening to the lowest in about four years boosted the value of
overseas sales, which were about 79 percent of the 2012 total.  “Earnings are weak in all businesses, with cameras
particularly so,” Toshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in  Tokyo , said in a report yesterday, cutting his
share price forecast for the stock 9 percent to 3,630 yen.  For the quarter ended March 31, Canon reported a 34 percent
decline in net income to 40.9 billion yen, citing falling prices
and slowing economies in  China  and  Europe . That also missed the
average analyst estimate of 51.9 billion yen. Sales in the
quarter fell 1.5 percent to 816.7 billion yen, the company said.  Camera Demand  Operating margin dropped to about 6.7 percent in the first
three months of the year, the lowest since 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ll probably struggle to grow our businesses in the
first half of this year,” Toshizo Tanaka, Canon’s chief
financial officer, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday. Demand for
office printers and digital cameras has been sluggish, he said.  Global  shipments  of digital cameras almost halved to 4.26
million units in February from a year earlier, a 10th
consecutive monthly decline, according to the Camera & Imaging
Products Association in Tokyo. Shipments of compact models were
down 40 percent in the first two months of 2013 from a year
earlier, while that for cameras with interchangeable lenses
dropped 17 percent, according to the industry group.  “We think Canon’s first quarter results could prompt
concern over companies that are majorly involved in the compact
digital camera business,” Masahiro Shibano, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said in a report.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  fell 3.7 percent to 2,167 yen.  Weaker Yen  Canon revised its  exchange rate  forecast to 95 yen to the
dollar for the last three quarters of 2013, and to 125 yen for
the euro, the statement showed. That compares with 85 yen to the
dollar and 115 yen to the euro predicted three months ago.  The Japanese currency averaged 92.17 yen against the dollar
in the first quarter, compared with 79.32 yen a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Each 1-yen change in the value of the dollar would boost or
damp full-year operating profit by about 7.7 billion yen, Canon
 said  in January.  Sales may rise to 3.98 trillion yen this year, compared
with an earlier projection of 3.81 trillion yen. Operating
profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, may total 450 billion yen, the company said, raising
its earlier forecast by 9.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
