Most Brazilian stocks dropped, led
by cosmetics maker  Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) , as first-quarter
earnings reports signaled economic weakness is curbing profits.  Eight of nine companies on the 69-member equity gauge
reported first-quarter sales that trailed estimates, while five
missed earnings forecasts, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Natura fell the most in a month. Airline  Gol Linhas
Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  rose after O Estado de S.Paulo reported
Brazil may cut taxes on jet fuel. Vale SA, the world’s largest
iron-ore producer, rallied after results beat forecasts.  The Ibovespa sank 0.2 percent to 54,868.56 at 10:53 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. Forty-five stocks fell on the gauge while 20
advanced. The real was little changed at 2.0102 per dollar.  “The Bovespa’s performance from now on will depend on the
first-quarter earnings companies will report,” Sandro Fernandes, a trader at brokerage Corval, said by phone from  Belo
Horizonte , Brazil.  “We’ve had some reports that were not so
good, such as Natura’s. This earnings season will give a
direction to the equity market.”  Natura dropped 3 percent to 47.53 reais. Vale gained 2.3
percent to 32.83 reais after posting earnings in the first
quarter that beat estimates for the first time in two years.  Gol rose 5.1 percent to 13.86 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
