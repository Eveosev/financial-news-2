Russia , the world’s largest energy
exporter, plans to ship 1.66 million barrels a day of Urals
crude from two export terminals on the  Baltic Sea  in May, a 15
percent drop from April, a preliminary loading program showed.  The port of Primorsk plans to export 48 lots totaling 4.806
million metric tons next month, the schedule obtained by
 Bloomberg News  showed. Ust-Luga will ship 22 cargoes of 100,000
tons each. Each port has one unassigned slot of 100,000 tons.  Less crude will be available for export after the end of
Russia’s seasonal refining maintenance, which is expected to
peak this month, according to data from the Energy Ministry’s
CDU-TEK central dispatch unit.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be 3.265
million tons next month, or about 772,015 barrels a day, up 2.2
percent from this month. The May schedule includes four 80,000-
ton cargoes of Siberian Light grade and 27 Urals lots.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
