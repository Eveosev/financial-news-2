Nigeria’s National Economic Council
approved a $9 billion loan from lenders including the  Export-
Import Bank of China , the Islamic Development Bank and the
African Development Bank.  The loan, part of the country’s 2012-2014 borrowing plan,
will be used by federal and state governments to fund new
infrastructure, invest in agriculture and create jobs, National
Planning Minister Shamsudeen Usman told reporters today in
Abuja, the capital. Interest rates on the loan will be as low as
2 percent, and the repayment period is 40 years, with a 10-year
moratorium.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, relies on crude
exports for about 95 percent of its foreign-currency earnings
and 80 percent of government revenue, according to the Finance
Ministry. The West African country, sub-Saharan Africa’s most
populous, with more than 160 million people, is increasing
infrastructure spending to spur business and boost economic
growth.  The council, headed by Nigerian President Goodluck
Jonathan, also approved a $3.37 billion fund for electricity
projects, Usman said. Electricity transmission projects will get
$1.65 billion while hydro-power generation projects will receive
$1.72 billion. The fund will be disbursed by the federal
government, Usman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
