Brazil ’s swap rates declined as the
central bank said in minutes of last week’s policy meeting that
uncertainty requires caution, spurring speculation that
increases in borrowing costs will be limited.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.26 percent at 10:16 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. They dropped to 8.25 percent on April 23, the lowest
level since Feb. 14. The real appreciated less than 0.1 percent
to 2.0093 per  U.S. dollar .  The central bank said in minutes of its April 16-17
monetary policy meeting published today that mature economies
will face a prolonged period of slow economic growth. Board
members voted 6 to 2 to increase the Selic target lending  rate 
by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from a record low 7.25
percent. The two dissenters, who voted to keep borrowing costs
unchanged, said in the minutes that the world economy may help
slow Brazil’s inflation.  “The Selic hikes won’t total more than 100 basis points,”
Carlos Kawall, the chief economist at J. Safra in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview. “The minutes suggest a cycle of
that magnitude will be enough to bring 2014 inflation to around
5 percent.”  Consumer prices rose at an annual  rate  of 6.59 percent in
March, exceeding the upper limit of the central bank’s preferred
range for the first time since November 2011. The target is 4.5
percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  Brazil’s swap rates tumbled the day after the meeting as
the increase in borrowing costs was less than some analysts had
forecast. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18 of 58 analysts
had projected an increase of 50 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
