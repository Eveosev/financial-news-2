Kai Tschoeke,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s
chief of German and Austrian mergers and acquisitions, is
leaving the New York-based  bank  after more than 20 years.  Tschoeke, 45, who has been with the firm for his entire
career, will depart this year to pursue other interests,
according to a spokeswoman for the bank, who asked not to be
named in line with company policy. His tasks on the German
management board will be assumed by existing members, she said.  Morgan Stanley was ranked No. 1 in German M&A last year
after advising  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  on the merger of its T-Mobile
USA unit with  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  as well as industrial
gas-maker  Linde AG (LIN) ’s acquisition of Lincare. The bank is ranked
No. 5 so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tschoeke’s departure comes amid a shake-up of some of the
top M&A bankers in Germany as first-quarter deal volume in
Europe’s largest economy fell to the lowest level since the
second quarter of 2012. Ken Oliver Fritz, the head of  investment
banking  for Germany at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , is leaving to
become   Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) ’s co-head, Lazard said in an e-mailed
statement today. He’s replacing Alexander Doll, who was hired by
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  in August.  Tschoeke advised Putzmeister Holding AG, Germany’s largest
cement-pump maker, when it agreed to be bought by  Sany Heavy
Industry Co. (600031)  in 2002 in the biggest ever Chinese-German takeover
at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
