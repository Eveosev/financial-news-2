The ruble strengthened for a second
day as Russian exporters bought the currency ahead of tax
payments, while  government bonds  rallied on speculation that
Bank Rossii will cut  interest rates .  The ruble appreciated 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s
target basket of dollars and euros to 35.6194 by 1:09 p.m. in
Moscow. It gained 0.5 percent versus the dollar to 31.2965. The
yield on OFZ bonds due July 2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to a record low of 6.51 percent.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export, traded little changed in
 London  at $101.68 per barrel after rising 1.4 percent yesterday.
The ruble is appreciating as companies gather funds to pay
mineral extraction taxes and excise duties this week and ahead
of corporate income tax payments on April 29.  The ruble appreciated “thanks to selling of export revenue
before the payment of mineral extraction tax, rising oil and
demand for OFZs from foreign investors,” OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analysts,
led by Vladimir Kolychev, said in note today.  The  Finance Ministry  has sold out three OFZ bond auctions
in a row, raising 105 billion rubles ($3.4 billion) in total,
according to data published on its website. Slowing economic
growth and inflation is piling pressure on the central bank to
lower interest rates, which is feeding demand for OFZ debt.  Russia is currently the most overweight country in
portfolios of emerging-market bond managers, Morgan Stanley
analysts said today, citing EPFR Global data.  Bank Rossii said it spent the equivalent of 2.22 billion
rubles selling foreign currency and buying rubles on the market
on April 23. Today’s strengthening took the ruble out of the
central bank’s “intervention zone” after it spent 14.9 billion
rubles between April 15 and April 22, data on the  official
website  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
