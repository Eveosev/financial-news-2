Hog futures climbed to the highest
in almost three weeks on signs of increasing demand for U.S.
pork. Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale- pork  prices added 0.1 percent to 86.5 cents a
pound yesterday, the highest since Feb. 1, government data show.
Meatpackers processed 1.256 million hogs in the first three days
of this week, up 1.5 percent from the same period a year
earlier. Spot  hogs  rose 0.6 percent to 77.13 cents a pound, the
highest since April 12, government data show.  The pork price “is up, and that’s a good thing,” Paul Beere, a grain and livestock adviser at Prime Agricultural
Consultants in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “That leads to higher cash and better futures.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.6 percent to 91.55
cents a pound at 10:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching 91.575 cents, the highest for the most-active
contract since April 5.  Cattle futures for June delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$1.219 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.50475 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
