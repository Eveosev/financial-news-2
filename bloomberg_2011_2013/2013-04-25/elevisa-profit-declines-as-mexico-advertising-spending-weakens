Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the largest
maker of Spanish-language TV programs, said first-quarter profit
fell 29 percent as broadcast advertising weakened.  Net income dropped to 1.07 billion pesos ($88 million), or
38 centavos a share, from 1.51 billion pesos, or 53 centavos, a
year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa said yesterday in a
 statement . Sales rose 2.4 percent to 15.5 billion pesos, missing
the 16.2 billion-peso average of two analystsâ€™ estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Televisa is  investing  in networks offering cable and
satellite television to reduce its dependence on the broadcast
business, which is slowing as more viewers turn to the Internet
and pay TV. Advertising sales dropped 7.2 percent from a year
earlier to 4.21 billion pesos, partly because of a large drop in
government spending.  Satellite subscriptions rose by 259,567 to 5.4 million. The
three cable operators controlled by Televisa ended the quarter
with 2.36 million video customers, up 6.6 percent from a year
earlier.  Televisa fell 3 percent to 61.74 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The shares have fallen 9.5 percent this year,
compared with a 4.1 percent decline for the benchmark IPC index.  Net income was hurt by a 16 percent increase in
depreciation expenses, a smaller gain from currency fluctuations
than a year earlier, and 217.7 million pesos in losses by Grupo
Iusacell SA, the mobile-phone company in which Televisa has a 50
percent stake.  Operating profit, which leaves out those items, rose 3.2
percent to 3.39 billion pesos, Televisa said.  (Televisa is scheduled to discuss results on a conference
call at 10 a.m.  New York  time. For details, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
