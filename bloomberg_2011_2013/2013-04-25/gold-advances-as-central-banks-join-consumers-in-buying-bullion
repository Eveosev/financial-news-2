Gold futures rose the most since June following purchases by central banks and signs of increasing investor demand on the heels of last week’s biggest plunge in three decades. Silver posted the biggest gain in 15 months.  Russia and  Kazakhstan  expanded  gold reserves  in March for the sixth straight month, International Monetary Fund data show. The volume for the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s benchmark contract has been more than four times last year’s daily average every day since April 16, while monthly coin sales by the U.S. Mint are heading for the highest since December 2009.  “News about central banks buying is very bullish,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in  Port St. Lucie ,  Florida , said in a telephone interview. “Prices are roaring higher with reports of increased physical buying worldwide.”  Gold futures for June delivery jumped 2.7 percent to settle at $1,462 an ounce at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 29.  Futures have rebounded 11 percent since dropping to a two- year low of $1,321.50 on April 16. On April 15, the metal plummeted 9.3 percent, the most in 33 years, after entering a  bear market  on April 12.  After the settlement, gold reached $1,468.60, the highest since April 15, amid concern that tension may escalate in the  Middle East  after the Obama administration said it has seen some evidence that Syrian government forces used the deadly chemical sarin in the civil war.  ‘Big Push’  The assessment is “not sufficient” to take action, Miguel E. Rodriguez, President  Barack Obama ’s legislative liaison to Congress, said in a letter to lawmakers dated today.

The total for December 2009 was 231,500 ounces. The mint said on April 23 that it ran out of its smallest American Eagle coin.
