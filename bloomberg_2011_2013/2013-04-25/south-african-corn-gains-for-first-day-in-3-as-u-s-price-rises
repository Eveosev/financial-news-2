South African corn futures rose for
the first time in three days after an increase in prices for the
grain in the U.S. where a government report showed higher output
of grain-based ethanol.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
climbed 1.1 percent to 2,106 rand ($232) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
Prices for the yellow variety increased 1.7 percent to 2,093
rand a ton.  Corn futures for delivery in July advanced for a second day
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Ethanol production increased 2.5
percent to 853,000 barrels a day, pushing the three-week average
to the highest since July.  South Africa is the continentâ€™s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as animal feed.  Wheat for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to 3,355 rand a
metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
