Volga Gas Plc (VGAS) , a natural-gas
producer in western and southern  Russia , expects to benefit from
higher prices and ease of access to pipelines as demand outpaces
supply in the regions where it operates.  “There is a deficit of gas in the western and southwestern
part of Russia,” Michael Calvey, a board member at the London-
based company, said in an interview. “A cubic meter of gas in
Saratov or Volgograd is much more valuable than in Siberia.”  Russia’s gas heartland of Siberia is where OAO Gazprom, the
world’s biggest producer of the fuel, pumps most of its output.
Other gas companies in the region must compete to access
pipelines, whereas those operating elsewhere can offload their
output to the state-controlled producer for export.  “When you are in a region where there is a deficit,
Gazprom is happy to buy your gas,” Calvey said. “It frees them
up to export more gas to  Europe  at a much higher price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
