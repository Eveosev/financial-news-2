Former Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher ’s funeral last week cost the U.K. government around 3.6
million pounds ($5.6 million), mostly for security.  The cost had been estimated at as much as 10 million pounds
by the Daily Mirror newspaper.  According to Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s spokesman,
Jean-Christophe Gray, the breakdown was 500,000 pounds in
“ceremonial costs” from the use of St Paul’s Cathedral, a
reception afterward at the Mansion House in the City of London,
and the printing of invitations; 1.1 million pounds in
additional police security costs; and about 2 million pounds for
police diverted from other duties.  Thatcher’s funeral on April 17 drew thousands of mourners
and opponents to central London. More than 800 troops lined the
route of her coffin, with 4,000 police on duty.  The Thatcher family bore the costs of undertaking and
flowers, Gray said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
