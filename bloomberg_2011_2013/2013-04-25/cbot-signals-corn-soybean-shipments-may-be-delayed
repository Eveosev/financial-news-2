CME Group Inc., the world’s biggest
agricultural futures exchange, set a condition for canceling
corn and soybean shipments from most terminals along the
 Illinois River  following flooding and a barge accident.  Loading may be delayed for a number of days under exchange
rules, Chicago-based CME Group said today in a statement. The
first day to announce plans to deliver corn and soybeans against
May futures contacts at locations on the River is April 30.
There were no grain or oilseed supplies registered for delivery
as of yesterday, according to a report from the Chicago Board of
Trade report, a CME unit.  The CME declaration “will not make a difference for supply
or demand, since no deliveries were expected,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in
Bloomington,  Illinois . “It’s not a big surprise. Most grain
merchants had already shifted to price cash corn and soybeans
off the July futures, so it should not have a big impact.”  As many as four  locks  had been closed on the Illinois
River, and the U.S. Coast Guard closed marine traffic because of
flood risk. The Marseilles, Illinois, lock was  damaged  by a
barge accident on April 19.  A record amount rain fell in parts of Illinois this month.
Last year, the worst drought since the 1930s forced barge
companies to idle ships in December and January because of low
water levels along the  Mississippi River , the busiest U.S.
waterway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
