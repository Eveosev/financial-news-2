Khazanah Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s
state investment company, selected three banks to help arrange a
sale of as much as $1 billion of convertible Islamic bonds, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  The sovereign fund is working with  CIMB Group Holdings
Bhd. (CIMB) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  on a potential
offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. Khazanah could raise $500 million to
$1 billion, though a final decision on whether to proceed has
yet to be made, one person said.  The Shariah-compliant bonds, or sukuk, would be
exchangeable into shares of companies controlled by Khazanah,
the people said. The fund owns about 33 percent of  Tenaga
Nasional Bhd. (TNB) , the country’s biggest power producer, and about
29 percent of Telekom Malaysia Bhd., data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It’s also the largest shareholder in telecommunications
company  Axiata Group Bhd. (AXIATA)  and  IHH Healthcare Bhd. (IHH)   No decision has been made on which companies’ shares would
back the Islamic bond, the people said. Mohd Asuki Abas, a
spokesman for Khazanah, declined to comment in an e-mailed
response to questions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
