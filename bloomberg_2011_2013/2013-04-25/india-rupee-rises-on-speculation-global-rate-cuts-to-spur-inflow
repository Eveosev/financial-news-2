India ’s rupee rose from a one-week
low on speculation global policy makers will lower borrowing
costs to support growth, boosting purchases of local equities.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will cut its  repurchase rate  to
7.25 percent from 7.5 percent at a May 3 review, 17 of 19
economists predict in a Bloomberg News survey. The  European
Central Bank  may reduce rates on May 2, according to another
survey, after manufacturing and services activity for April
underscored weakness in output. Global funds bought a net $151.6
million of Indian shares on April 22 after adding $292.1 million
last week, the  most  in a month, exchange data show.  Disappointing economic data “has raised expectations of a
rate cut by the ECB,” analysts at Edelweiss Financial Advisors
Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar, wrote in a report
today. “Month-end dollar demand is keeping gains in the rupee
limited, but a strong domestic equity market is proving to be
supportive.”  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 54.22 per dollar as of
9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.43 on April 23, the weakest level since April 16. The
market was shut yesterday for a local holiday. The currency will
stay between 54.35 and 53.90 today, according to Edelweiss.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.59 percent.  Germany ’s Ifo index of business confidence fell more than
economists predicted, the institute said yesterday. The euro-
area composite purchasing managers’ index of manufacturing and
services remained at 46.5 in April, Markit Economics said April
23. That’s below the 50 mark that divides contraction from
expansion.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.20 per
dollar, compared with 55.33 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.00 versus 55.13. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
