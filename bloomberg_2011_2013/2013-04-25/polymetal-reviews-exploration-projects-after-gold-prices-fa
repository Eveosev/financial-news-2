Polymetal International Plc (POLY) , the
London-listed gold and silver producer with most of its
operations in  Russia , is reviewing spending plans and projects
after prices for the precious metals slumped.  “We plan to complete the review in about a month and a
half and to announce the results along with the second-quarter
output figures,” Chief Executive Officer Vitaly Nesis said
today in a phone interview. “We have good projects and it’s
hard to say which ones we may delay.”  Gold plunged 14 percent in a two-day rout earlier this
month, the biggest slide in three decades, while silver also
fell into a  bear market . Projects likely to be delayed or
modified by Polymetal include Kutyn, Maminskoye and the heap
leach facility at Sopka, the company said in a statement.  Still, gold may recover from a two-year low, according to
Polymetal’s CEO.  “The market is too volatile and it’s hard to say if my
previous forecast of prices reaching $2,000 per ounce by year-
end will be correct, but still there is a possibility it will
happen,” Nesis said today. “I see no fundamental reasons for
the recent slump in prices.”  Nesis said in January that gold may climb to a record above
$2,000 an ounce by the end of 2013 after averaging $1,700 to
$1,800 this year.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$1,448.28 an ounce, and traded at $1,443.94 as of 8:57 a.m. in
 London . Bullion has fallen 14 percent in 2013 after climbing for
12 years through 2012.  Polymetal’s revenue fell 9 percent in the first quarter to
$341 million from a year earlier even as gold equivalent
production advanced 16 percent to 235,000 ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
