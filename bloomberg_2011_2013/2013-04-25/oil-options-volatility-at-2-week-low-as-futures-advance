Crude oil options volatility
slumped to the lowest level in two weeks as futures rallied on a
U.S. jobless claims report that was  better than expected .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.58 percent at 2:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 21.47 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery advanced
$2.21 to $93.64 a barrel on the Nymex, a sixth consecutive gain,
after applications for jobless benefits slid to 339,000, the
Labor Department reported. That was the lowest level since March
9. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted 350,000 claims.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $80 puts, which dropped 6 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,217 contracts at 2:42 p.m. June $81 puts were
second-most active on volume of 2,570 lots. They fell 8 cents to
6 cents a barrel.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
54 percent of electronic trading volume. Calls, or bets that
prices will rise, made up 50.3 percent of trading on volume of
159,944 lots yesterday.  June $80 puts were the most-active options in the previous
session, with 6,907 lots changing hands. They dropped 12 cents
to 11 cents a barrel. June $98 calls rose 11 cents to 20 cents a

contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 35,770 lots and
