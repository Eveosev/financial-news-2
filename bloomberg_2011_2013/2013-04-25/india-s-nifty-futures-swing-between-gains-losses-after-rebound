Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses, signaling benchmark indexes may hold
near a six-week high.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for April delivery fell less
than 0.1 percent to 5,923.5 at 10:24 a.m. in  Singapore . Indian
markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 5,836.90 on April 23,
holding at its highest level since March 15. The S&P BSE Sensex
index gained 0.1 percent to 19,179.36. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares climbed 0.4 percent
yesterday.  Indian shares have rallied since plunging to a seven-month
low earlier this month as slowing wholesale-price inflation and
falling commodity prices prompted speculation the  Reserve Bank 
of India will cut  interest rates  next week, and overseas funds
bought the most stocks in five weeks.  After the recent rebound, “there’s no great urgency to get
into the market right now,” I.V. Subramaniam, a director at
Quantum Asset Management Co., said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV India. “We will invest if stock prices decline and
earnings look better.”  Profits at the five Sensex companies that have reported
March-quarter results so far have either  matched or beaten 
analyst estimates. Net income at about 43 percent of the 30
index companies trailed forecasts in the three months ended Dec.
31, compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters.  Foreign Inflows  Foreign funds bought a net $152 million of local shares on
April 22, taking their net investment in stocks this year to
$10.6 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Funds bought a
net $292.1 million worth of equities last week, the most in five
weeks.  Inflows have accelerated as data on April 15 showed India’s
 inflation  slowed to a 40-month low of 5.96 percent in March,
increasing the scope for the central bank to cut rates, and as a
slump in oil and gold prices cut import costs for the two
commodities that helped fuel a record $32.6 billion current-
account deficit in the December quarter.  The current-account gap, along with elevated  prices , has
deterred the RBI from further reducing borrowing costs after 25
basis-point cuts in January and March. The authority may pare
its key rate by another 25 basis points at a May 3 review,
according to 14 of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Jet Airways  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) , India’s second-biggest
steelmaker, may today report a fourth-quarter profit of 9.7
billion rupees ($178 million), according to the median of 18
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (JETIN)  may be active after Etihad Airways
PJSC agreed to buy a 24 percent stake in the Indian carrier for
20.6 billion rupees. Etihad will purchase 27.26 million shares
at a cost of 754.74 rupees apiece, 32 percent higher than the
closing price on April 23, Mumbai-based Jet said in an exchange
statement.  The stake will help Etihad tap one of the world’s fastest-
growing aviation markets, with travel forecast to triple by
2021. Indian carriers are seeking equity alliances after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government last September allowed
foreign carriers to buy holdings of as much as 49 percent. Jet
shares rallied 4.5 percent to 573.15 rupees on April 23.  Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. (MMFS)  may be active
after the company reported net income of 3.34 billion rupees for
the quarter ended March 31, beating the median estimate of 2.6
billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The stock was
upgraded by HSBC Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG after posting
earnings.  The Sensex has dropped 1.3 percent this year, and is valued
at 12.9 times  projected 12-month profits , compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.3 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
