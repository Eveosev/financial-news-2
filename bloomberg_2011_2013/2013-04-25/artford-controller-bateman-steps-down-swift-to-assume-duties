Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc., the insurer that restated 2012 earnings in March, said
Robert Bateman resigned as controller and senior vice president.  Chief Financial Officer Christopher Swift will assume the
role of principal accounting officer until a permanent successor
is named for Bateman, according to a regulatory filing today
from Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut city of the
same name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
