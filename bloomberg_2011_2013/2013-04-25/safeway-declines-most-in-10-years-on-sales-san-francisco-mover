Safeway Inc. (SWY)  plunged the most in 10
years after the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain reported
first-quarter same-store sales that were lower than it
previously estimated.  The shares fell 14 percent to $24.32 at the close in New
York, the largest drop since April 2003. Safeway, which operates
1,638 stores in the U.S. and  Canada , had gained 56 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with an 11 percent increase for
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 1.5 percent in the
first quarter, the Pleasanton, California-based company said in
a statement today. Chief Executive Officer Steve Burd, who will
retire in May after 20 years at the company,  said  on a
conference call in February that same-store sales may rise 1.8
percent to 2 percent in the period.  “The sales were disappointing, and they had talked them
up,” Meredith Adler, a Barclays Plc analyst, said today in a
phone interview. “That would imply that the last four weeks
slowed a lot. If you looked at the long-term trends of this
company, they have been very poor, and they have initiatives to
try to turn it around, but there’s not really any indications
that those are working yet.”  Adler, who is based in New York, projected a 1.8 percent
increase in same-store sales. She has an underweight rating on
the shares, the equivalent of a sell.  Earnings per share in the quarter ended March 23 totaled 35
cents, matching the average  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Total revenue was little changed at $9.99 billion.
Analysts projected $10.16 billion, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
