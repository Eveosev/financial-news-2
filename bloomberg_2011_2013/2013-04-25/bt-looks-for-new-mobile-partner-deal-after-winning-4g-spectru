BT Group Plc (BT/A) , the biggest fixed-
line phone company in the U.K., plans to use spectrum for faster
fourth-generation mobile services to get a better deal on its
wholesale agreements with wireless carriers.  The company, which put out a tender for new partners a few
weeks ago, currently has an agreement with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
Ross Cook, a BT spokesman, said. A Vodafone U.K. spokesman
declined to comment.  BT agreed to pay 186.5 million pounds ($287.8 million) for
spectrum that can carry 4G mobile signals in the U.K.’s auction
earlier this year. The London-based company was the only fixed-
line carrier to win access to the airwaves in the bidding, which
raised 2.34 billion pounds total. Vodafone,  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) 
and  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s British venture EE,  Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. (13) ’s Three and  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s O2 also won licenses.  “Now we’ve won 4G spectrum, we have got a strong hand to
get a better deal,” Cook said. “Some of the mobile operators
might want to use it.”  BT’s agreements with Vodafone for consumer and enterprise
service and handsets were worth a little more than 10 million
pounds a year, a person familiar with the details said, who
asked not to be named because the terms are private. Vodafone is
eligible to bid for the contract again, the person said.  The Financial Times reported on the new negotiations
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
