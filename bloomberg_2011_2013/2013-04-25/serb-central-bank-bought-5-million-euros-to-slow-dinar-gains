Serbia ’s central bank bought euros
for the third time this year today to slow gains in the dinar,
which rose to its highest level in 13 months.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije purchased 5 million
euros ($6.5 million) from commercial banks to “smooth the
dinar’s intraday swings” the bank said on its website without
disclosing any further details.  Four currency traders in Belgrade, who asked to remain
unidentified in line with the policies of their banks, said the
central bank was buying euros at levels below 111 dinars to the
euro after the unit strengthened 0.56 percent. The dinar traded
at around 110.55 to the euro before the central bank stepped in
as the currency rose to the highest level since early March
2012.  The dinar traded at 110.9325 at 4:40 p.m. in Belgrade,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, gaining for the fourth
consecutive trading session, after the European Commission said
Serbia was ready to begin membership talks with the European
Union following a agreement with its breakaway province of
 Kosovo .  The dinar and Romanian leu have been among top picks for
SocGen analysts in  London , including Esther Law and Dragoslav
Velickovic, who repeated their recommendation to buy the dinar
on expectations it will gain to 108 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
