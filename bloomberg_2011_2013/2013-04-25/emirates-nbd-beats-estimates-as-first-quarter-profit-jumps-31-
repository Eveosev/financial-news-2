Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Dubai’s biggest
bank, reported a 31 percent rise in first-quarter profit,
beating analyst estimates, as loan-loss provisions declined.  Net income advanced to 836.8 million dirhams ($228
million), or 14 fils a share, from 641 million dirhams, or 10
fils a share, a year earlier, the Dubai government-controlled
lender said in a regulatory filing today. Profit beat the 686.3
million-dirham mean estimate of five analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank’s impairment provisions for bad loans fell
19 percent from a year ago to 888 million dirhams.  Emirates NBD, whose Chief Executive Officer  Rick Pudner 
will leave at the end of the year after more than seven years in
the job, is recovering from the global credit crisis, which
slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led to a surge in
loan-loss charges as defaults rose. Dubai’s economy, the second-
biggest in the  United Arab Emirates , is set to expand 4.6
percent on average between 2012 and 2015, more than twice as
fast in the prior four years, government forecasts show.  Pre-provision operating profit “shows signs of growth
after a few resilient quarters,” Chief Financial Officer Surya Subramanian said in the statement. The retail and Islamic
banking businesses were key reasons behind this growth, he said.  Emirates NBD’s ratio of non-performing loans to total loans
fell to 14.2 percent in the first quarter from 14.3 percent in
the preceding three months, it said. The bank is one of the
biggest lenders to investment company Dubai Group LLC, which is
negotiating to restructure $6 billion of bank debt.  Economic Recovery  U.A.E.’s economic recovery is helping improve profit at
banks.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , which overtook Emirates
NBD this quarter as the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets,
reported April 23 a better-than-anticipated jump in first-
quarter profit to 1.4 billion dirhams from 1.04 billion.   Dubai
Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the country’s biggest Shariah-compliant
lender, reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter profit to
301.7 million dirhams.  Emirates NBD’s net interest income fell 2 percent to 1.75
billion dirhams as the net interest margin narrowed to 2.39
percent from 2.63 percent a year earlier, it said. The bank’s
loan book expanded 8 percent from a year ago to 220.6 billion
dirhams and deposits grew 7 percent to 223 billion dirhams.  Bank lending in the U.A.E., the second-biggest Arab
economy, rose 2.6 percent in 2012, according to central bank
data. That compares with a 16 percent rise in lending to the
private sector in  Saudi Arabia , the biggest Arab economy, and a
27 percent rise in gas-rich Qatar,  central bank data shows .  Emirates NBD in December agreed to buy Paris-based BNP
Paribas SA’s 95.2 percent stake in its Egyptian unit in a $500
million acquisition to gain access to the most populous Arab
country.  Shares of Emirates NBD surged 10.6 percent to 4.99 dirhams
yesterday, taking gains this year to 75 percent. The exchange’s
benchmark index has risen 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
