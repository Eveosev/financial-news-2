Canadian average  weekly earnings  of
non-farm payroll employees rose 3.1 percent in February from a
year earlier, led by construction.  On a monthly basis, earnings rose 0.9 percent to C$908.87
($888.44),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Construction
wages rose 4.6 percent to C$1,166.17, the fastest among the 10
largest categories.  The national 12-month wage increase exceeded the Bank of
Canada’s 2 percent inflation target. Consumer prices advanced at
a year-over-year rate of 1.2 percent in February.  Statistics Canada revised January’s earnings increase to
1.9 percent from an initial estimate of 2.7 percent.  The average length of the workweek increased in February on
an annual basis, Statistics Canada said, to 32.9 hours from 32.8
hours.  Payroll employment rose 14,500 in February to 15.33
million, a gain of 0.1 percent on the month and a 1.6 percent
from a year earlier.  Statistics Canada’s main  employment report , the labor force
survey of households, reported a job gain of 50,700 February and
a decline of 54,500 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
