The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  contracted for a second week, led by a
decline in issuance by U.S. financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
dropped $5.7 billion to $1.01 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since the market touched $1.002 trillion
for the period ended April 3.  Demand from money-market funds, among the biggest buyers of
commercial paper, has declined this year, while companies have
been able to issue longer-term debt in the corporate-bond market
at record-low borrowing costs. Total assets in the funds have
 decreased  to $2.595 trillion in the week ended April 17 from
$2.716 trillion for the period ended Jan. 9, according to the
 Investment Company Institute .  “The continued shrinkage in money-market mutual fund
assets is lowering the demand for financial CP,”  Howard Simons ,
strategist at Bianco Research LLC in Chicago, wrote in an e-
mail.  Commercial paper issued by U.S.-based banks  fell $6.6
billion to $291.4 billion outstanding, the lowest level since
the period ended Nov. 21, according to the Fed.  Commercial paper
sold by non-U.S. financial institutions  rose for the sixth time
in seven weeks, increasing $6 billion to $238.4 billion
outstanding, the highest level since the period ended Feb. 6.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
