Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , India’s
largest zinc and silver producer, reported a better-than-
expected 54 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit, aided by
higher metal output.  Net income rose to 21.7 billion rupees ($401 million), or
5.13 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from
14.1 billion rupees, or 3.34 rupees, a year earlier, the unit of
London-based  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  said today in an exchange
filing. The median of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was 18.2 billion rupees. Sales surged 25 percent to 38.5 billion
rupees.  Earnings before interest and tax from zinc and lead climbed
37 percent to 15.6 billion rupees. Refined silver output
increased 33 percent to 117 tons, while production of mined zinc
rose 16 percent to 260,000 metric tons.  Total expenses gained 17 percent to 19.1 billion rupees,
while fuel costs fell 14 percent to 2.76 billion rupees.  The shares of Udaipur, Rajasthan-based Hindustan Zinc rose
4.6 percent to 119.15 rupees at close of trade in Mumbai today.  Billionaire  Anil Agarwal , who owns the Vedanta group, is
seeking to buy the Indian government’s remaining stake in
Hindustan Zinc. The shares will give Vedanta’s Mumbai-based unit
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  control over a combined 964,000
tons of zinc and lead capacity and cash and equivalent of $3.3
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
