OAO Sberbank (SBER) , Russia’s biggest
lender, may provide financing to Belarusian truckmaker MAZ to
build an assembly plant in  India .  “We are in talks with two Indian firms to organize the
assembly of MAZ trucks in India,” Dmitry Korotkevich, MAZ
deputy commercial director, told reporters today in the capital,
Minsk, without elaborating.  While India’s truck market is “saturated,” MAZ expects to
invest at least $1.5 million in building a new plant in the
country to assemble at least 500 trucks a year, Korotkevich
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
