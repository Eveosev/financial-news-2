A day after  Diageo Plc (DGE)  sold $3.25
billion of bonds with maturities as long as 30 years, the cost
of insuring the debt of the world’s biggest distiller dropped to
a six-month low.  Credit-default swaps on Diageo fell four basis points to
63, the lowest since Oct. 24. It’s the second-best performing
contract in the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps linked to
125 investment-grade companies, which was unchanged at 106.5
basis points at 3 p.m. in  London .  The deal yesterday from Diageo, whose brands include
Johnnie Walker Scotch and Crown Royal Canadian whisky, was its
first debt offering in almost a year and the company said funds
will be used to repay commercial paper and maturing bonds. The
London-based company is ranked A- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings and an equivalent A3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  “Its a confirmation of their defensive characteristics and
reflects the strong investor appetite for core and quality
single A bonds,” said Norbert Ling, an analyst at BNP Paribas
SA in London. “Credit markets reward defensive companies. Not
every company can sell 30-year bonds.”  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
