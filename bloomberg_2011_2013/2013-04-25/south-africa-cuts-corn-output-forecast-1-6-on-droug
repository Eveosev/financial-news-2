South Africa , the continent’s
biggest corn producer, cut its forecast for output of the grain
by 1.6 percent because of drought in some growing regions, the
Crop Estimates Committee said.  The nation may reap 11.6 million metric tons of corn this
season, Marda Scheepers a spokeswoman for the committee, said by
phone from  Pretoria  today. That is more than the median estimate
of 11.5 million tons by seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey and
lower than the 11.8 million-ton prediction made by the committee
last month.  South  Africa  produced 12.8 million tons in 2010, the
biggest crop since 1982. Meal made from white corn is one of the
country’s staple foods and the yellow variety is mainly used as
 animal feed .  “Prolonged dry spells in the Northwest and Free State
provinces” reduced the forecast, Scheepers said.  Farmers will probably sow 516,600 hectares (1.28 million
acres) of wheat, 1.1 percent more than the area planted last
season, the committee said.  The country’s farmers planted 551,200 hectares (1.36
million acres) of wheat last year, the smallest area since the
start of record-keeping in 1931, according to the committee.  South Africa, which is a net importer of wheat, is sub-
Saharan Africa’s largest producer of the grain and the region’s
third-biggest importer of the grain after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data on Bloomberg.
The nation will reap 1.92 metric million tons wheat this season,
the committee said on Feb. 26, matching its previous prediction.  The country’s growers may increase the area planted with
canola 25 percent from last year to 55,000 hectares, while the
area to be planted with malting barley will probably drop 7.4
percent to 78,8000 hectares, it said.  The committee kept its predictions for output of sunflower
seeds, soybeans, groundnuts, sorghum and dry beans  unchanged .  White corn rose 1.1 percent to 2,106 rand ($232) a ton by
the close on the South African Futures Exchange, while the price
of the yellow variety climbed 1.7 percent to 2,093 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
