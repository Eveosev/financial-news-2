Methanex Corp. (MX) , a Canadian maker of
methanol, surged the most in four years after  Argentina  resumed
natural gas exports to its plants in  Chile .  Methanex rose 6.3 percent to C$42.61 at 10:57 a.m. in
Toronto. Shares of the Vancouver-based company earlier jumped as
much as 16 percent, the steepest intraday gain since 2009.  The company began receiving gas supplies from Argentina in
March under an agreement that it would sell methanol produced
from the gas back to the South American nation, Methanex said in
a statement yesterday after the close of trading. The resumption
of shipments increases the probability of getting even more gas
over the longer term, according to Steven Hansen, a Vancouver-
based analyst at Raymond James.  “The fact that the Argentines are willing to resume
shipments bodes well for Methanex’s remaining methanol plants in
Chile,” James said. “It’s a positive sign that Argentina is
willing to do business again.”  Before supplies resumed in March,      Methanex hadn’t received
gas from Argentina since 2007, Sandra Daycock, its director of
 investor relations , said by telephone.  Methanex is in the process of moving two of its four
methanol plants in Chile to Geismar,  Louisiana , because of
insufficient supplies of gas in Chile.  Natural gas is used to make methanol, a substance used in
the manufacture of everything from windshield-wiper fluid to
paint and transportation fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
