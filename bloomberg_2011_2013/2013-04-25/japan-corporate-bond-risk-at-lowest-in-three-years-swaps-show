The cost of insuring corporate
bonds from non-payment in  Japan  is headed for the lowest close
in three years, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index slid 1.5 basis points to 87
basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The measure, which has dropped 72 basis points this year,
is poised for its lowest close since April 2010, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 to 111 as of 8:56 a.m. in  Hong
Kong ,  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show.
The gauge is set for its lowest close since March 19, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets are closed in Australia for a national holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
