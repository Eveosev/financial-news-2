Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) , owner of the Redbox
DVD rental machines, gained the most in three months after
efforts to squeeze more from its kiosks fueled quarterly profit
that beat analysts’ estimates and the company said it plans to
change its name to Outerwall Inc.  The rebranding reflects Coinstar’s effort to diversify
beyond its namesake division, according to a statement
yesterday.  “It’s really distancing the parent company from that coin-
counting line of business,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Di Valerio said in an interview. The company will seek shareholder
approval of the name at its June 27 annual meeting.  Coinstar is developing new automated businesses to maintain
growth after demand for its $1-a-day DVD rentals peaks. The
company owns 35 percent of Redbox Instant by Verizon, a
streaming service, and is rolling out Rubi kiosks that offer
fresh brewed coffee. Coinstar has also started selling tickets
to concerts.  The stock  rose  6.6 percent to $58.66 at 9:36 a.m. after
trading at $58.85, for the biggest intraday jump since Jan. 25.
Through yesterday, the stock had advanced 5.8 percent this year.  Excluding items, first-quarter profit totaled 93 cents a
share, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said in a
statement. That beat the 86-cent average of 11 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income declined 58 percent to $22.6 million, or 78
cents a share, from $53.7 million or $1.65, a year earlier,
Coinstar said. Sales rose 1.1 percent to $574.7 million,
compared with the average estimate of $579.5 million.  Moving Kiosks  The company sought to improve Redbox’s performance by
increasing the number of movies available and relocating kiosks
from lower-performing locations, Di Valerio said. The actual
number of dispensers didn’t change, staying at 43,700, said Di
Valerio, the former finance chief who took over as CEO April 1.  For the  second quarter , the company forecasts profit of 90
cents to $1.05 a share on revenue of $555 million to $580
million. That includes costs of 16 cents to close kiosks
acquired from  NCR Corp. (NCR)  and added interest expense, the company
said. Analysts were anticipating $1.21 a share, the average of
11 estimates, on revenue of $580.2 million.  For the year, Coinstar projects profit of $5.05 to $5.55 a
share, on revenue of $2.39 billion to $2.55 billion. The full-
year forecast includes costs of 61 cents for kiosk closings and
interest.  Analysts project profit of $5.10 a share on revenue of
$2.42 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
