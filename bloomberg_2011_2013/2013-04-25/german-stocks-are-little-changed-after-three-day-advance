German stocks  advanced for a fourth
day as investors awaited a report on U.S. initial jobless-
benefit claims.  MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX)  gained 3.2 percent as first-
quarter profit beat estimates.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  fell 1 percent after
posting first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts’
forecasts.  Software AG (SOW)  slid 4 percent after quarterly revenue
missed estimates and profit fell.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.2 percent to 7,777.02 at 11:03 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The benchmark gauge climbed 4 percent over the
previous three days amid speculation that the  European Central
Bank  will lower  interest rates . The broader HDAX Index also rose
0.2 percent today.  “What we saw in the last couple of days was not-so-good
economic numbers overshadowed by speculation about an ECB rate
cut,” said Andreas Lipkow, a senior market strategist at
Kliegel & Hafner AG in Berlin. “The area between 7,700 and
7,800 is a very fair price for the DAX now as numbers out from
companies are not so good to allow the DAX to rise above the
8,000 point level; progress depends on the ECB decision and also
what we see out of the U.S. with jobless claims.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 39 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. initial jobless claims slipped to 350,000 last week
