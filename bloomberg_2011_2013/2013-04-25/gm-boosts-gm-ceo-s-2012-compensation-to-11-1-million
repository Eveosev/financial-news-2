General Motors Co. (GM)  Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson’s compensation mix was changed in 2012 to
accommodate the possibility he may retire before his long-term
restricted stock vests in three years, the company said.  “We certainly wouldn’t speculate on what he will actually
do -- that’s up to him,”  Tom Henderson , a GM spokesman, said in
a telephone interview.  Akerson’s compensation, which is subject to government
review because of GM’s 2009 U.S. bailout, increased 44 percent
to $11.1 million last year, the Detroit-based automaker said
today in a regulatory filing. That includes $1.99 million in
restricted stock units that were earned as part of his 2011
compensation package and granted in 2012, the filing said.  Under Akerson’s previous pay structure, about $2 million of
his compensation was paid as restricted stock, which had been
granted in the following year and took three years to vest, GM
said in the filing. Stock units that haven’t been vested upon
retirement may be forfeited. With the new system for 2012, he
got that $2 million as salary stock units, which vest
immediately and are paid out over three years.  Akerson, 64, is putting his stamp on the largest U.S.
automaker, seeking to cement GM’s position as the best-selling
foreign carmaker in  China  with the announcement last week that
the company and its partners will invest $11 billion in the
country through 2016. He’s also seeking to gain sales in the
U.S. with the introduction of about 20 new vehicles this year
after GM’s market share dropped to an 88-year-low in 2012.  $9 Million Target  Akerson received $1.7 million in salary and $9.4 million in
stock awards and other compensation, the automaker said today in
a regulatory filing.  The GM CEO’s compensation totaled $7.7 million in 2011 when
his target was $9 million. Akerson replaced  Ed Whitacre  in the
post in 2010 and led GM through its initial public offering that
November.  “I wouldn’t be surprised” if Akerson departs within the
three-year period,  Joe Phillippi , principal of consulting firm
AutoTrends Inc. in Andover,  New Jersey , said in a telephone
interview. “He stepped up when Ed surprised everybody” by
leaving before the IPO.  GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, along with Mary Barra, the
company’s top product-development executive, and  Mark Reuss ,
head of its North American operations, are seen as possible CEO
successors when Akerson leaves, people familiar with the
thinking have said.  Trails Peers  While Akerson’s listed compensation for 2012 rose from
2011, GM says only the composition of his pay changed, in
accordance with guidelines established by the U.S.  “His total compensation has not increased since joining
the company in September 2010 and remains below the 10th
percentile for executives in comparable positions due to the
restrictions imposed by the special master, despite his
significant contributions to operating performance and
outstanding leadership,” GM said in the proxy.  Akerson’s pay trails many of his peers, including  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  CEO  Alan Mulally , who received about $21 million in
compensation last year, according to Ford’s proxy. Mulally also
received stock payments of $11.7 million last month, $58 million
last year and $56 million the year before as part of his
incentive plan.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the largest European automaker, paid CEO
Martin Winterkorn 14.5 million euros ($18.9 million), 17 percent
less than in 2011.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  paid CEO  Carlos Ghosn  $10.3
million.  Toyota paid President Akio Toyoda 136 million yen ($1.43
million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sigtarp Criticism  Akerson’s compensation was criticized by the Special
Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program in a
January report that said the Treasury “failed to rein in
excessive pay” at GM, American International Group Inc., and
 Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , which were rescued by the U.S. government.  The  U.S. Treasury  is exiting its  stake in GM  through a
series of sales that began in January. Executive pay
restrictions can end once the Treasury sells off its remaining
shares.  The Treasury said in December that it plans sell its entire
GM holding within 15 months as the automaker bought $5.5 billion
of its stock, or 200 million shares, from the government. As of
April 1, the government’s stake had fallen to 16.4 percent, GM
said in the filing.  GM rose 0.9 percent to $30.71 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 6.5 percent this year, while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index increased 11 percent. GM’s 42 percent climb in
2012 was more than triple the S&P 500’s 13 percent rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
