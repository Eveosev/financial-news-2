St. James’s Place Plc (STJ) , the British
wealth manager whose biggest shareholder is  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) , said first-quarter net inflows rose 36 percent as cash-rich
individuals sought higher returns on their savings.  Net inflows climbed to 947 million pounds ($1.5 billion)
from 698 million pounds in the same period a year earlier,
Cirencester, England-based St. James’s said today in a
statement. Funds under management increased 12 percent to 39
billion pounds in that period.  St. James’s Place, which typically advises clients with
more than 100,000 pounds to invest, said low interest rates
drove investors to search for yields. The FTSE 100 Index, up 8.7
percent in the first quarter, also helped bolster sentiment,
said the firm, which gets paid an annual fee for directing
assets into funds managed by third parties.  Results were “driven by a number of factors including
improved investor sentiment, the sustained low interest-rate
environment, the breadth and quality of our investment
proposition, high levels of client satisfaction and the growth
in adviser numbers,” Chief Executive David Bellamy said in the
statement.  St. James’s is the fourth-best performer in the 28-member
 Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index (BEINSUR)  this year,  rising  25
percent. Lloyds, which holds 37 percent of the firm’s stock,
sold a 20 percent stake in the company last month after the
share price rose 54 percent in the previous 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
