Beijing Enterprises Water Group
Ltd. (371) , which develops water-treatment systems, rose the most in
two months in Hong Kong trading after Citigroup Inc. initiated
coverage with a buy rating due to  China â€™s water policies.  The company is a national play on Chinese environmental
protection and urbanization policies driven by wastewater
treatment volume, price increases and sewage and water demand,
Citigroup analysts including Timothy Lam wrote in report.  The stock surged 7.1 percent today to close at HK$2.40, a
one-month high, on three times its 3-month average daily volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
