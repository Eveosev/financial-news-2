J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  rose in extended
trading after billionaire investor  George Soros  disclosed a
passive stake in the retailer.  Soros Fund Management’s stake is equal to 7.9 percent of
J.C. Penney, according to a filing today. The investment makes
him the fourth-largest holder based on equity stakes, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  J.C. Penney is trying to rebound from a 25 percent drop in
sales and a net loss of $985 million last year under the
leadership of Ron Johnson, who was replaced as chief executive
officer by Myron Ullman earlier this month. Ullman, who left the
CEO role in 2011 for Johnson, has already tapped the company’s
credit line and is seeking to raise more cash.  J.C. Penney  rose  6.2 percent to $16.19 at 4:16 p.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
