India’s bonds declined for the
first time in seven days on speculation yields at the lowest
level since July 2010 will deter buyers.  Benchmark 10-year notes had earlier rallied on optimism the
central bank will cut interest rates after official data showed
 wholesale  prices rose 5.96 percent in March, the least since
November 2009. Brent crude has  rebounded 5.3 percent to 101.9
per barrel since touching the lowest level since July last week.  “Bonds have dropped as there was probably some profit
taking,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The increase in oil
prices also damped sentiment.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.77 percent in
Mumbai. The rate touched 7.74 percent earlier today, matching
the level on April 23 that was the lowest since July 2010.
Financial markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  Dash predicted bonds to recover as further monetary policy
easing is on cards.  Eighteen of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the monetary authority will reduce the repurchase rate by 25
basis points to 7.25 percent at its review on May 3, with three
forecasting no change and one seeing a cut to 7 percent.  The Reserve Bank of  India  has cut the repurchase  rate  by 50
basis points this year to spur growth. The nation’s gross
domestic  product  rose 5 percent in the fiscal year ended March
31, the weakest pace since 2003, the statistics agency
estimates.  Easing inflation “increases the probability of a more
accommodative monetary policy,” Raghuram Rajan, the top adviser
in the Finance Ministry, said in an April 16 interview.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed from April 23 at 7.23 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
