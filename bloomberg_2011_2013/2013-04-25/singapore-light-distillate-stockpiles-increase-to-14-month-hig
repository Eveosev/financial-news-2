Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
8.9 percent to the highest in 14 months, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate gained 946,000 barrels to 11.6 million barrels in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since the
period ended Feb. 29, 2012.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene fell 1.34 million barrels, or 13 percent,
to 9.1 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies dropped the
most since Dec. 12, ending a four-week increase.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen declined 30,000 barrels, or
0.2 percent, to 16.5 million barrels, according to the data.
Stockpiles decreased for the seventh time in eight weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
