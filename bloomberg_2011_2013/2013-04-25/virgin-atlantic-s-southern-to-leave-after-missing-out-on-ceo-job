Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.’s
Julie Southern, regarded as a prospective chief executive
officer until the appointment of Craig Kreeger 3 1/2 months ago,
is to leave the company.  Southern, Virgin’s chief commercial officer, will depart on
May 10 to “pursue new challenges,” the Crawley, England-based
carrier said in an e-mailed statement today.  The executive, who worked at Virgin for 13 years, had been
seen as the lead internal candidate to replace Steve Ridgway as
CEO. Kreeger joined Virgin from American Airlines, with his
appointment coming a month after Delta Air Lines Inc. agreed to
buy a 49 percent stake in the U.K. company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
