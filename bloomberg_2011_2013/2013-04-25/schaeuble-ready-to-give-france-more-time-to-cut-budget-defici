German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said  France  can take more time cutting its budget
deficit as long as the government doesn’t lessen its efforts to
carry out “structural reforms.”  “France’s share of administrative costs is too high,”
Schaeuble said today in an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio.
“France’s labor costs are too high. France is aware of that;
that can’t be changed overnight, this must be done step by step
and if that’s credible, one can be more flexible on the question
of which deficits have to be achieved in which year.”  Troubled euro countries have to fix their problems
“gradually, and this has to be done at an appropriate speed,”
Schaeuble said, adding that European budget rules provide
“sufficient flexibility to respond to economic developments.”  European Commission President  Jose Barroso   told an audience 
in Brussels on April 22 that European leaders’ focus on  deficit
reduction , while “fundamentally right,” had run its course and
needed to be moderated as  Europe  is reaching the limits of the
current policies.  While it’s up to the commission to make proposals on
deficit reduction, the European Union’s executive arm “is
obliged to execute the treaties” of the EU, Schaeuble said.
“Otherwise it destroys confidence if it starts saying that the
treaties are no longer valid.”  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, in a speech in Dresden
yesterday, said France “has an important role-model function
for the credibility of rules and confidence in the
sustainability of public finances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
