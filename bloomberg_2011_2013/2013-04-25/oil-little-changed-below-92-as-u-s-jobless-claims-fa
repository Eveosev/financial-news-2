West Texas Intermediate crude
capped the longest rally in nine months as fewer Americans filed
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments last week
and the market breached key technical resistance.  Prices surged 2.4 percent as the Labor Department said
applications for  jobless benefits  decreased to the lowest level
since March 9. The gain accelerated after WTI broke through a
Fibonacci level. The Obama administration said it has seen some
evidence that the Syrian government has used the deadly chemical
sarin in the country’s civil war. Brent oil’s premium to WTI
narrowed to less than $10 for the first time since January 2012.  “The weekly jobless claims report is a big positive for
the market and for the energy-demand outlook,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “ Syria  is a geopolitical risk
looming before us, and it’s helping raise the price a bit too.”  WTI for June delivery rose $2.21 to $93.64 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since April
10. Prices increased 8 percent in the past six days, the longest
consecutive winning streak since July. The volume of all futures
traded was 3.7 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day at 3:16 p.m.  Brent for June settlement climbed $1.68, or 1.7 percent, to
$103.41 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 29 percent above the 100-day average.  WTI-Brent Spread  The European benchmark crude’s premium to WTI narrowed to
$9.77 a barrel, the least since Jan. 3, 2012. It was $10.37
yesterday.  Jobless claims fell to 339,000 last week, below the lowest
estimate of 340,000 in a Bloomberg survey of 49 economists. The
Labor Department revised the previous week’s figure up to
355,000 from an initially reported 352,000.  “There’s been concern about the  U.S. economy , but the
jobless claims number makes the picture a little bit better,”
said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Economic news is
bullish today.”  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer, accounted for
21 percent of global demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  Economic Indicators  “We did get a little bit of a bounce off the drop in
jobless claims,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is
basically following economic indicators for direction.”  The jobless number also sent U.S. stocks higher. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 0.9 percent, heading
for a fifth daily advance. The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities jumped up to 1.8 percent, led by metals, wheat and
energy.  Futures broke through technical resistance at $91.14 a
barrel yesterday, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures
division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in  New York . That’s the
front-month’s 50 percent retracement level on a Fibonacci study
tracking the rise to $98.24 on Jan. 30 from a low of $84.05 on
Nov. 7. Prices then broke the 61.8 percent retracement level of
$92.82.  “You have both the broad risk-on trade in the markets,
along with technical factors at work with crude,” Yawger said.
“From a technical standpoint, we should be higher.”  Chemical Weapons  The evidence that Syrian government forces have used the
deadly chemicals is “not sufficient” to take action, Miguel E.
Rodriguez, President  Barack Obama ’s legislative liaison to
Congress, wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated today.  Israel  shot down an unmanned Hezbollah aircraft that was
approaching its Mediterranean coast, the second drone launched
by the militant Lebanese group in less than a year, the Israeli
army said in a statement. Hezbollah denied in an e-mailed
statement that it sent a drone to Israel.  U.S. gasoline  inventories  fell 3.93 million barrels last
week to 217.8 million, the biggest drop in a year, the Energy
Information Administration, the Department of Energy’s
statistical arm, said yesterday. Demand for gasoline jumped 4.4
percent to 8.75 million barrels a day, the most since November.  Gasoline for May delivery surged 6.44 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.8118 a gallon on the Nymex.  Futures’ advance was “supported by a renewed focus on
Wednesday’s DOE report,”  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York, said in an e-mail.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 20.8 percent, compared with yesterday’s 21.5 percent.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 489,265
contracts as of 3:19 p.m. It totaled 497,695 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.73 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
