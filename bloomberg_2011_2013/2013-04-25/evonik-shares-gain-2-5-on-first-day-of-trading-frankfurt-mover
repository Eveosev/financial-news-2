Evonik Industries AG,  Germany ’s
third-biggest chemical maker, gained 2.5 percent on the first
day of trading after it listed the 14.5 percent of shares it had
already sold to institutional investors.  The stock opened at 33 euros in  Frankfurt  today. Yesterday,
investors had paid 32.20 euros per share as the company sold a
2.3 percent stake. A 12.2 percent stake had already been sold in
private placements in February and March. The stock traded at
32.74 euros as of 9:41 a.m. valuing the company at 15.2 billion
euros ($20 billion).  Evonik, based in Essen and majority owned by RAG-Stiftung
and  CVC Capital Partners , risks losing out in the competition
for investors as increases in the share price will be an
opportunity for the owners to further reduce their stakes,
analysts including Oliver Schwarz at MM Warburg have said. RAG-
Stiftung, which plans to reduce its holding to about 25 percent
eventually, has earmarked proceeds to pay for costs related to
closing Germany’s deep-shaft coal mines from 2018.  Evonik, a candidate to join the local benchmark DAX index
when enough shares are freely traded, called off three initial
public offerings in five years after market volatility hurt
prices. Germany’s biggest chemical makers by sales are DAX
members  BASF SE (BAS)  and  Bayer AG. (BAYN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
