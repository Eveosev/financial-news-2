U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration have
“taken a toll” by forcing the department to reduce training
and postpone contracts.  “We are doing everything we can to absorb these cuts
without reducing services,” Lew told a House Appropriations
subcommittee in testimony prepared for a hearing today. “We
have scaled back training, delayed contracts and limited
purchases.”  Workers at the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of
the Treasury Department, will have to stay home without pay for
as many as seven days between now and September, Lew said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
