China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, posted first-
quarter profit that rose 89 percent as low-priced smartphones
helped control the cost to add new users.  Net income  rose to 1.9 billion yuan ($308 million), from
1.01 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said
in a filing today. Profit was expected to rise to 2.58 billion
yuan, according to the median estimate of four analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Chairman Chang Xiaobing curbed expenses while luring new
smartphone subscribers with low-cost devices priced at 999 yuan,
including  ZTE Corp. (000063) ’s V956. That helped win users who download
games and videos on third-generation services while reducing its
reliance on subsidies for pricier devices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone5, which sells for about six times the price.  “The 3G business will be the main driver for China
Unicom’s earnings” this year, Alen Lin, a Hong Kong-based
analyst with BNP Paribas Securities Asia, said in an April 9
report. “The offering of low-cost handsets will keep subsidy
expenses under check, boosting profitability.”  Revenue rose 15 percent to 70.6 billion yuan in the
quarter, from 61.2 billion yuan. The company was expected to
report sales of 66.7 billion, according to the median estimate
in the Bloomberg survey.  Unicom fell 0.2 percent to close at HK$10.80 in Hong Kong
trading before the announcement. The  shares  have dropped 13
percent this year, compared with a 1.1 percent decline for the
city’s  Hang Seng Index .  Unicom had 87.8 million 3G subscribers at the end of the
first quarter, lagging behind the 114.4 million for market
leader  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , according to data the companies
released this month.  China Mobile this week reported its weakest profit growth
in three quarters as higher costs eroded gains from an increase
in users of high-speed network services. Third-ranked  China
Telecom Corp. (728)  is scheduled to report results tomorrow.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
