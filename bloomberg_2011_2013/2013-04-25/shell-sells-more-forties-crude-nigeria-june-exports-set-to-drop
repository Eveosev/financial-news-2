Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold its
second cargo of  North Sea  Forties crude in as many days as the
differential for the benchmark blend dropped to the lowest level
in about two weeks.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, will export 60
crude cargoes in June, according to a partial loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News that cover 16 of the nation’s 18
grades, the majority of which have dropped from May.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties to Vitol Group for loading from May 11
to May 13 at 40 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window. That compares with a cargo it sold
yesterday at minus 25 cents and is the lowest since April 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Statoil ASA offered Oseberg for loading May 17 to May 19 at
a premium of $1.10 a barrel to Dated Brent, without finding a
buyer, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 11 cents to a discount of 28 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for June settlement traded at $102.51 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $101.31 in the previous session. The July contract was at
$102.38 at the same time today, a discount of 13 cents to June.  Platts will reduce from May 1 the de-escalator, or
discount, applied to Forties blend with a higher sulfur content.  Sellers will pay 25 cents a barrel for every 0.1 percentage
point of sulfur over a 0.6 percent limit in May, 10 cents less
than in April, Platts said today in an e-mailed note. The
pricing agency reviews the de-escalator every month.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
fourth day, the Platts survey showed. The grade traded at a
discount of 40 cents to the benchmark in the Mediterranean and
minus $1.20 in northwest Europe on April 19.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 4 cents to 28 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.18 a
barrel compared with $1.22 at yesterday’s close. That’s the
narrowest since Feb. 1, the data show.  Russia plans to ship 1.66 million barrels a day of Urals
from two export terminals on the  Baltic Sea  in May, a 15 percent
drop from April, a preliminary loading program showed.  The port of Primorsk plans to export 48 lots totaling 4.806
million metric tons next month, the schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News showed. Ust-Luga will ship 22 cargoes of 100,000
tons each. Each port has one unassigned slot of 100,000 tons.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be 3.265
million tons next month, or about 772,015 barrels a day, up 2.2
percent from this month. The May schedule also includes four
80,000-ton cargoes of Siberian Light grade and 27 Urals lots.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 3 cents to $3.16 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nigeria will ship in June 10 cargoes of Qua Iboe, seven of
Agbami, six each of Bonga and Forcados, five of Brass River,
four each of Akpo and Usan, three of Amenam, Erha and Escravos
two each of Antan, EA Blend and Okono and one each of Abo,
Okwori and Yoho, the plans showed.  That compares with 76 shipments due to be exported next
month, a complete schedule showed. The cargo sizes range from
322,000 to 1 million barrels.  The Republic of Congo is set to reduce crude exports in
June to seven lots, one less than next month, a separate loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Ghana plans to keep exports of its Jubilee crude in June
unchanged for a fourth month at three cargoes of 950,000 barrels
each, according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
