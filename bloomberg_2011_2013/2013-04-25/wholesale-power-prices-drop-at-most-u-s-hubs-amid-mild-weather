Spot electricity prices across most
of the major U.S. hubs were lower today as moderate weather
crimped demand.  Temperatures nationwide were more seasonal after trending
above normal earlier this week, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
State College,  Pennsylvania . Forecasts from the operators of the
six regional power markets showed demand on their grids will be
lower today than yesterday.  “We’re seeing some moderation after it was super-cold in
Denver,  Chicago  and even in the mid-Atlantic last week,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting
firm in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “We’re starting to see the
vestiges of spring.”  Spot on-peak power at PJM Interconnection LLC’s benchmark
 Western hub , which includes prices from Erie, Pennsylvania, to
Washington, slid for a third day, dropping $7.31, or 17 percent,
to $36.34 a megawatt-hour at 3:13 p.m. from yesterday’s full-day
average, the least since April 5, data from the grid operator
compiled by Bloomberg show. On-peak hours are from 7 a.m. to 11
p.m. PJM operates a 13-state grid from New Jersey into North
Carolina and  Illinois .  New York City power fell $7.69, or 15 percent, to $42.63,
the least since April 4. Prices on the main  Texas grid  declined
$1.17, or 3.4 percent, to $33.76 and Southern California’s SP15
hub dropped $55.14, or 58 percent, to $40.18, data from the
regional grid operators show.  Temperature Outlooks  The high temperature in  Washington  today may be 64 degrees
Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), 6 lower than usual, and Houston may be
9 below normal at 72 degrees, according to AccuWeather. San
Franciso may reach 61 degrees, 3 below the norm.  Wholesale electricity prices nationwide are being subdued
by a seasonal drop in demand along with increased nuclear
generation, especially in the western states, and the lowest
level of  natural-gas  use at power plants for this time of the
year since 2010 as prices climb, Schork said.  Output from nuclear reactors rose 0.8 percent today to
78,073 megawatts, or 77 percent of capacity, the most since
April 13, according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg.  New  England , which is heavily reliant on gas-fired
generation, bucked the downward trend. Real-time  power  prices
from  Connecticut  to  Maine  were up $1.47, or 3.1 percent, at
$48.54 from yesterday’s on-peak average, data from ISO New
England Inc., the region’s grid operator, show.  New England  New England was producing 60 percent of its electricity
from natural gas at 2:48 p.m., and has been close to that level
during the daylight hours over the past two weeks, according the
grid operator. By comparison, gas accounted for 53 percent of
output on March 28.  Spot gas at the Algonquin City Gates, which includes
delivery to  Boston , rose 4.6 percent today to $5.4078 per
million British thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange,
the most since April 11.  The spread between two major Midwestern hubs widened to the
most since July 2012 as  power use  exceeded the day-ahead
forecast and  wind generation  fell below estimates. The on-peak
average spot price at the  Minnesota hub  was averaging $82.58 a
megawatt-hour as of 3:13 p.m. Eastern time,a premium of $44.20 a
megawatt-hour to the  Indiana hub .  Indiana  prices are averaging
$38.38 after topping $160 earlier today.  Generating capacity in the region is down because of
seasonal maintenance, said John Typadis, a Boston-based analyst
covering the Midwest grid operator for Genscape Inc., which
tracks-real time power data.  Thin Spots  “The volatility that has ensued is a result of thin spots
in the supply stack being exposed and the real-time congestion
that has only helped add to the wideness of price swings
today,” he said.  Congestion on the Hazleton transformer in eastern  Iowa ,
partly caused by multiple line outages near the 640-megawatt
Duane Arnold nuclear station, is limiting power flows into
 Minnesota  from Indiana, Typadis said.  “Demand is coming in stronger than anticipated, which is
exacerbating this situation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
