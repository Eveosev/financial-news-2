Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) ,  Mexico ’s
biggest homebuilder by revenue, said its sales and cash supply
 shrank  in the first quarter as slow collections affected its
ability to finish homes under construction.  Revenue plummeted 46 percent to 3.3 billion pesos ($273.5
million) in the first three months of the year from the same
period last year, according to a  report  today with the Mexican
stock exchange. Cash and cash equivalents tumbled 94 percent to
322.7 million pesos from a year earlier, the company said.
First-quarter free  cash flow  was negative 3.2 billion pesos.  Mexico’s biggest homebuilders have been struggling to adapt
to a changing industry. Subsidy programs on which the builders
depend for growth have increasingly emphasized development of
capital-intensive apartments closer to cities over single-family
homes in commuter towns.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of profit known as Ebitda -- fell 52
percent to 599.7 million pesos in the period. Its profit margin,
based on adjusted Ebitda, narrowed to 18 percent from 20 percent
last year.  Homex, based in Culiacan, Mexico, said April 19 that it
agreed to sell its stake in two prisons to companies controlled
by billionaire  Carlos Slim , the world’s richest man, according
to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . The company said it would
use the 4 billion pesos in proceeds as working capital and to
pay down debt ahead of schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
