EQT Corp. (EQT) , the Pittsburgh-based
natural gas producer that’s selling its utility, rose to the
highest in more than four years after beating quarterly
estimates and predicting a rise in 2014 output.  EQT  climbed  7.8 percent to $73.96 at the close in New York,
the highest price since May 21, 2008.  First-quarter production sales rose 47 percent from a year
earlier to the equivalent of 79.4 billion cubic feet of gas,
beating expectations of 77 billion cubic feet, Hsulin Peng, a
New York-based analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co., wrote today in
a note to clients. The company’s forecast output for 2014 of at
least 445 billion cubic feet equivalent also exceeded estimates,
he wrote.  First-quarter profit rose 39 percent to $100.3 million, or
66 cents a share, from $72 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. Per-share profit beat the
average of 15 analysts’ estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  EQT agreed in December to sell its Equitable Gas utility
for $720 million in cash, completing its transformation into an
exploration and production company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
