Boeing Co. (BA) ’s decision to slow
output of the new 747-8 model is complicating Cargolux Airlines
International SA’s fleet-renewal plans as  Europe ’s biggest
freight-only carrier standardizes around the upgraded jumbo.  Cargolux, the first client for the 747-8, has seven of the
jets in its fleet and six to be delivered. The Luxembourg-based
carrier could have a further requirement when it retires aging
747-400s, having decided against smaller Boeing 777s or  Airbus (EAD) 
SAS A330s, the only other wide-body freighters in production.  “It’s an issue on our radar screen,” said interim chief
executive officer Richard Forson. “We are evaluating what the
future should look like because neither Airbus nor Boeing is
developing a wide-gauge freighter. What’s popping up on the
horizon is whether there will be a replacement for the 747.”  Boeing said last week it would cut the 747-8 build rate to
1.75 aircraft a month by early 2014 from two now to combat weak
demand. The U.S. company’s biggest and priciest model with a
list price of $352 million, the new jumbo has won only 110
orders since it went on sale in 2005, 70 of them for freighters.  Cargolux, which has two more 747-8s due this year, is
relying on fleet flexibility to spur a return to profit after
its loss widened to $35.1 million in 2012 from $18.3 million a
year earlier as volumes fell 1.8 percent to 645,759 metric tons.  ‘Complexities’  Forson said Cargolux needs to be able to quickly add or cut
capacity as required, something that’s easier when operating a
single aircraft type, especially once the completion of payments
on 11 747-400s means they can be idled without a cash outflow.  “There are inherent complexities involving a dual fleet,”
Forson said. “With a larger fleet it may make sense but in our
business we only envisage a fleet of around 18 747s by 2017.”  A recent evaluation led Cargolux to decide against the
cargo version of the 777, production of which is on a sounder
footing after the twin-engine model won more than 700 orders in
all its variants in the time the 747-8 has been available.  Airbus scrapped plans for an A380 superjumbo freighter in
2007 to focus staff and money on the delayed passenger version.
Cargo specialists including  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS) , had placed orders, as had Emirates, the biggest
A380 customer, and lessor International Lease Finance Corp.  The European company’s only new-build freighter, the A330
200F, has a maximum payload of 70 metric tons, versus 102 tons
for the 777 and 133 tons for the 747-8.  Labor Deal  Cargolux’s volumes increased 8 percent in the first quarter
and business performance so far is 2 percent ahead of full-year
targets, it said yesterday. Prices out of  Asia  remain under
pressure as the operator seeks new routes to bolster sales.  “Growth in demand is starting to exceed growth in
capacity,” Forson said. “That’s a positive indicator, but
there’s still a lot of surplus capacity in the market with
irrational competitors prepared to discount heavily.”  Cargolux, which employs 1,500 people, is seeking cost cuts
and improved productivity to avoid job losses after canceling
labor agreements last year. Forson said he’s hopeful a labor
accord can be struck before a deadline at the end of August.  The acting-CEO said he’s also awaiting a decision on the
sale of a 35 percent stake in Cargolux acquired by the
government when Qatar Airways Ltd. exited after only a few
months as a shareholder following a dispute over strategy.  Bidders  Forson said the government has disclosed it’s in talks with
four potential buyers. “What their expectations are for the
airline is crucial to ascertain on day one,” he said.  Cargolux is continuing to seek new revenue sources as it
pursues a goal of delivering a profit next year after two years
of losses, the executive said. The company said April 12 it
would add Ouagadougou in  Burkina Faso  to its network of African
destinations that includes Tripoli and  Port Harcourt  in  Nigeria .  Deliveries of the 747-8F are meanwhile scheduled to
continue through 2017, and Forson said Cargolux could even seek
to accelerate those if the market rebounds.  “I see the 747 becoming more valuable just because of the
limited number of orders placed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
