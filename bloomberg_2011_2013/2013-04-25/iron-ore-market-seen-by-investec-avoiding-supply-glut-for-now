The  iron-ore  market will avoid a
“near-term” supply surplus as Chinese demand for the
steelmaking raw material helps to absorb additional production,
Investec Securities said.  “Unlike some other market commentators, we are not of the
view that the iron-ore market will be materially oversupplied in
the near term,” analysts led by Hunter Hillcoat in  London  said
in an e-mailed report today.  The world’s biggest producers are planning $250 billion of
new mines, threatening to deepen a price slump for the commodity
already forecast to drop for at least the next three years. Ore
with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese port of Tianjin fell
6.8 percent to $135.10 a dry metric ton this year, according to
prices from The Steel Index Ltd.  While supply of seaborne iron ore will exceed demand by
about 100 million tons by 2015, the shipments will increasingly
displace production in  China , the biggest buyer, the analysts
wrote. The ore is the main cargo for Capesize vessels, each able
to haul more than 150,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
