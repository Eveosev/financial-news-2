U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  killed off plans by David Cameron’s Conservatives to
monitor data from phone calls and e-mails, citing concerns about
civil liberties, as Parliament prepared to end its current
session.  Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May was pushing for
adoption of the Communications Data Bill after police and
intelligence agencies sought powers to collect information
showing the time, location and duration of a mobile-phone call
or the existence of an e-mail. Civil-liberties campaigners said
the proposals were too intrusive and put ordinary people at risk
of being spied upon.  “What people dub the snoopers’ charter, that’s not going
to happen -- certainly with  Lib Dems  in government,” Clegg told
LBC radio today. An aide to Clegg, speaking on condition of
anonymity in line with government rules, said no new version of
the bill would appear when the next parliamentary session begins
on May 8.  The move shows Clegg flexing his muscles against his Tory
coalition partners before local elections next week and with
national elections two years away. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
mirrored that strategy for his own party by appointing a new
team this week to focus on Conservative policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
