Three British men were sentenced to
as much as nine years and nine months in jail for preparing to
commit terrorist acts in the U.K. and abroad.  Richard Dart, 30, Imran Mahmood, 22, and Jahangir Alom, 26,
were sentenced today at London’s Central Criminal Court after
pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to planning the attacks.  Dart was jailed for six years, Mahmood will spend nine
years and nine months in custody, and Alom was sentenced to four
years and six months, London’s Metropolitan Police said in an e-
mailed statement. Mahmood received terrorist training in
 Pakistan  while Dart and Alom hoped to, police said.  “The training that Dart and Alom sought, and which Mahmood
attempted to assist with, would have taught Dart and Alom the
skills and techniques necessary to commit acts of terrorism both
abroad and in the United Kingdom,” Mark Topping, a counter-
terrorism lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  All three men pleaded guilty in March.  “This case serves as a classic example of how terrorists
live in our midst while preparing their acts and their
determination to travel overseas to train before returning to
the U.K.,” Stuart Osborne, head of the police’s counter-
terrorism unit, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
