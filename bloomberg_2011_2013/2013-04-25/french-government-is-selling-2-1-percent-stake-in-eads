The French government raised 707
million euros ($920 million) by selling a 2.1 percent stake in
Airbus SAS parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  France  sold 17.6 million shares through its unit Sogepa,
according to a statement. The  shares  were offered at 40.20 euros
to market price, according to the terms of the deal obtained by
Bloomberg News. UBS AG was the sole manager.  EADS dropped 1.7 percent to 39.97 euros at 1:15 p.m. in
Paris.  The French state is reducing its stake to 12 percent,
matching a German government holding in EADS, as part of the
ownership change. Both countries will lose their veto rights
over major decisions in the new structure.  Investors in Europeâ€™s biggest aerospace company agreed in
March to change its shareholder structure, clearing the way for
luxury-carmaker  Daimler AG (DAI)  and French publisher  Lagardere SCA (MMB)  to
sell their holdings, which both did earlier this month.  Toulouse, France-based EADS joins companies including Dutch
cable television operator  Ziggo NV (ZIGGO)  that have seen shareholders
sell stakes through block sales this year. The volume of
secondary share sales in Europe, the Middle East and  Africa  has
risen about 60 percent to more than $30 billion so far this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
