U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened for a second day versus futures after  Alon USA
Energy Inc. (ALJ) â€™s Krotz Springs, Louisiana, refinery shut a reformer
and a report showed area fuel supplies at a  six-month low .  The reformer at the 83,000-barrel-a-day  plant  halted
following a fire at 8:14 a.m. local time today, Blake Lewis, a
spokesman for the company at Lewis Public Relations, said by
telephone from  Dallas .  Gasoline inventories on the Gulf Coast, the PADD 3 area,
fell 1.75 million barrels to  71.9 million  in the week ended
April 19, the lowest level since Oct. 26, according to Energy
Information Administration data.  The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the Gulf narrowed by 1.87 cents to 15.88 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 12:05 p.m.
Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, strengthened 0.5 cent to trade
at a  6.5-cent premium  to futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fell 0.5 cent to a discount of 3.25
cents a gallon versus Nymex futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread for Gulf refiners, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , widened 96 cents to $23.05 a
barrel, the first expansion in four days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet
oil gained 21 cents to $11.28 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
