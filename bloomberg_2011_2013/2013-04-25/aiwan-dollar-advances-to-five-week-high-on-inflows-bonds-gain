Taiwan ’s dollar rose to a six-week
high as foreign funds turned net buyers of the island’s stocks.
 Government bonds  gained on concern a bird flu outbreak will hurt
the economy.  Overseas investors bought $186 million more local shares
than they sold today, taking net purchases this week to $396
million, according to exchange data. Taiwan confirmed the first
H7N9 bird flu infection yesterday following an outbreak that
started in  China  last month, which helped push the Shanghai
Composite Index of equities to a 2013 low.  “We’re seeing inflows not just into stocks, but bonds as
well,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at
Cathay United Bank Co. “But the confirmed bird flu case last
night is scaring the market a little bit. It’s hurting sentiment
as the outbreak has caused slumps in China’s stock market.”  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.3 percent to NT$29.750 against its
U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The currency
touched NT$29.665 earlier, the strongest level since March 14.
It was trading 0.6 percent stronger two minutes before the 4 p.m.
close. The central bank has sold the local dollar in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 fell
one basis point to 0.91 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market prices. The rate touched 0.902 percent earlier, the
lowest level since March 6.  Production Slows  Official data this week showed the island’s economic
recovery is losing momentum. Industrial production unexpectedly
fell 3.28 percent in March from a year earlier, following a
revised 11.6 percent slump the previous month.  Export orders 
dropped 6.6 percent, after a 14.5 percent decline in February.
Overseas shipments account for around two-thirds of Taiwan’s
gross domestic product.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.4 percent to
NT$29.634 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, slipped 12 basis point, or 0.12
percentage point, to 3.28 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.385
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
