Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television provider, fell in New York trading
after adding fewer customers than projected last quarter.  The shares fell 0.6 percent to $92.19 at the close. The
stock has fallen 5.1 percent this year, compared with an 11
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The New York-based cable provider has lost video customers
for 16 consecutive quarters, dating back to 2009, as consumers
switch to rival services such as  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s
FiOS and  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s U-verse. Time Warner Cable also has been
less aggressive with promotions and discounts, causing some
budget-minded customers to leave.  “Time Warner Cable reported a disappointing first quarter
against a backdrop of low market expectations for both financial
and subscriber results,” Bryan Kraft, an analyst at  Evercore
Partners Inc. (EVR)  in New York, said in a note to clients.
“Management had warned about the impact of promotional
subscriber roll-offs having an unusually large impact on churn
this quarter.”  Time Warner Cable added 131,000 residential  Internet users ,
missing the average analyst estimate of 160,000. Video customers
declined by 119,000 in the period, more than the 92,000 loss
projected by 12 analysts on average.  Telecom Gains  Verizon’s FiOS added 188,000 broadband customers and
169,000 TV subscribers last quarter. U-verse gained 232,000
video customers and 731,000 Internet subscribers. Those gains
don’t include subscribers using older DSL Internet technology, a
number that is shrinking for both phone companies. Time Warner
Cable competes with FiOS in New York and both FiOS and U-verse
in  Los Angeles .  AT&T decreased its price for its so-called triple-play and
double-play packages in the quarter, Rob Marcus, Time Warner
Cable’s chief operating officer, said during a conference call.
Cable and some telecommunications companies bundle TV, Internet
and landline phone together for a triple play, while two of
those products make up a double play.  Time Warner Cable lost 35,000 residential phone customers,
the first quarterly decline since 2011.  “Many customers chose not to take phone and instead spent
money on incremental Internet speeds,” Marcus said.  Defections to  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Google Fiber in the  Kansas
City ,  Missouri , area have been “de minimis,” Marcus said, as
only 2.5 percent of Time Warner Cable’s subscribers in the
region have switched.  Net Income  Even with disappointing subscriber numbers, Time Warner
Cable boosted profit. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were
$1.41 a share, beating the $1.37  average analyst estimate 
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose to $401 million, or $1.34
a share, from $382 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement.  Sales rose 6.6 percent to $5.48 billion, compared with the
$5.49 billion average analyst estimate. Business services rose
25 percent to $537 million.  Time Warner Cable repurchased shares for $660 million in
the quarter, compared with the previous period’s $571 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
