Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS)  said it
will have “difficulty” maintaining its profit level this year
from 2012 amid falling oil prices and higher taxes.  First-quarter net income was steady from a year ago at 8.3
billion dinars ($97.6 million), while earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization fell 22 percent to 12.1
billion dinars, in line with its own forecast, the Novi Sad,
Serbia-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Unfortunately, the negative external factors had a
serious impact on NIS’s business results,” Chief Executive
Officer Kirill Kravchenko said in e-mailed comment. “Already
today we understand that it will be a very difficult task to
maintain the company’s financial results at last year’s level.”  Controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , NIS had a 49.5 billion-
dinar net income in 2012, 22 percent more than a year earlier,
on bigger output and refinery upgrade. The company said it will
seek to offset the falling prices with further upgrades. NIS’s
three-month investments rose 59 percent to 12.2 billion dinars.  Oil and gas production rose 5 percent in the first quarter
from the same period a year earlier to the oil equivalent of
411,000 tons, with refineries processing a total of 523,000
tons, a 27 percent annual increase. Fuel sales rose 12 percent
to 566,000 tons.  Overall fuel consumption in Serbia was 8 percent lower in
the first three months of the year, compared with January-March
2012, NIS said, adding the decline was partly because of
increased excise and value-added tax rates in  Serbia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
