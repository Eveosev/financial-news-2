Zinc led declines in base metals in
 London  as signs of slowing economic growth in China added to
concerns that demand for industrial metals will decline.
Aluminum and lead also slipped, while copper and nickel were
little changed.  Zinc for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 0.6 percent to $1,907 a metric ton at 11:09
a.m.  Seoul  time. Copper dropped as much as 0.7 percent to
$6,982.75 and swung between losses and gains before trading
little changed. The metal yesterday jumped the the most in
almost four months.  China’s manufacturing is expanding at a slower-than-
estimated pace this month on weakness in global and domestic
demand, a report showed this week, as  economic growth  in the
world’s biggest metals consumer unexpectedly lost momentum in
the first quarter. Previously owned U.S. home sales unexpectedly
dropped in March.  “The overall sentiment remains weak,” Chae Un Soo, a
metals trader at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co., said by phone
from Seoul. “Macro indicators out of economies from China to
U.S. still don’t look that great, which is weighing on metals
prices.”  Copper for August delivery rose 0.3 percent to 50,770  yuan 
per ton ($8,227) on the Shanghai Futures Exchange while the
metal for delivery in July on the Comex gained 0.7 percent to
$3.1865 per pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
