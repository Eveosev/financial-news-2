Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s biggest maker of  wind turbines , said
first-quarter profit rose more than fivefold as cost cuts
countered a decline in sales.  Net income jumped to 32.5 million yuan ($5.3 million) from
6.18 million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind said yesterday in a
Hong Kong stock exchange filing. Sales dropped 44 percent to 951
million yuan amid a weaker “market environment.”  Wind-turbine manufacturers have seen revenue decline as
increased competition drives prices down. Goldwind and Danish
peer  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  are among companies to reduce
expenses to weather slowing growth in the industry.  Cost cuts helped more than triple profit from operations in
the quarter and will underpin a forecast jump in first-half
earnings of as much as 50 percent, Urumqi-based Goldwind said.  Orders under contract totaled 4,576 megawatts at the end of
March, of which 404 megawatts were overseas, the company said.  Goldwind rose 0.7 percent to close at HK$4.50 in Hong Kong
trading today before the earnings were announced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
