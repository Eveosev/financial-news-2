Ethanol weakened for a second day
against gasoline, the first consecutive losses in more than
three weeks, as production of the biofuel increased.  The spread widened 4.64 cents to 35.88 cents a gallon, the
biggest one-day expansion since April 1. The Energy Information
Administration reported yesterday that  output  rose 2.5 percent
to 853,000 barrels a day in the week ended April 19, up 11
percent from a record low on Jan. 25, while  inventories  climbed
0.5 percent to 17.6 million barrels. The value of Renewable
Identification Numbers increased.  “The market’s done its job in terms of encouraging
production to come back,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for May delivery added 1.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.453 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 6.44 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $2.8118 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  output  has tumbled 11 percent from a record high
963,000 barrels a day in December 2011 after drought last summer
in the U.S. Midwest sent corn prices soaring and wiped out
profits for turning the grain into renewable fuel.  Poet LLC,  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  are among
companies that have resumed operations at mills that were idled
because of the higher manufacturing costs.  Corn Futures  Corn for May delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.4525 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread was 11 cents a gallon, unchanged from
yesterday. That compares to minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Corn-based RINs rose 2.5 percent to 62.5 cents, rebounding
from the lowest level since March 25, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, climbed 1.3 percent to 77 cents.  RINs are certificates assigned to each gallon of biofuel to
track compliance with government mandates. Once the fuel is
mixed with petroleum, refiners can keep the certificate or trade
it. Corn-based RINs have plunged 41 percent from a record $1.06
on March 8. Advanced RINs have dropped 29 percent since March 11
from their high of $1.08.  RIN Futures  CME Group Inc. (CME)  said today that it will start futures
contracts for the certificates on May 13. RINs for biodiesel,
advanced biofuel and ethanol will be settled based on Argus
Media prices, the exchange said in the statement. They will be
available on the CME Globex electronic trading platform for
over-the-counter clearing through CME ClearPort and open outcry
on the trading floor in New York.  Rising RINs have been a source of contention between
ethanol industry advocates and petroleum interests as they
debate whether the U.S. should keep the law.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to hold
hearings this summer on the law,  Charlotte  Baker, the
committee’s spokeswoman said in an e-mail today.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 0.5 cent to $2.62 a
gallon in  New York , 4 cents to $2.48 in Chicago and 4.5 cents to
$2.545 on the  Gulf Coast , data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
West Coast ethanol dropped 0.5 cent to $2.675.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago dropped 3.5 cents to
14 cents and the U.S. Gulf’s discount to the West Coast dwindled
5 cents to 13 cents, the tightest since March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
