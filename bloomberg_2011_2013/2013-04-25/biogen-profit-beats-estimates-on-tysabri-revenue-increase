Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) , the fourth-
largest U.S. biotechnology company by market value, reported
first-quarter net income rose 41 percent on higher sales of its
multiple sclerosis  drugs .  Profit increased to $426.7 million, or $1.79 a share, from
$302.7 million, or $1.25, a year earlier, the Weston,
Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement. Adjusted
for one-time items, profit of $1.97 a share beat the $1.63
average of 28 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 9.5 percent to $1.42 billion, boosted by
higher sales of the drugs Avonex and Tysabri, both for multiple
sclerosis. Biogen won U.S. approval on March 27 for Tecfidera,
its first pill for the central nervous system disease, and
analysts expect that drug may contribute an additional $3.4
billion in sales in 2017.  “Tecfidera’s blockbuster potential, a solid base business,
and a strong pipeline will allow  Biogen Idec  to post industry-
leading long-term growth,”  Eric Schmidt , an analyst with Cowen
& Co., wrote in an April 22 research note.  Biogen shares  fell  3.1 percent to $206.18 at the close in
 New York  yesterday. They have gained 41 percent this year,
rising to a record after Tecfidera gained U.S. approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
