Agthia Group PJSC (AGTHIA)  jumped the most
on record after the Abu Dhabi-based company reported a 38
percent increase in first-quarter profit.  The  shares soared  11 percent, the most since they were
listed in July 2005, to 2.9 dirhams at the close in the emirate.
About 1.8 million shares were traded, more than seven times the
three-month daily average, according to  data compiled  by
Bloomberg. The benchmark ADX General Index rose 1 percent.  Net income rose to 37 million dirhams ($10.1 million), the
company that creates, invests, trades and operates companies
that are involved in the food and beverage business said in a
statement yesterday.  “We remain optimistic and expect another successful growth
year,” the company said, commenting on the outlook for 2013.  Today’s jump pushed Agthia’s gains this year to 33 percent,
compared with a 25 percent rise for the benchmark index. The
stock’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 73 today. A
reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a security or
index is poised to decline.  Three analysts recommend investors buy the stock and four
advise holding the shares,  data compiled by Bloomberg show .  To contact the reporter on this story:
