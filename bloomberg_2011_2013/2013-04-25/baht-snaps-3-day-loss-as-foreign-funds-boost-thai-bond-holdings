The baht ended three days of losses
as international investors increased holdings of  Thailand ’s debt
amid optimism the Southeast Asian nation’s economy is improving.
Five-year  government bonds  rose.  Global funds  bought  $2.2 billion more sovereign debt than
they sold this month through yesterday, taking this year’s net
purchases to $12 billion, Thai Bond Market Association data
show. The Bank of Thailand raised its 2013 growth forecast on
April 12 to 5.1 percent from its January estimate of 4.9
percent. The central bank is concerned about the baht’s advance
to a 16-year high earlier this month, Assistant Governor
Chantavarn Sucharitakul said yesterday.  “Inflows in bonds continue and the baht is still under
pressure to appreciate,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader
at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “But there is
concern about intervention and also some demand to buy dollars,
slowing movements in the baht for now.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 28.90 per dollar as of 9:41
a.m. in Bangkok after reaching a one-week low of 28.99 earlier
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level
since a devaluation in July 1997 that sparked the Asian
financial crisis.  The baht has appreciated 5.8 percent this year, the most
among 11 major Asian currencies, prompting central bank Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul to say on April 19 the  exchange-rate  has
started to move beyond its fundamentals.  The Bank of Thailand may introduce a minimum holding period
for foreign buyers of domestic bonds, the Post Today reported,
citing an unidentified central bank official. Overseas investors
may have to pay a penalty for selling before the end of the
lock-in period, the Thai-language newspaper said in a report
today.  Governor Prasarn and Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong
have said Thailand should not impose  capital controls .  One-month implied volatility in the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.7
percent.  The yield on the 5.125 percent government bonds due March
2018 fell two basis points to 3.104 percent. The rate reached
3.103 percent on April 18, the lowest level since November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
