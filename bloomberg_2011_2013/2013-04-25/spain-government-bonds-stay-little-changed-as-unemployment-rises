Spanish government bonds stayed
little changed after a report showed unemployment, at a 37-year
high, rose more than forecast in the first quarter.  The 10-year bond yielded 4.28 percent as of 8:03 a.m.
London time. The rate on two-year notes was at 1.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
