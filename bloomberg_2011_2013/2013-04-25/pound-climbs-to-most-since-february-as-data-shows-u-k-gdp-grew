(Corrects pound high in second paragraph.)  The pound jumped to the most since
February against the dollar and climbed against the euro after a
report showed the U.K. economy expanded more than economists
forecast in the first three months of the year.  Britainâ€™s currency rose 0.9 percent to $1.5411 at 9:32 a.m.
London time, after reaching the most since Feb. 20, when it
climbed to $1.5451. Sterling advanced 0.7 percent to 84.67 pence
per euro, the most since April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
