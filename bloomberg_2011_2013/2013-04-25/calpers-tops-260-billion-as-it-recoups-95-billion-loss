The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System  reached a market value of $260.8 billion in
assets, surpassing the high set before the global financial
crisis wiped out more than a third of its wealth.  The largest U.S. pension, with half of its money in
equities, passed its pre-recession high of $260.6 billion on
Oct. 31, 2007, according to a posting today on its website. The
fund returned 13 percent in 2012, about the same gain as the
Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.  “The fund is stabilizing and the lessons we’ve applied
from the past are paying off,” Chief Investment Officer  Joe Dear  said by e-mail. “But as remarkable as this number is, we
are long-term investors and try to not get too excited when
things are good or too discouraged when things are bad.”  Calpers isn’t alone in seeing gains. The 100 largest public
pensions in the U.S. had $2.9 trillion in assets in the fourth
quarter of 2007, according to  U.S. Census Bureau  data. That
dropped to $2 trillion in 2009 and rebounded to almost $2.8
trillion as of Sept. 30.  Even with its gains, the Sacramento-based pension is still
short $87 billion, or about 26 percent, of meeting its long-term
commitments, and has had to ask the state and struggling cities
to contribute more.  Calpers’s value was already in decline when Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in September 2008, leading to a
panic that wiped out more than $6 trillion in U.S.  stock-market
value  in about six months. By 2009, Calpers’s value had
plummeted to $164.7 billion.  Equities Climb  Since then, the pension fund has benefited from the stock
market’s recovery after the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)   touched  a 12-year low
in March 2009. The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities  climbed  more
than 13 percent last year and has more than doubled since its
low.  Apart from stocks, Calpers  invested  about 16 percent of its
money in bonds as of Jan. 31, 13 percent in private equity, 8
percent in real estate, 4 percent in cash-equivalents, 4 percent
in inflation-linked holdings such as commodities and 1 percent
in forest land and infrastructure such as airports and power
plants.  The state and local governments paid $7.8 billion to the
fund in the last fiscal year, almost four times more than a
decade earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
