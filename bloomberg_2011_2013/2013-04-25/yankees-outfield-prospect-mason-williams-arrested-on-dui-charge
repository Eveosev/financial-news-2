New York  Yankees outfield prospect
Mason Williams was charged with driving under the influence
after failing a field sobriety test in Tampa, Florida, police
said.  Williams, a fourth-round draft pick by the Yankees in 2010,
was driving his 2012 Range Rover at 2:45 a.m. this morning when
he was pulled over after weaving in his lane while driving about
50-53 miles per hour in a 40 mph zone, according to a  news
release  posted on the Tampa police department website.  Williams “displayed clues of impairment” and agreed to
perform field sobriety exercises, police said. Those tests
“indicated additional clues of impairment” and he was
arrested.  The 21-year-old Williams was booked at the Hillsborough
County Sheriff’s Office and charged with driving under the
influence.  Williams took two breath tests, registering .067 and .062,
below the legal limit of .08 in the state of  Florida , according
to Janelle McGregor, a spokeswoman for the Tampa police.  An e-mail seeking comment from Jason Zillo, a spokesman for
the Yankees, wasn’t immediately returned.  Williams is  playing  for the Yankees’ Class-A Tampa
affiliate, batting .271 with five runs batted in and five
doubles in 18 games this season. Williams is listed as the
Yankees’ top prospect and No. 32 in all of baseball, according
to Baseball America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
