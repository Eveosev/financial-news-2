Japanese  stock   futures  rose amid
optimism corporate earnings are improving after monetary easing
by the Bank of Japan weakened the yen. Australian equities
futures gained after U.S. jobless claims fell.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758)  added 5 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo after Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics reported its first full-year
profit in five years as the weaker yen boosted overseas revenue.
ADRs of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s top producer of excavators,
added 3 percent as it forecast profit will rise 46 percent this
fiscal year. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil
producer, rose 2 percent as crude capped its longest rally in
nine months.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 13,985 in Chicago yesterday, up from 13,920 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 14,010 as of
8:05 a.m. in Osaka. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
advanced 0.2 percent today.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.3
percent in Wellington. Markets in Australia and New Zealand were
closed for national holidays yesterday.  “If the Bank of Japan carries out its intended policy over
the next two years in terms of QE and stimulating that economy,
we are going to see some substantial uplift,”  Tim Schroeders , a
portfolio manager who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne, said referring to bond
purchases known as quantitative easing. “But the question
remains globally in terms of how effective that policy is.”  Inflation Forecasts  All 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict no
easing at the BOJ meeting today, as the bank releases inflation
forecasts.  Investors are weighing how the yen’s decline will improve
the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters. The yen has
depreciated against all 16 of its major counterparts since April
4, when the central bank said it will double the amount of money
circulating in the economy by the end of 2014 by buying
government bonds, its boldest round of quantitative easing.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index rose 0.4 percent in New York yesterday,
as earnings from United Parcel Services Inc. to Cliffs Natural
Resources Inc. topped estimates and data showed applications for
jobless benefits fell by 16,000 to 339,000 last week.  Oil Advances  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery rose $2.21
to $93.64 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since April 10. Prices increased 8 percent in
the past six days, the longest consecutive winning streak since
July.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 8.2 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and China
remain on standby to support growth. The Asian benchmark traded
at 14.2 times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 14.4
times for the S&P 500 and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S.  rose  1.7 percent to 92.46, the
highest close since March 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
