HIG Capital LLC is combining German
and U.K. refining assets that make solvents and additives for
racing-car fuels and agrochemicals, ahead of a planned push into
Asia and the U.S.  Haltermann is being merged with Petrochem Carless to form
HCS, with potential benefits in logistics, sales and optimizing
the enlarged group’s four factories, said Paul Canning, a
managing director at the private-equity company. London-based
Canning orchestrated the acquisition of Petrochem at subsidiary
HIG  Europe  alongside colleague Johannes Natterer.  HIG is drawing up a merger blueprint and job cuts won’t be
a feature, the executive said. Petrochem takes byproducts from
North Sea oil and gas, refining them into products from racing-
car fuel to oils used in inks and solvents in crop protection.
The unit’s 2012 sales exceeded 350 million pounds ($540
million), and Haltermann completed the purchase this month.  “One of the big synergies will be allowing this business
to punch more in line with its weight into global markets,”
Canning said in a phone interview. “This business would never
compete with the Exxons of this world. This is still a niche
business but it’s now a niche business with a bit of scale.”  HIG, with $12 billion of capital under management, is
looking at other potential acquisition targets in Europe to
develop the Petrochem and Haltermann brands, Canning said.  “If we get this right, we should get a lot of growth out
of these businesses,” the HIG managing director said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
