Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , one of four U.S.
companies with a top  credit rating  from  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service, sold $2.67 billion of bonds with a
portion of euro-denominated debt paying a record-low coupon.  The world’s largest software maker issued bonds in euros
for the first time, raising 550 million euros ($715 million)
with 20-year, 2.625 percent notes, the lowest coupon among
similar-maturity, non-financial corporate bonds sold in that
currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt pays
55 basis points more than swaps.  In the U.S., the company also sold $450 million of 1
percent, five-year securities that pay 32 basis points more than
Treasuries, $1 billion of 2.375 percent, 10-year notes that
yield an extra 70 basis points and $500 million of 3.75 percent,
30-year bonds that pay a spread of 90.  Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, stock
repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today in separate filings.  “The debt is opportunistic and helps us lower the overall
cost of capital,” said Peter Wootton, a spokesman for
Microsoft. The pricing “in  Europe  is very attractive in this
20-year tenor.”  The company’s $14.3 billion of outstanding bonds before
today’s sale include $750 million of 2.125 percent notes due
November 2022 that traded at 98.5 cents on the dollar April 23
to yield 2.3 percent, or 60.2 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  While average yields on investment-grade corporate debt
have dropped 8 basis points to 2.69 percent since Microsoft last
issued bonds in November, the company’s new dollar securities
were priced with higher coupons than those in the previous
offering, according to Bloomberg and Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  Microsoft, along with Johnson & Johnson, Exxon Mobil Corp.
and Automatic Data Processing Inc., are rated Aaa by Moody’s and
AAA at S&P.  Fitch Ratings  ranks the company a level lower at
AA+.  To contact the reporter on this story:
