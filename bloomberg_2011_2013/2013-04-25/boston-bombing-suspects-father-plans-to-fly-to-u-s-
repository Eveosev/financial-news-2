The father of the Boston bombing
suspects, Anzor Tsarnaev, plans to fly to the U.S. today and has
been promised he can meet with his son, Dzhokhar.  Agents from the U.S.  Federal Bureau  of Investigation have
said they’ll assist him to see Dzhokhar, who’s receiving
treatment in the hospital after being captured, Anzor told
reporters today in Makhachkala, the capital of the southern
Russian region of Dagestan.  The mother of the two suspects, Zubeidat, said she hasn’t
decided whether to travel to the U.S. and is considering giving
up her American passport. She said she doesn’t accept that her
sons Tamerlan and Dzhokhar carried out the attack in which two
homemade bombs were detonated near the Boston marathon’s finish
line April 15, killing three people and injuring more than 200.  Tamerlan, 26, died after a shootout with police. Dzhokhar,
19, has been charged with two capital counts, including use of a
weapon of mass destruction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
