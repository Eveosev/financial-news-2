 Consumers’ Co-Operative Refineries
Ltd.’s Regina  refinery  will delay the restart of its 46,000
barrel-a-day coker to May 23, a company spokesman said.  All units will be running at “full bore” by then, with
the refinery producing about 126,000 barrels a day, Vic Huard, a
spokesman for the Regina, Saskatchewan-based refining company,
said today in an interview in Calgary.  The coker, which processes Canadian heavy oil, was damaged
by a fire on Feb. 11. Repairs are now complete, Huard said,
though the restart of the heavy crude train supplying the unit
was delayed by six days to May 17, he said.  The refinery is currently producing about 80,000 barrels a
day from two units undamaged by the fire, Huard said. The two
units process light and synthetic grades of oil.  The delay won’t affect the retail network operated by
Federated Co-op Ltd., parent of Consumers’ Co-Operative, he
said.  In October, Consumers completed an expansion that increased
the Regina refinery’s capacity by about 30,000 barrels a day to
130,000 barrels, making it Canada’s fourth-largest refinery, the
company said. The project allows the plant to process more light
synthetic crude and will add 15,000 barrels a day more in the
future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
