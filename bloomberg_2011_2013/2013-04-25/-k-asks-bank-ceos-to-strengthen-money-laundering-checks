Hong Kong’s banking regulator told
chief executives of lenders in the city in a  letter  today to
strengthen their anti-money laundering controls and systems.  The request followed a meeting on April 12 when Hong Kong
Monetary Authority Chief Executive Norman Chan told them that
failure to address the problem could threaten the city’s status
as an international financial center, according to a
presentation released by the HKMA today.  The regulator now has powers to fine or initiate criminal
proceedings against banks under a law that came into effect a
year ago. It has already begun using enforcement powers acquired
to start investigations, according to Stewart McGlynn, an acting
division head at the authority.  The HKMA plans to double its team of specialists, which
mainly comprises examiners for carrying out on-site checks at
banks, to 22 people over the year, he said at a briefing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
