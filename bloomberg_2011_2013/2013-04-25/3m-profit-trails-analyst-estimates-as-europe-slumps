3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of products
ranging from  Scotch tape  to dental braces, cut its annual
earnings forecast after quarterly profit trailed estimates for
the first time in 1 1/2 years amid a slowing global economy.  The shares fell the most in six months after  St. Paul ,
Minnesota-based 3M said profit will be $6.60 to $6.85 a share,
down from a range of $6.70 to $6.95. Analysts  predicted  $6.83 on
average. Currency translation will reduce 2013 sales by about
1.5 percent, the company said.  3M, an economic bellwether with sales in industries as
diverse as health care, electronics and auto parts, faced a
“low-growth economic environment” in the first quarter,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Inge G. Thulin said. The
company made 65 percent of 2012 revenue outside the U.S. and
gets fewer dollars when converting sales from countries with
weaker currencies.  “This is 3M’s first miss-and-lower in some time but can be
understood in light of the lackluster demand environment,”
Steve Winoker, a New York-based analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. who rates the stock market perform, said in a
note. “Currency was a significant drag.”  3M dropped 2.8 percent, the most since Oct. 23, to $104.88
at the close in  New York . Even after the decline, the stock has
gained 13 percent this year, outperforming the 11 percent gain
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Euro, Yen  In 2012,  Asia  Pacific accounted for 30 percent of sales and
 Europe , the  Middle East  and Africa for 23 percent. The euro has
weakened 1.4 percent and the yen has slid 13 percent against the
dollar this year through yesterday, according data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Profit last quarter  missed  analysts’ estimates for the
first time since the third quarter of 2011. Net income was
little changed at $1.13 billion, or $1.61 a share, trailing the
average prediction by 4 cents. Sales rose 2 percent to $7.63
billion, below the average forecast of $7.81 billion. They fell
0.5 percent in Asia Pacific because of lower prices and currency
impact, especially from the yen, 3M said. Revenue from the
Europe region was unchanged as acquisitions made up for a 1.1
percent decline in volume.  The company’s electronics and energy unit was the largest
drag on earnings, with sales declining 3.3 percent and operating
profit falling 16 percent to $196 million.  “Industrial missed my numbers because European short-cycle
is weak,” said  Brian Langenberg , principal and director of
research at Chicago-based Langenberg & Co., in a telephone
interview. “In Asia, telecom and electronics were weak as
well.” Langenberg has a hold rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
