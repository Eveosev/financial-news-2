Posco (005490) , Asia’s third-biggest
steelmaker by output, reported a worse-than-estimated 29 percent
decline in first-quarter profit as prices fell on waning demand
from carmakers and shipbuilders.  Net income  for the parent company was 383.4 billion won
($345 million) in the three months ended March 31, Pohang, South
Korea-based Posco said today in a regulatory filing. That
compares with 538.6 billion won a year earlier, according to
data on the Bloomberg, and the 505.5 billion won average of 15
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company didn’t
provide year-ago numbers.  Posco today cut its group sales forecast for this year by 3
percent to 64 trillion won, while predicting global steel demand
may gradually recover from the second quarter. The company and
its global peers are coping with declining profits as  China ’s
economic slowdown and the  European debt crisis  reduces demand
for the alloy used in cars, ships and buildings.  “We hardly see any catalyst to boost demand this year,”
Park Byung Chil, a steel analyst with Seoul-based IBK Securities
Co., said before the profit announcement. “On the supply side,
there won’t be much improvement in this region, with China still
pumping up output. While Posco will try to increase prices to
reflect cost gains, it won’t be easy.”  Posco has fallen 7.6 percent in Seoul trading this year,
underperforming a 2.3 percent decline in the local benchmark
 Kospi index . Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., China’s largest publicly
traded steelmaker, has lost 2 percent during the same period,
while  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401)  has gained 24 percent.  Operating profit was 581.4 billion won, compared with the
580.7 billion won average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales were 7.68 trillion won, Posco said in a
separate statement.  The average price for Posco’s products probably fell to
832,000 won per metric ton in the first quarter, compared with
1.03 million won a year earlier and 849,000 won in the fourth
quarter of last year, Kwon Hae Soon, an analyst at Mirae Asset
Securities Co., said in an April 17 report.  China’s hot-rolled coils, a  regional benchmark  product, has
fallen about 6 percent to 3,727  yuan  a ton this year. China is
the world’s biggest consumer and producer of steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
