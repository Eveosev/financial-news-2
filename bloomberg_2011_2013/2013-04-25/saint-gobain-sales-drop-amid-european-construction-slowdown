Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA ,  Europe ’s
biggest supplier of building materials, said first-quarter sales
dropped 4.8 percent amid a construction slump and cold weather
in Europe.  Sales declined to 9.7 billion euros ($12.6 billion), Saint-
Gobain, based in Courbevoie near Paris, said in a statement
today. Analysts  polled by Bloomberg  had expected 9.68 billion
euros, the average of seven estimates. The company reiterated
its 2013 targets.  Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Andre de Chalendar is
cutting investments, selling businesses and raising prices to
adjust to the European car and construction slump that has hurt
demand for flat glass and building materials and put the
company’s  credit rating  under pressure. Moody’s Investors
Service and  Standard & Poor’s , which rate Saint-Gobain at Baa2
and BBB respectively, have said they may downgrade the company.  “We continue to raise our prices in order to broadly
counter the rising cost of raw materials and energy over the
year as a whole, while vigorously pursuing our cost cutting
program,” the CEO said today. “We anticipate a gradual
recovery in the group’s trading over the next few quarters.”  In January, the company agreed to sell its U.S. glass-
bottle business for $1.7 billion. In March, It agreed to sell a
pipe and foundation business to  Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK)  for $175
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
