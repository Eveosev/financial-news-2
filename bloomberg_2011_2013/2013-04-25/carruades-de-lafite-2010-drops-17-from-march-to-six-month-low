A case of Carruades de Lafite 2010,
the second wine of first-growth Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sold
for 1,466 pounds ($2,240) on the London-based Liv-ex wine
exchange yesterday, a six-month low and 17 percent down from
March, according to Liv-ex data on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage fetched as much as 3,504 pounds a case on Liv-
ex in August 2011 as demand for wines from the region was
peaking, and dropped as low as 1,454 pounds on Oct. 19 after
investor appetite in  Asia  cooled. The 2010 wines are the
cheapest of the past 10 trading vintages apart from the 2011s,
according to merchant prices collated by Liv-ex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
