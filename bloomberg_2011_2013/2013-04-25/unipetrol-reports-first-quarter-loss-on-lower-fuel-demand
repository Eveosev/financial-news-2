Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the largest Czech
refiner, said it incurred its second consecutive quarterly loss
on lower processing volumes and weaker sales of gasoline.  The net loss in the three months through March reached 148
million koruna ($7.5 million), compared with the 363 million-
koruna loss a year ago, the company said today in a statement
posted in its website. Unipetrol reported a 3.1 billion-koruna
loss in the fourth quarter of last year.  Revenue in the first quarter fell 3 percent to 24.8 billion
koruna. Earnings before interest and tax came to a loss of 70
million koruna as demand for refinery products and gasoline
continued to decline.  “Volumes in the refinery segment fell as a result of a
general market slump due to the economic recession and large
volumes of illegal fuel trade,” the company said in the
statement. “The recession in the Czech and the EU economy
continues to negatively impact our results.”  Unipetrol was forced to shut down its Paramo refinery last
year as lower demand for refinery products and obsolete
equipment made the plant unprofitable to run.  PKN Orlen SA, which controls 63 percent of Unipetrol, said
today first-quarter net income fell to 149.3 million zloty
($46.9 million) from 1.26 billion zloty reported last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
