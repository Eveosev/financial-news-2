Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, rose to the highest in
five years after saying customer interest was growing and homes
reserved for purchase increased in the first quarter.  The homebuilder, based in  High Wycombe ,  England , was up 2.7
percent to 96.55 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the
highest since May 2008. The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index
gained 1.9 percent.  About 300 homes have been reserved since the U.K.
government said in March it would provide a loan of as much as
20 percent of the value of a newly built home worth 600,000
pounds ($925,000) or less, Taylor Wimpey said in a statement
today. Customer interest was up 15 percent for the year before
the program was announced and there have been “further
significant increases” since then, according to the statement.  “We have seen an increase in visitor levels and
reservations, driven by improved customer confidence and helped
in recent weeks by the government’s budget announcements,”
Chief Executive Peter Redfern said in the statement. “This,
together with the quality of our locations and the inherent
value in our landbank, is enabling us to drive improvement.”  More Orders  U.K. homebuilders have boosted margins by focusing on
higher-end homes and building on discounted land after a slump
during the financial crisis caused sales to drop. Taylor
Wimpey’s order book has risen 27 percent in value since the end
of the year and 18 percent from the same time last year, the
company said today.  Mortgage lending hasn’t increased “and continues to act as
the principal constraining factor” on Taylor Wimpey’s
performance, Redfern said in the statement.  The homebuilder has bought or gained options to purchase
about 3,000 land plots this year and has approved the purchase
of more than 4,000 others, according to today’s statement.
