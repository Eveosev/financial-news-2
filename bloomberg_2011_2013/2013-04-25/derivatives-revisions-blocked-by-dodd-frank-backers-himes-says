U.S. House derivatives legislation
designed to roll back some Dodd-Frank Act requirements won’t
gain passage because Senate Democrats will resist reopening the
2010 regulatory law, Representative Jim Himes said today.  “If I were betting, I would say none of these bills will
become law,” Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, said at a Bloomberg
Government breakfast in  Washington . “I don’t think there’s a
lot of appetite in the Senate to get into which of these bills
make sense and how are they balanced.”  Himes, who was a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  investment banker
before being elected to Congress in 2008, sponsored a bill that
would alter a requirement that banks with access to deposit
insurance and discount borrowing move some derivatives trades to
affiliates with that are separately capitalized.  While his bill and six others that have been approved by
the House Agriculture Committee could move on the House floor,
they would be unable to win passage in the Senate, Himes said.  “It’s still a morality play between those who believe
Dodd-Frank should be repealed in its entirety and those who
believe it’s the received word of God and any attempt to alter
it is obviously being a shill for the industry,” Himes said.
“There’s not much room between those poles right now.”  The measures would affect derivatives units at banks such
as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)   To contact the reporter on this story:
