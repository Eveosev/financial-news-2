Aguas Andinas SA (AGUAS/A) ,  Chile ’s largest
water utility, said first-quarter profit fell 8.6 percent after
mudslides fouled water-processing plants and caused outages to
much of the capital.  The company, which supplies drinking water to most of
Santiago, reported net income of 38.2 billion pesos ($80.7
million) in the first three months of 2013, down from 41.8
billion pesos a year ago. Revenue slipped 0.4 percent to 108
billion pesos, it said on the securities regulator’s website.  Sales volumes fell by 2.9 million cubic meters after rains
in January and February caused mudslides in the Cajon del Maipo
area and increased turbidity levels at water plants, briefly
countering a drought, the company said in the filing.  “The drought that began in 2010 still persists, which has
led to the application of contingency plans to ensure a normal
services to our clients,” said Aguas Andinas, whose shares have
risen 29 percent over the past year.  Inversiones Aguas Metropolitanas SA (IAM) , the holding company
that owns a majority stake in Aguas Andinas, reported profit of
19 billion pesos in the first quarter, down from 20.7 billion
pesos a year earlier, according to a separate filing. IAM is
controlled by  Spain ’s  Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
