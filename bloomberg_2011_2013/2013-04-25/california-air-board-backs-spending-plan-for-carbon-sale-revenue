California  regulators backed a
state plan to spend proceeds from carbon permit sales on  energy
efficiency , clean transportation and natural resources programs.  The state Air Resources Board voted today to support the
proposal from the state Finance Department to invest the first
three years of revenue from the allowance auctions on carbon-
reducing projects including high-speed rail, zero-emissions
vehicles, low-income housing retrofits and urban forestry.  California Governor  Jerry Brown  proposed last year using as
much as $500 million a year in revenue from the carbon sales to
pay for a high-speed rail project linking the state’s largest
cities. The air board has so far generated $138 million from its
first two allowance auctions and will hold one more on May 16
for this fiscal year, which ends June 30.  Brown is expected to release next month an updated budget
for the 2013-2014 fiscal year, including proposals on how to
spend the auction profits.  Under California’s carbon cap-and-trade program, the state
is limiting emissions from power generators, oil refineries and
other industrial plants, and cutting that limit gradually to
reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The system will
eventually cover 85 percent of the  greenhouse gases  released in
the state.  The air board is issuing carbon allowances, each permitting
the release of 1 metric ton, through a combination of free
allocations and quarterly auctions. Companies must turn in
carbon permits to cover their emissions, and those with more
allowances than they need can sell or trade the excess.  To contact the reporter on this story:
