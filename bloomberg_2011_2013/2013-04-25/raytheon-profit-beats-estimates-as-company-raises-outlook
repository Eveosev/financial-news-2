Raytheon Co. (RTN)  reported first-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates and raised its 2013 profit
outlook while lowering sales expectations.  The world’s biggest missile maker said net income from
continuing operations rose 8.9 percent to $490 million, or $1.49
a share, compared with $450 million, or $1.33 a share, a year
earlier.  Analysts predicted  $1.28 a share, the average of 18
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 1 percent to $5.88
billion, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said today in
a statement.  Raytheon said it expects full-year profit to be higher than
forecast in January. The company said 2013 profit will be $5.26
to $5.41 a share, up from the $5.16 to $5.31 a share forecast
last quarter. It expects revenue to be $23.2 billion to $23.7
billion, down from the earlier forecast of $23.6 billion to
$24.1 billion.  “Strong program execution drove solid operating results in
the first quarter,” William Swanson, Raytheon’s chairman and
chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Our innovation
and technology, along with our focus on productivity, agility
and affordability, continue to create value for our customers
and shareholders.”  Raytheon followed defense contracting peers such as  General
Dynamics Corp. (GD) ,  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  and  Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) , which also said this week that automatic budget cuts that
took effect March 1 won’t hurt profits this year. Raytheon is
the only company in the group that cut its revenue forecast.  The reductions, known as sequestration, were crafted by
President  Barack Obama  and congressional Republicans as a
penalty for failing to agree on a deficit reduction strategy.
They will strip $1.2 trillion from national security and
domestic programs over nine years unless a compromise is
reached.  Raytheon rose 1.3 percent to $58.13 in  New York  trading
yesterday and is up 1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
