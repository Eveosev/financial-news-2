BYD Co., the Chinese automaker
part-owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , rose the
most since November 2011 in Hong Kong trading today after
forecasting a 31-fold surge in first-half profit.  Shares of the the maker of the E6 electric car gained 12
percent to HK$28.15 at the close of trading in Hong Kong, while
the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.7 percent. Its Shenzhen-
traded stock rose 3.1 percent.  The Shenzhen, China-based company said it may earn first-
half  net income  of 400 million  yuan  ($65 million) to 500 million
yuan, up from 16.3 million yuan a year earlier, according to a
filing to the city’s stock exchange yesterday. First-quarter
profit gained 316 percent to 112.4 million yuan as sales
increased 9.8 percent to 12.9 billion yuan.  The company headed by Chairman Wang Chuanfu forecast an
increase in its auto sales and said it’s seeing strong orders
for its handset and assembly business. Demand for rechargeable
batteries is growing and rising prices for photovoltaic products
are helping narrow its solar losses.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , a Chinese partner for  General Motors Co. (GM) ,
gained 0.1 percent to 14.90 yuan, snapping a four-day losing
streak. First-quarter net income rose 11 percent to 6.2 billion
yuan, while vehicle sales gained 17 percent to 1.34 million
units in the first three months, the Shanghai-based company said
yesterday in a statement to the city’s stock exchange.  Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) , China’s biggest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and pickup trucks, slid 2.3 percent to HK$33.70
in Hong Kong and dropped 2.7 percent in Shanghai trading. The

yuan, beating the 1.65 billion-yuan average of three analyst
