Boston  Celtics coach Doc Rivers has
been fined $25,000 for criticizing officials following the
team’s 87-71 National Basketball Association playoff loss to the
 New York  Knicks two days ago.  NBA Executive Vice President of Basketball Operation Stu Jackson announced the punishment today in an e-mailed release.  Rivers said in his post-game press conference on April 23
that officials called “horrendous” fouls on Celtics center
 Kevin Garnett  that he said changed the course of the game.
Garnett picked up two fouls in the first quarter, and played
just 24 minutes in the game, six below his season average.  “That’s just the way it goes,” Rivers told reporters.
“There’s nothing I can do about it now. I thought it could’ve
gone either way on three of those, they all went against Kevin.
I think that’s tough.”  The Knicks lead the Celtics 2-0 in their best-of-seven
opening round series. Game 3 is tomorrow night in Boston.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
