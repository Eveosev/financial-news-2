Jordany Valdespin hit a 10th-inning
grand slam off the  Los Angeles Dodgers ’ Josh Wall to lift the
New York Mets to a 7-3 Major League Baseball win.  The New York Yankees (11-9) fell 3-0 at the Tampa Bay Rays
(10-11) on Ben Zobrist’s two-run double and Sean Rodriguez’s
solo home run at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.  At Citi Field in New York,  David Wright  tied the game 3-3
with a run-scoring single with two outs in the bottom of the
ninth. Wright then was caught trying to steal second, sending
the game into extra innings.  Mets starter Matt Harvey, who came into the game 4-0,
allowed three runs on four hits and struck out seven in six
innings and did not get a decision. Bobby Parnell (1-0) got the
win, walking one and striking out a batter in the 10th inning
for New York (10-9).  Matt Kemp  hit a two-run homer and knocked in all three runs
for the Dodgers (9-11).  To contact the reporter on this story:
