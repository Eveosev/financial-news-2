Skylar Diggins, the third player
chosen in the Women’s National Basketball Association draft, has
signed with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports, a statement from the firm
said.  Jay-Z, whose real name is  Shawn Carter , announced April 2
that he was starting an athlete representation firm with New
York Yankees All-Star second baseman  Robinson Cano  as its first
client.  The firm operates in a partnership with Creative Artists
Agency, whose agents handle contract negotiations. Roc Sports
negotiates player marketing agreements.  Diggins, of the Tulsa Shock, played collegiately at the
University of Notre Dame, where the guard became the only player
in school history -- male or female -- to register 2,000 points,
500 rebounds and assists and 300 steals.  Baylor center Brittney Griner was taken by the Phoenix
Mercury with the No. 1 pick. Delaware forward Elena Delle Donne
went second to the Chicago Sky.  The WNBA bills the trio as “Three to See.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
