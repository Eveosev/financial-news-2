Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd., an
Indian waste management company backed by  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) ’s private equity unit, delayed a planned $200 million
initial public offering because of tepid market conditions.  “We have to take into account the  market sentiment ,”
Chairman Ayodhya Rami Reddy said in an interview. “We are not
sure the time is quite right for a mid-cap offering.”  The BSE Mid-cap Index has slumped 11 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Hyderabad-based
company had planned to invest 5 billion rupees ($92 million)
from the proceeds of the share sale to set up a 48 megawatt
“waste-to-energy” plant in Hyderabad.  Ramky Enviro had hired  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB) ,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America , IDFC Capital Ltd., SBI Capital
Markets Ltd. and Edelweiss Capital Ltd, to manage the sale.  The shares of group company  Ramky Infrastructure Ltd. (RMKY) ,
which went public in October 2010, have slumped 85 percent from
the offer price of 450 rupees, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
