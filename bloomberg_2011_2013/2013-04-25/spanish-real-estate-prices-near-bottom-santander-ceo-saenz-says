Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s decision to
“retract” as much as 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of
provisions to cover property price declines may show  Spain ’s
real estate market is close to its lowest point, Chief Executive
Officer Alfredo Saenz said.  Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, set aside the funds for
for this year to cover the risk that price declines would
accelerate. The bank is “retracting” the provision because it
now doesn’t expect it will be needed, he said today.  “If it hasn’t reached bottom already, the room that
remains for the real estate market to fall is very small,”
Saenz said at a news conference at the bank’s headquarters
outside Madrid.  Santander’s upbeat outlook on Spanish  house prices 
contrasts with other commentators who point to the weak state of
the economy as evidence that further price declines are
inevitable. Moody’s Investors Service said this month that  house
prices  would continue to fall for at least five years.  Santander set aside extra provisions at the start of the
year because it “subliminally” thought that Spain’s bad bank,
known as Sareb, set up at the end of last year, might drive down
prices, Saenz said.  “We don’t see that Sareb is having an effect on prices,”
he said.  House prices have declined 36 percent from their April 2007
peak, according to the real estate website Fotocasa.es and the
IESE business school in Madrid. Santander’s net holdings in real
estate fell 47 percent from a year earlier as it sold 4,500
properties in the first quarter, the lender said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
