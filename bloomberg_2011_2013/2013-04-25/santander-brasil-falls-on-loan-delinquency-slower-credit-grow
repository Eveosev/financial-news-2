Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , the
Brazilian unit of Spain’s biggest lender, fell the most in three
months after first-quarter revenue stagnated on a slower
expansion in credit and increased loan delinquency.  Shares declined 3 percent to 14.13 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the steepest drop since Jan. 22. The stock
was the worst performer on the  MSCI Brazil/Financials Index (MXBR0FN) ,
which advanced 0.8 percent.  Santander’s adjusted revenue in the first quarter was 10.3
billion reais ($5.1 billion), almost the same as a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Santander Brasil is suffering from earlier bad credit
that is likely to end by the second half of 2013, but we are
still skeptical about the bank’s ability to reach a larger set
of good clients to recover loan growth without undermining asset
quality,” Regina Longo Sanchez, Thiago Bovolenta Batista and
Alexandre Spada, analysts at the investment bank Itau BBA, wrote
in a research note to clients.  Santander said in a regulatory filing today that its loan
portfolio rose 6.2 percent to 211.7 million reais in the three
months through March from the same period a year earlier. That
is the slowest pace since at least the first quarter of 2011,
according to data posted on the bank’s website.  The lender’s delinquency rate increased to 5.8 percent in
the first quarter of 2012 from 4.8 percent a year earlier,
according to the filing.  Shares have fallen 5.6 percent this year while the MSCI
index of Brazilian financial stocks gained 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
