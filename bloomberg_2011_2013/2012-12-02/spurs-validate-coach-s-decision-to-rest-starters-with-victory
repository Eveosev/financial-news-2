The San Antonio Spurs defeated their
division rival Memphis Grizzlies 99-95 in overtime to validate
their coach’s decision to rest his starters three nights
earlier, a move that cost the team $250,000.  The Spurs were fined by the National Basketball Association
after coach Gregg Popovich sent home his players before the
team’s 105-100 loss to the Miami Heat on Nov. 29. San Antonio
was playing its fourth road game in five nights and finishing a
six-game road trip.  Tony Parker scored 30 points, Tim Duncan had 27 points and
15 rebounds and Manu Ginobili added 10 points for the Spurs
(14-4) who are one-half game behind the Grizzlies in the Western
Conference’s Southwest Division.  Thirty-six-year-old Duncan, 30-year-old Parker, 35-year-old
Ginobili and 25-year-old Danny Green, who scored one point last
night, had returned to San Antonio as the team prepared for
Miami.  “What I do from my perspective is from a coaching
perspective,” Popovich told reporters before the game. “And I
think the league operates from a business perspective. And I
think that’s reflective in the action that they took.’”  Popovich hasn’t decided if he will appeal the fine. NBA
Commissioner David Stern said pulling the players “did a
disservice to the league and our fans.”  The Spurs trailed 46-45 at the half. The Grizzlies
outscored their opponents 27-15 in the third quarter with the
Spurs rallying the final period to tie the game 87-87 at AT&T
Center in San Antonio.  Marc Gasol had 20 points and Mike Conley Jr. scored 18 for
the Grizzlies (12-3). The Grizzlies and the Miami Heat share the
best record in the league.  In other NBA games last night, it was Miami 102, Brooklyn
89; Portland 118, Cleveland 117 (2OT); Chicago 93, Philadelphia
88; Oklahoma City 100, New Orleans 79; Houston 124, Utah 116;
Milwaukee 91, Boston 88; and Dallas 92, Detroit 77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
