Russia’s crude oil and condensate
 output  climbed to a post-Soviet record of 10.503 million barrels
a day in November, beating the high reached the previous month,
according to the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  Crude and condensate production rose 0.5 percent compared
with revised data for October and 1.5 percent from November of
last year, according to CDU-TEK preliminary data received today
by e-mail.  President  Vladimir Putin  has called for Russia to maintain
production at above 10 million barrels a day for at least the
next decade and ordered the government to prepare new tax breaks
to encourage development of the continental shelf and
unconventional oil reserves. Oil production climbed above that
level in September 2009 for the first time since the collapse of
the  Soviet Union .  Exports declined to 5.12 million barrels a day last month,
a 1.3 percent decrease from October.  Natural-gas production was 57.64 billion cubic meters,
according to the data. Output at OAO Gazprom, the world’s
biggest producer of the fuel, was 42.5 billion cubic meters in
November.  Soviet-era crude and condensate output in Russia peaked at
11.4 million barrels a day in 1987,  BP Plc (BP/)   data  show. Russian
production, including natural gas liquids, was higher than  Saudi
Arabia ’s in 2009 and 2010, according to BP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
