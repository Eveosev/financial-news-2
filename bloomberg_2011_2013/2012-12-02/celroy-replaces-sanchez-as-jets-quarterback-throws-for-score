Third-string quarterback Greg McElroy
led the Jets to a touchdown on his first drive of the season,
giving New York a 7-3 lead early in the fourth quarter of its
home game today against the Arizona Cardinals.  Mark Sanchez  was sent to the bench and replaced with
McElroy with about five minutes left in the third quarter with
the Jets trailing 3-0. Sanchez had thrown three interceptions
and was 10-of-21 for 97 yards.  Backup  Tim Tebow  was inactive for the game because of
cracked ribs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
