About 10 pounds of benzene was
released by a pipeline leak at  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s  Baton Rouge 
Refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to a report made
to the National Response Center.  Atmospheric monitoring is being conducted at the site and
absorbent pads have been placed under the leak, according to the
report, which was taken at 2:08 p.m. yesterday.  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substance in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify the information
