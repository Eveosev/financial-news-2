  Israel ’s government bonds due 2018
rose, pushing yields down for the first time in almost a week,
as investor concern U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach a deficit
agreement boosted demand for the relative safety of state debt.  The yield on the 4 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due
January 2018 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
points, to 2.89 percent at 2:52 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the first drop
since Nov. 26. The two-year break-even rate, the yield
difference between the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate
government bonds of similar maturity, was little changed at 212,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.12 percent over
the period.  Treasuries rose for the first month since July as President
 Barack Obama  and lawmakers bantered about tax increases and
spending cuts, intensifying concern that a failure to reach an
agreement may lead to an economic downturn. Exports comprise
about 40 percent of Israel’s economic output, and the U.S. is
one of its largest markets.  “Local government yields are tracking their U.S.
counterpart over the weekend amid uncertainty about the progress
on the deficit talks,” said Sagie Poznerson, head of trading at
Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Investors are also
preparing for tomorrow’s government auction.”  Auction Tomorrow  The Finance Ministry plans to sell a combined 1.3 billion
shekels ($341 million) of bonds at Monday’s auction, ministry
data posted on Bloomberg show. The debt sale includes 300
million shekels each of the 2018 bonds and of 4.25 percent notes
due March 2023. The government will also sell 250 million
shekels of 2.75 percent inflation-linked securities due
September 2022.  Economic growth slowed to 2.9 percent in the third quarter,
less than forecast, from 3.4 percent the previous three months.
The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark bonds due January 2022
was unchanged at 3.85 percent. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of
corporate bonds advanced less than 0.1 percent to 279.73.  The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.8154 a dollar on
Nov. 30, boosting last month’s increase to 1.8 percent. One-year
 interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for
rates over the period, rose one basis point to 1.82 percent on
Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
