The New York Knicks improved their
record to 7-0 at home this season, defeating the Phoenix Suns
106-99 behind 34 points from Carmelo Anthony.  Raymond Felton  added 23 points, seven assists and no
turnovers yesterday at Madison Square Garden, while Tyson
Chandler had 15 points and 13 rebounds. The Knicks took a 17-
point lead into the fourth quarter and held off a Suns’ rally to
improve to 18-1 at home under coach  Mike Woodson .  “Every game’s not going to be a runaway or blowout for
us,” Woodson told reporters. “You gotta give them credit. They
played hard. They were scrapping it out and made a game out of
it. We closed it out and got a ‘W,’ that’s what counts.”  The Knicks (12-4) have a one-game lead over the Brooklyn
Nets in the Atlantic division of the  National Basketball
Association ’s Eastern Conference.  Marcin Gortat had 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead the
Suns (7-11), who have lost three straight road games to fall to
2-8 away from home this season.  The Orlando Magic outscored the Los Angeles Lakers 40-26 in
the fourth quarter to pull away for a 113-103 win last night at
the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Arron Afflalo had 30 points
and  Glen Davis  added 23 points and 12 rebounds as the Magic
(6-10) won for the second time in seven road games.  Kobe Bryant had 34 points for the Lakers, who fell to 8-9
and now have a 3-4 record under coach  Mike D’Antoni .  To contact the reporter on this story:
