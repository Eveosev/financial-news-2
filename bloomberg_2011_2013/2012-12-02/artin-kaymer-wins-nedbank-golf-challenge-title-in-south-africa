Martin Kaymer  shot a 3-under-par
final round to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge title by two shots
from Charl Schwartzel and collect a prize of $1.25 million.  The 27-year-old German had a mixed round today in Sun City,
South Africa, including an eagle, four birdies, a bogey and
double-bogey as he finished  at 8-under  for the tournament.  South Africa’s Schwartzel matched Kaymer’s round to finish
6-under at the Gary Player Country Club, with  Bill Haas  of the
U.S. at 3-under. Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa was 1-over
today as he slipped out of contention, six shots back.  The 12-player invitational event also included England’s
Lee Westwood, winner the past two years, and his countryman
 Justin Rose , who climbed to No. 4 in the Official World Golf
Ranking this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
