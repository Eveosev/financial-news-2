Ricky Ponting , Australia’s record
run-scorer and former captain, was dismissed for eight in his
last innings in Test cricket as his team lost the series-
deciding match against  South Africa  by 309 runs.  Ponting, playing his 168th Test in a career spanning 17
years, was given a guard of honor by South Africa as he walked
out to bat in Perth. He struck two boundaries before being
caught at slip by  Jacques Kallis  off the bowling of spinner
Robin Peterson. He scored four runs in the first innings.  The Australians had reached 102 runs when Ponting became
the third wicket to fall, as the home side needed to post 632,
the biggest-ever fourth innings total, to wrestle the world No.
1 ranking from the Proteas. Fast bowler Mitchell Starc smashed
an unbeaten 68 off 43 balls to top score for  Australia  but by
then it was too late as South Africa had reduced the hosts to
235-9.  “I’ve given cricket my all,” Ponting, 37, said when he
announced his decision to retire the day before the Perth test.
“I want to be a consistent performer and if you look back over
the past 12-18 months I haven’t been able to perform
consistently.”  Ponting, who made his test debut in the same city against
 Sri Lanka  17 years ago, averaged just 6.4 in the present three-
match series compared with a career average of 51.85.  Ponting has amassed 13,378 runs and recorded the most
appearances in the team’s history along with his predecessor as
Test captain Steve Waugh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
