Backup quarterback  Tim Tebow  was
declared inactive for the New York Jets in today’s home game
against the Arizona Cardinals because of cracked ribs.  Tebow, 25, was injured in a Nov. 11 loss at the Seattle
Seahawks and coach Rex Ryan said he was “really very limited”
in practice this past week.  Greg McElroy  is the backup quarterback today for the Jets,
who are tied with the Buffalo Bills for last place in the
American Football Conference’s East Division. The Jets and
Cardinals both are 4-7 entering today’s game at MetLife Stadium
in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
