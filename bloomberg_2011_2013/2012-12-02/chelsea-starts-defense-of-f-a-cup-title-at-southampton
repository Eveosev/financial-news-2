Defending champion Chelsea faces a
trip to Southampton in the third round of English soccer’s F.A.
Cup, while record 11-time winner Manchester United travels to
West Ham.  Chelsea, which appointed Rafael Benitez as manager last
month, beat Liverpool 2-1 in May’s F.A. Cup final to win the
competition for a fourth time in six seasons. Liverpool will
start its cup campaign at a non-league club, either Lincoln City
or Mansfield Town.  The third round is the stage at which clubs from the elite
Premier League and the Championship enter the competition.  There are two further all-Premier League matches, with
Swansea hosting Arsenal and Queens Park Rangers at home against
West Bromwich Albion.  Coventry City, from the third-tier League One, plays
Premier League Tottenham in a repeat of the 1987 F.A. Cup final,
and Manchester City plays Watford.  Chelsea has won the competition seven times. Roberto di Matteo, who led the Blues to the F.A. Cup and Champions League
titles last season, was fired in November and Benitez named
interim manager.  Here is the full third-round draw, with the matches
scheduled to be played over the weekend of Jan. 5 and Jan. 6:  To contact the reporter on this story:
