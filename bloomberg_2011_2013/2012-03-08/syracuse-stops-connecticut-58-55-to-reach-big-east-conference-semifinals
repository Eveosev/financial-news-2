Syracuse University  will play the
University of Cincinnati and the University of Louisville will
face the University of  Notre Dame  in today’s semifinals of the
 Big East conference  men’s basketball tournament.  Dion Waiters scored 18 points to lead top-seeded Syracuse
to a 58-55 win over the  University of Connecticut  at Madison
Square Garden in  New York  yesterday. Orange forward James
Southerland scored all 10 of his points in the final eight
minutes for Syracuse (31-1), which rallied from an eight-point
deficit.  The ninth-seeded Huskies (20-13) were unable to
successfully defend their tournament title, which they won from
the same seeding position before eventually capturing the
national championship last season.  “The run they made last year left a sour taste in my
mouth,” Waiters said in a televised interview. “I just wanted
to come out here and get revenge.”  Syracuse, ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll,
led 27-24 at halftime before  Connecticut  took an eight-point
advantage with 14 minutes remaining.  The Orange worked their way back into the game as
Connecticut went more than seven minutes without a field goal.
The Huskies, who shot 34 percent from the field, got 15 points
from Shabazz Napier and 14 from Andre Drummond.  Bearcats Advance  Yancy Gates scored 23 points and grabbed eight rebounds for
the No. 4 Cincinnati Bearcats (23-9), who got the decisive
points on a running shot in the lane by Cashmere Wright with
nine seconds remaining. Henry Sims, who led the Hoyas with 22
points and 15 rebounds, missed a 3-point shot as the game ended.  No. 7 seed Louisville, led by Kyle Kuric’s 20 points, upset
second-seeded Marquette 84-71. Peyton Siva scored 18 for the
Cardinals (24-9, 10-8  Big East ). Darius Johnson-Odom had 23
points for the Golden Eagles (25-7, 14-4 Big East).  In the final Big East game yesterday, Jerian Grant and Pat
Connaughton each scored 12 points and the third-seeded Fighting
Irish (22-10, 13-5 Big East) outscored South Florida 12-8 in
overtime to earn a 57-53 win. Victor Rudd Jr. had 16 points for
the Bulls (20-13, 12-6 Big East).  The winners of the semifinals meet in the championship game
tomorrow, a day before the field for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament is announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
