U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the defection of Syria’s deputy oil minister would be an
“important moment” if the reports are confirmed, and urged
others in the government to follow.  The official, Abdo Hussameddin, appeared to announce his
defection in a statement posted on YouTube.  “If confirmed, this is an important moment,” Cameron’s
spokesman, Steve Field, told reporters in  London . “It would be
the highest ranking civilian resignation so far, and would
follow a number of military resignations. The regime has no
legitimacy, and we would urge others to step away and support
the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
