The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose a second day, by 0.8 percent to
703.06, at 4:10 p.m. in  New York  as Greece moved closer to
completing its debt restructuring. Cocoa, gasoil and zinc led
the gain.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices also rose for the
second day, by 0.5 percent to 1621.326 at 4:19 p.m. in New York.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures jumped the most in three weeks on political
concerns in  Ivory Coast , the world’s top grower, while prospects
for European commodity demand improved. Coffee and sugar also
rose.  Guillaume Soro, the former Ivory Coast rebel leader who
became prime minister, resigned his position, along with the
rest of the government. The smaller of two harvests in the
country may drop 26 percent from a year earlier,  Ecobank
Transnational Inc. (ETI)  said on March 6. Stocks rose as Greece moved
closer to restructuring its debt, and the dollar eased.  Soro’s resignation “in conjunction with the outside
markets like the weak dollar and strong equities help propel
cocoa higher,”  Hector Galvan , a senior broker at RJO Futures in
Chicago, said in an e-mail.  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $118, or 5.2 percent, to
settle at $2,395 a ton at 12:10 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the largest gain for a most-active contract since Feb. 15.
The rally was the biggest among 24 raw materials in the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1.894
a pound in New York, halting a four-session drop.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
23.96 cents a pound, snapping a three-day slide.  In London futures trading, cocoa, robusta coffee and
refined sugar gained on NYSE Liffe.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rose for the second straight day as  Greece 
moved closer to restructuring its sovereign debt, easing concern
that commodity demand will contract.  Investors with about 60 percent of Greek bonds eligible for
a debt swap agreed to participate. Copper also rose as the
dollar’s decline against a basket of major currencies boosted
the appeal of raw materials as alternative assets. Global stock
prices advanced.  Copper futures for May delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
settle at $3.7915 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal, up 0.8 percent yesterday, has gained 10 percent this
year.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.4
percent to $8,330 a metric ton ($3.78 a pound).  Zinc, lead and tin climbed in  London , while nickel and
aluminum fell.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline advanced a second day, following  Brent crude 
higher on optimism that Greece will be able to restructure its
debt and that the U.S. will report more employment.  Futures rose as Brent surged 1.1 percent on the reports
from Greece. Economists in a survey by Bloomberg News forecast
the U.S. Labor Department will report that employers boosted
February payrolls.  Gasoline for April delivery rose 2.66 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $3.314 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have gained 23 percent this year, making
gasoline the best performer in the GSCI index.  April-delivery heating oil rose 5.01 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $3.2695 a gallon on the exchange. Prices are up 11
percent this year.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold jumped the most in two weeks as the improved prospects
for a debt swap in Greece sent the euro higher against the
dollar, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as an
alternative to the U.S. currency.  The euro strengthened the most against the dollar in two
weeks as Greece moved closer to completing its debt swap.
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said inflation will
probably breach the bank’s 2 percent limit this year even as the
economy stalls. The ECB kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record low of 1 percent.  Gold futures for delivery in April rose 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,698.70 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices advanced 0.7 percent yesterday.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 0.7 percent to
$33.831 an ounce on the Comex. The commodity’s 21 percent gain
this year is the biggest among precious metals.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery advanced 2.1 percent to $699.45 an ounce. Platinum
futures for April delivery climbed 1.8 percent to $1,656.70 an
ounce.  CRUDE OIL  Oil climbed after German industrial production increased
more than forecast and Greece moved closer to completing its
debt swap.  Prices gained 0.4 percent as  Germany ’s Economy Ministry
said output rose 1.6 percent in January, greater than the 1.1
percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Oil shipments from  Iran 
have dropped by as much as 400,000 barrels a day,  Barclays
Capital  said.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 42 cents to settle at

are up 7.8 percent this year.  Brent oil for April settlement advanced $1.32, or 1.1
percent, to end the session at $125.44 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The European benchmark contract’s premium to  New York- 
traded West  Texas  Intermediate widened to $18.86 at the close,
the most since Feb. 6. The spread increased after the U.S.
Energy Department said yesterday that crude stockpiles at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York-traded
futures, surged to the highest level since July.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybeans rose the most in more than a week on signs that
drought-reduced crops in  South America  are boosting demand for
supplies from the U.S. Corn fell.  In the week ended March 1, U.S. exporters sold 1.015
million metric tons of soybeans for delivery before Aug. 31, up
85 percent from the previous week, the Department of Agriculture
said today. A separate report showed  China , the world’s biggest
consumer, bought 165,000 tons from exporters. The country may
boost imports 5.7 percent next year, the agency said yesterday.  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
close at $13.385 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Feb. 27.  Corn futures for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$6.355 a bushel in Chicago, the third straight drop.  Wheat fell for a fourth straight session, the longest slump
in almost a month, on speculation that a government report
tomorrow will show ample global supplies as crop prospects
improve in the U.S. Great Plains.  Global inventories before the 2012 harvest in the Northern
Hemisphere may total 212.83 million metric tons, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before tomorrow’s U.S. Department of
Agriculture report on supplies. While the estimate would be down
0.1 percent from last month’s forecast, supplies would still be
the highest on record. Parts of Oklahoma and Texas may have
showers today through March 10, Telvent DTN forecast.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.7 percent to settle
at $6.3475 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after sliding 5.2 percent in the previous three days. The last
time prices dropped for four straight sessions was the period
ended Feb. 10. The most-active contract is down 19 percent in
the past year.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures rose for the second straight day on speculation
that demand for U.S. meat exports will climb as the dollar
eases. Cattle increased for the first time in a week.  The appeal of U.S. shipments increased as the dollar fell
for the third time in four days against a basket of six major
currencies. Yesterday, wholesale pork rose 0.7 percent to 85.42
cents a pound, the biggest gain since Feb. 23, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.5 percent to settle
at 87.75 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity has advanced 4.1 percent this year.  Cattle futures for April delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$1.2665 a pound. The price, down 4.1 percent in the previous
four sessions, has climbed 4.3 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement increased 0.6
percent to $1.58575 a pound.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures settled at a 10-year low for a second
day after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles
dropped by less than expected last week.  Gas slid 1.3 percent after the Energy Department said
inventories fell 80 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 2
to 2.433 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected withdrawal of 85 billion. Above-
average temperatures and record production have led to the
biggest surplus of the heating fuel in more than five years.  Natural gas for April delivery fell 3 cents to $2.272 per
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Feb. 15, 2002. The
futures dropped to a 10-year intraday low of $2.231 on Jan. 23.
Gas, down 24 percent this year, is the worst performer on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
