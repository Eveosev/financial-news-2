Driving through  Manhattan  in an
oversized Ford F-150 SuperCrew pickup, my major concern is not
decapitating any hapless cyclists.  There might be any number of reasons why a pickup and the
Big Apple might seem at odds --  Wall Street  versus Main Street
and all that. My issue is with the gargantuan side mirrors.
Boulder-sized chunks of glass and heavy plastic, they hang out
extremely far on either side.  Fine, perhaps, when you’re towing a big boat and need to
see the universe behind you. Not so helpful when your main
concern is avoiding the bobbing heads of delivery men.  Once I clear the city without having claimed any urban
scalps, I find myself marveling at this asphalt-bound tug boat.
The size, the price, the technology. This $52,000  Ford (F)  is not
the truck of my youth.  I’ve been in a pickup state of mind recently. My first car
was also a truck, and I’ve always loved pickups for their
versatility, their toughness, and their 4X4 ability to go
through rocks and mud.  Putting aside fears that all my city friends would suddenly
ask me to help them move -- a real complaint among pickup owners
-- I recently bought a used 2002 midsize Nissan Frontier.  It’s
perfect for ferrying dirt, rocks, lumber and furniture around a
property in rural  Pennsylvania .  Oversized Tires  It has 4X4 and oversized tires, a leather interior and it’s
pretty nice to drive. It also has an antiquated CD player and
only two airbags.  I wanted to see what the latest pickups had to offer. The
Ford F-150 is consistently the best-selling truck in the U.S.,
and the luxury version I tested was resoundingly modern. The
leather seats are heated and cooled, the steering wheel
electronically tilts and telescopes. There’s a (much needed)
back-up video camera. It has a power moon-roof, satellite radio
and a 4.2-inch screen with navigation.  The beast is also huge. Intimidatingly so. Ford calls it a
“SuperCrew.”  And with four full doors and plenty of room, it
could easily fit the kind of guys who either favor hard hats and
steel-toed boots or ten-gallon Stetsons and spurs.  It has a bed that it 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) long, ample for
carrying a queen-sized mattress or half-cords of firewood, and
you can opt for one that’s a foot longer.  Rhinoceros Size  Even without actually towing something behind you, a novice
truck driver has to get used to driving something this long and
bulky. This is no two-door sports car threading its way through
traffic. It’s a 19.3-foot-long, 5,100-pound rhinoceros which
shoulders its way in.  Once I get past the size, I begin to appreciate the
elegance of Ford’s EcoBoost motor. Yes, elegance. Rather than
the brutish 5.0-liter V-8 of the standard F-150, the SuperCrew
packs a twin-turbo, direct-injected V-6.  Rated at 365 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque, it’s
a slick piece of technology displacing only 3.5 liters, this
engine has far more in common with a hot sports car.  The result is better gas mileage, relatively speaking; 15
miles per gallons city, 21 highway versus 14 and 19 for the
regular 5.0-liter V-8. The V-6 also gets 40 more foot-pounds of
torque than the bigger engine, providing the kind of muscle you
need to power up hills while pulling a barge or trailer. For any
sagacious truck guy, that’s a bonus. (The V-6 costs about $900
more.)  Peppy Power  It also means that power comes on quickly and seamlessly.
The  F-150  is peppy and powerful, depending on how you want to
drive it. The handling is good. My wife Miranda drove and loved
it. The size didn’t bother her one whit.  The price set me back on my heels. The base price of this
2011 model was around $46,000, with more than $5,000 of options
and a destination charge of almost $1,000. All in it carried a
$52,075 price tag.  For my current lifestyle, a compact or mid-size truck is
better. So I spent a week driving the 2012 model of the Nissan
Frontier 4X4. With a price of $29,085 as tested, it was a four-
door model with a V-6 engine. Its SV trim wasn’t much more
luxurious than my 10-year-old model. In fact it had cloth seats
that looked cheap and oddly, included no optional navigation
system.  Traction Control  The body style is newer and larger too.  Nissan (7201)  has added
important safety additions like traction control and better
brakes, as well as side impact and curtain air bags. But the
drive was only nominally better than the older Frontier, because
the automatic transmission is only a five speed, and the 4.0-
liter V-6 gets only 261 hp and 281 lb-ft of torque. At 14 mpg
city and 19 highway, mileage is poorer than the larger Ford.  While standard wheels are puny 16-inchers, a $1,190 sport
appearance package allows you to upgrade to 18 inchers. It would
have looked great with even bigger wheels. If I was buying a new
Nissan, I’d opt for a locking rear differential and skid plates.  The truck wars are fierce, and Ford has embraced a mix of
the old and new in a compelling way. Meaty and modern, it’s the
one I’d pick up.  The 2011 Ford F-150 4X4 SuperCrew and 2012 Nissan Frontier 4X4
SV at a Glance:  Engines: 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6 with 365 hp  and 420 lb-ft of torque; 4.0-liter V-6 with 261 hp  and 281 lb-ft of torque.  Transmissions: Six-speed automatic; five-speed automatic.  Gas mileage per gallon: 15 city, 21 highway; 14, 19.  Prices as tested: $52,075; $29,085.  Best features: Powerful, efficient motor; more  manageable size.  Worst features: Nightmare side mirrors; needs technology  updates.  Target buyers: Person who needs a work truck with luxury  elements; the driver who needs a smaller, simpler and  less expensive truck.  (Jason H. Harper writes about autos for Muse, the arts and
