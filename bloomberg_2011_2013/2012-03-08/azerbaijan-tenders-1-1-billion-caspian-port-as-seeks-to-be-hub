Azerbaijan announced a $1.1 billion
tender to build a port as the energy-rich former Soviet republic
seeks to become a hub for trade between  Europe  and Central Asia,
with interest from companies from France, Holland and  Sri Lanka .  The port, designed by Netherlands-based Royal Haskoning BV,
will be built in the village of Alat, about 66 kilometers (40
miles) south of the capital of Baku, said Sadraddin Mammadov, a
Transport Ministry official overseeing the project.  The harbor would be the largest in the  Caspian Sea  and the
building of the first of three stages by May 2014 may cost $690
million, Mammadov said in an interview. Van Oord Dredging and
Marine Contractors BV started dredging at the site last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
