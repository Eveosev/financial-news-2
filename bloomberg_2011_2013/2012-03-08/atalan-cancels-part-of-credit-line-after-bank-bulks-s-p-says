Matalan, the U.K. budget clothing
retailer, canceled 20 million pounds ($32 million) of its  credit
line  after it failed to reach agreement with one of its lenders
to reset covenants, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  The company changed the terms on the remaining 30 million
pounds of the 50 million-pound revolving credit, S&P said in a
report yesterday. The Skelmersdale, England-based company’s
rating will not be affected.  S&P expected Matalan to breach covenants for the fourth
quarter ended Feb. 28.  Matalan’s liquidity position is “adequate” as it has 96
million pounds of cash and free operating cash flow of about 30
million pounds to 35 million pounds, said S&P, which rates
Matalan B.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc provided the 50 million-pound credit line last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
