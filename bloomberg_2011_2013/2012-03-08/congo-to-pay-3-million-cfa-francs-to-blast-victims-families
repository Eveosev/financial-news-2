Congo will pay 3 million CFA francs
($6,035) to families of victims of the March 4 explosion at an
arms depot in the capital, Brazzaville, that left at least 250
people dead, Planning Minister Pierre Moussa said.  More than 2,315 people were injured in the blast and 13,854
people were left homeless, Moussa said. The explosion occurred
when a short circuit set alight a cache of arms, some of which
were slated for destruction, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
