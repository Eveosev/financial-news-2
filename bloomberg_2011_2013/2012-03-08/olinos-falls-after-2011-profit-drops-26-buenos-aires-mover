Molinos Rio de La Plata  SA,
Argentina’s largest food company, declined the most in more than
three months after its 2011 profit fell 26 percent.  Molinos retreated 7.5 percent to 25.25 pesos at the close
in  Buenos Aires , the steepest decrease since Nov. 17. The
benchmark Merval index retreated 0.1 percent.  The company, controlled by the Perez Companc family,
reported today net income of 277 million pesos ($63.8 million)
in 2011, down from 376 million pesos the previous year,
according to data on the website of the Buenos Aires exchange.  “The fall can be attributed to the results as the rest of
the market is fairly calm,” Leonardo Chialva, a partner at
Buenos Aires-based financial adviser and asset management firm
Delphos Investment, said in an interview. “Molinos is also
quite illiquid,” which exacerbates moves, Chialva said.  Molinos shares have retreated 16 percent this year. The
Merval has gained 9 percent.  This year’s retreat is attributable in part to an expected
drop in the soybean harvest during the upcoming growing season,
according to Chialva. “News of lower soy crops give Molinos
much less negotiating leverage with local providers,” he said.  Argentina ’s soybean harvest may total 46.5 million metric
tons in the season that starts on April 1, less than the 49
million produced last year, a unit of the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said March 6. Crops have been affected by hot, dry
weather this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
