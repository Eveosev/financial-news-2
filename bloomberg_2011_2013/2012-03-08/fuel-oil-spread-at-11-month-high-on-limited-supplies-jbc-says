The  premium  of low-sulfur  fuel oil 
over its higher sulfur equivalent is at its highest level in 11
months because of limited supplies in northwest  Europe ,
according to JBC Energy GmbH.  “Despite the overall more bearish sentiment in fuel oil
markets amid quickly rising crude outright prices, low-sulfur
fuel oil remains supported from tight supplies and lower
refinery runs curbing supplies,”  David Wech , an analyst at
Vienna-based JBC Energy said in an e-mailed report today.
“Upbeat demand from  Japan  might also be a supporting factor.”  This lack of low-sulfur fuel oil supplies in Europe has
been contrasted by declining demand for high-sulfur after the
initial shortage of the product in Singapore at the start of the
year has eased, JBC said, without citing any  price levels .  Fuel oil barges with 1 percent sulfur in the Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded yesterday at $54.50 a metric ton more
than 3.5 percent barges, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the widest spread since July 6.  Rising crude prices have led to asphalt, a product made
from residues, jump to its highest level in Rotterdam since at
least September 2009, according to JBC Energy.  “Prices were supported by a string of factors including
the boost in the crude flat price in recent weeks as well as
refinery shutdowns on both sides of the Atlantic limiting
availability,” Wech said. “In Europe, Petroplus’s Ingolstadt
and Petit Couronne plants produced significant quantities of the
heavy product while supplies of suitable heavy-sour feedstock
also tightened following an embargo on the import of Syrian
Heavy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
