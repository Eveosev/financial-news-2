     March 8 (Bloomberg) -- Kofi Annan , the United Nations envoy
charged with helping to mediate the Syrian crisis, said armed
intervention in the country would only worsen the crisis.  The former UN secretary-general is slated to head to Syria
on March 10 for negotiations with President Bashar al-Assad’s
government. Annan, who will also represent the  Arab League , told
reporters after meeting with the group’s secretary general,
Nabil el-Arabi, in Cairo that he had full international support
for his mandate to broker a peaceful political settlement.  Annan deplored the violence in Syria, where the
government’s crackdown on protests in the past year has killed
more than 7,500 people according to UN estimates. He said the
situation “cannot continue” as is, and said he hoped “no one
was thinking seriously” of using force to solve the conflict.  Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said yesterday that the U.S.
is reviewing the possibility of “non-lethal” military action
in Syria.  John McCain , the top Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, called on March 5 for U.S.-led air strikes
to create safe havens for civilians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
