Iraq  will keep the prices that
farmers get for wheat and barley unchanged this year.  Wheat grade A is $620 a metric ton, grade B is $534 a ton
and grade C is $448 a ton, the agriculture ministry said in an
e-mailed statement. Barley, mainly used as fodder, will be $448
a ton, it said.  Iraq consumes about 4.5 million tons of wheat a year and
local production for the 2010-11 season was about 1.73 million
tons, Hassan Ismail Ibrahim, director general of Iraqâ€™s Grain
Board, said Nov. 29. The country plans to import 3 million tons
of wheat in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
