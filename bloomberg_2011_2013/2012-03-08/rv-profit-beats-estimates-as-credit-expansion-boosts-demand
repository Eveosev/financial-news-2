MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRV3) ,
 Brazil ’s fourth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, posted a larger-
than-expected fourth-quarter profit as increased availability of
credit boosted home sales.  Net income rose 38 percent to 209 million reais ($118.3
million) in the quarter, beating the  average estimate  for
adjusted net income of 199 million reais among seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Contracted sales increased 25 percent to
a record of 1.44 billion reais in the quarter, the Belo
Horizonte-based company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  MRV’s profit “surprised on the positive side due to a
combination of higher revenues, lower operating margins and a
lower  tax rate ,” Banco Itau BBA SA Analysts David Lawant,
Enrico Trotta and Vivian Salomon wrote in a note to clients.  The stock rose 2.1 percent to 15.13 reais at 12:20 p.m in
Sao Paulo, the highest intraday level since Feb. 17. MRV has
gained 42 percent this year, the  third-best performance  among
members of the BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index.  While  house prices  in  Latin America ’s biggest economy rose
3 percent to $3,344 per square meter on average between October
and December, according to economic research institute Fipe, MRV
was able to benefit from an increase in lending to lower-income
buyers by state-owned banks.  Caixa Economica Federal (CEFN3) , Brazil’s biggest mortgage
provider, improved its productivity and efficiency in lending,
while Banco do Brasil SA started offering loans through the
government’s housing plan Minha Casa Minha Vida, MRV said.  Sales target reached  MRV’s contracted sales rose 15 percent to 4.32 billion
reais in 2011, at the bottom of the company’s target of 4.3
billion reais to 4.7 billion reais. New projects totaled 41,825
units last year, an 11 percent decline, according to the filing.  The company expects contracted sales of 4.5 billion reais
to 5.5 billion reais in 2012, and margins on earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a measure of
profitability, to be between 24 percent and 28 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
