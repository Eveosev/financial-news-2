Argentina ’s corn crop estimate was
cut by the  Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange  after a drought parched
crops last year.  The world’s second largest exporter of the grain will
probably harvest 20.8 million metric tons, down from a previous
forecast of 21.3 million tons, the exchange said today in its
weekly e-mailed report. The new estimate came after the
inspection of damaged crops in the Pampas agricultural zone.  Droughts from Mexico to Argentina are shrinking corn
stockpiles to a five-year low, raising the prospect of a  bull
market  before U.S. farmers start reaping the biggest crop ever.  Rainy weather in February will extend into the rest of
March, stemming the damage caused to corn and soybean crops, the
exchange said. The estimate for this year’s soybean harvest was
maintained by the exchange at 46.2 million tons.  Argentina is the world’s second-largest corn exporter after
the U.S. and the third-largest soybean exporter behind the U.S.
and  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
