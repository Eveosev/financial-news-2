U.S. stocks rallied, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest two-day advance of the
year, as Greece moved closer to completing its debt swap.  Banks (S5BANKX)  had the biggest increase in the  S&P 500  among 24
groups. Wells Fargo & Co. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  rose at least
1.2 percent.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  added more than 1.8
percent to pace gains among the biggest companies.  Coach Inc. (COH) ,
the largest U.S. luxury handbag maker, climbed 4.6 percent after
saying its business continues to be “strong” in  China .
 McDonald’s (MCD)  Corp. lost 3.2 percent as  sales  trailed estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,365.91 at 4 p.m. New York
time, adding 1.7 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 70.61 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,907.94. The
Russell 2000 Index of small companies gained 1.3 percent to
806.34. About  6.1 billion  shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges
today, or 8.8 percent below the three-month average.  “ Greece  has no choice and the bondholders have no
choice,” said Stanley Nabi, New York-based vice chairman of
Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which oversees $10.5
billion. “They’re both in the mud. The swap will go through.
That will cause a moderate sigh of relief in the market. How
long it will extend? That’s the big question mark.”  Stocks gained as Greece’s government got about 85 percent
of bondholders to tender their holdings of the country’s debt
for new securities in the biggest restructuring in history. A
final result will be released tomorrow at 8 a.m. in Athens, a
government official said. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. Athens time.  Turn the Tide  With Greece again the focus of the euro-area debt crisis
now in its third year, the goal of the exchange is to reduce the
206 billion euros of privately held Greek debt by 53.5 percent.
Together with a 130 billion-euro second Greek aid package, the
writedown is a key element in European leaders’ efforts to turn
the tide against the crisis.  “They’ve bought themselves some time,” Alan Brown, the
London-based group chief investment officer at Schroders Plc,
said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $283.9 billion.
“Reducing Greek debt is all well and good, but it doesn’t do
anything to restore Greece’s competitiveness. This problem is
likely to resurface and the question is when.”  Today’s rally in stocks extended the S&P 500’s gain in 2012
to  8.6 percent . The index has risen amid better-than-estimated
economic data and expectations  Europe  would tame its debt
crisis. Technology and financial shares had the biggest gains
among 10 groups this year, adding at least 13 percent.  Banks Rally  The KBW Bank Index advanced 1.4 percent today as 21 of its
24 stocks climbed.  Wells Fargo (WFC)  climbed 3.3 percent to $31.40.
JPMorgan increased 1.2 percent to $40.44.  Investors also watched economic data as the number of
Americans filing claims for  jobless benefits  rose to 362,000
last week, a level consistent with an improving labor market.
The Labor Department will report monthly jobs data tomorrow,
which economists forecast will show an increase of 225,000
private jobs and total non-farm payrolls growth of 210,000.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth added 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average rallied 1.4 percent. A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P
indexes increased 3.6 percent. Commodity and industrial shares
had the biggest gains in the S&P 500 among 10 groups. Alcoa, the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, rallied 2.3 percent to $9.77.
Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction and
mining-equipment, rose 1.9 percent to $110.28.  Coach, Monster  Coach advanced 4.6 percent to $76.79. Analysts’  estimates 
are likely to increase because of a boost in revenue and gross
margins, Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said.  Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  surged 3.4 percent to $8.61. The
online recruiting service that has lost almost 90 percent of its
value is poised to extract a record takeover premium for
investors. Chief Executive Officer Salvatore Iannuzzi said last
week he is weighing options to boost the company’s shares after
Monster traded as low as 0.67 times the value of its net assets.
competitor, said Matrix Asset Advisors Inc.  “It should wrest a high premium,” said David Katz, chief
investment officer at New York-based Matrix Asset Advisors Inc.,
which oversees about $935 million and owned Monster shares as of
February. Acquirers would still be “getting it at a steal.”  McDonald’s lost 3.2 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$96.96. The restaurant chain said sales at stores open at least
13 months rose 7.5 percent worldwide last month, trailing
analysts’ estimates for the first time since August, as
consumers cut spending in Europe.  AIG Slumps  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  slumped 3.9 percent to
$28.31. The U.S. Treasury Department is selling $6 billion in
shares of AIG, the insurer rescued in 2008 after it suffered
losses tied to wrong-way bets on the mortgage market.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  slid 1.2 percent to $84.83. The company
expects its natural-gas and  oil production  to drop 3 percent in
2012. Exxon’s forecast is based on an average price of $111 a
barrel for Brent crude, it said in a slide presentation at an
investor meeting today.  Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)  tumbled 7 percent to $10.12. The shares had
the biggest decline in the Russell 1000 Index. The maker of the
prostate cancer drug Provenge slumped after Johnson & Johnson
said its rival product, Zytiga, performed better than a placebo
in a trial.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  gained 2.1 percent to $541.99. The shares closed
almost unchanged yesterday after the company unveiled a new
version of its iPad tablet computer. Apple took over from Wells
Fargo as the stock most often in the top 10 holdings of the 50
largest mutual funds in the fourth quarter, and widened its lead
among the biggest  hedge funds , Citigroup Inc. said.  Top 10  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, was a top-10 holding
for 18 of the 50 largest U.S. mutual funds in the period,  Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup’s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a
note yesterday. Wells Fargo, based in  San Francisco , and
Microsoft Corp. are in the top 10 holdings of 17 of the mutual
funds. Apple gained 6.2 percent in the quarter, while the S&P
500 rallied 11 percent. Wells Fargo rose 14 percent and
Microsoft added 4.3 percent.  “The 30 most held stocks for hedge funds shifted more
heavily” to technology, Levkovich said in the report. “Apple
remains the most-held stock for both growth and value hedge
funds as well as for growth mutual funds while Wells Fargo
remains the most owned for value oriented mutual funds.”  The decreasing number of industry groups in “uptrends”
may foreshadow a retreat by the U.S. stock market, according to
Craig W. Johnson, a technical market strategist at Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis.  Trending Higher  The amount of industries trending higher increased from
October through last month to about 95 percent before slipping
last week, Johnson said, citing an indicator watched by analysts
who use charts to predict market direction. He said the high
proportion signaled the market was due for a retreat.  “This  advance  is getting tired,” Johnson said in a phone
interview yesterday. “As the market gets to higher and higher
levels, you start to see less and less participation,” he said.
“100 percent of the stocks up, 100 percent of the groups up”
all the time isn’t possible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
