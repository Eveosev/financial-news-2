The number of Americans filing
claims for  jobless benefits  rose to 362,000 last week, a level
consistent with an improving labor market.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments increased
by 8,000 in the week ended March 3, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast 352,000 claims, according to
the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey. The average over
the past four weeks held close to a four-year low.  The rate of firings indicates companies have grown more
comfortable with headcounts and could take on additional
employees when demand picks up. Economists forecast a Labor
Department report tomorrow will show that employers boosted
payrolls in February and the  jobless rate  held at an almost
three-year low.  “The level of claims is still quite low,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “I’m
still encouraged by what we’ve seen in the labor market in
recent months.”  Stocks rose as more investors indicated they will
participate in  Greece ’s debt swap. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index climbed 0.6 percent to 1,361.22 at 10:58 a.m. in  New York .  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 345,000 to
370,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 52 economists. The Labor
Department revised the prior week’s applications to 354,000 from
the initially reported 351,000.  Nothing Unusual  A Labor Department official today said there were no
unusual circumstances affecting today’s figures.  The four-week  moving average , a less-volatile measure, was
little changed at 355,000 from 354,750, which were the fewest
since March 2008.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
rose by 10,000 in the week ended Feb. 25 to 3.42 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
26,800 to 3.4 million in the week ended Feb. 18.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
held at 2.7 percent in the week ended Feb. 25, today’s report
showed. Twelve states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 41 had a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  More Employment  Job creation  has strengthened in recent months. The
projected 210,000 increase in February payrolls would cap the
best six-month stretch of job growth since the period ended June
2006, more than a year before the recession began. Employers
took on an estimated 1.13 million workers from September through
February.  Data from a private report based on payrolls showed
companies added more workers in February than a month earlier.
Employment increased by 216,000 last month after a 173,000 gain
in January, according to figures from ADP Employer Services
released yesterday.  Improving job prospects will help absorb those who are
still losing jobs.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the
world’s largest computer-services provider, fired more than
1,000 workers in  North America  last week, according to employee
advocacy group Alliance@IBM.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said “the job
market remains far from normal” when he spoke at a U.S. House
hearing in  Washington  last week. The 8.3 percent unemployment
rate and a subdued inflation outlook warrant a highly
accommodative stance for monetary policy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
