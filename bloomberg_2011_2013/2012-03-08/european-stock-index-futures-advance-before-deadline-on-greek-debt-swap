European stocks  rallied the most in
a month as the deadline on  Greece ’s debt swap approached and
Germany’s industrial output increased more than forecast.  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. climbed to a five-
year high after doubling its dividend and predicting earnings
will climb. BNP Paribas SA jumped 3.7 percent as Simon Property
Group Inc. agreed to buy some of the French bank’s stake in
Klepierre SA.  Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s largest energy company, sank 5.7
percent after cutting its dividend.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  advanced 1.6 percent to 264.16
at the close in  London , the biggest increase since Feb. 3. The
gauge rose 0.6 percent yesterday after a private report showed
hiring in U.S. companies accelerated last month. The measure has
surged 8 percent this year as the  European Central Bank  lent the
region’s lenders more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) for
three years to ease liquidity.  “Investors will be able to draw a line under Greece that
has been going on for too long,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief
strategist at Brewing Dolphin Securities Ltd. in London. “In
the U.S., economic news flow has been very encouraging. The
overall trend of employment has been positive.”  Data today showed the number of Americans filing claims for
jobless benefits rose to 362,000 last week. The U.S. Labor
Department will release its monthly payrolls figures tomorrow.  National benchmark indexes rose in all of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  gained 1.2 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX both rallied 2.5 percent.  Volume Climbs  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, declined 11
percent, the largest loss in three months. The number of shares
changing hands on the Euro Stoxx 50 was 32 percent greater than
the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors with at least 60 percent of the Greek bonds
eligible for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated
they’ll participate, moving the country closer to sealing the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history. The offer, which
ends at 10 p.m. Athens time today, aims to reduce the 206
billion euros of privately held Greek debt by 53.5 percent.  In  Germany ,  industrial output  increased more than
economists forecast in January as construction activity jumped.
Production rose 1.6 percent from December, when it fell 2.6
percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists
forecast a January increase of 1.1 percent.  EADS Gains  EADS surged 11 percent to 29.74 euros, the highest price
since May 2006. The maker of Airbus passenger jets agreed to pay
a  dividend  of 45 cents a share, more than doubling the payout
from last year and exceeding analyst estimates for a 30-cent
dividend. Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items
will increase to more than 2.5 billion euros in 2012, from 1.8
billion euros last year, EADS said.  BNP Paribas jumped 3.7 percent to 37 euros after Simon
Property Group, the biggest U.S. mall owner, agreed to buy 28.7
percent of Klepierre for 28 euros a share in a deal valued at
1.52 billion euros. The sale will reduce BNP Paribas’s stake in
Klepierre to 22 percent. Shares of Klepierre surged 8.4 percent
to 25.35 euros.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  added 1.6 percent to 356.8 pence as the U.K.’s
second-biggest insurer by market value reported operating profit
of 2.5 billion pounds ($4 billion), topping the 2.45 billion-
pound median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Scania, Volvo  Scania AB (SCVB)  and  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  rose 6.9 percent to 135.50 kronor
and 4.7 percent to 96.15 kronor, respectively, after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. named the Swedish truckmakers among its top picks.  Gemalto NV (GTO)  jumped 8.8 percent to 46.98 euros as the
inventor of the smart chip used in bank and phone cards forecast
revenue and operating profit will increase this year.  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  advanced 5.7 percent to 13.65 euros.
 Europe ’s largest postal service said  profit  in 2012 will rise as
much as 6.6 percent as growth in global trade helps the
company’s DHL express and freight business.  Enel retreated 5.7 percent to 2.87 euros after the utility
cut its dividend payout by a third to 40 percent of ordinary net
income as it seeks to raise funds to cut debt.  Annual net income fell to 4.15 billion euros from 4.4
billion euros a year earlier, hurt by a windfall-profit tax
imposed in  Italy , the company said. That missed the 4.3 billion-
euro average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
