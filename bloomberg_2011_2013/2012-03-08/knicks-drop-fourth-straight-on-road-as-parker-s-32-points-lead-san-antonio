Tony Parker  had 32 points and the
 San Antonio  Spurs defeated the Knicks 118-105, handing New York
its fourth straight road loss.  The Spurs ended the first half with a 22-6 run to take a
58-41 lead entering the third period, and never let the Knicks
get closer than 11 points in the second half.  Parker shot 12-for-19 and had six assists in his point-
guard matchup with New York’s Jeremy Lin, who had 20 points on
7-for-15 shooting and four assists in the game at the AT&T
Center.  San Antonio (26-12) improved its home record to 15-3 this
National Basketball Association season. Carmelo Anthony had 27
points for New York (18-21), which has lost six of its past nine
games after going on a seven-game winning streak with Lin as its
new point guard.  Center  Tyson Chandler  missed the game for the Knicks with a
strained left hamstring and said he may return tomorrow night in
Milwaukee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
