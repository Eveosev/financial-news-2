New York  Giants quarterback Eli Manning restructured his contract for this season to help the
team try to get under the National Football League’s salary cap,
the Star-Ledger of  Newark ,  New Jersey , reported.  The Giants were $8 million over the payroll limit and need
to get under the ceiling by the start of the new league year on
March 13 by releasing players or restructuring a big contract,
the newspaper said, citing NFL players’ union records. The
Giants cleared $6.75 million in salary cap space for the 2012
season by reworking Manning’s deal, the Star-Ledger said.  Manning’s new base salary for the 2012 season is $1.75
million, according to the NFL Players Association’s website. He
had been set to make $10.75 million, though the Giants have now
guaranteed $9 million of that, allowing them to spread the cap
hit over the final four years of his deal, the Star-Ledger said.
Manning receives the guaranteed money immediately.  Manning, 31, won his second Super Bowl title with the
Giants last season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of New
York’s 21-17 championship win over the  New England Patriots  last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
