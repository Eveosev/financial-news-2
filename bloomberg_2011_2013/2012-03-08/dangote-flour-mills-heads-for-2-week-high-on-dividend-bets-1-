Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, reached its highest level in two weeks amid
speculation the company will pay a full-year dividend.  The stock rose for a second day, up 5 percent to 4.43
naira, the most since Feb. 23. The shares increased 5 percent
yesterday.  “We are expecting that the company will pay a dividend but
may not give bonus shares because of its high issued shares,”
Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila
Finance, a brokerage, said by phone today.  The company has 5 billion shares outstanding, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Dangote expects profit to increase
78 percent during the fourth quarter of its 2011 fiscal year, it
said in a statement on Jan. 5. Net income will be 4.84 billion
naira ($31 million) for the three months through December, up
from 2.72 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based company
said.  Dangote reported a 51 percent drop in profit for its 2010
financial year. Its shares have fallen 11 percent this year,
compared with a 2.2 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
