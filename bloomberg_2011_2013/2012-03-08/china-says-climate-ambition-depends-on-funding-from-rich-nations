China  said developing nations could
take more action on  climate change  only when they get more 
money and technology from rich countries, which need to 
recognize their past responsibility for greenhouse-gas output.  “Social and economic development and poverty eradication
are first and overriding priorities of developing-country
parties,” China said in a filing  published today  on the website 
of the United Nations climate unit. Whether they can “enhance 
their actions both on mitigation and adaptation depends on the 
enhanced finance and technology supports by developed-country 
parties.”  There's a risk that developed nations may be “double
counting” when they use carbon markets to help reduce the cost 
of greenhouse-gas cuts, China said. That’s because wealthy 
nations may argue that buying emission credits fulfills their 
financial and technology transfer commitments as well as 
offsetting emissions, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
