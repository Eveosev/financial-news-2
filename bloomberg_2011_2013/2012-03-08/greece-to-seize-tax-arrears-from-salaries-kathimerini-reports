Greek tax authorities will be able
to directly seize a portion of salaries and pensions from people
owing more than 5,000 euros ($6,612) in unpaid taxes,
 Kathimerini  reported, citing a finance ministry circular.  The measure will apply to salaries and pensions that are
bigger than 1,000 euros per month, the Athens-based newspaper
said. The tax authorities will also be able to seize funds from
bank deposits of those with tax arrears, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
