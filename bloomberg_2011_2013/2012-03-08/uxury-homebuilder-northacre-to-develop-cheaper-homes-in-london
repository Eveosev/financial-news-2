     March 8 (Bloomberg) --  Northacre Plc (NTA) , developer of The
Lancasters luxury apartments opposite London’s Hyde Park, plans
to build less-expensive homes to increase returns on projects,
the company’s finance director said.  The homes will be priced at 1,000 pounds ($1,580) to 2,000
pounds a square foot in neighborhoods such as Fitzrovia,
Marylebone and Bloomsbury, close to costlier areas like
Knightsbridge and Mayfair, Ken MacRae said in an interview
today. That compares with 3,000 pounds or more in The
Lancasters.  “It won’t be a traditional prime Northacre development,”
MacRae said in Cannes,  France . “These are areas on the fringes
of prime central London that are undervalued. We can deliver a
better product than what’s out there at the moment.”  The Lancasters drove a surge in Northacre’s share price in
2010 and sales triggered a 50-50 profit split on the project
between the company and venture partner Minerva Plc. The
apartments in the 192,000-square-foot (17,800-square meter)
former hotel were priced from 900,000 pounds to 16.5 million
pounds.  Northacre is seeking to buy office buildings and convert
them into “mid-market” homes, MacRae said. The projects will
be sold under a different brand from Northacre, he said.  “A lot of offices are being marketed as residential and
we’re interested in that,” he said. “We want to introduce a sub-
brand of Northacre.”  Overseas investors have turned to  London ’s residential
real estate to preserve wealth as they face political and
economic uncertainty in their home markets. The value of houses
and apartments costing an average of 3.7 million pounds rose 0.7
percent from January and are now 8.9 percent higher than the
market’s previous peak in March 2008, according to property
broker Knight Frank LLP.  About 66 of the units at the Lancaster have been sold,
according to Claire March, the company’s sales and marketing
director. Northacre will acquire no more than two new
development sites within the next nine months, she said.
