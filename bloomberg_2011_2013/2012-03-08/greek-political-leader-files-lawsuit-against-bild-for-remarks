Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Greek
political party Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, filed
a lawsuit in  Greece  seeking 1 million euros ($1.3 million) from
the German newspaper Bild for what he called slanderous remarks
about him and his party.  In the suit, Tsipras said the German newspaper published
“libelous and highly offensive” material, according to a
 statement  on the party’s website.  Syriza, which holds nine seats in the 300-seat Greek
parliament and voted against the country’s austerity measures,
claims that Bild is seeking to “criminalize and demonize” the
party, according to the statement. Bild has claimed that Tsipras
supported violent anarchists who set dozens of buildings on fire
during anti-austerity protests on Feb. 12, Syriza said in the
statement.  Tobias Froehlich, a spokesman for  Axel Springer AG (SPR) , Bild-
Zeitung’s publisher, said the newspaper hasn’t yet received any
suit and thus cannot comment.  The lawsuit was first reported in Kathimerini newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
