Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s biggest energy
company, cut its dividend payout by a third to 40 percent of
ordinary net income as it seeks to raise funds to cut debt, 
with recessions in its biggest markets weighing on revenue.  Net income  fell to 4.15 billion euros ($5.47 billion) from 
4.4 billion euros a year earlier, hurt by a windfall-profit tax 
imposed in Italy, the company said today in a statement. That 
missed the 4.3 billion-euro average  estimate  of 17 analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Enel has lost 28 percent in Milan trading in the past year
as higher fuel costs and lower demand eroded profit. The Rome-
based company,  Europe ’s most-indebted power utility, scrapped a
2012 interim dividend on Jan. 31 as it focused on refinancing
borrowings. Net financial debt was 44.6 billion euros at the end
of 2011, compared with 44.9 billion euros a year earlier.  “The weakened economic environment in the mature economies
in which we operate is expected to persist, at least during the
first part of 2012,” Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said
in the statement. “Although this shows signs of recovery from
2013 onwards.”  Enel proposed a dividend of 26 euro cents for 2011, of 
which 10 cents was paid as an interim dividend in November.  The company will probably announce cost-cutting measures 
and capital-spending cuts at its 2012-2016 strategy presentation 
in  Rome  today, Javier Garrido and Sarah Laitung, analysts at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to investors on Feb. 16.  Enel posted preliminary 2011 results on Jan. 31, including
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
17.7 billion euros and sales of 79.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
