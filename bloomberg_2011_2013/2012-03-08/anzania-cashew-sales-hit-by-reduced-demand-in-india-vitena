Tanzania failed to sell about 80,000
metric tons of cashew nuts this season because of reduced global
demand, the Cashewnut Board of Tanzania said.  Total output for the season, which runs from September to
April, is about 160,000 tons, Ayub Mbawa, acting director-
general of the board, said in a phone interview today from  Dar
es Salaam , the commercial capital.  “The demand among processors in countries like India and
Vietnam, where our cashew nuts are exported, has not been very
good,” Mbawa said. “Our immediate concern is for the farmers to
get paid, because they already sold the crop to cooperatives,
but some have received part payment,” Mbawa said.  Tanzania is Africa’s largest cashew-nut grower after
Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, and is the world’s
ninth-biggest producer, according to the  United Nations ’ Food
and Agricultural Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
