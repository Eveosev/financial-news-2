The  U.S. Senate  failed to adopt a
Democratic amendment that would have banned export of products
derived from crude oil transported from Canada using the
Keystone XL pipeline.  The amendment, proposed by Senator  Ron Wyden , an Oregon
Democrat, also would have required approval or denial of the
pipeline 90 days after all environmental analyses are completed.
The Senate voted 34-64, with 60 votes needed for adoption.  The amendment was offered during debate on a transportation
spending measure. The Senate may vote on the full measure early
next week.  The Senate is considering a separate Republican amendment
that would approve the pipeline route.  To contact the reporter on this story:
