Gemalto NV (GTO) , inventor of the smart
chip used in bank and phone cards, rose the most in more than 16
months after forecasting higher revenue and operating profit as
more consumers use mobile payment services.  The  shares rose  as much as 8.3 percent to 46.79 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since October 2010 and highest price since
the company’s 2004 stock sale. They were up 5.9 percent at 45.76
euros as of 11:23 a.m. in Paris.  “We’re seeing a positive impact as Gemalto starts
deploying mobile payment and 4G with carriers,” said Sebastien Sztabowicz, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. “This is
exactly what the market wanted to see.”  The Amsterdam-based company, whose clients include phone
companies and banks, expects its margins will continue to
benefit from the shift to new security technology, Chief
Executive Officer Olivier Piou said. Gemalto has been refocusing
business from older commoditized smart chips to new applications
like contactless payment and machine-to-machine transmissions.  Net income slipped 3.6 percent to 161.4 million euros
($212.6 million) last year. Sales rose 5.8 percent to 2 billion
euros. Analysts had expected profit of 164 million euros and
sales of 2 billion euros, according to the average  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit from operations in the mobile segment rose 15
percent to 137.8 million euros.  Sales Forecast  Gemalto expects 2012 revenue growth to be similar to the 8
percent to 12 percent growth the company has had since 2010,
excluding currency shifts, Piou said.  Gemalto reiterated its target of 300 million euros in
operating profit in 2013, compared with 238.6 million euros in
2011 excluding assets the company is holding for sale.  “We’re confident we’ll see growth in all of our units in
2012,”  Piou said today in a conference call. “We’re exactly
where we wanted to be, at  the cross-roads between software,
high-tech and telecoms.”  Gemalto last week unveiled a contactless payment SIM-card
tested by  Mastercard Inc. (MA) ,  Visa Inc. (V)  and  American Express Co. (AXP)  at
the  Mobile World Congress  in Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
