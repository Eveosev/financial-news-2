Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  snapping a three-day losing streak, after U.S.
employers increased hiring and more investors joined a Greek
debt swap, boosting demand for riskier assets.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., gained 2.2 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong
Kong-based clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market,
climbed 5.6 percent.  Cheung Kong Infrastructure (1038)  Holdings Ltd.,
the utilities owner controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing,
climbed 3 percent after posting higher profit.  “Greece is going to be OK for now,” Marino Valensise, who
oversees about $67 billion as chief investment officer at Baring
Asset Management Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television. “We have
space for a rally. Any retreat will be bought as there’s still a
lot of people who are underweight on risk.”  The  Hang Seng  Index advanced 1.3 percent to 20,900.73 as of
the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong. Volumes on the benchmark index
fell to 1.6 billion shares, 10 percent less than 30-day moving
average, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The gauge advanced
the past three months, its longest such winning streak in two
years, as  China  cut bank reserve ratios and amid signs the U.S.
economy is improving.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies, also known as the H-share Index, gained 1.8 percent
to 11,168.50.  Options protecting against losses on the gauge cost the
most since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. when
compared with contracts on U.S. stocks. The difference, or skew,
shows investors are increasingly bearish on the shares after the
index surged as much as 46 percent since October and China this
week cut its target for economic growth.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.3
percent today. The gauge advanced 0.7 percent in New York
yesterday after ADP Employer Services reported U.S. companies
added 216,000 workers in February. The report came two days
before the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs data.  Li & Fung rose 2.2 percent to HK$17.42.  Man Wah Holdings
Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker that gets about half its sales from the U.S.,
rose 5.1 percent to HK$5.99.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a power-
tool maker that counts  North America  as its largest market,
advanced 2.5 percent to HK$9.51.  Optimism about Greece’s debt swap helped drive stocks
higher. Investors with at least 58 percent of the Greek bonds
eligible for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated
they’ll participate, putting the country on the verge of the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history.  Esprit gained 5.6 percent to HK$18.24, while  China
Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , a shipmaker that
gets about a third of its revenue from Greece and Germany,
increased 1.2 percent to HK$2.53.  Power Assets  The Hang Seng Index has risen 13 percent this year. The
rally boosted the price of shares on the gauge to 10.6 times
estimated earnings. That compares with 13 times for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 10.8 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Cheung Kong Infrastructure climbed 3 percent to HK$46.90
after reporting profit increased 54 percent last year. Power
Assets Holdings Ltd., a unit of the utilities operator, rose 2.3
percent to HK$58.75 after posting net income that beat
estimates.  Futures on the Hang Seng expiring this month added 1.3
percent to 20,837. The HSI Volatility Index dropped 6 percent to
22.54, indicating options traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent
in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
