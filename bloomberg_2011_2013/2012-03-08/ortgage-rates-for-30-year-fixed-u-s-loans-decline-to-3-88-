U.S.  mortgage rates  for 30-year
loans fell to 3.88 percent, lowering borrowing costs as the
economy and demand for housing strengthen.  The average rate for a  30-year (NMCMFUS)  fixed loan declined in the
week ended today from 3.9 percent,  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a
statement. The rate was 3.87 percent last month, the lowest in
Freddie Mac records dating to 1971. The average  15-year (NMCM15US)  rate
decreased to 3.13 percent from 3.17 percent, according to the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company.  The housing market is getting a boost from low borrowing
costs and improving job numbers. Companies added 216,000 workers
to payrolls in February, up from a gain of 173,000 a month
earlier, ADP Employer Services said yesterday.  Hovnanian
Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , New Jersey’s largest builder, beat analysts’
estimates yesterday, when it reported a narrower quarterly loss
and said that February orders were up 38 percent from a year
earlier.  “The healing of the housing market will be a long and
gradual process, but it does at least appear to be under way,”
 Paul Dales  and  Paul Diggle , analysts at Capital Economics in
London, wrote in a March 6 note to clients. “Home sales and
homebuilding will continue to edge higher, while later this year
prices will finally stop falling.”  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of previously owned homes rose 4.3 percent in January
from the previous month, the National Association of Realtors
reported Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
