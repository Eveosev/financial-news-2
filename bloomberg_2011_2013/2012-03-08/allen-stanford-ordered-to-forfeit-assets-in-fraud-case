R. Allen Stanford, who was convicted
of running a $7 billion investment fraud, must forfeit assets
seized by the U.S. government, a federal jury in Houston said,
finding that the money constituted proceeds of the scheme.  The exact amount of the forfeiture wasnâ€™t immediately
available. U.S. prosecutors had sought $330 million from the
seized accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
