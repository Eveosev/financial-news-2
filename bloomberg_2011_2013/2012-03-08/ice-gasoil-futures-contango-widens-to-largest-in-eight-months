The contango, or discount of March
gasoil futures to April, widened today to the most in more than
eight months on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  March gasoil traded at $1,022 a metric ton, or $4.25 less
than April at $1,026.25 a ton as of 11:49 a.m. in London. That
matches the largest spread since June 24, excluding expiry day
anomalies.  A market in contango signals excess supply or declining
demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
