Cuba will not participate in the
Summit of the Americas scheduled for next month, Colombian
President Juan Manuel Santos said today after meeting with his
Cuban counterpart  Raul Castro .  Santos, who also met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
today in  Havana , said that other countries in the hemisphere had
not reached a consensus on whether Cuba should be invited to
attend the summit in Cartagena,  Colombia , according to a
statement on the South American nation’s  presidential website .  “I told President Castro that we appreciate his desire to
participate in this meeting, but it’s hard to extend an
invitation because of the circumstances that did not allow us to
reach a consensus,” Santos said, according to the presidential
website.  Countries aligned with Chavez last month threatened to
boycott the U.S.-backed summit, which President Barack Obama is
scheduled to attend, unless Cuba is invited.  To contact the reporter on this story:
