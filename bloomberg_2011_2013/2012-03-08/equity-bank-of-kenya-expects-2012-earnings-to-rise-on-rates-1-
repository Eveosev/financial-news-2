Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s second-
biggest lender, expects to boost earnings this year after
raising lending rates and as bad debts decline, Managing
Director James Mwangi said.  “We have regained our margin” after increasing the
maximum interest rate on loans to 25 percent in November, Mwangi
said in an interview today in the capital of Nairobi. “We have
created a culture of repaying loans and convinced our customers
of a small increase in payments.” Non-performing loans last
year fell 10 percent to 3.3 billion shillings ($39.8 million).  Kenyan banks began increasing interest rates on loans to as
much as 35 percent last year as the central bank tightened
monetary policy to combat rising inflation and stem depreciation
in the shilling after it fell to a record low against the
dollar, Mwangi said.  Higher income from loans has helped lenders remain
resilient even as economic growth slowed, the Nairobi bourse
plummeted 30 percent and inflation accelerated to 19.7 percent
in November, double the government’s target. The economic
outlook should improve this year, Renaldo D’Souza, a research
analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd. in Nairobi, said by phone
today.  Economic Recovery  “Banks should perform better this coming year with
inflation coming down and  interest rates  expected to come down -
- those are the key determinants to the performance of banks,”
D’Souza said. “Economic growth may also increase.”  The government expects economic expansion of 5.3 percent
this year, up from an estimated 4.5 percent in 2011, while
inflation is projected to slow to below 10 percent by early next
year from 16.7 percent in February.  Equity Bank’s 2011 profit surged 44 percent to 10.3 billion
shillings as it increased lending, especially to small and
medium-size businesses, Mwangi said. Net interest income climbed
to 19.3 billion shillings from 13.8 billion shillings.  The lender’s branch network rose 14 percent to 186 in the
five countries where Equity Bank has operations, including
 Uganda ,  Rwanda ,  Tanzania  and  South Sudan , while the number of
customers surged 24 percent to 7.2 million, Mwangi said.  Equity Bank fell 1.3 percent to 19.35 shillings at 11:34
