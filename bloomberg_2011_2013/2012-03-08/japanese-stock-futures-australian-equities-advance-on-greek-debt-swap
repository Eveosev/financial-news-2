Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose as  Greece  moved closer to the biggest
sovereign-debt restructuring in history.  American depositary receipts of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc.,  Japan ’s No. 2 publicly traded bank, gained 1.7
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Canon Inc., a
camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its
sales, rose 0.9 percent after the euro strengthened against the
yen, boosting the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters. BHP
Billiton Ltd., Australia’s top oil producer and the No. 1 global
mining company by market value, rose 1.2 percent in Sydney after
oil and metals prices advanced.  “It looks like the negotiations on the Greek debt-swap are
going to pass without any big storm,” said Juichi Wako, a
senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “Shares
may be bought as Greece is moving nearer to restructuring its
debts. Many investors were waiting for a buy chance.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in

percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose 1 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Greece’s government got about 85 percent of bondholders to
tender their holdings of the country’s debt for new securities.  ‘No Choice’  “Greece has no choice and the bondholders have no
choice,” said Stanley Nabi, New York-based vice chairman of
Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which oversees $10.5
billion. “They’re both in the mud. The swap will go through.”  A final result will be released tomorrow at 8 a.m. in
 Athens , a government official said. Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. Athens time.  The 17-nation euro currency rose after the  European Central
Bank  kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged and President
 Mario Draghi  said recent surveys showed signs of economic
stabilization. The yen fell against all of its major
counterparts.  The yen depreciated to as low as 108.46 against the euro
today in  Tokyo , compared with 107.18 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened
to 81.73 last night from 81.34. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  U.S. Jobs  In the U.S., investors also watched economic data as the
number of Americans filing claims for  jobless benefits  rose to
362,000 last week, a level consistent with an improving labor
market. The Labor Department will release its monthly jobs
report on March 9, which economists forecast will show an
increase of 225,000 private jobs and total non-farm payrolls
growth of 210,000.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle at

Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S climbed 2.1 percent to 103.36 in New York
yesterday as speculation that slowing inflation will spur
Chinese policy makers to take further steps to bolster growth
lured investors to the lowest share prices in a month.  China may report today that consumer-price growth slowed to
the least in 19 months and that industrial production dropped to
a two-year low, according to economist surveys conducted by
Bloomberg. The nation this week reduced its economic growth
target for 2012 to the lowest level since 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
