Viggo Thorisson, the former managing
director of Iceland’s failed VSP Securities hf, was sentenced to
two years in prison by Reykjanes District Court for attempting
to defraud investors and the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  Thorisson was  convicted  for forging VSP documents to show
that a U.S. company, Napis Inc., owned assets of $700 million
that were used as collateral for debt Napis was issuing on the
 Channel Islands Stock Exchange . Thorisson owned 25 percent of
Napis’ shares.  The attempt was uncovered by managers at VSP in April 2007,
who reported it to the local police. VSP failed in May the
following year.  “It appears to be obvious that the defendant used
deception” for financial gain for himself and Napis, according
to the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
