Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell to a
one-week low a day after the Energy Department said stockpiles
swelled to a record.  Prices slipped after a government report showed  inventories 
reached a record 22.1 million barrels even as margins for
producing the fuel are negative, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We saw heavy producer selling,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative
energy broker. “There’s definitely a lot of ethanol for sale.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 0.2 cent to
$2.246 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest
settlement price since Feb. 27. Prices have gained 2 percent
this year and dropped 12 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.29 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive increased
3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.40, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.305 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 0.5 cents to
$2.25.  Distillers are losing 6 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
