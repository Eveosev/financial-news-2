New Jersey ’s revenue collections
jumped 20 percent last month, narrowing the state’s shortfall
from budget projections.  February revenue was 9.5 percent above forecasts, Treasurer
Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a statement today. For the first
eight months of this fiscal year, collections were up 4.3
percent from the same period of 2011, and are running 1.7
percent below projections.  “As we anticipated, New Jersey’s ongoing economic recovery
is beginning to strengthen our revenue,” Sidamon-Eristoff said
in the statement. “Our expectation is that this strengthening
will continue through the end of the current fiscal year and
fiscal 2013.”  Governor  Chris Christie ’s $32.1 billion budget for the
fiscal year that begins July 1 counts on  tax revenue  increasing
7.3 percent, the most since before the recession began in
December 2007. Revenue through the first half of this fiscal
year was 3.2 percent, or $326 million, below targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
