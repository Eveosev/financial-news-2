Airbus SAS’s (EAD)  capacity to increase
A330 production to 11 aircraft a month by 2014 from 9 is hostage
to  China , which may forego deliveries to protest Europe’s plan
to tax carbon emissions, the head of the parent company said.  China has 35 A330s scheduled for delivery over the next few
years, including 25 for which Airbus is already building parts,
and the country may refuse to accept the planes to punish the
European Union for taxing emissions, European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said
today in a briefing.  China is among 27 countries that have said they will
consider retaliatory steps following the European Union’s
extension of its carbon market to aviation. The EU decided in
2008 that aviation should become part of its cap-and-trade
carbon program after airline discharges in Europe doubled over
two decades.  “We would like to see a solution on a global level,’
Gallois told journalists today. “We don’t think that a solution
unique to Europe is appropriate.”  China is also threatening to block delivery of 10 A380
superjumbos that are on order with Hong Kong Airlines, Gallois
said today.  European levies on  carbon emissions  from airplanes will
cost Chinese airlines 800 million yuan ($127 million) this year,
 Li Jiaxiang , the head of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China, told reporters March 5 in Beijing.  Chinese carriers with planes scheduled for delivery
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
