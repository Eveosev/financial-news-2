Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s largest custody bank, had the  credit rating  cut on its
long-term debt by Moody’s Investor’s Service, which cited
falling profit margins in the bank’s main business.  Moody’s downgraded the senior long-term debt of the New
York-based company to Aa3 from Aa2 and did the same for the
firm’s subsidiaries. The lead bank, The Bank of  New York  Mellon,
was downgraded to B from B+ for financial strength and to Aa1
from Aaa for deposits, Moody’s said in a statement.  Moody’s attributed the downgrade to the heightened risk in
the financial industry in general and to eroding profits in BNY
Mellon’s investment services segment, whose pretax profit margin
fell to 29 percent in 2011 from 36 percent in 2009, according to
the statement. Investment services is BNY Mellon’s largest unit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BNY Mellon rose 2.3 percent to close at $22.34 in New York,
bringing gains this year to 12 percent.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
