Negotiations between Bayerische
Landesbank’s biggest owner and European Union regulators who
must approve its restructuring will take place later this month,
EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said.  Almunia said he will hold “an important meeting” with
Bavarian officials by the end of March to discuss remaining
issues on how the state-owned bank will share the costs of
a 2008 government bailout and restructuring measures it must
make in return for EU approval for the rescue.  The Brussels-based antitrust authority has required banks
to sell off units or change behavior to compensate for billions
of euros in government subsidies and guarantees. Munich-based
BayernLB will likely sell a real-estate unit to meet EU
requirements that it focus on its main business, according to
the German state of Bavaria, which owns 94 percent of the bank.  “We’re advancing -- before the end of this month, there’s
an important meeting between myself and my cabinet and my
Bavarian counterpart,” Almunia said at a Copenhagen conference.  BayernLB is the last of several German state-owned banks to
require EU approval for a bailout during the financial crisis
that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Bavaria owns most of the lender after providing it with 10
billion euros ($13.25 billion) in capital and a 4.8 billion-euro
guarantee for a portfolio of asset-backed securities during the
global credit crunch. The remaining 6 percent is held by
Bavarian savings banks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
