Private-fund advisers serving the
most sophisticated clients should be exempt from the full force
of registration requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s Daniel Gallagher said.  As private-equity and hedge funds prepare to meet a March
30 registration deadline, the SEC should consider letting some
avoid parts of the requirement, Gallagher said today in remarks
prepared for a conference in Arlington, Virginia. Gallagher, one
of two Republicans among the SEC’s five commissioners, used the
example of advisers who don’t use leverage and market their
services “only to sophisticated and institutional investors.”  “There will be cases, moving forward, when an individual
adviser or a particular class of advisers ought to be granted
some measure of relief,” he said in a speech to the Investment
Adviser Association. “In many instances, all investors in a
given private fund are sophisticated enough and possess enough
bargaining power to ensure adequate disclosure.”  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted in response to
the 2008 credit crisis, requires the SEC to register private
fund advisers. The agency’s registration rule, adopted before
Gallagher joined the SEC in November, requires reporting of data
on employees, investors and assets they manage. Fund advisers
are also preparing to report private data on a new Form PF that
will be used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to
weigh potential risk in the funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
