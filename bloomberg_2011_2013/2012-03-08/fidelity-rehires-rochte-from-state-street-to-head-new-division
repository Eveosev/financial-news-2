Fidelity Investments , the second-
largest mutual fund company, rehired Anthony Rochte of  State
Street Corp. (STT)  to lead a new division focused on specialized
sector investments.  Rochte was a senior managing director at Boston-based State
Street’s money-management unit, where he helped run the world’s
second-largest line-up of exchange-traded funds. He will become
president of the new division starting in late April, said  Adam Banker , a spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity.  Rochte, who worked at Fidelity from 1996 to 2000 as vice
president of investment services in the firm’s institutional
brokerage business, will report to Jacques Perold, president of
Fidelity Management & Research Co., said Banker, who declined to
specify what kind of investment options the division would focus
on under Rochte.  Last year, investors poured $118 billion in U.S.-registered
ETFs while withdrawing $31 billion from actively managed mutual
funds, according to the  Investment Company Institute , a
Washington-based trade association. About 91 percent of
Fidelity’s stock and bond mutual fund assets are in active
funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
