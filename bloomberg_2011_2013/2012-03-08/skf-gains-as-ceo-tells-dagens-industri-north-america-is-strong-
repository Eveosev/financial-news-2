SKF AB (SKFB) , the world’s largest maker of
ball bearings, climbed the most in more than three months after
Dagens Industri reported the company continues to see rising
demand in  North America  and improvements in Europe.  Shares of the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company rose as much
as 6 percent to 167.2 kronor, the biggest intraday gain since
Nov. 30, and were trading up 5 percent at 165.5 kronor as of
2:57 p.m. in Stockholm.  North American markets are still strong and Europe is
“moving in the right direction,” Dagens Industri cited Chief
Executive Officer Tom Johnstone as saying. Asia is also
rebounding, he said, according to the newspaper.  SKF extended its reach into U.S. markets in February with
an agreement to buy West Nyack, New York-based  General Bearing
Corp. (GNRL) , which generates annual sales of about $155 million. There
are no financial limits on acquisition opportunities, Johnstone
said, according to Dagens Industri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
