New York Yankees All-Star relief
pitcher  David Robertson  sprained his right foot after falling
down a flight of stairs.  X-rays showed no broken bones from the tumble, which
occurred while Robertson was moving boxes at his spring-training
residence in Tampa,  Florida , the Major League Baseball team said
on its  website . He was fitted for a walking boot and will have a
scan to determine if there’s any further damage.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said Robertson probably won’t
miss enough time to jeopardize his availability for Major League
Baseball’s opening day. The Yankees begin their season on April
6 against the Tampa Bay Rays.  Robertson, a 26-year-old right-hander, went 4-0 with a 1.08
earned run average in 70 relief appearances last season,
striking out 100 batters in 66 2/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
