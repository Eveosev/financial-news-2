Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. (PNK) ’s $325
million term loan to support a debt tender offer rose in initial
trading, according to information provider Markit Group Ltd.  The debt, sold to investors at 99 cents on the dollar,
began trading at par, Markit said.  The operator of seven U.S. casinos pays interest at 3
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The lending
benchmark will have a 1 percent minimum, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Lenders to Las Vegas-based Pinnacle received 101 soft-call
protection for one year, the person said, meaning the company
would have to pay one cent more than face value to reprice the
debt in its first year.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is arranging the transaction, which
was increased by $75 million and matures in March 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
