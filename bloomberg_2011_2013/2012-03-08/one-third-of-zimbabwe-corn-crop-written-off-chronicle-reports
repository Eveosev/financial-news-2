Almost a third of  Zimbabwe ’s corn
crop has been written off after the late start to the country’s
rainy season, the state-controlled  Chronicle  said, citing
Agriculture Minister Joseph Made.  About 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of the 1.6
million hectares planted won’t produce a viable harvest, the
Bulawayo-based Chronicle said on its website.  Zimbabwe’s main corn-farming season runs from November
through May. Corn is the southern African country’s staple food.  To contact the reporter on this story:
