Electricite de France SA , the
biggest nuclear operator, will take until 2018 to carry out 10
billion euros in post-Fukushima safety measures, an executive
said today.  The timetable is under discussion with the country’s atomic
watchdog, which ordered additional diesel generators and cooling
sources for reactors, Dominique Miniere, director of EDF’s
nuclear production division, said in Paris.  EDF, operator of the country’s 58 nuclear reactors, was
ordered to carry out extra safety measures to guard against
“extreme” situations following the Japanese nuclear disaster
triggered by an earthquake and tsunami last March. The state-
owned utility has estimated that the work will cost about 10
billion euros ($13.3 billion).  The nuclear operator was told to install “core” safety
equipment and procedures at every plant ranging from the
additional generators for power supply in case of failures to
“bunkered” control rooms and so-called rapid action units.  “The generators will be deployed starting around 2015 at a
rate of about 20 a year,” Miniere said at a conference. “We
will move as fast as possible but there are industrial
considerations.”  Rapid Action Units  The rapid action units will require a one-time investment
of 250 million euros plus 50 million to 100 million euros a
year, Miniere said. EDF has begun recruiting 300 to 350 people,
and the units will be ready by 2014, with one for every four
plants.  EDF is also reinforcing the concrete base of  France ’s
oldest reactor at Fessenheim by mid-2013 and carrying out work
at Tricastin for 2014, he said.  The utility expects global investment across the company to
reach as much as 15 billion euros in 2015, compared with 10.5
billion euros last year, to pay for reactor equipment, safety
upgrades and new atomic plants. Spending on French nuclear
plants will at least double to 3.4 billion euros to 3.6 billion
euros in 2015 from 1.7 billion euros in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
