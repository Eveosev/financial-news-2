A Greek parliamentary committee
called on two European officials to come to Athens to testify in
an inquiry into whether Greece’s 2009 deficit was artificially
inflated.  Letters were sent to  Joaquin Almunia , the European
Commission vice president and competition commissioner, who was
the monetary affairs commissioner at the time, and Walter Radermacher, the European Union’s chief statistician, according
to faxed copies of the letters dated March 6.  Greek lawmakers approved on Feb. 22 the setting up of a
committee to investigate the 2009 shortfall and “factors that
led to Greek statistical data being disputed,” according to the
letters.  Revisions of the 2009 deficit began in October of that year
when the then-prime minister,  George Papandreou , revealed the
gap was twice a previous forecast of 6 percent after winning
elections. The final estimate of the deficit, issued in November
2010, was 15.4 percent.  That figure includes public corporations as well as
liabilities from social security funds and local Government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
