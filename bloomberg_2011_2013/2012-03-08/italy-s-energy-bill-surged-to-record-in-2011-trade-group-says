Italy ’s total energy bill, which
includes the cost of imported oil, gas and electricity, surged
to a record last year, industry group  Unione Petrolifera  said.  The bill increased 19 percent to 63 billion euros ($83.3
billion), up from 52.9 billion euros in 2010, the Rome-based
organization said in a  report  published on its website today.  Last year’s energy outlays amounted to about 4 percent of
Italy’s gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
