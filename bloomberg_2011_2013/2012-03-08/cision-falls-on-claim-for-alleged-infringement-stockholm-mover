Cision AB (CSN) , a Swedish media-
monitoring and analysis company, declined the most in more than
three years in  Stockholm  after saying a claim of alleged rights
infringement in the U.S. may hurt profit.  The shares fell as much as 27 percent, the  biggest drop 
since October 2008, and were down 25 percent at 45.70 kronor as
of 1:02 p.m. in Stockholm where the company is based.  Cision received “a threat from a major U.S. publisher of a
damages claim based on alleged infringement of rights,” the
company said in a statement today without naming the publisher.
“It cannot be excluded that the impact on Cision’s full-year
earnings could be significant. Cision intends to work towards an
amicable solution or otherwise invoke such defense as it sees
fit.”  The company said it is currently unable to assess the
potential financial consequences and it will publish more
information as soon as possible. Cision entered the North
American market in 2001 through the acquisition of Bacon’s.  Cision also operates in territories including the U.K.,
 Germany , Canada,  Hong Kong  and the Nordic countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
