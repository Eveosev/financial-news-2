Japanese lawmakers plan to question
AIJ Investment Advisors Co. President Kazuhiko Asakawa, whose
whereabouts are unknown following the asset management firm’s
suspension for possible losses.  The lower house of parliament will ask Asakawa to appear
before its financial committee on March 14, Shunichi Yamaguchi,
an opposition Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker, told Bloomberg
News in  Tokyo  today.  The Diet will send the request in writing and ask that
Asakawa give reasons should he decline, said Yamaguchi, a member
of the committee. “It’s unclear where he is,” he said.  Japan ’s financial regulator suspended AIJ on Feb. 24 for a
month to find out what happened to the 185.3 billion yen ($2.3
billion) of pension assets managed by the firm.  The committee will also ask to speak with executives from
the pension fund industry, Yamaguchi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
