Vietnam ’s five-year government bonds
fell for the first time in a week after the  finance ministry 
raised the price of petroleum products, spurring concern
inflation will accelerate.  The cost of products including gasoline and kerosene was
increased by as much as 12 percent, the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  Consumer-price (VNCPIYOY)  gains eased for a
sixth month in February to 16.44 percent, still the highest
among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg, official data
show.  “Concern that inflation may accelerate is coming back,”
said Cao Tan Phat, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB
Securities Co. “The increase was quite high compared with
market expectations.”  Yields (GGVN5YR)  on the five-year bonds rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.56 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was steady at 20,830 per dollar as of 2:33 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
set the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec 26, its
website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
