Poland is working on changes to its
renewable energy law draft presented last year and may be ready
with the new proposal as soon as this month, Puls Biznesu
reported, citing Deputy Economy Minister Mieczyslaw Kasprzak.  The new version of the bill comes after the ministry
received 1,000 pages of critical remarks from the industry, the
newspaper said. The previous version of the law proposed
introducing lower subsidies for wind farms.  Kasprzak said further talks on the original proposal donâ€™t
make sense, Puls reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
