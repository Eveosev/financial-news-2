Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  sold 700
million Swiss Francs of tier 2 contingent convertible notes that
pay a coupon of 7.125 percent, according to two people with
knowledge of the sale.  The so-called high-trigger buffer capital notes convert
into shares if the bankâ€™s core tier 1 capital drops below 7
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
