Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , the U.S. oil
producer that spun off its refining business last year, paid
Chief Executive Officer Clarence Cazalot three times more in
2011 than a year earlier after the company’s stock price surged.  Cazalot’s total compensation was $31.5 million last year,
compared with $10.2 million in 2010, Houston-based Marathon Oil
said in a proxy  filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today.  The biggest reason for the jump was $18.8 million from a
non-equity incentive plan in 2011, compared with zero a year
earlier, according to the filing. The award was based on
Marathon Oil’s share-price and dividend-per-share performances
compared with peers.  The board decided in December 2010 to accelerate the
vesting of outstanding performance units, with an effective date
of June 30, 2011, when the refining spinoff occurred,  Lee Warren , a Marathon Oil spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. The
acceleration will reduce potential total compensation for
periods that end in 2012 and 2013, she said.  The company “had a remarkable year in terms of both
operational performance and stock performance,” Warren said.
Marathon Oil rose 42 percent in the first six months of last
year. The new refining company is  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)   Cazalot, who also is chairman of Marathon Oil, had a salary
of $1.4 million in 2011, a bonus of $3 million and option awards
of $6.4 million, the proxy filing showed. He had $1.6 million
from a change in pension value and certain deferred
compensation, and $276,207 in other compensation.  Marathon Oil rose 1.7 percent to $33.53 at the close in  New
York . The stock has climbed 15 percent this year after rising 30
percent during 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
