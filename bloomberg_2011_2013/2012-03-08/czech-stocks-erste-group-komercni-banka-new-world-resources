The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.6 percent to 996.5 at its close in Prague.  The following are among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,
climbed for a third day, adding 1.8 percent to 3,775 koruna, its
highest in a month. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  
advanced 1.7 percent to 462.2 koruna. Stocks rose across Europe
after the industrial output in  Germany , the largest economy in
the region, increased more than forecast and  Greece  moved closer
to completing its debt swap.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, increased 1.5 percent to 146.6 koruna, snapping a
five-day selloff. Commodities gained, lifting  Europe ’s benchmark

Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
