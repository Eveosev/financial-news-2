The Swiss central bank spent 17.8
billion francs ($19.5 billion) in 2011 to stem what it called
the currency’s “massive overvaluation” and enforce an
exchange-rate cap to protect the economy.  The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  bought foreign currencies from a
wide range of counterparties in  Switzerland  and abroad, the
Zurich-based central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
The SNB had a profit of 13.5 billion francs in 2011 compared
with a loss of 19.2 billion francs the previous year, in line
with preliminary estimates published on Jan. 13.  The SNB’s decision to impose a franc cap of 1.20 versus the
euro on Sept. 6 has helped protect the economy and stabilized
currency holdings amassed during 15 months of interventions in
2009 and 2010. Interim Chairman Thomas Jordan, who declined to
comment on monetary policy at a briefing in Bern today, has
pledged to defend the ceiling with the “utmost determination”
if needed by purchasing currencies.  “Today’s figures show that the SNB did the right thing by
imposing the cap,” said Jan Amrit Poser, chief economist at
Bank Sarasin in Zurich. “Not only did it stabilize the Swiss
economy, but as a side effect also helped the central bank
reverse losses.”  The franc, which is traditionally considered a haven in
times of global turmoil, weakened against the euro after the
release, trading at 1.2055 per euro at 12:43 p.m. in Zurich.
Versus the dollar, it was at 91.15 centimes.  ‘Big Role’  Consolidated foreign currency positions contributed 7.7
billion francs to the central bank’s profit in 2011, with
interest income accounting for 5.5 billion francs, the SNB said.
Franc positions had a net loss of 163 million francs in 2011,
partly because of liquidity-absorbing repo operations.  A valuation gain on gold holdings contributed 5.4 billion
francs to the result. The SNB’s so-called stabilization fund,
created in 2008 to help bail out  UBS AG (UBSN) , had a profit of 900
million francs, less than half of the profit in 2010, as the
“outlook in the key investment markets had worsened in the
second half of the financial year, leading to writedowns.”  Jordan said at the briefing that currency developments
“didn’t have much of an impact” on overall results in 2011.  “Imposing the limit on the franc played a big role,” he
said. “That meant the franc couldn’t appreciate further. In
other words, we saw a correction of its massive overvaluation
and that had a significant impact on the 2011 result.”  The SNB will pay 1 billion francs to the federal government
and the cantons and 1.5 million francs in dividends. The central
bank is a joint-stock company in which public shareholders
including cantons and regional banks have a stake of about 55
percent. Private individuals hold the remainder.  The SNB will hold its next monetary policy assessment on
March 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
