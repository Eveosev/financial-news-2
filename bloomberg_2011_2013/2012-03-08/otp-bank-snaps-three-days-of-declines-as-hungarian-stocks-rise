OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, rose for the first day in four as a deadline on  Greece ’s
debt swap approached and Hungary’s government pledged to obtain
aid.  The shares rose as much as 3.3 percent and traded 0.3
percent stronger at 3,700 forint by the close in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  advanced 0.4 percent.  Hungary’s “only goal” is to reach a financing agreement
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union
“fast,” Tamas Fellegi, minister in charge of aid negotiations,
said at a conference in Budapest today.  Investors with about 60 percent of the Greek bonds eligible
for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated they’ll
participate, putting the country on the verge of the biggest
sovereign restructuring in history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
