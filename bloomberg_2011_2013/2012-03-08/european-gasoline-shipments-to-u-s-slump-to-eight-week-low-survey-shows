Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
 Europe  are set to fall to an eight-week low as consumption of
the auto fuel weakens in the world’s biggest economy, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders and oil companies booked 10 tankers for the two
weeks to March 22 and eight more are likely to be hired,
according to the median estimate in a survey yesterday of seven
shipbrokers, traders and owners who specialize in transporting
gasoline. That’s the fewest since the two weeks begun Jan. 12.  U.S. purchases of the fuel held below 60 million barrels
for a 10th week in a row, MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report
showed March 6. Refineries in the country are using stocks of
winter-grade gasoline, lifting the amount available, according
to Ehsan Ul-Haq, a senior consultant at KBC Energy Economics.
Gasoline specifications can change as temperatures fluctuate
because of government efforts to curb air pollution.  “U.S. refiners will also be drawing down their stocks of
winter-specification gasoline before blending the European
material into summer specs, so more domestically produced
gasoline should be available,” Ul-Haq said by e-mail.  Returns (BTCETC2)  for tankers carrying gasoline on the benchmark
Rotterdam-to-New York trade route fell 2.7 percent to $12,641 a
day, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. They rose
yesterday for a first session in nine and are down 43 percent
this year.  Three-Week High  The supply of vessels available to carry trans-Atlantic
gasoline cargoes increased by two to 31, the biggest tally for
the voyage in three weeks, according to the survey.  The ships, known as Medium-Range tankers, would be able to
haul about 5.7 million barrels of the fuel, or 404,000 barrels a
day, over the next two weeks. That’s 52 percent of the 776,000
barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the past year, according to
the  Department of Energy .  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each tanker would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons
of gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  Charter rates  for tankers on the benchmark voyage fell 0.9
percent to 164.58 industry-standard Worldscale points, according
to the exchange.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  Following is a table of ships chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                            March 8    March 1      Change
