The  U.S. Senate  rejected an amendment
that would have approved construction of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) â€™s
Keystone XL pipeline from  Canada  to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The amendment failed 56-42 today, with 60 votes needed for
approval. The amendment was proposed by Republican Senator John
Hoeven of  North Dakota  to be part of a transportation spending
measure. The Senate may take a vote on the highway bill early
next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
