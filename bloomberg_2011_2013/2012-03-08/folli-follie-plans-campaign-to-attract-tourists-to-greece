Folli-Follie SA (FFGRP) , a Greek fashion
accessories manufacturer and retailer, is starting an
advertising campaign to promote the country abroad as its
economy contracts for a fifth year.  “Especially during this difficult time  Greece  is living
through, private/business initiatives are more necessary than
ever,” the Athens-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  “Crazy for Greece,” as the campaign is called, will be
shot on the island of Spetses, and will feature the  Greek flag .  The aim is to attract tourists, with an emphasis on the
Asian market, and the advertisements will be broadcast on
television and the Internet, featured in newspapers and
magazines and posted on billboards, Folli-Follie said in the
statement.  The company has 440 sale points in 24 countries, including
China, Japan, Korea, the U.S, Canada, the  United Arab Emirates ,
Switzerland, France and the U.K.  Tourism, Greece’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
