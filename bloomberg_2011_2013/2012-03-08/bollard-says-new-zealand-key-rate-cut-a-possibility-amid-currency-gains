New Zealand  central bank Governor
Alan Bollard said an interest rate cut is a possibility were the
nation’s currency to gain further, adding it isn’t something
he’s currently considering.  “It’s not something we’re looking at at the minute, but 
it’s completely a possibility,” Bollard said in an interview on
Television New Zealand’s Breakfast today.  Bollard yesterday kept the official cash rate at a record
low 2.5 percent and signaled no change in borrowing costs for
much of the year. He said the New Zealand dollar’s 12 percent
gain the past 12 months is undermining economic growth,
inhibiting exports and that sustained currency gains would
reduce the need for further rate increases.  “It is worth us pointing out to the financial markets that
betting on the New Zealand dollar’s strength is not a sure
thing,” Bollard said today.  New Zealand’s dollar rose as high as 82.81 U.S. cents
earlier today from 81.95 cents yesterday before Bollard’s rate
announcement. It bought 82.47 cents at 9:35 a.m. in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
