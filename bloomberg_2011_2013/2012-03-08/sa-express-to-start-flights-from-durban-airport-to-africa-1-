SA Express , a South African state-
owned airline, agreed to start flights to  Africa  from the King
Shaka Airport in the eastern port city of Durban, President
Jacob Zuma said.  The routes will include cities in  Zimbabwe  and Mozambique,
Zuma told reporters today at the opening of the Dube Trade Port,
north of the city and adjacent to the airport. The airline will
also start operations to Lagos, the commercial capital of
 Nigeria , sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy, Transport
Minister Sbu Ndebele said at the same event.  “SA Express will expand its operations into Africa with
frequent flights to Zimbabwe, Mozambique and other SADC
countries to start with, and future continent-wide expansion,”
Zuma said. SADC is the Southern African Development Community, a
regional grouping.  The port and surrounding infrastructure would boost trade
between  South Africa , the region and the rest of the continent,
Ndebele said.  “Our focus now is on regional integration,” he said.
“Trade is beginning to increase between South Africa and the
rest of the continent and we need these links to be
strengthened.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
