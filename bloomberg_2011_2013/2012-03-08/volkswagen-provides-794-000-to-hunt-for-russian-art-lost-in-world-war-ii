Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is providing funding
of 600,000 euros ($794,000) for a German-Russian research
project to track down Russian art treasures lost in World War
II, a statement from two state-owned funding bodies said.  VolkswagenStiftung , the research-sponsorship arm of
 Europe ’s biggest carmaker, will fund 75 percent of the 800,000
euro costs, with the rest coming from the two German state-owned
funding institutions -- the  States’ Cultural Foundation  and the
 Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation .  Russian museums lost hundreds of thousands of artworks and
cultural treasures through plunder and destruction by German
troops in World War II. The project will bring Russian and
German historians and art historians together to comb the
archives of both countries, as well as of the western allies.  “We have high hopes that we will not only gain new
historical insights, but will also find traces leading to
individual artworks,” the Russian museum curators were quoted
in today’s statement. “Despite efforts to register losses and
our own research, we still rely on assumptions and speculation.
This project is a breakthrough.”  The research begins with the museums of Novgorod and Pskov
as well as the royal palaces at Catherine Park, Gatchina,
Pavlovsk and the Peterhof Palace, according to the statement.  To contact the writer on the story:
