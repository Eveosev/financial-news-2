The Swiss central bank returned to
profit in 2011 as the franc stabilized the value of its euro
holdings and  gold prices  rose.  The profit was 13.5 billion Swiss francs ($14.8 billion)
after a loss of 19.2 billion francs in 2010, the Zurich-based
 Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  said in a statement today, confirming
preliminary figures published on Jan. 13. A valuation gain on
gold holdings contributed 5.4 billion francs to the result as
foreign-currency positions added 7.7 billion francs. The SNB
will pay 1 billion francs to the federal government and the
cantons.  The SNB, led by interim Chairman Thomas Jordan, imposed a
cap of 1.20 francs per euro on Sept. 6 after the currency
climbed to a record, threatening the economy. The measure
stabilized the value of the central bank’s euro holdings amassed
during 15 months of currency purchases through June 2010, while
helping reverse a record loss.  “Today’s figures show that the SNB did the right thing by
imposing the cap,” said Jan Amrit Poser, chief economist at
Bank Sarasin in Zurich. “Not only did it stabilize the Swiss
economy, but as a side effect also helped the central bank
reverse last year’s losses.”  The euro, the main currency of the SNB’s foreign exchange
holdings, lost as much as 16 percent against the franc in 2010,
causing the SNB’s record loss that year. It fell only 2.7
percent in 2011, helped by the currency limit.  The franc was little changed after the announcement,
trading at 1.2059 against the euro at 8:19 a.m. in Zurich. It
has remained above 1.20 since the SNB imposed the cap. Against
the dollar, it traded at 91.51 centimes.  The SNB, which lowered its benchmark lending rate to near
zero in August, will hold its next monetary policy assessment on
March 15. The central bank is a joint-stock company in which
public shareholders including cantons and regional banks have a
stake of about 55 percent. Private individuals hold the
remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
