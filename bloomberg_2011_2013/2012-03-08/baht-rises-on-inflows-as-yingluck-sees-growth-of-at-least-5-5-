Thailand ’s baht advanced by the most
in two weeks after international investors raised holdings of
the nation’s shares on optimism growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
second-largest economy will improve this year.  Global funds purchased $264 million more Thai stocks than
they sold this month, according to exchange data. Gross domestic
product may rise between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent this year
after increasing 0.1 percent  last year , Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra said in  Tokyo  yesterday.  “The basic trend of funds flowing into regional stocks
will probably continue,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader
on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd. in Tokyo. “Among Asia, countries with strong domestic
demand like Thailand, the  Philippines  and  Malaysia  may attract
strong fund inflows.”  The baht advanced 0.6 percent from March 6 to 30.60 per
dollar as of 3:12 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Local financial markets were closed for a public
holiday yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
price swings used to price options, was little changed at 6.5245
percent.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of Thailand’s
economy, were unchanged in January from a year earlier after
decreasing in the previous two months, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before government
data due this week.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was steady at 3.42 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
