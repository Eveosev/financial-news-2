of Treasuries maturing from May 2020 to February 2022. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
