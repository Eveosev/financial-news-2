LG Display Co. (034220) , the world’s second-
largest panel maker and an  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  supplier, rose in  Seoul 
trading after a new iPad featuring a sharper screen was
unveiled.  The  stock  climbed 2.2 percent to 28,200 won at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Seoul, while  South Korea ’s benchmark Kospi
index gained 0.9 percent.  Apple unveiled the third version of the iPad yesterday,
featuring a 9.7-inch “retina” display, as market-research firm
Gartner Inc. forecast the Cupertino, California-based company
will capture two-thirds of global tablet-device shipments this
year. Seoul-based LG Display is the largest liquid-crystal-
display panel supplier for Apple, according to Barclays Plc.  “In the mid-to-long term, LG Display stands to benefit
from the tablet sales,” said Kang Yoon Hum, a Seoul-based
analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co., who  rates  the
company’s shares “market perform.”  LG Display gets about 2 percent of its revenue from Apple,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , a chip supplier for Apple, rose
2.2 percent to 29,750 won, while Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.,
which assembles the U.S. company’s products, gained 2.2 percent
to NT$101 in Taipei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
