The Electricity Authority of Cyprus
has obtained a 130 million-euro ($172 million) loan from the
 European Investment Bank  to help the state-owned power producer
expand its production capacity.  The agreement signed in Nicosia today for a new unit at the
Vasilikos power plant came “in good time to cater to the urgent
need for energy production in the country,” EIB Vice President
Plutarchos Sakellaris said in a statement e-mailed by the bank.  The 767-megawatt power station, which produces half of
Cyprus’s power capacity, was knocked out by a July 11 explosion
that killed 13 and injured 61, leading to outages that damaged
the island’s economy, the euro area’s third-smallest. The loan
will help boost confidence in Cyprus, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said in a statement e-mailed by the  ministry  today.  The EIB already provided 560 million euros in loans to help
upgrade the EAC’s transmission and distribution network, a
combustion engine at Dekeleia power plant and the Vasilikos
power plant, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
