Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, said it acquired closely held Paratek
Microwave Inc. to gain technology that lets handsets operate on
different kinds of wireless networks.  RIM announced the purchase in a  blog post  today. The
Waterloo, Ontario-based company didn’t disclose terms.  RIM is trying to stem U.S. market-share losses to
smartphones from Apple Inc. and devices that run Google Inc.’s
Android operating system. RIM’s share dropped to an average of
15.2 percent from 17.2 percent in the three months through
January, researcher ComScore Inc. said this week.  Paratek, based in Nashua,  New Hampshire , designs and makes
radio-frequency technologies for mobile handsets, including
miniaturized antennas that work on all communications bands. The
company has engineering facilities in Crystal Lake,  Illinois ,
and Burlington, Ontario, and has 46 employees.  John Koles, a Paratek spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to a telephone call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
