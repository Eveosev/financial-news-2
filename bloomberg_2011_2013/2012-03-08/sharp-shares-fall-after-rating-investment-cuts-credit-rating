Sharp Corp. (3436) ,  Japan ’s largest liquid-
crystal-display maker, fell the most in more than a month in
Tokyo trading after Rating & Investment Information Inc. lowered
its credit rating on the company.  Sharp declined 4.8 percent, the biggest drop since Feb. 2,
to close at 520 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent today. The
company’s shares have declined 23 percent this year.  Osaka-based Sharp forecasts a record net loss this fiscal
year because of falling prices of LCD televisions and solar
cells, it said Feb. 1. Rating & Investment cut Sharp’s credit
rating by two levels to A-, the fourth-lowest investment grade,
from A+ as “it will likely take time for the company to improve
earnings capacity,” the Tokyo-based ratings company said in a
statement today.  “The  credit-rating  cut accelerated the stock’s drop,”
said Keita Wakabayashi, an analyst at Mito Securities Co., who
has a “neutral minus” rating on the stock. “Given the market
condition for flat-panel televisions, investors can’t be bullish
on Sharp.”  Sharp’s net  loss  in the year ending March 31 may be 290
billion yen ($3.6 billion), the electronics maker said Feb. 1,
reversing an earlier forecast for a profit of 6 billion yen.
Sharp said it will halve output at its largest TV panel factory
in Sakai, Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
