Boeing Co. (BA)  failed to deliver any of
its new 787 Dreamliners in February even as total output of the
company’s planes increased.  Deliveries for all the Chicago-based planemaker’s models
rose 31 percent from a year earlier to 46, with no customers
receiving 787s, according to data posted today on Boeing’s
website. Boeing has delivered five 787s since September, all to
Tokyo-based  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)   February’s delivery dearth for the $200 million Dreamliner
was related to inspections needed after discovering a
manufacturing error related to lamination on the fuselage,  Jim
Albaugh , president of Boeing’s commercial unit, said March 2.
The company boosted production to 3.5 Dreamliners a month last
week, ahead of schedule as it works toward a goal of 10 a month
by the end of next year.  Initial deliveries have been with engines made by Rolls-
Royce Holdings Plc. The version powered by  General Electric Co. (GE) 
engines hasn’t yet been certified by authorities. Boeing said
yesterday that the required test flights for that version were
completed at the end of February.  The company has repeatedly declined to say what caused the
additional delay to the model, which was initially due to reach
 Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  last year. Chief Executive Officer Jim
McNerney had said in October that the tests were 95 percent
completed. The first 787 entered service more than three years
late as Boeing struggled with new materials and manufacturing
processes used for the composite-plastic jet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
