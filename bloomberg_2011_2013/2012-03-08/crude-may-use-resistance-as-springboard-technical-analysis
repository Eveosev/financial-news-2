Oil may add to this year’s gain
after testing prior resistance yesterday and using it as a
bullish “springboard,” according to  technical analysis  by
Auerbach Grayson & Co.  Futures settled above $104 a barrel on Feb. 21 for the
first time since May, forming a new support for the contract,
said  Richard Ross , an analyst at the New York brokerage.  “This completed a nine-month complex head-and-shoulders
bottom, which holds the potential to propel prices significantly
higher,” Ross said in a telephone interview. “We successfully
retested the old resistance on the pullback to $104, which has
created a textbook buying opportunity.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.46, or 1.4 percent, to
settle at $106.16 a barrel yesterday on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures dropped to $104.35 during yesterday’s session,
the lowest intraday level since Feb. 21.  Crude oil in  New York  is up 7.4 percent this year and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 7.6 percent.  “It took oil rising to $147.27 back in 2008 to help put a
brake on growth,” Ross said. “Absent a spike of that
magnitude, crude prices and equities should remain positively
correlated and we believe that the strength of crude should have
bullish implications for both the global growth story and stock
prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
