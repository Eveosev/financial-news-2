The Japanese government will allow
the nation’s utilities to include solar power in electricity
supply plans for the year beginning April to ease expected
shortages in summer, the Sankei newspaper reported.  Solar power had been excluded due to instability concerns,
Sankei reported, without saying where it got the information.
 Japan ’s utilities are required to submit annual plans detailing
how they intend to supply power.   The utilities will be allowed to include as much as 10
percent of their solar capacity, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
