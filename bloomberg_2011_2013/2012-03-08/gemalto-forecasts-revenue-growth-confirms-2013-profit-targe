Gemalto NV (GTO) , inventor of the smart
chip used in bank and phone cards, forecast revenue and
operating profit will increase this year after reporting 2011
earnings that were in line with analysts’ estimates.  Net income slipped 3.6 percent to 161.4 million euros
($212.6 million) last year, the company said in a statement
published on  Business Wire  today. Sales grew 5.8 percent to 2
billion euros. Analysts had predicted profit of 164 million
euros and sales of 2 billion euros, according to the average
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re confident we’ll see growth in all of our units in
2012,” Chief Executive Officer Olivier Piou said today in a
conference call. “We’re exactly where we wanted to be, at
cross-roads between software, high-tech and telecoms.”  Gemalto reiterated its target of 300 million euros in
operating profit in 2013, compared with 238.6 million euros in
2011 excluding assets the company is holding for sale.  “We’ve had almost linear profit growth toward the 300-
million bar, and revenue growth in the range of 8 to 12 percent
at constant exchange rates since 2010,” Piou said. He said 2012
will probably also follow this pattern.  The Amsterdam-based company, which has been shifting
revenue from older commoditized smart chips to new security
technology, expects its business will benefit from a ramp-up in
contactless mobile payment and machine-to-machine transmissions.
Gemalto last week unveiled a SIM-card tested by  Mastercard Inc. (MA) ,
 Visa Inc. (V)  and  American Express Co. (AXP)  at the  Mobile World Congress 
in Barcelona.  Gemalto shares closed up 2.2 percent to 43.20 euros
yesterday in Paris. The stock has gained about 15 percent since
the beginning of the year. The company has a market value of 3.8
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
