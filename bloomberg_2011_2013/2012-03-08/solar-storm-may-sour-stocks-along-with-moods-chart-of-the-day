A solar storm heading to Earth today
may affect radios, flights and people’s moods. It may also hurt
stocks, according to a study by the  Federal Reserve  of Atlanta.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows, in lighter colors above the
white line, the average annual performance of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, the  Nasdaq  and the NYSE Composite indexes
since their inception, as recorded in a paper published by the
Atlanta Fed in October 2003. The darker bars show the average
when measuring only the five days following a geomagnetic storm,
a result the paper attributes to changes in human behavior,
judgment and risk taking.  “The markets are always looking for a specific buy or sell
signal, or a well-signposted catalyst, but sometimes Mother
Nature likes to remind us that some events can’t be factored
into algorithms and black-box trading,” said  Paul Robinson , a
futures broker at ICAP Plc in  London .  The sun erupted March 6, with the largest solar flare in
five years on course to hit Earth at about 7 a.m. New York time
today, the  Associated Press  reported yesterday, citing the Space
Weather Prediction Center. Radiation emitted by flares may
disrupt radio communication, power grids and satellite
navigation.  The Fed’s research paper, entitled Playing the Field:
Geomagnetic Storms and the Stock Market, was written by Anna
Krivelyova and Cesare Robotti.  To contact the reporters on this story:
