KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
miner that has Europeâ€™s biggest output, jumped the most in more
than a week as the metal advanced.  The shares rose as much as 3 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Feb. 29, before trading 2.7 percent higher at 147.9
zloty as of 12:10 p.m. in Warsaw. KGHM has advanced 34 percent
this year, the best-performing stock in the  WIG20 Index (WIG20) , which
has climbed 6.8 percent.  Copper gained 1.5 percent in London as Germany said
industrial production rose more than economists anticipated in
January. Data yesterday showed U.S. companies increased hiring,
more investors signed on to a Greek debt swap and stockpiles of
the metal used in pipes and wires declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
