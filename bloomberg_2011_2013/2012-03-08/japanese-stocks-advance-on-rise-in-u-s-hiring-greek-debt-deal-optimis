Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rising the most in three weeks, after
U.S. companies increased hiring and the yen slipped against the
dollar. Shares also gained on a report that Japan’s economy
contracted less than initially estimated.  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker by market value,
rose 2.6 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s
top publicly traded bank, gained 2.7 percent on a report the U.S.
Federal Reserve is considering a new type of bond-purchase
program.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801)  and other developers rose after
Tokyo’s office vacancy rates dropped for the first time in five
months.  “Investors are feeling less pessimistic about the global
economy,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $35
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “Now that the
yen is starting to ease, manufacturers who had really been hurt
are coming back.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent to 9,768.96,
its biggest gain since Feb. 15, at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index climbed 1.6 percent to 836.16, with
almost three times as many shares advancing as falling. Volume
on the gauge was 17 percent higher than the 100-day average.  The settlement price for Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures and
options contracts for March delivery will be fixed tomorrow. The
settlement price, also known as the “special quotation,” of
Nikkei 225 options is calculated after all stocks on the index
begin trading.  Japan GDP  Japan’s economy contracted less than the government’s
initial estimate last quarter on rising reconstruction demand
after last year’s record earthquake.  Gross domestic product 
shrank an annualized 0.7 percent in the three months ended Dec.
31, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo today, compared with a
preliminary projection of a 2.3 percent contraction.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge advanced 0.7 percent in  New York 
yesterday, rebounding from its biggest drop of the year, after
ADP Employer Services reported U.S. companies added more jobs
than expected in February.  Exporters climbed as the yen fell after Japan today posted
a record current-account deficit of 437.3 billion yen ($5.4
billion), threatening to undermine the currency’s haven status.
That is the biggest deficit since comparable data began in 1985
and compares with estimates for a 320 billion yen gap.  Yen Weakens  The yen depreciated against the dollar, falling as low as
81.36 from 80.73 at the close of trading yesterday. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Toyota (7203) , which gets about 70 percent of its sales abroad,
rose 2.6 percent to 3,330 yen. Canon Inc., which gets 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, climbed 2.2 percent to 3,715 yen. The
stock also got a boost after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. raised its target price to 4,730 yen from 4,358.  Financial stocks also rose amid optimism on  Greece ’s debt
swap and a new bond-buying strategy the Fed is weighing.
Investors holding at least 58 percent of the Greek bonds
eligible for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated they
will participate, putting the country on the verge of the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history.  The Wall Street Journal reported the Fed is considering a
strategy that would allow it undertake another round of
quantitative easing, or bond buying, while lowering the risk of
inflation.  Financial Stocks Rise  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rose 2.7 percent to 415 yen,
the most active stock by value in  Japan . Nomura Holdings Inc.,
the nation’s biggest brokerage, climbed 4.7 percent to 378 yen.
T&D Holdings Inc., a life insurer, jumped 4.3 percent to 932 yen.  Real estate companies advanced after Miki Shoji Co., a
privately held office brokerage, reported Tokyo’s office vacancy
rates fell to 9.15 percent in February from 9.23 percent a month
earlier, its first decline since September.  Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s second-biggest developer by market
value, gained 4.7 percent to 1,551 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co. rose 4.6 percent to 1,954 yen. Tokyo Tatemono Co.
surged 5.4 percent to 335 yen to lead gains on the Nikkei 225.  The  Topix (TPX)  has jumped 15 percent this year, rebounding from
last year’s 19 percent drop, amid signs the  U.S. economy  is
improving and  Europe  is acting to contain its debt crisis. The
 value  of stocks listed on the index has risen to 1.03 times book
value, up from 0.88 in December, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A number below 1 means companies can be bought for
less than value of their assets.  Sumco Corp. increased 4.5 percent to 887 yen after a report
the wafer maker will receive 15 billion yen ($185 million) in
investment from a group including Japan’s three top banks and
Mitsubishi Corp., according to the Nikkei newspaper, which
didn’t cite anyone. The company has been struggling with weak
demand for chips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
