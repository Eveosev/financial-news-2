Commodity investment firm  Klesch
Group (0031923D)  is interested in building an aluminum smelter near
Husavik, north Iceland, to be completed within two years,  Visir 
reported without saying where it got the information.  Klesch has asked to be allowed to use an environmental-
impact assessment conducted for  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , which canceled its
plans to build a smelter in the area after concluding that
Iceland wouldnâ€™t be able to supply enough power at competitive
prices, the Reykjavik-based news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
