David Stockton , the former top
economic forecaster for Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
and former chairman Alan Greenspan, has joined Macroeconomic
Advisers LLC as a senior adviser.  Stockton will work out of the St. Louis firm’s Washington
office with former Fed governor  Laurence Meyer , according to a
press release from Macroeconomic Advisers.  Stockton retired from the Fed Sept. 30 as director of the
Division of Research and Statistics. The division’s staff of
325, including dozens of PhDs, prepares a forecast for the
Federal Open Market Committee every six weeks and conducts
economic research on a variety of topics including housing and
labor markets.  Division directors such as Stockton were once known as
“barons” inside the Fed for their control of resources
critical to the central bank’s policy-making process.  “David commanded the respect and admiration of  Alan
Greenspan  and Ben Bernanke, as well as generations of Board and
FOMC members,” said Meyer, who co-founded the St. Louis
forecasting firm. “There is no one, and I mean no one, who
could make a greater contribution to our forecasting efforts and
analysis of monetary policy than David Stockton.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
