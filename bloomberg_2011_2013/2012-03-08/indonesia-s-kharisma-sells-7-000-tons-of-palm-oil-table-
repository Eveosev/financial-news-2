PT Kharisma Pemasaran Bersama
Nusantara , which sells  palm oil  from  Indonesia ’s state-owned
plantations, sold 7,000 metric tons of 10,250 tons of the
commodity that it offered at an auction in Jakarta.  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI) , the country’s largest-listed
plantation company by market value, withdrew 4,000 tons of palm
oil in a separate auction because of low bids.  The following table lists the results of the sale today,
based on a faxed statement. The volumes are given in metric tons,
while prices are in rupiah per kilogram including a 10 percent
value added tax, unless stated otherwise.  Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
