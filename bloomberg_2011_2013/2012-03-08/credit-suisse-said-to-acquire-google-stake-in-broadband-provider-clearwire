Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  bought  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s stake in wireless-broadband provider  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) ,
said a person with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be
named because the information is private.  In a  regulatory filing  this week, Google said it sold 29.4
million Clearwire shares for $2.26 each without identifying the
buyer. The sale price valued the stock, Google’s entire 6.5
percent stake in Clearwire, at $66.5 million.  Google invested about $500 million in Bellevue, Washington-
based Clearwire in 2008 as part of a $3.2 billion investment by
a group of communications and technology firms including  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S) ,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , Bright House Networks LLC and  Time
Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)   Mountain View, California-based Google had planned to sell
the shares at $1.60 each, according to a Feb. 24 regulatory
filing. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Credit
Suisse bought the stake.  Steven Vames, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment. Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Google, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
