South Korea , Asia’s third-biggest
consumer of copper, bought a total of 3,000 metric tons of
Chilean copper cathodes in tenders, according to notices on the
state-run stockpiling agency’s website.  The Public Procurement Service, which stockpiles strategic
commodities, purchased the grade-A copper with more than 99.99
percent of purity from  LG International Corp. (001120)  for delivery by
June 15 to Incheon, the notices showed today.  Of the total, the agency bought 1,000 tons at a premium of
$98 a ton over the London Metal Exchange official cash
settlement price, it showed. Another lot of 2,000 tons was
purchased at a premium of $108 a ton, the website showed. The
premium includes insurance and shipping costs.  Copper for three-month delivery traded on the LME rose 1
percent to $8,376 per ton at 5:10 p.m. in Seoul. The metal, used
in cables, wires and pipes, has gained 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
