Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
South Africa’s second-biggest construction company, said it
would offer 112.8 million shares in a rights offer to cut debt
and fund expansion.  Shareholders will be offered 34 shares for every 100 held
at 18 rand each, Johannesburg-based Murray & Roberts said in a
statement today. The 2 billion rand ($266 million) raised from
the sale will help restore profit “as soon as practically
possible,” Murray & Roberts said Jan. 31.  “This offer is at a massive discount and shows how
difficult it has been for the company to raise money,”  David Shapiro , a director at Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities,
said by phone. “It needed this offer to be a success.”  Murray & Roberts posted a loss of 528 million rand in the
fiscal first half through December. Last year it resolved not to
pay dividends until liquidity improves following a slowdown in
South African spending on infrastructure and unresolved claims
with projects in its home market and Dubai. Murray & Roberts,
which helped build the Gautrain rapid-rail network that links
Johannesburg and  Pretoria , also has operations in  Australia .  The stock rose 2.4 percent to 28.40 rand at the close in
Johannesburg. Murray & Roberts has climbed 11 percent this year,
in line with the  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction & Building
Materials (JCBDM)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
