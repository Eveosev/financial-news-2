Grain exports from  France ’s Rouen
port,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, jumped 53 percent in
the week through yesterday, boosted by the biggest wheat
shipments to North Africa since the last week of March 2011.  Outbound grain shipments were 222,038 metric tons between
March 1 and March 7 from 145,570 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Exports included
217,010 tons of soft wheat.  Algeria was the biggest export destination, taking 132,760
tons of soft wheat, the most since September, while Morocco was
the destination for 60,500 tons of the grain and Tunisia took
23,750 tons, the first shipments since June.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of France’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
