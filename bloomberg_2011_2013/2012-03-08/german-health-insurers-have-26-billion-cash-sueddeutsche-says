Politicians and insurers in  Germany 
are debating how to use almost 20 billion euros ($26 billion) of
health-care funds, after the countryâ€™s public health insurers
generated a surplus of 4 billion euros in 2011,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported.  Politicians are suggesting lower premiums or abolishing
payments for medication, while insurers want to keep the money
as reserve for years with deficits, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
