Fenway Park, the home field of the
Boston  Red Sox , has been listed on the  National Register of
Historic Places  100 years after it was built.  The National Park Service notified the Major League
Baseball club yesterday that its application for Fenway Park’s
inclusion on the list was approved.  “The commitment to preserve all that is good about Fenway
Park was made to fans more than a decade ago and we’re pleased
that Fenway Park will be counted among America’s most treasured
historical places, ensuring that it is protected and enjoyed by
future generations,” the team said in a statement.  The Red Sox can recoup as much as $40 million in federal
historic preservation tax credits with the new designation,
according to the Boston Herald.  Fenway was designed by James McLaughlin and built on a
landfill for $650,000, the Herald said. Construction started in
September 1911 and the first game was played on April 20, 1912,
before a crowd of 27,000.  The listing means changes to Fenway are subject to review
by the  Massachusetts Historical Commission .  Owner  John Henry  has spent $285 million on Fenway
renovations during the past decade, the Herald reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
