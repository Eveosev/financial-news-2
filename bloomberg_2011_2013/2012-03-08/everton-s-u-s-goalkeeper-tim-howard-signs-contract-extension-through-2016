Everton goalkeeper  Tim Howard 
extended his contract until 2016, the Premier League soccer club
said on its  website .  Howard, who turned 33 two days ago, has appeared in 256
games since joining Everton on loan from Manchester United in
the middle of 2006. He made the move permanent in February 2007.  “When you have a really good relationship in life and
both sides are eager to continue and keep that going, it’s a no-
brainer,” the U.S. international team player said. “They were
very happy to keep me here and I am very, very happy to stay.”  Howard scored his first professional goal Jan. 4 with a
length-of-the-field kick which bounced over the head of Bolton
goalkeeper Adam Bogdan. Howard’s made 72 appearances for the U.S.
national team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
