Angel investors boosted funding for
startups last year, according to  research  released today.  The median size of investment rounds by so-called angels --
wealthy investors who use their own money to back startups --
increased 40 percent to $700,000 last year, according to a study
by the Angel Resource Institute, Silicon Valley Bank and  CB
Insights .  The analysis, based on 573 deals valued at $873.3 million,
shows that angel investors are playing an increasingly important
role in promoting entrepreneurship, helping fledgling companies
get off the ground and stimulating  job creation , said Allan May,
chairman of ARI, which researches angel investing.  “Startup companies fuel economic growth and job creation
and are the drivers of future U.S. competitiveness,” he said in
a statement. The research provides insight into “how angel
investment impacts the economy.”  Health care startups accounted for 37.4 percent of last
year’s angel dollars, while the Internet lured 27.2 percent of
the total.  The most active angel groups were Tech Coast Angels, Band
of Angels LLC, Golden Seeds LLC, Central Texas Angel Network and
Launchpad Venture Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
