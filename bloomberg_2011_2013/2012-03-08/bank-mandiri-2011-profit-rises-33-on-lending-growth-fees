PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI) , the nation’s
largest lender by assets, said profit rose 32.8 percent from a
year earlier bolster by lending growth and fee-based income.  Net income climbed to 12.2 trillion rupiah ($1.34 billion)
from 9.2 trillion rupiah a year earlier, the company said in a
statement in Jakarta today. A survey of 28 analysts by Bloomberg
estimated net income of 12.32 trillion rupiah last year.  Gross domestic product in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy
expanded 6.46 percent last year, the fastest pace since before
the Asian Financial crisis, benefitting lenders including Bank
Mandiri as consumers borrowed more to finance homes, vehicles
and appliances.  Bank Indonesia  has cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to a record low 5.75 percent since October to help boost
consumption, which accounts for more than half of GDP.  The government’s plan to increase the price of subsidized
fuel in April may damp loan demand, Bank Mandiri Chief Financial
Officer Pahala Mansury said.  “As the government will increase the price of subsidized
fuel, inflation will spike and it will impact to our loan growth
this year,” he said. That’s why we maintain credit growth this
year will be about 20 percent to 22 percent.”  Net interest income or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, rose 11.6 percent to
21.78 trillion rupiah from 19.52 trillion rupiah in 2010.
Lending grew 27.7 percent to 314.4 trillion rupiah, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
