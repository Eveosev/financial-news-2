Greece , with more than half of young
people of out of work, surpassed Spain in December in having the
highest youth jobless rate in the euro area following four years
of economic recession.  Greece’s unemployment rate rose to 21 percent from 20.9
percent in November, the Hellenic Statistical Authority said in
an e-mailed statement from Athens today. The jobless rate for
those between the ages of 15 and 24 increased to 51.1 percent
from 48 percent in the previous month, compared with 49.9
percent in Spain in January.  Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said on March 2 that Greece
needs measures to immediately boost growth and  job creation  as
the economy buckles under austerity measures linked to the
country’s bailouts. The economy shrank 7 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier and 6.8 percent in the whole of
2011, a fourth year of contraction.  Greece’s female jobless rate increased to 25.3 percent in
December from 24.5 percent in the previous month, the
statistical authority said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
