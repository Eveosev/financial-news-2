South Africa ’s government sent a
letter of apology that was accepted by the Nigerian authorities
for deporting 125 Nigerians last week because they didn’t have
the relevant health documents to enter the country.  Both governments are considering measures to strengthen
their relationship following the incident, South Africa’s
Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a
statement on its website today.  “I will be sending a letter back to my counterpart in
South Africa accepting the apology” on behalf of the Nigerian
government, Nigerian Foreign Minister Olugbenga Ashiru told
reporters today in Abuja, the capital.  The mass deportation from Johannesburg on March 2 led
Nigerian authorities to deport 131  South Africans  upon arrival
on three separate days, Ashiru said.  Vaccination papers issued by  Nigeria  and used by the South
African High Commission to give visas to Nigerians were rejected
as fake at the point of entry in Johannesburg, Ashiru said March
6.  Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan will receive a special
envoy from South Africa “within the next couple of days,”
Ashiru said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
