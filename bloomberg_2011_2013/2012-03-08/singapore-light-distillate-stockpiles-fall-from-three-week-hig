Singapore â€™s stockpiles of light
distillates fell from the highest in three weeks, according to
data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  light distillates  such as naphtha,
reformate and gasoline declined 5.3 percent to 11.08 million
barrels in the week ended yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 11.69 million barrels as of Feb. 29, the
highest since Feb. 8.  Residues (SPIVRESD) , a category that includes  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excludes bitumen, dropped 1.8 percent to 21.41
million barrels.  Middle distillates  such as gasoil and kerosene
rose 1.8 percent to 11.29 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
