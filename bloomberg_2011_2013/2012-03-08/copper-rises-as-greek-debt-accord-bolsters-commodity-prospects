Copper futures rose for the second
straight day as  Greece  moved closer to restructuring its
sovereign debt, easing concern that commodity demand will
contract.  Investors with about 60 percent of Greek bonds eligible for
a debt swap agreed to participate. Copper also rose as the
dollar’s decline against a basket of major currencies boosted
the appeal of raw materials as alternative assets. Global stock
prices advanced.  The debt exchange “is garnering more support, and that’s
allowing for a little more ‘risk-on’ behavior and rallying
markets,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at  Country Hedging  in St.
Paul, Minnesota, said in a telephone interview. “Rising
equities and a weaker dollar certainly are a positive for
copper.”  Copper futures for May delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
settle at $3.7915 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The metal, up 0.8 percent yesterday, has gained 10 percent this
year.  Inventories tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange, down 25
percent this year, extended a slump to the lowest since July
2009.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.4
percent to $8,330 a metric ton ($3.78 a pound).  Zinc, lead and tin climbed in London, while nickel and
aluminum fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
