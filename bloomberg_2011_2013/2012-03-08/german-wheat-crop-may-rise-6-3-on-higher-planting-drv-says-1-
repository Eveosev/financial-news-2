Germany ’s wheat production may jump
6.3 percent this year after farmers increased sowing and as the
crop escaped damage from “extreme” cold in February, farm
organization Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said.  Overall wheat production, including the spring-planted
wheat and the harder durum variety, may rise to 24.2 million
metric tons from 22.8 million tons on increased  planting  and
yields, the Berlin-based DRV forecast today.  German farmers last year faced rain in August that hampered
wheat harvesting and hurt grain quality, following a dry spring
that reduced yield potential across Western Europe. Germany is
the European Union’s second-largest wheat grower after  France .  “The long and mild autumn in many cases allowed to
compensate for the partly difficult planting conditions for the
crops,” the DRV wrote in an  e-mailed statement . “The extreme
frost in the first half of February, partly with some new record
temperatures lows, limits the yield potential particularly in
the east.”  The crops largely escaped “major” frost damage, according
to the DRV.  Soft Wheat  Winter soft wheat production, the bulk of the Germany crop,
may climb 6 percent to 23.7 million tons, a combination of a
1.5 percent increase in the planted area to 3.22 million
hectares (7.8 million acres) and yields rising 4.4 percent to
7.37 tons per hectare, based on the DRV forecast.  Some damage from the cold in February means the area of
spring-planted wheat may climb 22 percent to 73,500 hectares,
according to the DRV. That would be about 2.2 percent of the
overall wheat surface.  Barley output may climb 13 percent to 9.89 million tons,
with planting rising 4.7 percent to 1.67 million hectares and
yields advancing 11 percent to 6.29 tons per hectare. Winter-
barley production may jump 17 percent to 7.82 million tons.  Germany’s rapeseed harvest may jump 26 percent to 4.81
million tons from 3.83 million tons last year, with yields
surging 24 percent to 3.63 tons per hectare, DRV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
