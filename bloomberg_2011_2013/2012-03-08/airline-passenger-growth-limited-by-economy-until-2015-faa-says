A sluggish economy and higher fuel
prices will hold down airline growth until 2015, according to a
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration forecast.  Carriers including  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  are projected to have an increase of 0.2 percent to
730.7 million passengers this fiscal year compared with 2011,
according to a summary of the FAA forecast released today.  The number of fliers will reach 800 million in 2015 and
1 billion in 2024, according to the FAA. The agency in 2011 had
predicted the industry would reach the 1 billion level three
years earlier. The FAA uses the predictions to estimate staffing
and equipment needs.  “More and more Americans are relying on  air travel , and
the Obama administration is committed to making sure the U.S.
can meet our growing aviation demands,” Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement.  Even with scaled-back growth, the U.S. needs new air-
traffic technology known as NextGen to keep flights moving,
LaHood said. “Our investment in NextGen is the key to getting
passengers and cargo to their destinations more safely, faster
and with less impact on the environment,” he said.  Revenue passenger miles, which take into account how many
people fly as well as how far, are expected to increase faster
than passenger totals alone, the FAA forecasts. The agency
predicts an average annual increase of 3.2 percent in RPMs over
the next 20 years, to 1.57 trillion by 2032 from 815 billion in
2011.  Freight Carriers  Cargo carriers including  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS)  are forecast to grow faster than passenger lines.
Revenue ton miles for cargo is projected to increase 4.9 percent
per year over the same time, according to the FAA.  The largest airports, except those constricted by lack of
runway capacity, are projected to expand the fastest, according
to the FAA. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International,
 Chicago ’s O’Hare International and Houston’s George Bush
International are among those that will grow faster than
average, the agency predicts.  The forecast is based on economic projections from IHS
Global  Insight Inc. (2172)  of Englewood,  Colorado .  To contact the reporter on this story:
