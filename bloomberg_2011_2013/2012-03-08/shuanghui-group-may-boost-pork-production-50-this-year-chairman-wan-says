Shuanghui Group,  China ’s biggest hog
processor, plans to boost production volume by 50 percent this
year, chairman Wan Long said today in Beijing.  The Henan-based company may slaughter 15.5 million hogs
compared with 10.3 million last year, he said. Sales may reach
63 billion yuan, compared with about 60 billion yuan last year,
Wan said.  The company will invest 6 billion yuan this year building
new projects in cities including Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang,
Nanning and Kunming, Wan said.  China’s hog industry is consolidating with bigger producers
better poised to weather volitality in hog prices and outcompete
regional and small players, Wan said.  Shuanghui’s listed arm is Henan Shuanghui Investment &
Development Co.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
