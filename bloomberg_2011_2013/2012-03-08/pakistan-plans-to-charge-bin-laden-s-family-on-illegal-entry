Pakistani authorities have
registered a case against Osama bin Laden’s family for illegally
entering the country, according to the interior minister.  “Osama bin Laden was living here illegally,” Interior
Minister Rehman Malik told reporters in Islamabad today.  Pakistan  arrested three widows and several children and
grandchildren of the al-Qaeda chief after he was killed by U.S.
Navy commandos last May in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) north of the capital.  The government last month demolished most of the hideout
where bin Laden had lived since 2005. A four-member commission
named by Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  is investigating why
the army failed to detect bin Laden’s presence or prevent the
U.S. attack.  The house where the family is living has been declared a
sub-jail during the course of the judicial process, Malik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
