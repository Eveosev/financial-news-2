Laszlo Birinyi, among the first to
suggest buying stocks as the market reached its bear-market
bottom in March 2009, said he’s still bullish on U.S. equities
even after the biggest decline of the year this week.  “While we may have stumbled for a day or two, I think the
race is still on,” Birinyi said on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop with Betty Liu” today. He reiterated his call from
last week that the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  has the potential
to reach a record high of 1,700 this year should economic growth
surprise investors the same way falling bond rates did in 1995.  Recent declines in smaller companies don’t portend the
rally is slowing, Birinyi said today. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY) , an
index of stocks with an average market value of about $725
million and considered by some investors to be an indicator of
potential economic growth, fell 3 percent since Feb. 3, while
the S&P 500 is up 1.6 percent in the same period. He said the
underperformance isn’t “troublesome” and recommended investors
stay in equities.  “There’s always something that doesn’t fit the scenario,”
said Birinyi, who founded the Westport, Connecticut-based firm
Birinyi Associates Inc.  Stocks most tied to the economy, such as  Caterpillar (CAT)  Inc.
and Salesfore.com Inc., are faring better this year than stocks
considered safer during times of distress, such as  McDonald’s
Corp. (MCD) , a sign to Birinyi that the equity market is forecasting a
better recovery than economists suggest.  ‘Very Good Things’  “The market is saying some very good things about the
economy which no one has factored in,” he said.  Caterpillar shares are up 22 percent, while Salesforce.com
has advanced 44 percent. McDonald’s is down 3.4 percent in 2012.
Economists last month lowered their average forecast for U.S.
gross domestic product growth in 2012 to 2.2 percent from a
projection of 2.3 percent in January, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The world’s largest economy grew 1.7 percent last year and
3 percent in 2010.  The  S&P 500  slid 1.5 percent  on March 6 , its biggest
decline since Dec. 8, after a report showed  Europe ’s economy
shrank and as investors watched developments in  Greece ’s debt
restructuring. The index has recouped almost all of that loss,
rising 1 percent to 1,365.91 today, as more investors agreed to
Greece’s debt swap.  Should the index reach 1,700, it would represent a 24
percent climb from today’s closing level. The benchmark gauge
for U.S. equities has gained 102 percent since the 12-year low
on March 9, 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
