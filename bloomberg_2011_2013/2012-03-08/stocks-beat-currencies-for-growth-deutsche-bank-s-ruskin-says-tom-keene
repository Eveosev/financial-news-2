Buying U.S. equities is a better way
than currencies to invest on positive economic growth, according
to  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  New York .  Major currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, that
historically benefit from stronger U.S. growth seem to be at
“full value” and may struggle to gain further, Ruskin said in
a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene
and Ken Prewitt. Deutsche Bank expects the  U.S. economy  to
expand 2.7 percent this year compared with a median estimate of
2.2 percent from 79 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “If you think that the U.S. is in the lead in terms of the
risk-positive story, then I think it’s U.S. equities that are
going to lead the show,” Ruskin said. “Currencies like the
Aussie,  Canada  and the  New Zealand dollar  don’t seem to be able
to get the usual traction that you associate with the S&P going
up. So that tells me you want to play that much more directly
through the S&P. EM currencies will also respond as well.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has rallied 8.9 percent
this year. The Australian dollar has risen 1.5 percent versus
nine developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Canada’s dollar added 0.3 percent
and New Zealand’s dollar has gained 3.7 percent.  The euro will survive as the region’s shared currency in
2012 “quite easily” because risks in peripheral nations aren’t
systemic, Ruskin said.  The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.3266 and advanced 1.4
percent to 108.13 versus the yen at 12:44 p.m. in New York.  The 17-nation currency will trade at $1.25 by mid-year as
events including Italian labor reform and Greek elections add to
optimism, according to Ruskin. The euro will peak between $1.35
and $1.40 in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
