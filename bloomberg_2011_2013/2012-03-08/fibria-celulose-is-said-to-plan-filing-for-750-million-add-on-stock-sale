Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the Brazilian
pulp producer that’s selling assets to trim debt, may file for a
$750 million additional stock sale as soon as today, according
to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm plans to issue more shares as the current
shareholders aren’t planning to sell their holdings, said the
person, who requested anonymity because the matter isn’t public
yet. Bank of America Corp. and Banco Itau BBA SA are
underwriting the sale, which may happen in April, the person
said.  Fibria Celulose, which has 467.9 million shares outstanding
and closed yesterday in Sao Paulo at 15.20 reais a share, had a
 market value  of 7.11 billion reais ($4 billion), according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Fibria declined to comment through
an external press office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
