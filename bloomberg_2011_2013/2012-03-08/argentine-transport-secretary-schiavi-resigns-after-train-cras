Argentine Transport Secretary Juan
Pablo Schiavi resigned and Alejandro Ariel Ramos was designated
as his replacement, according to a statement on the official
 gazette  today.  Schiavi resigned two weeks after the second-worst train
crash in  Argentina â€™s history killed 49 people and left more than
460 injured. The crash may have been caused by brake failure,
Schiavi told local media shortly after the accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
