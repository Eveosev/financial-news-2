Egypt  signed an agreement to borrow
$400 million a year for three years from the International
Islamic Trade Finance Corp. to help fund purchases of fuel and
wheat, the state-run Middle East News Agency said, citing
International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga.  The funds will be provided to the state-run Egyptian
General Petroleum Corp. and the  General Authority  for Supply
Commodities, which imports wheat for the North African country,
Aboulnaga said at a press conference in Cairo today, according
to MENA. It carries an interest rate of 3.75 percent, she said.  Aboulnaga said the loan would help alleviate fiscal
pressures on the country, including the depletion of foreign
currency reserves. Those reserves plunged to $15.7 billion last
month from $36 billion at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
