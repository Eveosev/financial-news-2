Viacom Inc. (VIAB)  Chairman  Sumner Redstone 
opened the company’s annual meeting today with a joke: “To
paraphrase my very good friend Mark Twain, who could not be
here, the reports of my absence from this meeting have been
greatly exaggerated.”  Last week, Carl Folta, a spokesman for New York-based
Viacom, said Redstone couldn’t attend and would instead address
shareholders in a video presentation. The next day, Viacom
announced that Redstone, 88, planned to attend.  After a five minute introduction to the audience of about
110 shareholders, executives and members of the media, Redstone
handed the presentation over to Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Dauman , who summarized the performance of the company, the owner
of the MTV network and  Paramount Pictures .  Net income in the quarter ended Dec. 31 dropped 65 percent,
hurt by costs of $383 million related to a dispute with the
former shareholders of Harmonix, creator of the “Rock Band”
video games, sold in 2010, the company said last month.  Shareholders re-elected all 11 members of the board after
the 45-minute meeting.  Viacom rose 1.7 percent to $48.26 at 2:25 p.m. in  New York .
The shares had gained 4.4 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
