Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd.  President Yang Kaisheng said lending at the world’s
largest bank by market value was “normal” in early March,
after a newspaper said new loans at the nation’s four biggest
lenders fell during the period.  ICBC,  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ,  Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. (601288)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  lent a total of 550 billion
yuan ($87 billion) from Jan. 1 through March 4, Shanghai
Securities News  reported , citing an unidentified person. The
banks’ new loans were 320 billion yuan in January and 260
billion yuan in February, suggesting that new credit fell by
about 30 billion yuan in the first four days of this month, the
person said, according to the newspaper.  Xiao Gang, chairman of  Bank of China Ltd. , said the data
are no surprise, telling reporters in Beijing today that
investors should focus on monthly or quarterly figures.  The People’s Bank of  China  last month cut the percentage of
deposits that lenders must set aside as  reserves , after new
lending in January was the lowest for that month in five years.
The week-long Lunar New Year holiday was celebrated in January
this year for the first time since 2009. Data for February new
loans will be published later this month.  ICBC’s Yang said on March 4 that the top four banks’ new
lending in the first two months rose by about 20 billion yuan
from a year earlier. ICBC increased its lending in that period
by about 15 billion yuan to 165.5 billion yuan, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
