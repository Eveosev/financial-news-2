OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGSP) , a Russian oil
producer, sold two 100,000 metric-ton cargoes of East Siberian
Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO, for loading in April at about
$3.50 to $4 a barrel above Dubai to two unidentified buyers,
according to five traders who participate in the market.  The premium was lower than a recent deal by TNK-BP, which
sold ESPO for early April at a premium of $5.40 a barrel. March
cargoes sold for as much as $6.30 a barrel, according to traders.
