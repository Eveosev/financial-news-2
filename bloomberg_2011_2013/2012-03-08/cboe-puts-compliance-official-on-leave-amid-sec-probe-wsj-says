CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  placed a senior
compliance executive on leave after the Securities and Exchange
Commission began investigating the options market operator’s
oversight of traders, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The owner of the  Chicago Board Options Exchange , the
nation’s largest equity derivatives market, put Patrick Fay on
administrative leave because of the SEC inquiry, the newspaper
reported today, citing two people familiar with the matter. Gail Osten, a CBOE spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a phone
call or e-mail seeking comment.  CBOE Holdings said in its annual report filed Feb. 28 that
the SEC began investigating whether the company was complying
with its obligations as a self-regulatory organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
