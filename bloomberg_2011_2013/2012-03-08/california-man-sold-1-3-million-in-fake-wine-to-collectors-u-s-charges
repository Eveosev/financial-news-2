Rudy Kurniawan, a  California  wine
collector and dealer, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with
fraud, including a scheme to sell more than $1.3 million in
counterfeit wine.  Prosecutors charged Kurniawan with “multiple fraudulent
schemes relating to his wine business” from 2007 to 2012,
including phony wine sales and fraudulent loan applications.  “The bad-faith sale of any commodity you know to be a
counterfeit, fake or forgery is a felony,” Janice Fedarcyk,
head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s  New York  office,
said in a statement today. “Whether you are peddling a Picasso
or a Petrus, a Botticelli or a Burgundy, unless it is what you
say it is, the sale is a fraud.”  Kurniawan, 35, an Indonesian man living in Arcadia,
California, was arrested today and charged with three counts of
 wire fraud  and two counts of mail fraud. He was scheduled to
appear in federal court in  Los Angeles  today, according the
statement. The charges were unsealed today.  In 2009, billionaire wine collector William Koch sued
Kurniawan in Los Angeles state court claiming he had sold him
phony vintages. If convicted, Kurniawan, who is living in the
U.S. illegally, faces as many as 20 years in prison on each of
the fraud charges, according to prosecutors.  The case is U.S. v. Kurniawan, 12-MAG-606, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
