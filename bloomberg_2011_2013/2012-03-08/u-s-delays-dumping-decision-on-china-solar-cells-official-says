The U.S. Commerce Department  said it
delayed a decision on antidumping duties for Chinese solar-cell
imports following three postponements in its separate decision
on countervailing duties.  A preliminary determination will be made on May 17, Tim
Truman, a department spokesman, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. The determination had been scheduled for March 27.  The postponement follows delays in the agency’s
determination of countervailing duties. The investigation into
 China ’s subsidies for the nation’s solar companies has been
“extraordinarily complicated,” according to a notice in the
Federal Register on Feb. 22. The decision on countervailing
duties, was moved to March 19 from Jan. 12.  U.S. solar-equipment manufacturers, led by Bonn-based
 SolarWorld AG (SWV) ’s U.S. unit, claim they are being harmed because
China’s government uses cash grants, discounts on raw materials,
preferential loans and tax incentives, and manipulates its
currency to boost exports of solar cells.  The U.S. International Trade Commission took the first step
toward imposing added tariffs on Chinese solar imports on Dec.
2, saying U.S. solar-equipment makers are being harmed by
Chinese imports. China rejected the ruling, with the nation’s
 Ministry of Commerce  saying the decision shows American
“inclination to trade protectionism.”  Anti-dumping duties apply to goods sold overseas at or
below the price in the home country. Countervailing duties seek
to offset the benefits of government subsidies to industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
