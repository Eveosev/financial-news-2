Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s publishing
division hired consultant Bain & Co. to advise on reviving
growth as two executives depart.  Steve Sachs, an executive working on consumer marketing and
sales, and Chief Marketing Officer Stephanie George will leave
in June, according to an internal memo from Time Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Laura Lang.  Lang is working to boost growth at the publisher of
magazines, including Fortune and  Sports Illustrated , amid
intensifying online competition. She went to Time Inc. in
November from digital ad agency Digitas, after a nine-month
search to replace  Jack Griffin , who left after clashing with
executives. Time Inc. sales rose less than 1 percent last year,
accounting for 12 percent of Time Warner’s total  revenue .  “We need to find areas where we can double down, place big
bets and get back on a revenue growth trajectory,” Lang wrote
in the memo.  The unit can revive growth “if we have a very clear
assessment of the landscape in which we operate and a cohesive
strategy,” Lang said.  Time Warner, based in  New York ,  rose  0.8 percent to $36.91
at 3:27 p.m. in New York. The shares had gained 1.3 percent this
year before today.  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Time Inc.’s
hiring Bain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
