The decreasing number of industry
groups in “uptrends” may foreshadow a retreat by the U.S.
stock market, according to Craig W. Johnson, a technical market
strategist at Piper Jaffray in  Minneapolis .  The amount of industries trending higher increased from
October through last month to about 95 percent before slipping
last week, Johnson said, citing an indicator watched by analysts
who use charts to predict market direction. He said the high
proportion signaled the market was due for a retreat.  “This advance is getting tired,” Johnson said in a phone
interview yesterday. “As the market gets to higher and higher
levels, you start to see less and less participation,” he said.
“100 percent of the stocks up, 100 percent of the groups up”
all the time isn’t possible.  While the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index extended gains last
week after its best February since 1998, the  Russell 2000  Index
dropped 3 percent. That marked the first sign that some of the
industries might be pulling back from recent gains, Johnson
said. The Russell 2000 rose 31 percent from Oct. 3 through
yesterday, while the S&P 500 gained 23 percent, as U.S. economic
data beat forecasts and the  Federal Reserve  committed to keeping
 interest rates  low through at least 2014.  “We are starting to see some cracks below the surface,”
Johnson said in a note dated March 6.  Johnson predicts technology, the best-performing  group  so
far this year with a 14 percent advance through yesterday, and
health care, which  posted  fourth-quarter earnings growth of 5.1
percent, will perform better than the overall market. He said
some of the “weaker” groups, such as consumer staples and
utilities, could start falling.  The  S&P 500  will rise to 1,400 in the next six months and
will end the year at 1,350, Johnson said in the March 6 note,
reiterating an earlier prediction. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
stocks rose 0.7 percent yesterday to 1,352.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
