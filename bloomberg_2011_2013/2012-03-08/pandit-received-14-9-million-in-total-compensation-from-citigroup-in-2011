Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, said it gave Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit 
$14.9 million in total compensation for 2011, including his
first bonus since the lender almost collapsed in 2008.  The package included $1.67 million of salary and a $5.33
million cash bonus, the New York-based lender said yesterday in
a regulatory filing.  The award reflects Citigroup’s return to profitability
under Pandit, who  became CEO  in December 2007, the bank’s
personnel and compensation committee said in the filing. The
payout also rewards his performance last year, which he spent
grappling with a revenue slump as the European sovereign-debt
crisis roiled markets. The stock tumbled 44 percent, second-
worst among the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  “Although Citi’s reported financial performance was mixed,
underlying client trends point to continued progress on our
operating goals,” the bank said. “The committee awarded annual
incentive compensation, in addition to salary, to Mr. Pandit for
the first time in four years in a manner commensurate with his
responsibilities and the success of his implementation of Citi’s
long-term strategies.”  The figures reflect calculations from the filing’s summary
compensation table, which uses methods prescribed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Cutting Costs  Pandit is cutting 5,000 jobs to eliminate as much as $3
billion from costs this year. Revenue fell to $78.4 billion in
2011, a 9.5 percent decline from the prior year. Expenses,
including compensation and benefits, gained 8 percent to $50.9
billion. Profit increased 4 percent to $11.1 billion.  The personnel committee is headed by Alain Belda, former
CEO of Alcoa Inc., who is leaving the board in April. Other
members include Chairman  Richard Parsons , who will also resign
from the panel, Diana Taylor,  William Thompson  and  Michael O’Neill . The bank said O’Neill will stand for chairman.  Pandit’s payout is separate from a retention package the
committee awarded to him in May, under which he stands to
collect about $40 million, assuming the bank’s earnings meet
analysts’  estimates .  Chief Operating Officer  John Havens , who oversees the
securities and banking division, or S&B, received about $13
million for 2011, including a $5 million cash bonus, the filing
showed. Profit at the unit, which includes trading and
investment banking, fell 24 percent to $4.9 billion last year.  “Although 2011 was a challenging year for Citi and
particularly for S&B, Mr. Havens provided steady leadership, a
focus on longer-term goals, and an emphasis on diligent risk
management,” Citigroup said. “S&B achieved competitive results
in a challenging global markets environment.”  Manuel Medina-Mora, consumer banking chief, received about
$11.4 million, including a $4.2 million cash bonus. Profit at
the regional consumer-banking unit jumped 33 percent to $6.2
billion in 2011, compared with the prior year.  Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach received $11.4 million while
Chief Financial Officer  John Gerspach  was paid $7.2 million, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
