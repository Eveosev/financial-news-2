Kingboard Laminates Holdings Ltd. (1888) , a
Hong Kong-listed maker of laminate products, hired Citigroup
Inc.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Standard Chartered Plc for a HK$2.5
billion ($322 million) four-year loan, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Other banks are being invited to join at three levels in
syndication and lenders have until April 3 to respond, one of
the people said, asking not to be identified because the details
are private. Banks pledging HK$300 million or more are being
offered a so-called all-in fee of 288 basis points more than the
Hong Kong interbank offered rate while those lending HK$200
million to HK$290 million will receive 283 basis points, the
person said.  Lenders committing HK$100 million to HK$190 million will
receive an all-in fee of 278 basis points. The loan’s margin is
245 basis points over Hibor, the people said.  Kingboard Laminates’ Hong Kong-based investor relations
manager, Anna Cheung, declined to comment on the financing when
contacted by e-mail today.  Proceeds will be used for capital expenditure and general
corporate purposes and the facility agent for the loan is
London-based  Standard Chartered , one of the people said.  Kingboard Laminates established its first laminate
manufacturing plant in 1988 in Shenzhen and began producing
paper laminates in 1989, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
