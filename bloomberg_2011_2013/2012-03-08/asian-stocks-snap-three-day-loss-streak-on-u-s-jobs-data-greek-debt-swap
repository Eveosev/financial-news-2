Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index snapping a three-day losing streak, after
 Japan ’s economy shrank less than the government initially
estimated, U.S. employers increased hiring and more investors
joined a Greek debt swap.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker by market
value, rose 2.6 percent in Tokyo.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a
clothier that counts  Europe  as its biggest market, added 5.6
percent in  Hong Kong .  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s top lender, advanced 2.7 percent after U.S. banks gained
on a report the  Federal Reserve  is considering a new type of
bond-purchase program. LG Innotek Co. paced gains among
suppliers to Apple Inc., which yesterday introduced a new iPad
tablet.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  added 1.4 percent to 126.11 as
of 7:42 p.m. in Tokyo, with five stocks rising for each that
fell. Nine out of 10 industry groups in the measure advanced.  “Data over the last couple of months certainly showed
improved momentum in the  U.S. economy ,” said Belinda Allen,
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “There
has been improvement in the labor market.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent after a report
Japan’s economy shrank less than the government initially
estimated last quarter. Trading volume on the gauge was 17
percent above its 100-day average.  Kospi, Australia  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.9 percent after the
central bank refrained from raising its benchmark seven-day
repurchase rate. The decision was predicted by all 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.7 percent even after a
report showed employers unexpectedly cut workers in February.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.3 percent in Wellington after
the central bank held its key lending rate at 2.5 percent.   Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 1.3 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of  China ’s stock
exchanges, climbed 1.1 percent.  Options on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of 40
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong cost the most since the
2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. when compared
with contracts on U.S. stocks. The difference, or skew, shows
investors are increasingly bearish on the index after it surged
as much as 46 percent since October and China this week cut its
economic growth target.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.8 percent
today. The gauge advanced 0.7 percent in New York yesterday
after ADP Employer Services said U.S. companies added 216,000

materials that gets almost 70 percent of sales from the U.S.,
rose 2.2 percent to A$7.31.  Optimism about  Greece ’s debt swap pushed stocks higher.
Investors with at least 58 percent of the Greek bonds eligible
for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated they’ll
participate, putting the country on the verge of the biggest
sovereign restructuring in history.  Esprit gained 5.6 percent to HK$18.24, and  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a
Japanese maker of video-game players that gets one third of its
sales in Europe, rose 1.8 percent to 11,380 yen.  Financial stocks rose the most among the 10 industry groups
on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index after the Wall Street Journal
said the Fed is considering a strategy that would allow it to
undertake another round of quantitative easing, or bond buying,
while lowering the risk of inflation.  ‘General Confusion’  “There’s general confusion about what the Fed’s views
are,” Colonial’s Allen said. “I think it’s unlikely that they
will do any more QE in the near term if the labor market
continues to heal.”  Mitsubishi UFJ added 2.7 percent to 415 yen in Tokyo.
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s fourth-biggest lender
by market value, gained 1.3 percent to A$23.38.  Apple suppliers gained after the world’s most valuable
