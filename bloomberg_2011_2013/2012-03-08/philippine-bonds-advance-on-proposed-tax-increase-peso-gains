Philippine 10-year bonds advanced
for a second day on speculation tax changes on liquor and
tobacco will improve government revenue and cut borrowing.  The peso rose the most in almost two months after lawmakers
agreed to speed up the approval process to raise the levies. The
so-called “sin tax” measure can generate about 60 billion
pesos ($1.4 billion) for the government annually, presidential
spokesman Edwin Lacierda told reporters yesterday.  “Any additional revenue is going to be bond-friendly,”
said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president at Chinatrust
Philippines Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “It will mean
less reliance on borrowing and more money to spend to grow the
economy.”  The yield on the government’s 6.375 percent bonds due
January 2022 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.10 percent in Manila, according to prices from
Amstel Financial Services.  The peso rose for a second day after data from the U.S. and
 Japan  eased concern global growth will slow. U.S. companies
added 216,000 workers to payrolls in February, according to a
report from ADP Employer Services yesterday. Japan’s economy
shrank an annualized 0.7 percent last quarter, the Cabinet
Office said today, compared with a preliminary estimate of a 2.3
percent contraction.  The peso appreciated 0.7 percent to 42.575 per dollar in
Manila, contributing to a 3 percent gain this year, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
price swings used to price options, fell 0.24 to 6.26 percent,
the lowest level in a month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Government debt as a proportion of gross domestic product
dropped to 50.9 percent in 2011, the lowest level in 13 years,
the Bureau of the Treasury said today. That compares with 52.4
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
