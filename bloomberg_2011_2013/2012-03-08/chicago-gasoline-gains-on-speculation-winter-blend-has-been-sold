Chicago  gasoline strengthened
against futures on speculation that refiners sold off winter-
grade inventories of the fuel before the transition to summer
blend at the hub.  The change in vapor pressure requirements for the fuel
happens this month and refiners who must get rid of the winter-
specification fuel may have finished before the switch, said
Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 7 cents to 12.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:03 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
9.19 cents to $3.1843 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
