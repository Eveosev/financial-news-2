Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  said it
intends to appoint Rolf Watter as chairman of its board after
Michel Orsinger decided not to stand for the role.  Orsinger, the chief executive officer of  Synthes Inc. (SYST) ,
still plans to join the board if elected at the company’s annual
general meeting on March 29, Nobel Biocare said in a statement
today. Watter is currently the interim chairman.  Orsinger has “other upcoming professional commitments,”
Nobel Biocare said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
