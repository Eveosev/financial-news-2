Dubai’s shares headed for the
biggest gain in almost a week after banks flocked to  Greece ’s
debt swap and U.S. employers increased hiring, boosting investor
appetite for riskier assets.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only publicly traded Gulf

a.m. in the emirate, trimming its losses this week to 4.7
percent. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index, which tracks the biggest
200 companies in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, rose
0.1 percent.  “The mood is bullish from investors’ perspective and they
have more tolerance for risk,” said Chahir Hosni, equity sales
manager at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. “With the markets
in the U.S. and  Europe  doing better this is obviously helping.”  U.S. stocks advanced yesterday after a report from ADP
Employer Services said companies in the world’s biggest economy
added 216,000 jobs in February. Greece’s largest banks, most of
the country’s pension funds, and more than 30 European banks and
