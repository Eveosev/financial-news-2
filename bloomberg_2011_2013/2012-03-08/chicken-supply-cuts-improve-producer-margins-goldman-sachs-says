Chicken supply cuts are “pushing
margins in the right direction” at U.S. producers  Sanderson
Farms Inc. (SAFM)  and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  There’s “upside risk” to earnings at both companies if
margins keep improving ahead of what Goldman has modeled,
analysts led by Lindsay Drucker Mann in New York said yesterday
in a note.  The analysts said they were “encouraged” by “positive”
remarks about chicken prices from both companies at Goldman’s
Agricultural Biotech Forum in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
