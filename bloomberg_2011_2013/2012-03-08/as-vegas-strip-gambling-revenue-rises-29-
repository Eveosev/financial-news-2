Las Vegas Strip  gambling  revenue
increased 29 percent to $623.5 million in January on a surge in
baccarat play, adding momentum to the recovery for the largest
U.S. casino market.  Revenue for all of  Clark County , including the Strip and
downtown, increased 22 percent from a year earlier to $925.5
million, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said today in a website
 statement .  A surge in baccarat linked to the Chinese New Year drove
the gain, according to Mark Lipparelli, board chairman. January
also benefited from the  Consumer Electronics Show , the Shooting,
Hunting & Outdoor Trade show and better-than-expected attendance
at the World of Concrete convention, Union Gaming Group LLC said
today in a note. The Chinese New Year fell on Jan. 23 this year.  Excluding baccarat, statewide revenue for the month
increased 4 percent, Lipparelli said in an interview. That is
about in line with the 3.7 percent gain so far for the fiscal
year that began July 1. January revenue, at $1.04 billion, was
the highest monthly total since September 2008, he said.  Casino stocks rose.  MGM Resorts International (MGM)  gained 2.9
percent to $13.80 at the close in New York trading.  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS)  rose 2.3 percent to $55.29 and  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) 
added 0.9 percent to $123.39.  Strip revenue increased 5.7 percent to $3.65 billion
through seven months of the fiscal year, the state said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
