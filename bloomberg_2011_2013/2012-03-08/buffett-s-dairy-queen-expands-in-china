International Dairy Queen Inc., the
ice-cream maker owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , plans to expand in  China  and Thailand to take advantage of
opportunities in developing countries.  “Our strategy for international development is emerging
markets, and  Asia  has been a focal point,” Chief Executive
Officer John Gainor, 55, said in a phone interview. Dairy Queen
is customizing its menu based on the “taste profile” of
consumers in each country, he said.  The Green Tea Blizzard dessert is the number-one seller in
China, while the Oreo Blizzard takes the title in the U.S.,
Gainor said. The ice-cream maker, which has more than $3.2
billion in annual sales, opened its 500th location in China and
has more than 270 in Thailand. It expanded into  Saudi Arabia ,
Egypt, Guatemala and  Singapore  in 2011, the Minneapolis-based
company said yesterday in a statement.  Dairy Queen, whose brands include fruit-drink maker Orange
Julius and popcorn-retailer Karmelkorn, was purchased by Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire in 1998. Buffett, Berkshire’s CEO and
chairman, said at the time that he and Vice Chairman Charles Munger were regulars at Dairy Queen.  “We have put our money where our mouth is,” Buffett said
in a  letter  to shareholders.  Berkshire has historically derived a “relatively small
amount” of sales and profit from international markets, the
firm said last month in a regulatory filing. International
growth has exposed it to increased risks from “unstable
political conditions and civil unrest” in certain countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
