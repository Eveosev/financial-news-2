The  Federal Reserve  released
documents showing how Ally Financial Inc., HSBC North America
Holdings Inc. and IMB HoldCo LLC pledged to overhaul faulty
foreclosure practices that led some firms to settle claims by
state and federal authorities last month.  The release follows the Fedâ€™s publication of similar
documents for banks including Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo
& Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Feb. 27. Those documents show
how firms will strengthen communications with borrowers, limit
foreclosures and bolster compliance programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
