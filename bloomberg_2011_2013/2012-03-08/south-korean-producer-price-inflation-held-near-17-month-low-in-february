South Korean producer inflation held
at a near 17-month low in February as prices of agricultural
products declined due to increased supply.  Prices (KOPPIYOY)  climbed 3.5 percent from a year earlier, after a 3.4
percent increase in January, the smallest gain since August 2010,
the Bank of  Korea  said in a statement from  Seoul  today. They
rose 0.7 percent from January.  The Bank of Korea left its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.25
percent yesterday for a ninth straight month, saying that
downside risks to growth persist while inflation expectations
remain high. Consumer inflation moderated to a 14-month low of
3.1 percent in February, within the central bankâ€™s target range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
