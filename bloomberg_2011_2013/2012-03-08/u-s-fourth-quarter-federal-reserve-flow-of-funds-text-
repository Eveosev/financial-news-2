Following is the text from the
 Federal Reserve ’s flow of funds report.  Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2011, about ½ percentage point more than the pace
registered in the third quarter.  Household debt increased at an annual rate of ¼ percent in the
fourth quarter, the first increase since the second quarter of
2008. Consumer credit rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in the
fourth quarter, the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. Home
mortgage debt declined 1½ percent in the fourth quarter, the
smallest decline since the end of 2009.  Nonfinancial business debt rose at an annual rate of 4½ percent
in the fourth quarter, 1 percentage point higher than its third-
quarter pace. Corporate bonds outstanding and business loans
increased while commercial mortgage debt continued to decline.  State and local government debt declined at an annual rate of 1
percent in the fourth quarter. For 2011 as a whole, state and
local debt declined almost 2 percent, its first annual decrease
since 1996. Federal government debt rose at an annual rate of 13
percent in the fourth quarter. For all of 2011, federal debt
rose 11½ percent, the smallest annual increase since 2007.  At the end of 2011, the level of domestic nonfinancial debt
