Japanese trading company  Mitsui &
Co. (8031)  and a unit of  Softbank Corp. (9984)  may build a 30-megawatt solar
power plant as a preferential payment program for clean-energy
projects draws near.  SB Energy Corp., Softbank’s clean energy unit, and Mitsui
may set up the project in Tottori prefecture, Naoki Nakayama, a
spokesman for Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest mobile phone
company, said by phone today. He said a decision hasn’t been
reached.  The plan comes as Japan looks at ways to rely less on
nuclear power following the devastating accident in Fukushima
last March. The country will start in July a feed-in tariff
program which will pay above-market rates for solar, wind and
other forms of renewable energy.  Nakayama could not confirm a report by the Asahi newspaper
today that the project will cost about 10 billion yen ($123
million). The companies plan to start operating the project
around summer in 2013 if they decide to proceed with it, he
said.  On March 5, SB Energy  announced  plans to build four solar
power stations in central and western  Japan  with a combined
capacity of 12.2 megawatts. The company plans to build a total
of 200 megawatts of solar projects, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
