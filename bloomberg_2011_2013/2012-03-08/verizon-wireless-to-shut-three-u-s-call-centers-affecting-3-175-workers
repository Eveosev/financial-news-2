Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
mobile-phone carrier, said it is closing three U.S. call centers
and relocating employees because it wants to improve customer
service and make better use of existing facilities.  Call centers in Southfield, Michigan; Bellevue, Washington;
and Houston will be shut down by the end of the year, Basking
Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon Wireless said today in an e-
mailed statement. The closures will affect 3,175 employees.  Verizon Wireless is taking steps to rein in costs after
capital spending rose 6.3 percent in 2011. The carrier is trying
to keep pace with rival  AT&T Inc. (T)  as it spends billions of
dollars to improve and expand its network to cope with soaring
data traffic driven by the  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhone.  Verizon Wireless will offer to relocate employees “in good
standing” to similar positions at the 28 U.S.-based centers
that are continuing operations. The carrier will give
individualized severance packages for employees who opt to leave
and will provide an after-tax $10,000 relocation benefit for
those who move.  Additionally, Verizon Wireless is merging two northern
California call centers into one and consolidating two
“Internet Response” centers in Ohio and Illinois.  “We are realigning our call center portfolio in order to
maximize existing company resources and real estate assets and
enhance customer service,” Verizon said in the statement.  The wireless carrier is owned by  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)  and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and employs about 82,000 people in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
