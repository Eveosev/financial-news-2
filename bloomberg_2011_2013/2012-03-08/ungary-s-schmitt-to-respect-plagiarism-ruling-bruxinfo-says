Hungarian President  Pal Schmitt  said
he will “respect” the ruling of a university panel, which is
probing his doctoral thesis after media reports said it was
plagiarized, Bruxinfo reported, citing an interview with him.  Schmitt repeated that he rejects the allegations of
plagiarism, according to the transcript of the interview posted
yesterday on Bruxinfo’s  website . He said the allegations may
have surfaced because he has “helped” the government’s work as
president, Bruxinfo said.  In response to a question on whether he should resign,
Schmitt said he was still considered a “satisfactory president
for two-thirds of the country,” Bruxinfo reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
