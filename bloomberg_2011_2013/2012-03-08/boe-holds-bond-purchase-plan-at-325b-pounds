The  Bank of England  maintained its
target for bond purchases today, looking past signs of recovery
to support the U.K. economy through the European debt crisis.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor
 Mervyn King  held its bond-purchase plan at 325 billion pounds
($512 billion), as forecast by all 45 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The panel raised the program by 50 billion pounds
last month, and plans to complete the purchases by early May,
when it will have new quarterly economic forecasts.  The bank also held its  benchmark interest rate  at a record
low of 0.5 percent, as forecast by all 53 economists in a
separate poll. This month marks the third anniversary of the
bankâ€™s so-called quantitative easing program, which it started
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
