The option of withholding carbon
permits from the European Union market isn’t on the agenda of a
ministerial meeting tomorrow, an EU presidency official said.  “We don’t intend to bring it into discussion tomorrow,”
the official said in Brussels today.  In the part of the meeting devoted to EU emissions-
reduction policies, the meeting will focus on the so-called low-
carbon economy roadmap, or a strategy paper that maps the way to
the bloc’s 2050 carbon targets, according to the official.
Denmark holds the EU rotating presidency in the first half of
this year.  “It’s the analysis of most  member states  that something is
wrong with the carbon market; at least the price is low,” said
the official, who declined to be identified quoting policy.
“Support for the roadmap would also send a signal to markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
