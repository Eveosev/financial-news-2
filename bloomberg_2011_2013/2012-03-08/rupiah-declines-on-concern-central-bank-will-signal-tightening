Indonesia ’s rupiah pared losses
after the central bank kept its  reference rate  unchanged and
signaled it will act to stabilize the currency, amid concern
government plans to reduce fuel subsidies may revive inflation.  Bank Indonesia maintained its benchmark rate at 5.75
percent, according to a statement in Jakarta today. The move was
predicted by 15 out of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
central bank will continue to monitor and  intervene  in the
currency and secondary bond markets to curb volatility in the
rupiah, a note on the central bank’s website said.  “The market expected the rate to be maintained,” Dave Hartono, foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia, said
in Jakarta. “ Bank Indonesia  is trying to get the rupiah back to
the 9,100 to 9,150 range.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,125 per dollar as of 4:10
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency fell as much as 0.7 percent earlier.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of price movements used
to price options, fell 0.25 to an almost two-week low at 9.75
percent.  The government will propose raising fuel costs by 1,500
rupiah ($0.16) per liter when it discusses the revised 2012
state budget with the parliament, Energy Minister Jero Wacik
said March 6. Inflation may reach 6.8 percent this year if the
proposal is approved, Governor Darmin Nasution said today.  “Our baseline view is for Bank Indonesia to keep rates on
hold at 5.75 percent this year,” Mark Tan, Singapore-based
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a note to clients
today.  Consumer prices rose by 3.56 percent in February, the least
since March 2010, official figures show.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.86
percent, the highest since Jan. 18, according to closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
