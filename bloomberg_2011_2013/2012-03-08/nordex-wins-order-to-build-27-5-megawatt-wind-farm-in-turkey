Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind turbine
maker, won an order to supply and build a 27.5-megawatt wind
farm in  Turkey .  Nordex will deliver 11 of its 2.5-megawatt machines to the
Sincik project commissioned by Tektuk Elektrik Group, Hamburg-
based Nordex said in a statement today. The wind farm, to be
built this fall on a mountain ridge near the city of Adiyaman,
is expected to generate 60 gigawatt-hours of power a year.  Nordex installed 970 megawatts of turbines in 2011, an
increase of 9 percent from the previous year, it said on Jan.
26. Its biggest market is  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
