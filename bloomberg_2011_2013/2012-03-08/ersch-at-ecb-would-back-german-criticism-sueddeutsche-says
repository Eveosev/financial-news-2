Yves Mersch is the top candidate to
succeed Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo on the management board of
the  European Central Bank , as he is backed by  Germany , France,
and smaller European nations including Finland, Austria, and the
Netherlands,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, without saying where it
got the information.  Naming Mersch to the post would mean backing for criticism
voiced by Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann that the ECB too
carelessly handed hundreds of billions of euros to ailing
nations while accepting dubious guarantees in return, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
