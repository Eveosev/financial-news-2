Canada’s  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU)  may
need to ask the Romanian government for a permit to divert a
river that flows near its Rosia Montana gold-mine project,
 Mediafax  reported, citing Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely.  Gabriel Resources, which also needs an environment permit
to start works at the mine project, may need the new permit
because of unclear legislation, Borbely told Mediafax.  The country’s Parliament will revise the rules and decide
whether the permit must be approved by the government or by the
local authorities, according to the Bucharest-based news
service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
