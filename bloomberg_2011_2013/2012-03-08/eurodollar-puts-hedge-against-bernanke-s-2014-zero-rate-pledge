Trading in options that profit if
implied yields on Eurodollar futures expiring in two years rise
has increased this month relative to those that gain should they
fall, hedging the risk that  interest rates  won’t stay low
through the end of 2014.  Prices of Eurodollar futures contracts that expire in 2014
rose to this year’s high after the  Federal Reserve  said in
January that the economy may warrant holding the target lending
rate at zero to 0.25 percent at least through late 2014. Prices
have fallen since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained last
week in congressional testimony from signaling more asset
purchases under quantitative easing are imminent.  Volume in the March so-called mid-curve put options, whose
value is based on Eurodollar contracts expiring in 2014, has
been four times that for calls since March 1, according to  CME
Group data  tracked by R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a Chicago-based
futures brokerage. Open interest in puts rose by 200,000, while
that for calls increased by 13,000 through March 6. Puts grant
the right to sell the underlying futures, and calls grant the
right to buy. Open interest is the total number of contracts
that have not been closed, liquidated or delivered.  “The data suggest to us that people are buying puts,”
said Todd Colvin, a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien.
“People that are long in this area of the curve may be hedging
the chance of something happening to trigger a rise in rates.
There has also been some normalization in rates since January,
when the Fed pledged to keep rates low through 2014.”  Eurodollar Contract  The March 2014 Eurodollar contract traded at 99.225
yesterday, for an implied yield of 0.775 percent. That’s up
0.180 percentage point from an implied yield of 0.605 percent on
Feb. 2, when the contract reached the year’s high of 99.395. The
implied yield was 0.840 percent on Jan. 24, the day before the
 Federal Open Market Committee  extended its pledge to keep
borrowing costs low.  The implied yield on Eurodollar futures, moving in the
opposite direction of price, reflects expectations for the
three-month dollar London interbank offered rate and changes in
the Fed’s monetary policy. A put option increases in value if
implied yields of the underlying futures rise, while a call
option’s value would decline.  Bernanke said following the January policy meeting that the
central bank was considering another set of purchases after
buying $2.3 trillion of Treasury and mortgage-related bonds from
2008 to 2011 to stimulate the economy. He affirmed last week in
congressional testimony that interest rates are likely to stay
low at least through late 2014 without offering any indication
that further monetary easing was likely.  Eurodollars are dollars held in commercial banks outside
the U.S. A futures contract is an agreement to sell or buy a
specific amount of a commodity or security at a specific price
and time.  The  London interbank offered rate , or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was fixed yesterday at 0.4746 percent, down
from a high this year of 0.5825 percent on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
