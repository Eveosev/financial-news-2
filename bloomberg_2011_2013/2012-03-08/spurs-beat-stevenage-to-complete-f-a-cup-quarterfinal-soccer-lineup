Jermain Defoe  scored twice as
Tottenham came from behind to beat Stevenage 3-1 and secure the
last berth in the quarterfinals of English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  Joel Byrom’s fourth-minute penalty kick put Stevenage,
which plays in third-tier League One, ahead in the fifth-round
replay at White Hart Lane in London last night. Defoe tied it in
the 26th minute and added his second after Emmanuel Adebayor put
Spurs ahead from the penalty spot in the 55th minute.  Tottenham, which won the last of its eight titles in
 England ’s premier cup competition in 1991, will host Bolton
Wanderers in the final eight on March 17.  Championship team Leicester is the only non-Premier League
team in the quarterfinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
