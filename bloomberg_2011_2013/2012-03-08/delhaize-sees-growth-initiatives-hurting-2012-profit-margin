Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of the
U.S. Food Lion supermarkets, reported a 48 percent drop in
 fourth-quarter profit  and said its 2012 underlying profit margin
will be hurt by growth initiatives, particularly in the U.S.  Net earnings in the first quarter will be reduced by about
125 million euros ($165 million) as Delhaize executes the
planned closure of unprofitable stores, the Brussels-based
company said today in a statement. Pierre Bouchut will join
Delhaize on March 19 as chief financial officer, replacing
Stefan Descheemaeker, who took over as head of Delhaize Europe
in January.  Delhaize is closing 146 stores and plans to open 200 to 230
new stores and remodel about 200 others this year. The company
said it will exceed its target of 500 million euros in annual
gross savings in selling, general and administrative expenses
and cost of goods sold by the end of 2012.  “The group’s senior team has been strengthened by
impressive additions, but the margin outlook for 2012 looks to
be guided down,”  James Grzinic , an analyst at Jefferies
International, said in a note to investors. “We expect major
consensus downgrades.”  Bouchut, 56, who was most recently executive director for
growth markets at Carrefour SA, joined the French retailer as
chief financial officer in 2009. He has also held CFO posts at
 France ’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Schneider Electric SA.  Delhaize said its fourth-quarter net income fell to 99
million euros from 190 million euros a year earlier. Analysts
had projected net of 79.3 million euros, the average of three
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company will propose raising its gross dividend by 2.3
percent to 1.76 euros a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
