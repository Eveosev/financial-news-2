Cotton futures fell for the sixth
time in seven sessions after supply concerns eased as  India  is
set to reconsider a ban on shipments.  Orange juice  gained.  India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday asked a
group of ministers to “urgently” review the ban after industry
groups said the curbs may harm farmers. The fiber surged 4.5
percent on March 5, the most in nine months, after the country
halted shipments to ensure domestic supply. India is the world’s
largest exporter after the U.S.  “There was an idea India was not going to export, but now
we don’t know for sure,”  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf &
Sid Love Consulting Services in  Overland Park , Kansas, said in a
telephone interview.  Cotton for May delivery fell 0.6 percent to close at 89.56
cents a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  The fiber has tumbled 59 percent since reaching a record
$2.197 on March 7, 2011, as slowing global economic growth cut
demand, especially in China, the biggest consumer.  The U.S. will probably produce a bigger crop in the season
starting in August as farmers harvest more acres this year, Love
said. “It’s dangerous to bet on two bad years back to back,”
he said.  U.S. output declined 13 percent in the harvest ended in
late 2011 from a year earlier as drought hurt crops in Texas,
the nation’s biggest grower.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery advanced 0.7 percent
to $1.8975 a pound on ICE. The commodity has climbed 12 percent
this year, touching a record $2.2695 on Jan. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
