The Greek government and  Siemens AG (SIE) 
reached a settlement related to alleged past corrupt practices
by the company.  The settlement includes a commitment from the German
company to invest 100 million euros ($133 million) in operations
in Greece this year, the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  said in
an e-mail today.  Siemens will also look at building a new production plant
in Greece at an estimated cost of 60 million euros, which would
create about 700 jobs, the ministry said.  Greeceâ€™s cabinet unanimously approved the deal and
parliament must give final approval, according to the statement.  A parliamentary committee published a 2,000-page report in
January 2011 alleging that Siemens paid millions of euros in
bribes to the then-management of  Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  for contracts signed before 2004, as well as to
politicians during the governments of Constantinos Simitis, who
was prime minister from 1996 until March 2004, and his successor
Konstantinos Karamanlis, who was in office until October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
