U.K. stocks  advanced for a second
day as optimism mounted that private creditors will approve a
Greek debt swap and as the Bank of England maintained its key
 interest rate  and bond-purchase target.  William Morrison Supermarkets Plc rose after reporting an
increase in full-year profit.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  jumped 3.6
percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index gained 68.32, or 1.2 percent, to
5,859.73 at the close in  London . Stocks climbed 0.4 percent
yesterday after a report showed hiring in U.S. companies
accelerated in February. The gauge has rallied 5.2 percent this
year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index increased 1.2 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 2.5 percent.  “ Greece  is likely to force the hand of those that don’t
want to participate in the bond swap and it looks like it will
go through one way or another,” said  Manoj Ladwa , a senior
trader at ETX Capital in London.  Investors with about 60 percent of the Greek bonds eligible
for the nation’s debt swap have so far indicated they’ll
participate, putting the country on the verge of the biggest
sovereign restructuring in history. The offer, which ends at 10
p.m. Athens time today, aims to reduce the 206 billion euros of
privately held Greek debt by 53.5 percent.  Monetary Policy  The  Bank of England  today held its key rate at 0.5 percent
and maintained its commitment to buy an additional 50 billion
pounds ($79 billion) of bonds by May after lifting its target
for asset purchases to 325 billion pounds last month, as
forecast by economists.  European Central Bank policy makers kept the benchmark rate
at a record low of 1 percent today, meeting economists’
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
said inflation will probably breach the bank’s 2 percent limit
this year even as the economy stalls.  The ECB’s latest economic projections show inflation
averaging 2.4 percent in 2012, up from a December forecast of 2
percent. The euro-area economy may contract 0.1 percent,
compared with the previous forecast for 0.3 percent growth.  German industrial output rose 1.6 percent in January,
rebounding from a December drop. Economists forecast an increase
of 1.1 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Morrison gained 1.7 percent to 289.7 pence. The smallest of
the U.K.’s four main grocers reported an 8 percent gain in full-
year profit -- better than analysts estimated --and said it
plans to open more  convenience stores  and expand a revamped
fresh-food concept.  Technology for iPad  ARM Holdings , whose chip designs are used in Apple Inc.’s
iPad, added 3.6 percent to 569 pence. Morgan Stanley raised the
stock to “overweight” from “equalweight.” Apple unveiled a
new version of the iPad yesterday.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc jumped 8.4 percent to
652 pence.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  added 1.6 percent to 356.8 pence. Britain’s
second-biggest insurer by market value reported full-year profit
that beat analysts’ estimates as earnings in the U.K. outweighed
slower growth in  Europe .  GlobeOp Financial Services SA surged 6 percent to 485.25
pence. SS&C Technologies Inc. said it made an improved offer of
485 pence a share in cash for the company. The directors of
GlobeOp said they would be willing to recommend an offer by SS&C
at that level, SS&C said today.  Mining Companies  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  rose 1.8 percent to 1,147 pence. The company
said its $500 million purchase of the Sukunka coking coal
deposit in British Columbia from Talisman Energy Inc. will
“significantly increase” its holdings of hard coking coal,
while “unlocking synergies” with neighboring assets in the
Peace River coalfield.  A gauge of London-listed mining companies advanced 1.9
percent as most metal prices rose.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rose 1.5
percent to 1,988.5 pence. Rio Tinto Group added 2.7 percent to
3,460 pence.  Old Mutual Plc, the third-largest U.K. insurer, rose 2.9
percent to 162.6 pence. The company said Swedish and Danish
regulators have approved the 2.1 billion-pound sale of its
Nordic unit to Skandia Liv.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the oil and gas engineering company, gained
5.3 percent to 1,675 pence after the stock was upgraded to
“overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan & Chase Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
