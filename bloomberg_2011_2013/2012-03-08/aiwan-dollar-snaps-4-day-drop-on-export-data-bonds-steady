Taiwan’s dollar strengthened for the
first time in five days on optimism demand for the island’s
exports will pick up as the global economy recovers.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  The local dollar rebounded from a one-week low after
official data yesterday showed  exports  rose 10.3 percent last
month from a year earlier after a 16.8 percent slump in January.
The MSCI  Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  Index of shares snapped a three-day
decline as data showed  Japan ’s economy shrank less than the
government’s initial estimate and more investors agreed to a
Greek debt swap.  “There are more signs that a solution to Greece’s problems
is in sight,” said George Pu, a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. “There’s room for yields to
go up if the debt crisis continues to be resolved.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.527 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.590 earlier, the weakest level since Feb. 29. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of price swings used to price
options, dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to
4.62 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was little changed at 1.256 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market showed. The  overnight money-market rate  was
steady at 0.399 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
