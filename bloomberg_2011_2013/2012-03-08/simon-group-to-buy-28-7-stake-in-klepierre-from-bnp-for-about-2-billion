Simon Property Group (SPG)  said it’s
buying  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ’s 28.7 percent stake in French real estate
company  Klepierre (LI)  for about $2 billion.  Simon Group said it has no plans to buy more Klepierre
shares.  For BNP, the move marks an effort to sell assets as it
seeks to counter Europe’s more than two-year-old debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
