BKW SA (BKW) , the operator of a nuclear
plant in Muehleberg,  Switzerland , dropped the most in three
months in Zurich trading after a court ordered the company to
shut the station next year.  The shares fell as much as 9 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since they began trading Dec. 13, and were down 8
percent to 33.35 Swiss francs at 10:48 a.m. Zurich time.  BKW FMB
Energie AG (BKWN) , the parent, has fallen 58 percent in 12 months.  Switzerland, where about 40 percent of power is nuclear,
has debated the industry’s future since a March 11 earthquake
and tsunami triggered partial meltdowns at  Japan ’s Fukushima
plant. Muehleberg is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Basel,
the site of a 1356 quake thought to be the biggest in recorded
European history. The plant has been the site of protests
seeking its closure, which the ruling set for next summer.  “The condition of the core shroud, the inconclusive
estimations of earthquake safety and the absence of cooling
independent of the River Aare do not allow for the operation of
Muehleberg beyond mid-2013,” the Federal Administrative Court
said in a statement.  On May 25, 2011 the government said it would phase out
atomic energy by 2034, effectively ending BKW FMB’s joint bid
with Axpo Holding AG to build a replacement for Muehleberg,
which went online in 1972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
