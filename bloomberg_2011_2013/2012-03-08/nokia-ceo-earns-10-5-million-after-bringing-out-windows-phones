Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Elop received pay and options valued at 7.94 million
euros ($10.5 million) in 2011 as he worked on a turnaround plan
and brought out the company’s first Windows Phones.  Elop got 1.02 million euros in base salary and 473,070
euros as a bonus for 2011. His pay also included deferred
compensation in the form of stock awards and options and payment
of 2.08 million euros to make up for lost salary from his
previous employer,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , Nokia said in its 20-F
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Elop, 48, was appointed in September 2010 to turn around
the company’s struggling smartphone business. After a five-month
asset review, he announced a turnaround strategy based on
cooperation with Microsoft to build Windows Phone handsets, as
well as investments to bring more smartphone capabilities to the
Espoo, Finland-based company’s low-end phones. He has unveiled
four Lumia Windows Phone handsets since October as sales of
Nokia’s earlier Symbian smartphones plummeted.  The CEO can get an additional bonus of as many as 750,000
shares if the company’s total shareholder return is competitive
with peers and if the share price reaches at least 9 euros by
the end of 2012, according to the filing.  Nokia hasn’t traded at that price since May 2010. The
shares fell 1.4 percent to 3.78 euros at 4:30 p.m. in Helsinki.  Chairman  Jorma Ollila  received 440,000 euros in 2011 for
his last full year at Nokia. Risto Siilasmaa, the founder and
chairman of  F-Secure Oyj (FSC1V) , has been nominated to lead the board
after Ollila, who built Nokia into the world’s largest mobile
phone maker as chief executive officer, retires in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
