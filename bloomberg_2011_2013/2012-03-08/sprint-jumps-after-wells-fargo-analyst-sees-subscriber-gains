Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless operator, surged to its highest value
since December, after a Wells Fargo Securities analyst said it
had taken advantage of recent mobile data moves at  AT&T (T)  Inc. and
struggles at  T-Mobile USA  to gain their subscribers.  Sprint rose 5.8 percent to $2.57 at 2:04 p.m. in New York,
its highest value since Dec. 6, after earlier rising as much as
8.6 percent.  While Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint is still expected
to lose subscribers in the seasonally-weak first quarter, the
carrier is attracting users from AT&T and T-Mobile, Jennifer Fritzsche, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a note
today. Subscribers like Sprint’s unlimited data plans -- which
no other major U.S. carrier offers -- and its selection of
handsets including the  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhone, which T-Mobile USA
lacks, she said.  Sprint, which serves more than 55 million customers, has
benefited from an outcry among AT&T users, some of whom have
complained about AT&T’s recent price increase on smartphone data
plans for new subscribers, and its  move  to set caps on heavy
users of wireless data. Getting the iPhone last year has also
helped Sprint gain users from T-Mobile, which also targets
price-conscious users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
