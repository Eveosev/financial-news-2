European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said there are “certain fragilities” in Ireland
that officials must tackle as the country tries to boost its
economy and deal with bank debts.  “Ireland is probably one of the problem countries that
made most progress under conditions that were certainly very
harsh,” Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  today.
“We also are aware that there are certain fragilities that need
to be taken care of.”  Asked whether the issue of the former  Anglo Irish Bank
Corp. (ANGL) ’s promissory notes was on the agenda at today’s Governing
Council meeting, he said “we didn’t discuss it yet, it is under
study.” Ireland is seeking European assistance to refinance
about 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of notes that it used to
bail out the Dublin-based bank.  Ireland may be allowed to delay a 3.1 billion-euro cash
payment to Anglo Irish this month as it works on a longer-term
plan to cut the cost of bailing out the nation’s financial
system, two people with direct knowledge of the plans said this
week. The International Monetary Fund’s Mission Chief to
Ireland, Craig Beaumont, said last week that a “lot of
consensus” has emerged on tackling the rescue cost for the
bank, declining to comment on the March payment.  Draghi also said he is “confident” the Irish public will
pass a planned referendum on the European fiscal compact. Asked
what the consequences of a rejection could mean for Ireland,
Draghi said “I don’t even want to think about” it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
