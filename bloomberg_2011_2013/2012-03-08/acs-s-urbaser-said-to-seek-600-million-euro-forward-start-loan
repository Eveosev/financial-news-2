Urbaser SA, the waste-management
unit of  Spain ’s largest builder, is seeking a 600 million-euro
($796 million) forward-start loan to extend a facility maturing
in May by 2 1/2 years, according to two people with knowledge of
the deal.  The subsidiary of  Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA  is offering to pay interest at 375 basis points more than the
 euro interbank offered rate  for the self-arranged  term loan ,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
negotiations are private.  The debt originally totaled 750 million euros when signed
in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Madrid-based
Urbaser hired 13 banks as bookrunners, with Societe Generale SA
acting as agent, the data show.  A Madrid-based spokesman for Urbaser, who didn’t wished to
be identified citing company policy, declined to comment.  Fellow Spanish borrower  Abengoa SA (ABG) , which develops solar
 power plants , has offered to pay the same rate of interest to
extend 1.8 billion euros of loans by three years, two people
with direct knowledge of the deal said.  Forward-start loans, created to provide liquidity to cash-
strapped borrowers during the credit crisis, lock in financing
before debt comes due in exchange for higher fees and  interest
rates . At their peak in 2009, European issuers had $42 billion
of forward-starts outstanding, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
