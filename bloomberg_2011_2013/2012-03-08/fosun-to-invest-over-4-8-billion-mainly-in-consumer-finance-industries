Fosun International Ltd. (656) , a Chinese
company that last year took a stake in  Greece ’s Folli Follie
Group, expects 2012 investments to surpass the as much as 30
billion yuan ($4.8 billion) it spent in 2011, its chairman said.  “We will mainly invest in consumer and financial services
sectors,” said Fosun Chairman  Guo Guangchang , adding that the
company is looking at opportunities in clothing, tourism and the
cultural industries both in China and abroad.  Shanghai-based Fosun, which also has stake in mining,
steel, property and drugs, is also interested in buying into a
fast-food restaurant chain in China, Guo said yesterday in an
interview in Beijing, where he’s attending the annual meetings
of the National People’s Congress, or  China ’s legislature.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  set a 2012 economic growth target of 7.5
percent on March 5, lower than an 8 percent goal in place since
2005. He pledged to adjust taxes as the nation seeks to end the
economy’s reliance on investment and exports in favor of
boosting domestic consumption.  “Our principle is to connect China and the rest of the
world. When we make foray into foreign markets, we would like to
add China elements,” said Guo, who ranked 27th on Forbes
Magazine’s 2011 China rich list with an estimated wealth of 17.5
billion yuan ($2.8 billion).  Fosun is investing in the consumer industry as it seeks to
diversify its business. The company, which also has a stake in
French resort operator  Club Mediterranee SA (CU) , paid 84.6 million
euros ($112 million) for 9.5 percent of Folli Follie, the Greek
operator of Hellenic Duty Free Shops and maker of jewelry and
handbags.  China Luxury Market  The  luxury goods  purchases in China and by Chinese
consumers reached a total of 212 billion yuan in 2010, Bain &
Co. said in December. The Greater China region is the world’s
third-largest market for luxury goods, according to the
consulting firm.  Demand for luxury goods in China has surged as a result of
growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. The average
disposable income of urban households increased 14 percent to
about 21,810 yuan in 2011, data from the National Bureau of
Statistics showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
