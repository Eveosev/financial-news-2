The European Commission may delay
rules for shareholders and bond owners on losses as a result of
the rescue of banks requiring bailouts to prevent turmoil on
financial markets, Financial Times Deutschland reported.  The European Union could buy time by seeking a response to
the proposals, which could take months, the newspaper said in an
e-mailed summary of an article to be published tomorrow, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
