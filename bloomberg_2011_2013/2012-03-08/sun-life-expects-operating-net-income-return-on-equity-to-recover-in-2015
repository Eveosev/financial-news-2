Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest insurer, expects operating income to rise to
C$2 billion ($2.02 billion) by 2015 while “maintaining a strong
capital and dividend position.”  Sun Life also expects to have an operating return on equity
of 12 percent to 13 percent, the Toronto-based insurer said
today in documents at its annual investor day.  Operating income was $C104 million in 2011, down from
C$1.48 billion the year before. Operating return on equity
declined to 0.8 percent in 2011 from 10.7 percent. Results last
year were hindered by costs for variable-annuity and segregated-
fund contracts, including C$635 million in the fourth quarter.  Sun Life  gained  1.6 percent to C$21.01 at 1:38 p.m. in
Toronto. It has declined about 32 percent in the last year amid
higher costs tied to interest-rate volatility and investor
concern that the insurer will cut its dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
