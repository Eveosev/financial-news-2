Opposition to establishing a
 Guggenheim Foundation  museum in Helsinki has more than doubled
from a year earlier, according to a poll by Helsingin Sanomat.  The museum is opposed by 75 percent of citizens of the
capital city region, compared with 30 percent in February 2011,
the newspaper said, citing a poll by TNS Gallup Oy. Support for
the museum fell to 19 percent from 47 percent.  The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
