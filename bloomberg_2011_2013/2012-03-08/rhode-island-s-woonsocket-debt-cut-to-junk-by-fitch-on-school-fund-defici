Woonsocket (1082MF) ,  Rhode Island , had $117.8
million of general-obligation bonds cut three steps to below
investment grade, or “junk,” by  Fitch Ratings .  An estimated $7.3 million deficit, about 7.6 percent of the
city’s general fund, is projected for the fiscal 2012 school
budget, following a deficit in the previous year. That reflects
“deficiencies in internal fiscal controls,” Fitch said today
in a statement. The company lowered Woonsocket’s rating to BB-,
down from BBB-, the lowest investment grade.  “Fitch has concerns about the city’s and school
department’s ability to implement changes that will meaningfully
improve financial stability given that previous efforts have not
always yielded intended results,” according to the statement.
The company maintains a negative outlook on the credit.  The 2012 deficit “surfaced precipitously” and is mostly
related to employment spending, according to Fitch. The city’s
alternatives to close the gap include a supplemental property
tax, a $3.2 million tax-anticipation note sale and spending cuts
such as payroll reductions, the company said.  About 22 percent of Woonsocket’s 41,200 residents live in
poverty,  U.S. Census Bureau  figures show. The city is 14 miles
(23 kilometers) north of Providence, the state capital.  Nearby  Central Falls (1058MF)  entered bankruptcy in August, citing
employee expenses it couldn’t afford.  To contact the reporter on this story:
