Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of the
Food Lion supermarkets, fell to the lowest value in more than
three years in Brussels after saying margins will shrink again
this year on U.S. price cuts and Bottom Dollar Food store
openings.  Delhaize declined as much as 6.1 percent to 38.76 euros,
the lowest price since October 2008, and  traded  2.37 euros lower
at 38.90 euros by 9:37 a.m. The shares have lost 32 percent in
the past 12 months.  “A hard landing in the U.S. due to a tactical error,”
Pascale Weber, an analyst at KBC Securities in Brussels, wrote
in an investor note. “Delhaize America decided to pass on cost
inflation in the fourth quarter. This led to a collapse in
volumes.” Weber lowered her price estimate for the shares by 18
percent to 45 euros.  Delhaize is seeking to turn around its U.S. business after
the Food Lion stores in the southeast have lost ground to rivals
including  Ruddick Corp. (RDK) ’s Harris Teeter, Publix Super Markets
Inc. and  Kroger Co. (KR)  in recent years. The Brussels-based grocer
will close about 126 unprofitable stores, reposition an
additional 600 to 700 Food Lion supermarkets following a
successful turnaround in Raleigh,  North Carolina , and plans an
expansion into  Pennsylvania  with Bottom Dollar Food outlets.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.4 percent
in the final three months, resuming a decline that previously
lasted nine quarters through March 2011. Operating profit before
currency swings fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, led by a
20 percent drop in the U.S. and Delhaize said its group margin
will continue to be impacted by price reductions in the U.S. and
accelerated openings of Bottom Dollar Food stores. Delhaize’s
operating  margin  contracted 56 basis points to 4.43 percent last
year, the lowest in eight years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
