Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS (TUPRS) ,  Turkey ’s sole refiner, reported a five-fold increase in
profit in the fourth quarter of last year, beating estimates, as
its refining margins exceeded Mediterranean benchmarks.  Net income jumped to 322.6 million liras ($182 million)
from 64.8 million liras in the fourth quarter of 2010,
calculated by subtracting full-year earnings Tupras reported to
the Istanbul Stock Exchange today from nine-month profits
announced earlier. The company was expected to earn 305.8
million liras, according to the average of 12 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tupras’s sales were 11.1 billion liras in the fourth
quarter, up from 7.4 billion liras a year ago, it said. The
increase was due to a weaker lira and the company’s refining
margin of $4.42 a barrel, more than an average Mediterranean
margin of $1.41 in the fourth quarter, Kocaeli-based Tupras said
in an e-mailed statement after the earnings were released.  “An increased capacity utilization ratio, cost saving and
optimization programs, rising oil prices and the impact of a
weaker lira helped Tupras’s refining margin exceed the
Mediterranean average,” the company said.  2011 Results  Tupras’s full-year sales grew 58 percent to 41.4 billion
liras in 2011, the company said. Profit climbed to 1.24 billion
liras last year from 737.3 million in 2010.  Tupras, owned by  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , raised sales volume 6.7
percent to 23.9 million metric tons in 2011 over the previous
year, it said on Feb. 14.  Tupras shares rose a fourth day, gaining 0.7 percent to
43.9 liras at 12:30 p.m. in Istanbul, when the market closed for
a midday break. The main share index advanced 1.5 percent in the
morning session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
