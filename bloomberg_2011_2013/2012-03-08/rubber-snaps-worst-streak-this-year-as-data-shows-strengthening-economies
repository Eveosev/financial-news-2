Rubber snapped the worst losing run
this year, gaining for the first time in four days, on
speculation that demand for the raw material used in tires will
improve as economies strengthen.  August-delivery gained as much as 1.5 percent to 329.5 yen
a kilogram ($4,057 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange,
and settled at 327.4 yen. Futures reached 320.4 yen yesterday,
the lowest level since Feb. 20.  U.S. employers boosted hiring, according to data, while
more investors joined a Greek debt swap, increasing prospects
for the country’s second bailout. Oil and Asian stocks climbed
after data showed that  Japan ’s economy shrank less than the
government initially estimated.  Concerns that Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis may worsen
have eased, while the yen weakened against the dollar, improving
investors’ appetite for yen-denominated contracts, said Gu Jiong,
an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  shrank an annualized 0.7
percent in the three months to Dec. 31, the Cabinet Office said
in Tokyo, compared with a preliminary estimate of a 2.3 percent
contraction. The median forecast of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 0.6 percent contraction.  “The wintering season remains a positive factor, boosting
rubber prices,” said Chaiwat Muenmee, analyst at Bangkok-based
commodity broker DS Futures Co. Trees shed leaves, producing
less latex during the low season.  Thailand , the largest producer,
may supply an average of 200,000 tons a month during March and
April, compared with around 383,000 tons in January, according
to the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries.  The Thai cash price fell 0.8 percent to 121.75 baht ($3.97)
a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand. May-delivery rubber in  Shanghai  dropped 0.3 percent to
28,005 yuan ($4,434) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
