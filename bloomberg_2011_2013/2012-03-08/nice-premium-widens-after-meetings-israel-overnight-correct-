of analytical telecommunications software, climbed in  New York 
to widen the premium over its Tel Aviv shares to the  biggest in
two months  after company officials met with investors in  Europe .  Nice officials repeated sales guidance from February,
according to Jamia Jasper, president of AmerIsrael Capital
Management LLC in New York and an adviser to the American
Israeli Shared Value Fund. Dafna Gruber, Nice’s chief financial
officer, said on a Feb. 15 conference call that 2012 revenue
would total between $930 million and $950 million. Sales totaled
$793.8 million in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The meetings were held in Dublin this week, said Erik
Snider, a spokesman for Nice in  Tel Aviv , who declined to
provide further details.  Shares of Nice advanced 2.3 percent to $35.34 yesterday in
New York to trade 1.42 percent over its Israeli stock, the most
since Jan 5. Nice rose 0.7 percent to 132.50 shekels in Tel
Aviv, or the equivalent of $34.84.  “The guidance was essentially a reiteration of prior
guidance which is always good,” said Jasper, who didn’t attend
the meetings and said she learned of the discussion from an
Oppenheimer & Co. report. “Investors were probably relieved to
hear that the company is making progress with sales at its
recently acquired Actimize subsidiary.”  Web Attacks  Nice is increasing sales of its Internet security
applications as companies from Sony Corp. to Citigroup have been
targeted in web attacks in the past year. Oppenheimer analyst
Shaul Eyal reiterated on March 6 a 12-month price target of $45
price on the shares, which have added 2.6 percent this year,
after slipping 1.3 percent in 2011.  “They’ve become an industry leader in developing a
technology that seems very useful in fighting terrorism,”
Jasper said in a phone interview yesterday. “This is a company
with no debt and trading at a very favorable valuation.”  Nice trades at 14.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bridgewater, New
Jersey-based  Synchronoss Technologies Inc. (SNCR) , which develops e-
commerce transaction technologies, trades at 47.8 times
estimated earnings.  Allot Jumps  The  Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest U.S.-traded
Israeli companies gained 0.6 percent to 83.87 yesterday as 17
stocks on the gauge advanced.  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , an
Israeli networking equipment manufacturer, jumped the most in
three weeks, adding 3.1 percent to $17.90.  SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , an Airport City-based
manufacturer of homemade soda machines, fell 0.4 percent to
$34.90, extending its decline to 27 percent since reporting a
6.2 percent increase in fourth-quarter  net income  on Feb. 29
that missed analyst estimates. The company also said global soda
maker unit sales rose 8 percent to 767,000 in the fourth
quarter, after increasing 60 percent in the third.  SodaStream’s Yonah Lloyd, executive director of corporate
development and communication, said clients including  Bed Bath &
Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  made holiday-season purchases in the third quarter
of 2011.  SodaStream ‘Misperception’  “There may be a misperception regarding our unit sales
numbers,” Lloyd said in a phone interview from Tel Aviv.
“Growth was strong, 45 percent for the quarter despite the fact
that key national accounts who bought heavily in the fourth
quarter in 2010 made the bulk of their purchases in the third
quarter of 2011.”  Lloyd said sales would increase 28 percent this year.
SodaStream revenue grew 39 percent in 2011 and 53 percent in
2010.  Israel ’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose 0.3 percent to 1,079.59
yesterday. Israeli markets will be closed today for the Jewish
Purim holiday.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
 Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after  China .
The nation is also home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S.  ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW) , a Petach Tikva, Israel-
based maker of order-tracking programs, advanced 3.3 percent to
$11.49 in New York, one cent short of an all-time high. The
company had its initial public offering in New York in June
2000.  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  dropped 3.1 percent to $12.30 as
Israel’s largest mobile-phone company said yesterday that
fourth-quarter net income fell to 76 million shekels from 319
million shekels a year earlier. The company’s shares have fallen
27 percent this year as Israel issues licenses to new mobile-
phone operators in a bid to bolster competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
