Japan ’s lower house of parliament
passed Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s 90.3 trillion yen ($1.1
trillion) budget for the year beginning April 1 that increases
the government’s dependence on bond sales to fund spending.  The legislation passed through the ruling  Democratic Party 
of Japan-dominated chamber and now goes to the opposition-
controlled upper house.  Under the terms of the bill, the government will sell 44.2
trillion of new bonds to pay for outlays, raising the dependence
on debt to an unprecedented 49 percent. Overall spending will
shrink for the first time in six years as Noda’s administration
delayed pension fund appropriations and used supplementary
expenditures to pay for rebuilding after last year’s record
earthquake and subsequent nuclear disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
