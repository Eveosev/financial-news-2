Yu Darvish struck out three batters
in two scoreless innings in his first spring training start for
the  Texas Rangers , who paid a record $51.7 million transfer fee
to his Japanese club before signing him to a six-year contract.  Darvish, 25, allowed two hits, both doubles, in yesterday’s
6-2 exhibition win in Peoria, Arizona, against the San Diego
Padres. He threw 36 pitches, 26 of which were strikes. It was
his first stint against an opposing Major League Baseball team -
- he threw an inning last week in an intrasquad game.  “It’s still early,” Darvish told reporters. “I’m just
starting to face these major league hitters and it’s early in
the spring for those hitters as well. It was nice to face those
guys.”  The next spring training start for Darvish, who went 93-38
with a 1.99 earned run average in seven seasons with the
Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, is expected to be March 13 against
the  Cleveland Indians .  To contact the reporter on this story:
