Standard Bank Group Ltd (SBK) .,  Africa ’s
largest lender, said full-year profit rose 22 percent after the
company cut costs and increased lending.  Net income climbed to 13.2 billion rand ($1.7 billion) from
10.8 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender
said in a statement today. The dividend increased 10 percent to
4.25 rand, while earnings per share excluding one-time items
grew 21 percent to 8.60 rand, beating the 8.45 rand median
 estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Its a credit to Standard Bank that they’re the only bank
that has acted contra-cyclically and that they’ve continued
lending at this point in the cycle at better margins and better
security values,” said Neville Chester, a  fund manager  at Cape
Town-based  Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML)  It’s a “good set of
results across the board.”  Standard Bank two years ago cut about 1,600 jobs to reduce
costs and reversed its strategy of expanding in  emerging markets 
outside Africa to focus on operations in 17 of the continent’s
countries. Standard Bank’s South African retail business
increased assets by 6 percent last year, which it said was above
the industry norm, at average  interest rates  11 basis points
above the benchmark consumer lending rate compared with 20 basis
points below a year earlier, it said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Earnings were helped by lower impairments on bad loans,
with Standard Bank’s credit-loss ratio improving to 0.87 percent
compared with 1.04 percent a year earlier, the company said.  “We are anticipating subdued revenue growth in 2012, but
intend to maintain focus on costs and to drive further
improvement in our return on equity,” the lender said. “While
an acquisition would make sense in markets where we are not yet
at scale, we will primarily concentrate on continuing to grow
our businesses organically.”  Standard Bank  gained 0.8 percent to 108.90 rand at the
close in Johannesburg, its biggest jump since Feb. 23, giving
the company a market value of 173 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
