A federal judge in  Dallas  said he
would rule soon on  Vitro SAB (VITRO) ’s request to block lawsuits in the
U.S. tied to the Mexican bankruptcy case filed by the country’s
largest glassmaker.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale heard arguments today on
whether to issue a temporary restraining order sought by Vitro
to halt U.S. legal action by holders of its defaulted bonds.  “It’ll be my intention to get you all a ruling in the next
couple of days,” Hale told lawyers after a three-hour hearing.  Vitro, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, argues that
bondholder suits should be stopped until Hale decides the larger
issue of whether to recognize and enforce the Mexican bankruptcy
case in the U.S. The restructuring was approved by a Mexican
court last month.  The restructuring is opposed by holders of $1.2 billion of
defaulted bonds, who say the inclusion of $1.9 billion of debt
from Vitro subsidiaries has allowed Vitro to dictate terms
without relinquishing control of the company or its units.  Creditors have presented cases in  Texas ,  New York  and
Michigan and have argued that Vitro’s dollar bonds are subject
to U.S. law.  The case is  Vitro SAB de CV (VITROA)  v. ACP Master Ltd. (In re Vitro
SAB de CV), 12-03027,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Northern District
of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
