Bon-Ton Stores Inc. (BONT) , the department
store chain that lost 73 percent of its market value last year,
had the biggest two-day gain in its history as the retailer said
it may generate as much as $70 million in cash this year.  Bon-Ton  rose  18 percent to $8.24 at the close of New York
trading, capping a 57 percent run in the past two days, the best
performance since its initial public offering in 1991. The stock
has more than tripled since dipping to a $2.71 close on Jan. 6.  The company, operator of the Bon-Ton, Bergnerâ€™s and Carson
Pirie Scott department stores, is seeking to lure customers with
trendier clothes, and saw positive results from a pilot program
tested in 2011, Chief Executive Officer Brendan Hoffman said in
an earnings statement yesterday. Hoffman, the former head of
Lord & Taylor LLC, was hired as CEO of York, Pennsylvania-based
Bon-Ton this year.  Bon-Ton operates 272 department stores in the U.S.
Northeast, Midwest and Great Plains, according to the statement.
Net income in the fourth quarter ended in January fell to $78.2
million, or $4 a share, from $85 million, or $4.41, a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
