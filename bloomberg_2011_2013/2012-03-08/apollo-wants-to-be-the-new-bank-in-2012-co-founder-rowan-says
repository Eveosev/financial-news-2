Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , the
private equity firm that went public last year, will focus less
on traditional buyouts and more on its credit investment
business in 2012, its co-founder said.  “Let’s be the new bank,” Marc Rowan, a senior managing
director, said today at the Citibank Financial Services
Conference in New York. “Let’s simply fill the holes created by
the destruction of the financial system. Let’s be the new
securitization market. Let’s not do traditional buyouts.”  Rowan, who co-founded Apollo with  Joshua Harris  in 1990,
said the firm can provide bank loans in the U.S. producing 6
percent to 8 percent returns and in  Europe  producing 7 percent
to 10 percent returns.  “That is a great investment for a pension fund,” Rowan
said. “And if they want leverage, we can double that or we can
triple that.”  Apollo agreed in December to buy Stone Tower Capital LLC,
adding $17 billion in credit assets and making  capital markets 
its biggest business unit, with about $39 billion under
management. Earnings from credit investments and real estate
purchases tend to deliver more predictable profits than private
equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
