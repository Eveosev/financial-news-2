Joaquin Almunia , the European
Union’s chief antitrust regulator, said concessions offered by
 Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) , the financial news and information
provider, in exchange for the EU closing an antitrust probe were
not sufficient.  The European Commission had sought views on Thomson
Reuters’ proposals in a so-called market test, Almunia said in
the text of a speech today in Copenhagen. The plans had proved
unsuccessful in allaying the EU’s competition concerns, he said.  “We have unsuccessfully market tested a solution offered
by Thomson Reuters to facilitate switching,” Almunia said. “We
have now reached a critical stage in this investigation. If no
effective solution can be agreed upon, then we will have to draw
the adequate conclusions.”  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
New York-based  Thomson Reuters  in selling financial and legal
information and trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
