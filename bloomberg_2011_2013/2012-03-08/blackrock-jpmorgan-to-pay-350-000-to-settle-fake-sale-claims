(Corrects settlement total in headline.)  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  will pay a total of $390,000 to settle allegations that the
companies executed fictitious trades on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  said.  BlackRock agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve claims that an
employee designed a strategy that put him on both the buy and
sell sides of trades in 10-year U.S. Treasury futures spreads on
two dates in 2010, the CFTC said in an order released today. In
the second trade, on May 25, 2010, the BlackRock employee
initiated a buy order for 11,642 10-year spreads a minute after
placing a sell order of the same size with a futures broker.  JPMorgan agreed to pay $140,000 over claims that an
employee placed a customer’s order to sell 11,642 10-year
spreads on May 25, 2010, the CFTC said in a separate order.  The JPMorgan employee “knew or should have known that the
customer was attempting to engage in a prearranged trade where
the customer was on both sides,” the CFTC said in the order.
The trades violated commodities trading regulations designed to
ensure that market prices are competitive.  “BlackRock cooperated fully with the CFTC and is pleased
to put this matter behind us,” said  Brian Beades , a spokesman
for the world’s biggest asset manager.  Justin Perras , a
spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment.  Both BlackRock and JPMorgan are based in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
