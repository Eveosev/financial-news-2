A judge adjourned a case against 43
pro-democracy workers charged with illegally using foreign funds
until April 10, in a case that strained U.S.-Egyptian ties and
sparked claims of American meddling in  Egypt ’s affairs.  Judge Makram Awad also issued an arrest warrant for the
missing defendants, including at least 15 Americans who have
left Egypt. Of the Egyptians and foreigners charged, only 15
were in court, including one American.  Just minutes after today’s hearing in Cairo began, Awad
recessed the session as arguments broke out among the lawyers,
with those representing the defendants saying it was intended to
be a procedural hearing. The standing-room-only session marked
the start of a new hearing in a case that went to trial last
month, only to end abruptly.  The first session on Feb. 26, which none of the foreigners
attended, was adjourned for two months. In a surprise move, the
judges presiding over the case then recused themselves.  Days later, a travel ban imposed on the foreigners was
lifted and most of them, including Sam LaHood, the son of U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, left the country. LaHood
works for the International Republican Institute, one of two
NGOs linked to the two main U.S. political parties, whose
workers have been charged. Only seven of the Americans were in
Egypt when the case began.  To contact the reporters on this story:
