Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second time this week to the lowest in almost a month on strong
dollar demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to 82.73 as of 5:12 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, the most since Feb. 10.  “The shilling has weakened on increased demand with
businesses seeking to accumulate dollars,” John Muli a trader
at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview.  Tanzania’s shilling remained unchanged after gaining 0.3
percent yesterday to 1,595 per dollar. The Ugandan market is
closed for a public holiday.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in Dar es Salaam
