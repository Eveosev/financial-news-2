Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish solar power
plant developer, is offering lenders higher interest to extend
the maturities on about 1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of
forward-start loans, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  The facility may pay initial interest of about 375 basis
points more than the  euro interbank offered rate  for a three-
year extension, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The Seville-based company is in
negotiations with lenders, an Abengoa spokeswoman said without
providing details.  Abengoa signed 1.57 billion euros of  forward-start 
facilities in 2010, paying interest margins of 275 basis points
to 300 basis points to extend maturities on some loans to this
year and to 2013, according to its latest earnings report.
Forward-start loans lock in financing before debt comes due in
exchange for higher fees and  interest rates .  The solar power plant company also has 167 million euros of
a 2005 syndicated loan outstanding that pays 67.5 basis points
more than Euribor, and a 2006 facility that matures in July this
year, according to the earnings report. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Standard & Poor’s rates Abengoa B+, one level below Moody’s
Investors Service’s ranking of Ba3. Fitch Ratings grades the
company BB, two levels below investment-grade status.  To contact the reporter on this story:
