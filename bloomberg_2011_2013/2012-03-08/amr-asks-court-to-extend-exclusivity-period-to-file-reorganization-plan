American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AMR) 
asked a bankruptcy court today to extend the period of time
during which it alone holds the right to file a plan of
reorganization to Sept. 28.  Seeking an extension is “customary” in complex
bankruptcies, and more time will let American focus on
restructuring and airline operations, said Sean Collins, a
spokesman. AMR, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, filed for Chapter 11
on Nov. 29. Its original exclusivity period ends this month.  “This extension will allow American to continue focusing
on preserving and enhancing its ongoing value and restructuring
its financial condition and operations to achieve a competitive
and sustainable cost structure,” Collins said.  AMR’s request for an extension is scheduled to be
considered by the bankruptcy judge at a March 22 hearing.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
