General Motors Co. (GM) , which is halting
production of its Volt plug-in hybrid for five weeks, plans to
pace production of the vehicle according to inventory levels,
Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said.  “We are going to match production to inventory,” he said
today in San Francisco. “If you were owners of this business,
that’s exactly what you would do.”  The company said this month it will stop making Volts at
its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant from March 19 until April
23. The factory had ramped up to full-speed production Feb. 6
after the New Year’s shutdown.  “We saw inventory building and we wanted to get it into
line,” Akerson said. “You’ve got to accept that there is some
intelligence behind our decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
