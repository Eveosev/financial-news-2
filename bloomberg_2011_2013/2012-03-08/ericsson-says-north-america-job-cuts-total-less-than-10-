Ericsson AB (ERICB)  is eliminating positions
throughout its North American units as part of a regular
process, the company said.  The cuts will be “less than 10 percent” of its workforce
in  North America , spokeswoman Minako Nakatsuma Olofzon said
today. It may hire in other areas from the ones it is reducing,
she said.  The company had about  14,801 employees  in North America at
the end of 2011 and  added 2,600  with the purchase of Telcordia
Technologies Inc. Rethink-wireless.com reported  yesterday  that
