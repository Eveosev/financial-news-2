Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLGL) ,
 Russia ’s largest producer of the metal, advanced to a one-month
high in U.S. trading as the dollar fell against the euro,
spurring demand for gold as an alternative investment.  Polyus’s  American depositary receipts  gained 3 percent to
$3.47 at 1:43 p.m. in New York, the highest price since Feb. 3,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The mining company was the

Russian companies traded in New York after Yandex NV. The
benchmark gained 1.3 percent to 111.70.  “A rise in the gold price and commodities in general ahead
of the Greek debt swap has helped the stock’s rally today,”
Marco Casas, vice-president of equity sales at Otkritie
Financial Corp. in  New York , said via e-mail.  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$1,699.20 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the most since Feb.
21, on signs that investors are buying the precious metal as an
alternative to a slumping dollar. The U.S. currency fell for a
second day against the euro as  Greece  moved closer to attracting
enough investors to make its debt-swap plan a success.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of 24 commodities climbed
0.8 percent to 703.30. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw
