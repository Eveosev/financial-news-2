Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ)  may open the
sale of its GBW real estate unit to private bidders, Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.  The European Unionâ€™s antitrust authorities are concerned
that BayernLB agreed to hold exclusive talks with municipalities
on the sale, the Hamburg-based newspaper reported in an e-mailed
summary of an article to be published tomorrow.  BayernLB may seek to offer certain bidders exclusivity for
a limited amount of time before opening the sale process to
others, FT Deutschland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
