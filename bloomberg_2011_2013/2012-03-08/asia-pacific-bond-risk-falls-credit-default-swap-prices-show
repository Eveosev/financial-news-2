The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased 4 basis points to
142.5 as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. It
would be the lowest level since March 5, according to CMA, which
is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 163.5 basis
points as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index is headed for the lowest close
since March 5, according to CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 5 basis points to
146 basis points as of 11:13 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
