U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said U.S. bank regulators should take the time they
need to get the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading right.  “Part of the challenge is people want things that are
simple, but it’s not a simple thing to say to -- try to draw
those lines between market making and other forms of trading,”
Geithner said today in an event at the Dallas Regional Chamber.
“There’s absolutely some work to do on this.” Geithner was in
the Dallas area to meet with local business leaders and tour a
railway facility.  The Volcker rule, named for its original champion, former
Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , is intended to reduce the
chance that banks will make risky investments with their own
capital that put depositors’ money at risk. The provision is
part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
