Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the world’s
largest pork processor, said the cost of raising hogs should
stay in the “mid $60s” during its fiscal fourth quarter.  “Raising costs should remain in the mid $60s per
hundredweight this fiscal year and average in the low $60s per
hundredweight for fiscal 2013,” C. Larry Pope, the Smithfield,
Virginia-based company’s chief executive officer, said in a
third-quarter earnings statement today.  “Market fundamentals remain supportive in both fresh pork
and hog production with balanced supply and demand,” he said.
“We expect that fresh pork will continue to be a solid
contributor to our overall results as U.S. protein supplies
contract, supported by ongoing healthy export demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
