Egypt ’s external financing needs are
rising as political instability hampers the nation’s economic
recovery, increasing the government’s refinancing risk, Bank
Audi SAL said.  “A continued upward trend in the government’s funding
costs driven by monetary and financial fears would further
increase refinancing risks and would also constitute risk
pressures,” said the Lebanese lender in a report. It estimated
Egypt’s external financing requirement at $14 billion.  A potential loan from the  International Monetary Fund  would
help alleviate pressures on the country’s external position, it
said.  Egypt will invite an IMF mission to visit the country in
the second half of March, Planning and International Cooperation
Minister Fayza Aboulnaga said yesterday. The Egyptian government
has asked the IMF for a $3.2 billion loan.  “An ambitious externally backed economic adjustment
program that has broad domestic political support behind it is
apt to ensure soft landing and recovery,” Bank Audi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
