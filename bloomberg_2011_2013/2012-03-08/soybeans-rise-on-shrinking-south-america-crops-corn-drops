Soybeans rose for a second time this
week on signs that drought-reduced crops in  South America  are
boosting demand for supplies from the U.S. Corn fell.  In the week ended March 1, U.S. exporters sold 1.015
million metric tons of soybeans for delivery before Aug. 31, up
85 percent from the previous week, the Department of Agriculture
said today. A separate report showed  China , the world’s biggest
consumer, bought 165,000 tons from exporters. The country may
boost imports 5.7 percent next year, the agency said yesterday.  “Soybean export demand is improving, and that is the story
going forward,” Jim Riley, a grain broker for the Linn Group in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “China will continue to
be a big buyer.”  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
$13.3225 a bushel at 10:37 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Yesterday, the oilseed touched $13.39, the highest for the most-
active futures since Sept. 21.  Corn futures for May delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$6.345 a bushel in Chicago, the third straight drop. On March 5,
the most-active contract reached $6.6525, the highest since Nov.
9.  The forecast for soybean output in  Brazil , the second-
largest producer after the U.S., was cut for a second time this
year after dry weather parched crops in the country’s south, the
government said.  Growers will reap 68.7 million tons in the crop year that
started Sept. 1, lower than the 69.2 million tons estimated on
Feb. 9, Conab, the government’s crop-forecasting agency, said in
an e-mailed report today. In January, Conab said growers would
harvest 71.8 million tons.  The U.S. was the largest exporter of both commodities in
the year that ended Sept. 30, according to government estimates.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
