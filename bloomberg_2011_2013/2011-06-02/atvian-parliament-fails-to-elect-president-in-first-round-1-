Latvian lawmakers failed to elect
either candidate in a presidential ballot, setting up a second
round of voting.  Neither incumbent President Valdis Zatlers, a 56-year-old
former doctor, nor Andris Berzins, a 66-year-old former banker,
won the 51 votes needed in the 100-seat legislature as some
members abstained. Fifty backed Berzins, while 43 cast ballots
for Zatlers. Parliament immediately called a second round of
voting for today.  “It’s my best guess that Berzins will win in the second
round,” said Daunis Auers, a political scientist at the
University of Latvia. “But If no one wins today, it’s a whole
new ballgame. In either scenario, it’s difficult to envisage
Zatlers being re-elected.”  Zatlers, whose term expires July 7, has taken a public
stand on graft, calling the country’s first referendum on new
parliamentary elections May 28 after lawmakers refused to lift
the immunity of a member facing a criminal probe. The
president’s actions harmed his chances for re-election, leaving
him as the underdog before today’s vote.  There was a 77 percent implied probability of neither
candidate winning in the first round, according to betting
website  Triobet  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
