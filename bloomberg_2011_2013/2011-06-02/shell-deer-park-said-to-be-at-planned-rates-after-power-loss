Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is operating
its refinery in Deer Park, Texas, at planned rates after a steam
loss yesterday stopped production, two people with knowledge of
the plant’s operations said.  The startup was quicker than usual after such a shutdown
because the closure was brief, said the people, who declined to
be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak for the
refinery.  Jill Davis, a spokeswoman for Shell in Houston, didn’t
respond immediately to a request for comment. She declined
earlier today to update the refinery’s status. Davis said
yesterday that “power and steam supply have been restored and
we are in the process of returning to normal operations.”  The Deer Park refinery lost power to all units yesterday at
4 a.m. local time after an interruption to the electric grid
operated by  CenterPoint Energy Inc. (CNP) , according to Norma Dunn, a
spokesman for  Calpine Corp. (CPN) , the steam supplier to the refinery.  The refinery can process 340,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
