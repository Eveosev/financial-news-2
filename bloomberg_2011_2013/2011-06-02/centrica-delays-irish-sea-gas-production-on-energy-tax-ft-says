Centrica Plc (CNA)  didn’t restart
production at its South Morecambe gas field in the Irish Sea
yesterday, after a period of routine maintenance, because the
supplementary  energy tax  the U.K. government introduced makes it
unviable to start production unless the wholesale gas prices
reach a high enough threshold, the Financial Times reported,
citing the company. Centrica will assess on a daily basis
whether to reopen the field, the FT said.  John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, said in a letter to Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  that the “surprise nature of the tax
increase has created fiscal uncertainty not only in the oil and
gas sector, but across the energy infrastructure investment
supply chain,” the FT said, citing the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
