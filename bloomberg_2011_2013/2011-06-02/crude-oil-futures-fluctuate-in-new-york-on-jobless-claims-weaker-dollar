Oil rose as the dollar weakened after
Moody’s Investors Service said it may place the U.S.
government’s rating under review for possible downgrade.  Crude advanced 11 cents as the euro extended gains
following the Moody’s announcement that it may review the rating
if there is no progress on increasing the debt limit. Futures
fell earlier after a U.S. government report showed an unexpected
increase in inventories to the highest level in two years. Crude
reversed in the last 30 minutes of floor trading.  “We seem to follow the dollar’s weakness again,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in  New
York . “The storage data was pretty negative, but the market
found some support down near $98.”  Crude oil for July delivery settled at $100.40 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after falling 1.8 percent to
$98.46. Prices have gained 9.9 percent this year.  Brent crude  for July delivery rose $1.01, or 0.9 percent,
to $115.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The euro advanced 1.1 percent to $1.4481 as of 3:34 p.m. in
New York after climbing to $1.4514, the strongest level since
May 6. The euro has gained 8.2 percent this year versus the
dollar. A decline in the U.S. currency makes dollar-priced
assets such as crude appear cheaper to investors using other
currencies.  “The heightened polarization over the debt limit has
increased the odds of a short-lived default,” New York-based
Moody’s said in a statement today. “If this situation remains
unchanged in coming weeks, Moody’s will place the rating under
review.”  Debt Limit  A bill that would raise the U.S. debt limit by $2.4
trillion failed to win House passage May 31 in a vote Democrats
said was rigged to ensure its defeat.  The euro also strengthened after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she’s committed to the shared currency.  Europe ’s
policy makers are considering asking investors to reinvest in
Greek debt when existing bonds mature.  Oil fell earlier after the Energy Department reported that
crude inventories climbed 2.88 million barrels to 373.8 million
in the week ended May 27, the highest level since May 2009.
Stockpiles were forecast to decline by 1.6 million barrels,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “The build in crude oil was the largest surprise in the
data,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “The report showed the gasoline market
is well-supplied.”  Fuel Supplies  Gasoline inventories increased for a fourth week, climbing
by 2.55 million barrels to 212.3 million, the Energy Department
said. Analysts expected a gain of 900,000 barrels, according to
the Bloomberg survey.  Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating
oil, fell 976,000 barrels to 140.1 million, the lowest level
since April 2009. Analysts forecast a withdrawal of 250,000
barrels.  Heating oil futures gained 3.52 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
settle at $3.0439 a gallon on the Nymex.  “Refiners are not making distillates because they
intentionally want to bring inventories down to a more
manageable, healthier level and because they don’t see demand,”
said Evans.  Distillate demand for the four weeks ended May 27 averaged
3.81 million barrels a day, 0.3 percent lower than the four
weeks ended May 20, and 5 percent less than a year earlier.  Cushing Supplies  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
West Texas Intermediate oil traded on the Nymex, dropped 159,000
barrels to 39.9 million, department data showed. The rate at
which refineries operated fell to 86 percent from the previous
week’s 86.3 percent.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
respond at its June 8 meeting in Vienna if there is demand for
more oil production, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi
said.  The Middle East kingdom has 3 million to 3.5 million
barrels a day of spare production capacity, Al-Naimi told
reporters today in Krakow,  Poland .  OPEC’s output rose 165,000 barrels, or 0.6 percent, to
average 28.895 million barrels a day in May, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.
 Saudi Arabia  bolstered production by 75,000 barrels, or 0.8
percent, to 8.925 million barrels a day, the highest level since
October 2008.  HSBC Holdings Plc said speculative trading may have added
$30 a barrel to  oil prices  last month as a gain in futures
holdings by commodities funds outweighed higher production by
Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 725,752
contracts as of 3:35 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 655,628
yesterday, 2.1 percent below the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.51 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
