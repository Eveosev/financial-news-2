Japan ’s 10-year bonds posted the
biggest weekly drop in two months on prospects political turmoil
may delay reconstruction from a March earthquake and add to
credit concerns.  Bond futures retreated from near a six-month high as Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan ’s pledge to step down set off a contest to
select Japan’s next leader. Kan survived a no-confidence vote
yesterday after offering to resign once the nation’s worst
postwar crisis is contained.  “Ten-year bonds with yields below 1.2 percent are
overvalued,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist at Sumitomo Trust &
Banking Co. in Tokyo, which manages the equivalent of $306
billion. “Political turmoil is negative for Japanese bonds.”  The benchmark 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.135 percent
as of 3:01 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent security due
June 2021 was 100.583 yen.  Ten-year yields gained 1.5 basis points for the past five
days, the biggest weekly advance since the period ended April 8.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery were little changed
at 141.06 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
contracts touched 141.18 yesterday, the highest since Dec. 7.  Lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party of Japan divided
over what that the timeframe may be for the prime minister’s
resignation, with Kan’s predecessor saying it could be by month-
end and the prime minister suggesting it might not be until
early next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
