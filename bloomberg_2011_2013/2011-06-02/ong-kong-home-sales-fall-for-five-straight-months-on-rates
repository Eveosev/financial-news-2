The number of home transactions in
 Hong Kong  fell for a fifth straight month in May as rising
mortgage rates continue to dent buying sentiment.  The number of units that changed hands last month declined
12 percent from a year earlier to 9,681, according to a
statement on the Land Registry website yesterday. The value of
transactions rose 15 percent from a year earlier to HK$49.5
billion ($6.4 billion), according to the release.  Rising mortgage rates from record lows in the city, where
Savills Plc says is the world’s most expensive place to buy an
apartment, is underscoring concerns that the nearly 70 percent
surge in  home prices  since the start of 2009 may not be
sustainable. The government in November increased property
transaction taxes and pledged to boost land supply amid public
protests that housing prices are becoming unaffordable and as
the central bank warned about the risk of a “property bubble.”  Hong Kong’s bank interest rates will rise on loan demand
and capital outflows when the U.S. increases borrowing costs,
Hong Kong Monetary Authority head  Norman Chan  said on April 28.  The Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks seven of the
city’s biggest developers, fell 4 percent this year, compared
with the 1 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
