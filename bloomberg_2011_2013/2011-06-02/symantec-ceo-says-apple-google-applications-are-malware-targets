Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  Chief Executive
Officer Enrique Salem said downloadable applications for
smartphones and tablets represent a new front in the fight
against computer threats.  Applications available from  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s  App Store  and
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android Market are vulnerable to attacks by
hackers who want information housed on handsets and tablet
computers, Salem said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg’s
 San Francisco  office. Apple’s store boasts more than 350,000
applications, while Android Market has more than 200,000.  “It’s very hard to completely vet everything,” Salem
said. “It’s early in mobile security.”  Symantec, the largest maker of security software, may spend
as much as $860 million more on acquisitions this year to help
it expand in mobile, he said. The company also seeks targets in
cloud services, or the delivery of computing over the Internet,
and virtualization, software that helps servers run more
efficiently, Salem said, reiterating remarks he made May 26.  The company is shifting its focus as demand surges for
smartphones, tablets and cloud computing, while businesses and
consumers curtail personal computer purchases.  Salem told analysts at the May 26 meeting in  New York  that
Symantec would spend as much as $1.25 billion on acquisitions in
the fiscal year that began in April. Included in that total is
$390 million Symantec spent on Clearwell Systems, which
specializes in electronic legal research.  Symantec, based in  Mountain View ,  California , fell 22 cents
to $18.80 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. It climbed 14 percent this year before today.  Mac Threats  For Apple users, the threats don’t end with mobile devices.
Mac laptops and desktops will increasingly be the target of
malware as they gain popularity, Salem said. Symantec’s software
has long secured PCs running Microsoft’s Windows software.  “Apple takes security very seriously,” said  Tom Neumayr ,
a spokesman for Apple. “We have a very thorough approval
process and review every App. We also check the identities of
every developer and if we ever find anything malicious, the
developer will be removed from the iPhone Developer Program and
their apps can be removed from the App Store.”  Apple has been trying to combat malicious software
targeting Mac users in the past month. The malware, posing as an
antivirus program called “MacDefender,” tries to trick people
in to thinking they have a virus. The scam encourages users to
download fake security software.  ‘Fraudulent Purposes’  “Its ultimate goal is to get the user’s credit card
information which may be used for fraudulent purposes,” Apple
said in a May 24  message  to users about how to avoid and remove
the software from their machines.  Gina Weakley, a spokeswoman for Google, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  In the market for cloud computing, Symantec is building
programs to help companies’ information technology departments
safeguard applications from Salesforce.com Inc. and other Web-
delivered software, including  SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  and possibly
Workday Inc., according to Salem.  Symantec is also close to delivering software that can scan
servers running virtualization software from VMware Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. more efficiently, Salem said.  Symantec, in a May 11 report, forecast higher revenue than
analysts predicted, buoyed by demand for data-backup software
and the effect of a weaker dollar on overseas sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
