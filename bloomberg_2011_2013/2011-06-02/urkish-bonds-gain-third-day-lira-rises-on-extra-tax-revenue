Turkish bonds rallied for a third day
and the lira gained to the highest in two weeks on the prospect
of lower debt issuance as the government expects additional  tax
revenue  this year.  Two-year bond yields dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 8.75 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul. The lira strengthened
0.9 percent to 1.5853 per dollar, the highest since May 19.  The government expects about 13.5 billion liras ($8.5
billion) in additional revenue this year, in payments of overdue
tax debts restructured in a government offer, Finance Minister
Mehmet Simsek said today.  Turkey ’s priority is to use the
revenue to reduce the country’s indebtedness, Simsek said. The
government is targeting a budget deficit of 33.5 billion liras
this year, the ministry said last month.  “The prospect of falling government debt issuance is
benefiting the  bond market  and probably this will be a lasting
effect,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities in
Istanbul, said by phone today. “The Treasury will probably not
have to borrow from abroad in the rest of this year.”  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  fell 0.2 percent to
63,112.60.  “After the weaker data released both at home and abroad,
we are starting to view short and medium-term bond yields as
quite attractive,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at
Turk Ekonomi Bankasi, said in a report today. TEB is a unit of
BNP Paribas in Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
