Wheat production in the European
Union may drop to 135 million metric tons because of drought,
 Memphis , Tennessee-based researcher Informa Economics Inc. said
today in a report to clients. That’s down 5.4 percent from the
company’s previous forecast and 763,000 tons less than
production last year, Informa said.  Canada ’s wheat output may total 27.1 million tons, or
500,000 tons below the company’s May estimate, Informa said.
Production still would be 3.9 million tons above last year. Wet
weather has cut plantings in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Informa
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
