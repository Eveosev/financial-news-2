Japan ’s sales tax should be doubled
to 10 percent by 2015 to finance measures to reform the nation’s
welfare system, a government panel recommended.  “Much of our social security payments right now is funded
by  government bonds , meaning the burden is shouldered by future
generations,” said a draft of recommendations from the
committee examining social security issues, chaired by Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan , released today in Tokyo. “This situation
and the social security system as it is cannot be neglected any
longer, given the critical state of our public finances.”  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings have all warned that Japan risks a downgrade in its
credit grade if it fails to push through changes. Leading one of
the world’s fastest-aging populations with a debt burden around
twice the size of the economy, Kan is scheduled to release a
blueprint for tax and welfare reform this month to keep the
budget sustainable.  The tax should be increased specifically to pay for social
security and it shouldn’t create a “bloated bureaucracy,” the
document said. The draft added that a wider safety net,
including more daycare centers and measures to secure jobs for
young workers, will require 3.8 trillion yen in fiscal 2015,
while steps to streamline the system will save 1.2 trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
