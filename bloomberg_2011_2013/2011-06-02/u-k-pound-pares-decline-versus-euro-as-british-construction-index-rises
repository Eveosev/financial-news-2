The pound pared a decline versus the
euro after an index of U.K. building activity increased by more
than analysts estimated.  The British currency was 0.4 percent weaker at 88.04 pence
as of 9:32 a.m. in  London , after depreciating as much as 0.6
percent. Against the dollar it was little changed at $1.6338.  The gauge of U.K. construction from Markit Economics Ltd.
and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  rose to 54
last month from 53.3 in April, exceeding the 53.5 median
estimate of 9 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
