Copper, nickel and aluminum declined
in  London  for a second straight day on mounting concern that the
global economic recovery may be faltering as manufacturing slows
from  China  to the U.S.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.9 percent to $9,016 a metric ton, the lowest level in
a week, and was at $9,027 at 1:36 p.m. in Singapore. Zinc and
lead also fell, joining equities and other commodities including
oil, as the outlook for global growth dimmed.  Output in the U.S. was the weakest in a more than a year,
according to a report yesterday, while industrial production
cooled in India and the U.K. In China, one report yesterday
showed manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in nine months,
while another indicated the slowest growth in 10 months.  “Global economic growth appears to be moderating and this
is weighing on  market sentiment ,” Zhu Yan, an analyst at
Xiangyu Futures Co., said from  Shanghai . China and the U.S. are
the world’s two biggest users of copper.  July-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  lost as much
as 0.7 percent to $4.079 per pound, dropping for a third day.
Copper for August delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
as much as 1.5 percent to 67,300 yuan ($10,381) a ton.  Some economists trimmed forecasts for May payrolls that
will be reported in two days after a private report yesterday
showed U.S. companies last month added jobs at the slowest pace
since September.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  reduced its estimate
to a gain of 100,000 from 150,000, while Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. cut its target to 160,000 from 225,000.  ‘Much More Anxious’  “If you knock out employment gains, you really take back
this idea that we’ve entered a sustainable recovery,”  James Paulsen , chief investment strategist at Wells Capital
Management, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “If we’re
no longer in a sustainable recovery, then investors get much
more anxious.”  The weaker-than-expected data have triggered speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve may decide to extend economic
stimulus beyond the expiration in June of its current program of
so-called quantitative easing.  Aluminum in London lost as much as 1.4 percent to $2,630 a
ton and nickel dropped as much as 1.5 percent to $22,900 a ton.
Zinc dropped 0.8 percent to $2,239 a ton, lead lost 1.3 percent
to $2,469 a ton and tin declined 1.1 percent to $27,300 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
