Russia  banned imports from 85
Brazilian beef plants as of June 15, the country’s health
authority said. The ban includes operations of  JBS SA (JBSS3) ,  Marfrig
Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  and  BRF - Brasil Foods SA. (BRFS3)   Russia temporarily banned imports from plants in the
Brazilian states of Mato Grosso,  Rio Grande  do Sul and Parana,
the sanitary authority said today in a statement on its website.  In a separate statement on the same website, the authority
said it inspected 29 Brazilian producers and found their
agriculture safety controls to be weak.  In April, Russia restricted purchases of beef and pork from
eight Brazilian meatpackers because of sanitary issues.  JBS, the world’s largest beef producer, and Marfrig,  Latin
America ’s second-biggest producer, are based in Sao Paulo.
Brasil Foods is the world’s largest poultry exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
