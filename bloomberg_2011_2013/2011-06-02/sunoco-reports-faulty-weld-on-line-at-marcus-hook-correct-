Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  reported a faulty weld on
a process line associated with an alkylation unit at the Marcus
Hook refinery in  Pennsylvania , according to a Pennsylvania
regulator.  The release was reported at about 4:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, said Deborah Fries, a spokeswoman with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Regulation.  “Sunoco did not state that the unit was or was going to be
shut down,” she said in an e-mail today.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  Thomas Golembeski, a company spokesman, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment.  The plant can process 194,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
