Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  hired two senior
energy traders from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to positions
in London,  SparkSpread  said.  David Beaton resigned from his role as a proprietary power,
gas and coal trader at Morgan Stanley in the past few days and
will join Noble as head of power, financial coal and emissions
trading, the energy news website reported yesterday, without
saying where it got the information.  Denis Bajolle, head of continental power trading at
Barclays in London, also left this week and will join Noble as
head of European power trading outside of Scandinavia,
SparkSpread said.  Candice Adam, a Noble spokeswoman in London, wasnâ€™t
immediately able to confirm the hires when reached by Bloomberg
News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
