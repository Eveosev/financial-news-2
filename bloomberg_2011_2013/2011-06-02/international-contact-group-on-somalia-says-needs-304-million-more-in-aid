The International Contact Group on
Somalia is seeking $304 million to deal with a humanitarian
crisis resulting from drought and conflict in the war-torn
African nation.  The group, consisting of mainly Western donors, has raised
$226 million of $530 million needed to provide aid, it said in a
statement distributed at a meeting today in  Uganda ’s capital,
Kampala.  “Somalia is expected to slide deeper into crisis, leading
to an increase in the number of Somalis in need of assistance
from the current 2.4 million,” the group said.  Somalia’s government has been battling Islamic insurgents,
including al-Shabaab, since 2007. The rebels control most of
southern and central Somalia. Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. accuses
of having links to al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups continue
to undermine peace in the Horn of Africa country, the Contact
Group said. The conflict and drought has displaced 100,000
people, it said.  Uganda and Burundi are willing to commit another 3,000
troops to the country, adding to the 9,000 they already have in
place, if the funding is secured, Augustine Mahiga, the United
Nation’s special representative to Somalia, told reporters in
Kampala.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, in
1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
