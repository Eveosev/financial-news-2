Asian stocks dropped for the first
time in three days after U.S. manufacturing expanded at the
weakest pace in more than a year and employers hired fewer
workers than forecast, fueling concern the global economic
recovery will slow.  Samsung Electronics Co., the Korean consumer-electronics
company that gets 85 percent of its revenue from overseas, sank
3.1 percent in Seoul.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest exporter of
consumer electronics, lost 1.7 percent in  Tokyo .  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co. led declines among Japanese carmakers
as sales in the U.S. slumped.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer,
retreated 2.2 percent after crude oil and metal futures dropped.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.6 percent to 134.59
as of 7:37 p.m. in Tokyo, paring this week’s advance and set for
its biggest drop since May 23. All of the 10 industry groups
that make up the gauge declined. More than four stocks dropped
for each that rose on the measure, which last week completed its
longest streak of weekly losses in two years as concern deepened
over  Europe ’s debt crisis and amid speculation a slowing global
recovery will crimp earnings.  “The weak manufacturing and employment data coming on the
back of soft data out of Europe and  China  and another downgrade
for  Greece  have added to concerns about the strength of the
global economy,” said  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $98 billion in
Sydney. “Investors are worried it will be something worse,
which will be bad for Asian exporters. As a result the risk on-
risk off, the roller coaster in global and regional markets
continues and right now it’s back to risk off.”  Kan Vote  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average decreased 1.7 percent
ahead of a no-confidence vote on Prime Minister Naoto Kan after
the country’s markets closed. The motion was rejected by the
lower house of parliament after Kan, who faces discontent over
his handling of the March 11 earthquake disaster that triggered
the world’s worst nuclear accident in 25 years, signaled he’ll
resign once a solution to the nation’s post-quake crisis is in
sight.  South Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 1.3 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 1.6 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index sank 1.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 2.3 percent, its steepest fall in a year.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. In  New York , the index retreated 2.3 percent
yesterday, its biggest decline since August, after the Institute
for Supply Management’s factory index fell last month to its
lowest level since September 2009.  Manufacturing, Jobs  Companies in the U.S. last month added jobs at the slowest
pace since September. Employment grew by 38,000 in May, data
from ADP Employer Services showed yesterday, missing a 175,000
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing growth from China, the U.S. and Europe slowed
in May, adding to signs that momentum is weakening in a global
economy facing headwinds from rising commodity costs and
financial shocks. Greece’s risk of default was raised to 50
percent by Moody’s Investors Service as European officials
rushed to put together the second bailout plan in two years to
stave off renewed financial turmoil in the region.  “The global economy has hit a soft patch and more
investors are shying away from risk assets.” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees the equivalent of $600 million at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. in Tokyo.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the world’s largest surfwear
maker, dropped 3.4 percent to A$6.20 in Sydney. Samsung
Electronics, which gets about 22 percent of sales from America,
dropped 3.1 percent to 883,000 won in Seoul.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) ,
the world’s third-biggest maker of mobile phones, tumbled 4.4
percent to 94,200 won. Sony, the maker of PlayStation gaming
consoles and Bravia televisions, lost 1.7 percent to 2,142 yen
in Tokyo.  Auto Slump  Acer Inc. (2353) , the world’s second-biggest supplier of notebook
computers, slumped 7 percent to NT$51.90 in Taipei, its steepest
drop since December 1997. The company said it will book an
operating loss of $150 million because of an inventory write-off.
It also plans to cut 300 jobs in Europe, the  Middle East  and
 Africa  to reduce expenses.  Carmakers declined as industry-wide U.S. auto sales fell to
1.06 million cars and light trucks last month from 1.1 million a
year earlier, according to a report from Autodata Corp., of
Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. Toyota and Honda, the automakers
hardest hit by  Japan ’s record earthquake, led U.S. sales
declines among Asian-based car manufacturers in May as supplies
of some models ran low, the report showed.  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, decreased 3.3 percent
to 3,270 yen. Honda, which gets about 44 percent of sales from
 North America , dropped 2.4 percent to 3,045 yen. Nissan Motor
Co., Japan’s No. 3 automaker by market value, sank 3.2 percent
to 781 yen.  Oil, Metals  A gauge of raw material producers led the drop among the 10
industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. BHP dropped 2.2
percent to A$43.55 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-biggest mining company by sales, fell 1.8 percent to
A$80.10. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal,
slipped 3 percent to HK$25.65 in Hong Kong.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the
nation’s largest offshore oil producer, dipped 2.2 percent to
HK$18.96.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 2.4 percent to settle
at $100.29 a barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest drop in a
single-session since May 11. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six metals including copper and aluminum lost 1
percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
