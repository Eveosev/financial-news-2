Brazil  will expand its monthly cash
payments to poor families as President  Dilma Rousseff  seeks to
meet her campaign pledge of eliminating extreme poverty by 2014.  The government plans to spend 20 billion reais ($12.7
billion) per year under its "Brazil Without Poverty" initiative
that seeks to lift 16.2 million Brazilians out of extreme
poverty, Social Development Minister Tereza Campello told
reporters in Brasilia today.  “We expect to be one of the first countries in the world
to eradicate poverty,” Campello said. “It is a challenge for
the public sector to set clear goals.”  Rousseff, during her Jan. 1 inauguration, vowed to use the
country’s expanding oil wealth and faster economic growth to
consolidate former President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ’s legacy.
Under Lula, who created a program that paid monthly stipends to
12.9 million families last year, 36 million Brazilians entered
the middle class.  The cash payments that were previously limited to three
children per family are being extended to five children. At the
same time, the government plans to include an additional 800,000
families in the program, known as Bolsa Familia, by 2013.  Bolsa Familia will reach 13.7 million people this year and
its budget will increase to 16 billion reais from 13.4 billion
in 2010, according to figures from the Social Development
Ministry.  Distribution of income is the best way to ensure economic
growth, Rousseff said today. To help families benefit from the
economic growth that generated 15 million jobs in the past eight
years, the government plans to train 1.7 million people from age
18 to 65, according to a statement from Rousseff’s office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
