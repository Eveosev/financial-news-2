(Corrects headline to say currency drops not gains.)  Taiwan’s bonds rose, pushing the 10-
year yield to the lowest level in more than two weeks, as
investors added to holdings of the safest assets on concern the
global economy is slowing.  The most-traded government debt gained for a second day
after data out of the U.S. yesterday showed the  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index fell to the lowest level since
September 2009 last month, and employers expanded payrolls at
the slowest pace in eight months. Taiwan’s government will
auction NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 10-year bonds on June 7.  “Worries over the U.S. economic recovery are reflected in
the bond-market rally,” said James Wang, a fixed-income trader
at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Traders are also waiting
for the bond sale next week to get more direction on yields.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent security due March 2021 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.416 percent as
of the 1:30 p.m. local time close, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.3 percent to NT$28.785 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was 0.1 percent stronger at
NT$28.681 one minute before the end of the trading session.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, rose two basis points to 0.36 percent, the sixth
day it has advanced, according to a weighted average compiled by
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
