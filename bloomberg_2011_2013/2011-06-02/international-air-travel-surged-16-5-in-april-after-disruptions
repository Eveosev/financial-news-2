International  air travel  jumped the
most in 10 months in April after a volcanic eruption disrupted
flights in  Europe  a year earlier, according to the  International
Air Transport Association .  International passenger demand climbed 16.5 percent in
April from a year earlier, IATA said today in a statement in
 Singapore . Air travel in Europe gained 29 percent after it was
severely affected by the volcano eruption in  Iceland  last year.  Air travel is growing at 3 percent to 4 percent this year
after eliminating all distortions, IATA Chief Executive Officer
 Giovanni Bisignani  said at a briefing in Singapore. Higher costs
may damp demand as crude oil rose 37 percent in the past 12
months.  “Demand improved significantly in April and business
confidence is high,” Bisignani said. “Unfortunately two things
are spoiling the party -- demand shocks and high jet fuel
prices. Maintaining load factors needed to support profitable
growth will be difficult given the challenge of matching
capacity to volatile demand.”  Airlines worldwide may earn $8.6 billion this year, IATA
said in March, cutting a forecast of $9.1 billion made in
December. Crude traded at $99.80 a barrel in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 12:11 p.m. Singapore
time. The price of jet fuel rose 0.5 percent to $129.70 a barrel
yesterday in Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  International airfreight demand rose 8.5 percent in April,
IATA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
