Oil traded near $100 a barrel in  New
York , little changed from a week ago, before a report that will
indicate the strength of the  U.S. economy  and as OPEC prepares
to meet in Vienna next week to decide output quotas.  Futures have fluctuated from $98 to $103 a barrel this
week. The U.S. Labor Department will say today that employers
added fewer jobs in May, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will respond
if the world needs more crude, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said before the group meets June 8.  “The market has defined a range as we head toward the
 unemployment rate  tonight,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who
predicted oil will average $100 this year. “It might get good
numbers. It’s a volatile market.”  Crude for July delivery traded at $100.35 a barrel, down 5
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:34 p.m. in  Singapore . It earlier rose as much as 47 cents
and fell as much as 15 cents. The contract yesterday gained 11
cents to $100.40. Prices are up 35 percent the past year.  Brent crude  for July delivery was unchanged at $115.54 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday rose $1.01, or 0.9 percent.  U.S. Jobs  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$15.14 a barrel to U.S. futures, little changed from yesterday.
The difference between front-month contracts in  London  and New
York reached a record $19.54 on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76
cents last year.  U.S. job growth probably slowed to 165,000 new employees in
May from 244,000 in April, a Bloomberg News survey of economists
showed before today’s Labor Department report.  “If analysts are correct, May would mark the smallest
increase since January, a month which traditionally sees low
hiring,” said  Stephen Schork , president of The Schork Group
Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , in a report today. “Put
simply, we are expecting extreme volatility around the number’s
release at 8:30 a.m. Expect the Nymex pits to open wild.”  Initial jobless claims in the week ended May 28 fell by
6,000 to 422,000, above the 417,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, according to Labor
Department figures yesterday in  Washington .  OPEC Meeting  OPEC will probably maintain production levels for an eighth
consecutive meeting next week, resisting calls to ease the
pressure of $100-a-barrel oil on the global economy, according
to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.  “Speculation on what the future may hold” is the main
reason for the current oil price,  Saudi Arabia ’s Al-Naimi told
reporters in Poland yesterday. “There is no such thing as a
fair price.”  Oil fell in intraday trade yesterday after a U.S.
Department of Energy report showed crude stockpiles climbed 2.88
million barrels to 373.8 million last week, the highest since
May 2009. Supplies were projected to fall by 1.6 million
barrels, according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories increased for a fourth week, climbing
by 2.55 million barrels to 212.3 million, the report showed.
Analysts expected a gain of 900,000 barrels, according to the
Bloomberg survey. Demand increased 4.5 percent to 9.43 million
barrels a day.  Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating
oil, fell 976,000 barrels to 140.1 million, the lowest level
since April 2009. Analysts forecast a withdrawal of 250,000
barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
