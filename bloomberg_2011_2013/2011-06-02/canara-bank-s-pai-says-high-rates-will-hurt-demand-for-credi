Jagdish Pai, executive director at
 Canara Bank (CBK) ,  India ’s third-biggest state-owned lender, comments
on inflation and  interest rates . He spoke in a phone interview
from Bangalore.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao increased
the repurchase rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent
on May 3, the biggest move since July 2008, and indicated he is
ready to step up the battle against inflation even at the risk
of restraining growth.  While inflation slowed to 8.66 percent in April from 9.02
percent in March, the central bank said the rate probably won’t
decline much further until September.  “High rates always dent the demand for credit
significantly because volumes will not be there. Bigger
borrowers who go for capital expenditure will put it in on hold.  ‘‘We are of the view that inflation will be under control
by the end of June on expectations of good monsoons and the
RBI’s recent policy that has been wide and all encompassing.
These will start yielding results and bring it down from June or
July onwards.  ‘‘I don’t think there will be a rate increase beyond July.
I don’t think we have the appetite or capacity to absorb any
more rate increases. The general view for this month’s rate
increase is 25 basis points and we subscribe to that view.  ‘‘We will be looking at holding our margins rather than
improving it any further.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
