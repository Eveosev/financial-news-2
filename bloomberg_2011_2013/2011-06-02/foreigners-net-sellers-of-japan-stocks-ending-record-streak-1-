Foreign investors were net sellers of
Japanese stocks last week, snapping a record buying streak that
stretched 29 weeks as weaker economic reports cut the appetite
for shares.  Overseas investors sold 7.2 billion yen ($89 million) more
Japanese stocks than they bought last week, according to data
released by the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. A net 4.84 trillion
yen worth of shares were purchased during the binge that
finished in the week ended May 20.  “Investors moved away from equities to less riskier
assets,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at
Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$104 billion. “Economic figures from the U.S. created
uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy. That was
the biggest factor in last week’s selling.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average declined 0.9 percent last week,
its third-straight week of losses, as reports showed the  U.S.
economy  grew at a slower than estimated rate, reducing the
earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
