Peruvian Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori’s support has fallen and her poll lead over Ollanta
Humala ahead of the June 5 presidential election is within the
margin of error, Manuel Saavedra, who heads polling research
firm CPI, told reporters in  Lima .  Polling firm Datum’s latest survey also has the candidates
in a statistical tie, general manager Manuel Torrado told
reporters today.  Peruvian electoral law bars researchers from publishing
polls in Peruvian media in the week before the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
