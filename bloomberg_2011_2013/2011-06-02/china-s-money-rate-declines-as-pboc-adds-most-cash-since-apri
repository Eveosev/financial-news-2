China ’s money-market rate dropped to
a three-day low as the central bank injected the most cash in
into the financial system in five weeks.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 81 billion yuan
($12.5 billion) of capital this week. China may increase the
yuan’s trading band,  interest rates  and banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios in June to curb inflation, the Shanghai
Securities News reported yesterday, citing unidentified market
participants.  “The capital injection is helping ease the cash shortage
triggered by the reserve-ratio hike last month,” said Tang Guohui, a bond trader at Industrial Securities Co. in Shanghai.
“If the PBOC really wants to hike the ratio again in June, it
might do it during the first half.”  The seven-day repurchase rate dropped 38 basis points, or
0.38 percentage point, to 3.52 percent as of 11:36 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate touched 5.32 percent
on May 25, the highest level since Feb. 23.  The central bank has raised benchmark interest rates four
times and boosted lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios by three
percentage points since September.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell three basis
points to 3.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 rose one basis point to 3.64 percent yesterday, according
to the Interbank Funding Center.  --Andrea Wong. Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
