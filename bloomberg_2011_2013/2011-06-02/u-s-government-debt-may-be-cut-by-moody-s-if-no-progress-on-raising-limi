Moody’s Investors Service said that
if there is no progress on increasing the statutory debt limit
in coming weeks, it expects to place the US government’s rating
under review for possible downgrade, due to the very small but
rising risk of a short-lived default.  Moody’s said if the debt limit is raised and default
avoided, the Aaa rating will be maintained.  Moody’s said a
“credible agreement” on substantial deficit reduction would
support a continued stable outlook. Lack of an agreement could
prompt Moody’s to change its outlook to negative on the Aaa
rating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
