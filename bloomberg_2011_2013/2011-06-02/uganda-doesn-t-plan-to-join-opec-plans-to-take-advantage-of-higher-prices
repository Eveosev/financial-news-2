Uganda  won’t join the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries because it wants to take
advantage of higher prices, the nation’s foreign affairs
ministry said.  Operating outside the group will allow Uganda to regulate
its output and avoid pressure to boost production when prices
are rising, Henry Okello Oryem, the minister of state for
international relations, said today in an interview in the
capital, Kampala.  The oil industry in Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest
economy, is poised to grow as  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K.-based
energy company, plans to start pumping crude and gas from the
Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven
reserves, according to Tullow.  “OPEC is controlled because it is under pressure from
major countries,” he said. “Rather than being controlled, we
shall be independent and take advantage of prices when they are
high.”  The decision to stay away from OPEC was influenced by
 Norway , which is not part of OPEC,’’ he said. “And because
Norway is helping us in policy, we believe for a while we won’t
join OPEC.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
