Iraq agreed to increase daily oil
exports to  Jordan  to 15,000 barrels from 10,000 barrels, the
Jordanian state-run news agency  Petra  said, citing Jordanâ€™s
Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit.  The two states agreed to raise the quantity later to 30,000
barrels a day, he said, without specifying a date. Bakhit and
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki agreed to the arrangement
yesterday in Baghdad, Petra reported.  Jordan, which imports energy to meet most of its needs, is
losing money after switching its power stations over to diesel
and gasoil after  Egypt  halted shipments of less expensive
natural gas in April. It was the second time this year that
sabotage of the Egyptian pipeline network interrupted gas
supplies to Jordan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
