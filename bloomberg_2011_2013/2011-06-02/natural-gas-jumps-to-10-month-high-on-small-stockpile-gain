Natural gas futures jumped to a 10-
month high after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles
increased less than expected last week.  Gas futures rose 3.6 percent after the Energy Department
reported inventories rose 83 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 27 to 2.107 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected gain of 94 billion.
Hotter-than-normal weather last week may have increased the use
of gas to generate power for air conditioning.  “The number was low,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “We had some heat across
the country last week, and the  weather forecasts  are still
supportive.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 16.5 cents to $4.794 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement price since July 30. Futures
touched $4.859, the highest intraday price since Jan. 24.  The stockpile increase was smaller than the five-year
average gain for the week of 99 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A deficit to the five-year average widened to 2
percent from 1.3 percent the previous week.  “There was an explosion in the market this morning
following a paltry 83-Bcf injection,” Pax Saunders, an analyst
at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a note to clients.
“Market watchers are asking, ‘where’s the gas?’”  Highs in Atlanta touched 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius)
on May 25, about 10 degrees higher than normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc.  Texas Heat  Hotter-than-normal weather in the central, southern and
eastern U.S. through June 16 may boost air conditioner use.
Temperatures may be as much as 8 degrees above normal in the
Great Lakes region next week, according to a note to clients
today from Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The high in Dallas on June 10 may be 98 degrees Fahrenheit
(37 Celsius), 7 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College , Pennsylvania. The high in  Chicago  may be 88, 8
degrees above normal.  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 35 percent above normal
from June 8 through June 12,  David Salmon , a meteorologist at
Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , said in a note to
clients today.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Storm Season  A cluster of showers and thunderstorms in the west-central
 Caribbean Sea  has a 20 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone, the National Hurricane Center said in a  Tropical
Weather outlook  issued at 2 p.m. in Miami. An area of low
pressure north of the Yucatan Peninsula has a 10 percent chance
of development within the next 48 hours, the hurricane center
said.  AccuWeather increased its 2011 forecast for the development
of major hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday, boosting
its forecast for storms of Category 3 or higher to four from the
three it predicted in March.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
