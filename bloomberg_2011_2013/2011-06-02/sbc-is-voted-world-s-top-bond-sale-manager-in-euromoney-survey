HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  topped  Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) ’s poll of the leading managers of
bond sales for companies, governments and agencies, surpassing
 Barclays Capital , which dropped to fifth.  London-based HSBC,  Europe ’s biggest bank by market value,
moved up one place in the survey of 147 of the world’s biggest
bond issuers, Euromoney said in a statement. Barclays Capital
dropped down the rankings after topping the poll of debt capital
markets services in 2010.  Companies raised $1.7 trillion from bond markets worldwide
this year, up from $1.3 trillion in the same period in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales soared last month
as borrowers sought to finance acquisitions and pay off higher-
cost debt, capitalizing on lower borrowing costs with yields on
10-year Treasuries at the lowest level in six months.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. jumped to second place from sixth,
while  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA moved up one place to third, Euromoney’s
survey shows.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA was voted the best provider of credit
strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
