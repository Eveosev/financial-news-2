South Korea  said overseas investors
turned net sellers of the nation’s stocks in May on concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen, reducing demand for assets in
emerging markets.  Overseas investors sold a net 2.8 trillion won ($2.6
billion) of South Korean stocks in May, compared with net
purchases of 4.4 trillion won in April, the  Financial
Supervisory Service  said in an e-mailed statement today. Total
net stock holdings of overseas investors stood at 402.4 trillion
won as of the end of the month, down from 412.5 trillion won in
April.  Bonds held by overseas investors more than doubled by a net
2.65 trillion won, the biggest jump in seven months, to 78.8
trillion won as of May 31, the regulator said.  Investors from the UK, Luxembourg and France turned net
sellers of South Korean stocks last month, while U.S. investors
were net purchasers of South Korean stocks for the last 18
straight months.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 2.3 percent in May, its first
monthly drop since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
