KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-traded unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state-run energy
producer, said output at the Karazhanbasmunai oil unit has begun
to recover as a protest winds down.  The number of strikers at the unit has decreased to 164
people, KazMunaiGas EP said in an e-mailed statement. It didn’t
give details of the increase in output. A total of 893 people,
mainly drivers, are on strike at a second unit, Ozenmunaigaz,
the company said, without commenting on production.  Karazhanbasmunai was hit by a strike by 700 workers over
wages that began May 17, the company said at the time. Output
“suffered insignificantly,” said Mikhail Dorofeyev, an Astana-
based KazMunaiGas EP spokesman.  Ten workers went on hunger strike and another 250 didn’t
come to work at the Ozenmunaigaz unit after a court ruled their
claims were illegal, the company said last week. The labor
action didn’t affect production, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
