Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s
biggest power producer, has filed a bid with Rosenergoatom,
 Russia ’s nuclear plant operator, to extend the service life of
two reactors in a Bulgarian nuclear power plant.  EDF and Rosenergoatom lead a group of several companies
bidding to extend the service life of two 1,000-megawatt
reactors at the Kozloduy plant on the Danube, plant spokeswoman
Margarita Kamenova said in a phone interview from Kozloduy,
 Bulgaria , today. The units’ operational lives are due to expire
in 2017 and 2019.  The plant’s management is evaluating the bid and will
announce its decision by September, she said. The service life
extension will cost about 100 million lev ($74 million), she
said.  Kozloduy , Bulgaria’s only atomic power plant, has two
Russian-made 1,000-megawatt reactors, which supply 38 percent of
the nation’s needs. They were built in 1987 and 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
