Greece  will sell 10 million carbon
trading permits through the  Athens Stock Exchange , the
environment, energy and climate change ministry said.  The bourse will auction the permits this year in separate
tranches of 1 million each, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. The permits are unused European Union permits
for the period between 2008 and 2012.  The first tranche will be sold later this month, and the
results of each sale will be published on the exchangeâ€™s
website, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
