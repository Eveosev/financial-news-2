Ukraine’s winter grain crop is
“mostly” in good condition, even as the country experiences
hot and dry weather, said First Deputy Agriculture Minister
Mykola Bezuhlyi.  “The only cereal that we are concerned about is spring
barley,” Bezuhlyi told reporters today in Kiev, without making
any forecast on the harvest.  Ukraine plans to reduce areas planted with spring barley
and replace it with corn, Bezuhlyi said. This year, the country
planted a record 3.4 million hectares (8.4 million acres) of
corn, 600,000 more than a year earlier, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
