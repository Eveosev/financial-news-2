Hungary’s government may acquire 2.8
trillion forint ($15.2 billion) in assets managed by private
pension funds, pension lobby group  Stabilitas  Penztarszovetseg
said today.  The funds managed 3.162 trillion forint as of March 31, of
which the government may receive 2.8 trillion, based on
preliminary data, Julianna Baba, president of Stabilitas, said
in an e-mailed statement. The funds must transfer the assets to
the state by June 12.  The assets under management at the end of March included
1.529 trillion in Hungarian government debt, 1.085 trillion
forint in investment funds and 343 billion forint in shares,
Baba said.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government last year gave the
holders of mandatory private pension funds an ultimatum --
either turn the holdings over to the state or lose 70 percent of
future pension claims. Faced with the possibility of losing the
government portion of their social-security contributions, most
people opted not to block the transfers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
