U.S. Bancorp,  Minnesota ’s biggest
lender, said federal regulations including proposed caps on
debit-card “swipe” fees may cost the bank more than $1 billion
a year in revenue.  “That’s a pretty big loss of income,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Richard Davis said today at a Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. investor conference in New York. Davis also
cited card and banking regulations including those that limit
interest-rate increases, contract changes, and overdraft and
late-payment fees.  The caps on debit-card transaction fees alone may cost the
Minneapolis-based bank $400 million in annual revenue, said
Davis, 53. The  Federal Reserve  has proposed capping the swipe
fees, also called interchange, at 12 cents a transaction,
replacing a formula that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase
price.  U.S. Bancorp may be able recoup 40 percent of the $1
billion by imposing new fees for checking accounts and other
services, Davis said. Some regional competitors are keeping free
checking, a strategy that won’t be sustainable if the proposed
caps take effect, he said.  U.S. Bancorp rose 3 cents to $24.73 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen
8.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
