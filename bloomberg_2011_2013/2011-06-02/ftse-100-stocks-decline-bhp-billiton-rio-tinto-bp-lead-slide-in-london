U.K. stocks dropped for a second day,
led by a selloff in mining companies as base metals tumbled amid
mounting concern that the global economic recovery is faltering.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  lost
more than 2.5 percent as copper, nickel and aluminum retreated.
 Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , maker of a third of all auto-catalysts, and
 Kingfisher Plc (KGF) , Britain’s largest home-improvement retailer,
retreated after posting earnings that trailed estimates.  The FTSE 100 lost 80.69, or 1.4 percent, to 5,847.92 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, for the biggest two-day drop in four
weeks. The gauge slid 1.3 percent last month amid renewed
concern that  Greece  will default on its debts. The FTSE All-
Share Index retreated 1.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index fell 0.3 percent.  “It’s the same old concerns that have sent jitters through
investors,” said  Anthony Grech , head of research at IG Index in
 London . “Worry about the stability of the economic recovery and
just how much worse than expectations the U.S. employment
numbers will be tomorrow.”  Tomorrow’s Labor Department report may show U.S. employers
hired fewer workers in May, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The projected 170,000 gain in payrolls would follow
a 244,000 increase in April. A separate release today showed
factory orders in the world’s largest economy dropped in April
by the most in almost a year.  Greek Default Risk  Stocks also declined today after Greece’s risk of default
was raised to 50 percent by Moody’s Investors Service. The
rating firm downgraded Greece to Caa1 from B1, putting the
Mediterranean nation on par with Cuba. Moody’s move came after
policy makers considered asking investors to reinvest in new
Greek debt when existing bonds mature.  Antofagasta, owner of copper mines in  Chile , slid 3.1
percent to 1,269 pence. Xstrata, the world’s fourth-largest
copper producer, slipped 3.1 percent to 1,375 pence and BHP, the
world’s biggest mining company, fell 2.7 percent to 2,327 pence.  Base metals retreated for a second day on the London Metal
Exchange as the outlook for global growth dimmed. Reports
yesterday showed manufacturing output in the U.S. in May was the
weakest since September 2009, while industrial production cooled
in India and the U.K.  Johnson Matthey  Johnson Matthey declined 3.3 percent to 2,013 pence after
the company posted an 11 percent gain in full-year profit to
182.3 million pounds ($298 million), missing the 230.6 million-
pound average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
company reported a 71.8 million-pound impairment charge that
included costs for closing a Belgian plant.  Kingfisher lost 1 percent to 279.3 pence after the retailer
reported earnings that missed some analysts’ estimates as
profitability declined at its U.K. B&Q chain. Gross margin, or
profit as a percentage of revenue, was “slightly down” in the
U.K. and Ireland as less-profitable seasonal items and increased
promotions drove sales growth.  Home Retail Group Plc fell 2.2 percent to 209 pence, while
Wolseley Plc, which supplies heating and plumbing products,
declined 3.1 percent to 1,959 pence.  Asos Plc (ASC) , Britain’s second-largest online clothing
retailer, sank 8.3 percent to 2,144 pence after a 41 percent
increase in full-year profit wasn’t sufficient for analysts to
raise their earnings estimates, leading some investors to
question the stock’s valuation.  The shares currently trade on a multiple of 60 times
analysts’ estimates of fiscal 2012 earnings. That compares with
11.2 times for the 20-member FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.  Noventa Ltd. plunged 61 percent to 66 pence after the
tantalum miner warned of an “urgent fund-raising requirement.”
Noventa said its current cash position of $17.6 million is
“substantially” less than the business needs.  Serco Group Plc (SRP)  rallied 4.4 percent to 597.5 pence. Credit
Suisse Group AG reiterated its “outperform” recommendation on
the operator of London’s Docklands Light Railway and raised its
price estimate for the shares by 7.4 percent to 720 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
