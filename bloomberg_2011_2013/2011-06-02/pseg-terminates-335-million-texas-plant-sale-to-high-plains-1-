Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) 
terminated a $335 million agreement to sell a natural-gas fueled
power plant in Texas because the buyer, High Plains Diversified
Energy Corp., was unable to obtain financing.  Public Service will seek offers from other bidders for the
1,000 megawatt Odessa plant, Kathleen Lally, vice president for
 investor relations  at Newark, New Jersey-based Public Service,
said in a phone interview today.  High Plains, based in Lubbock, Texas, had intended to close
the transaction during the first quarter and finance it by
selling municipal bonds. The utility, created in 2008 by the
West Texas Municipal Power Agency, was unable to get the
municipal designation needed to tap such financing, Lally said.  Julie Hillrichs, a spokeswoman for High Plains, declined to
comment. High Plains agreed to buy Constellation Energy Group
Inc.â€™s Quail Run power plant in  Texas  for $185.3 million in
December.  Odessa is one of two 1,000 megawatt gas-fired plants that
PSEG is shedding. The sale of another facility, Guadalupe,
closed during the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
