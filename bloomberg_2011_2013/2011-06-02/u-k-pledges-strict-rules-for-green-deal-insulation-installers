The U.K. will enforce “strict”
rules to ensure work carried out under the country’s so-called
Green Deal to insulate homes meets necessary standards, the
Department for Energy and Climate Change said.  An organization called the U.K. Accreditation Service has
been appointed to makes sure efforts to improve the energy
efficiency of homes comply with the standards, the department
said today in an e-mailed statement. Under the Green Deal, which
is currently being debated by lawmakers, the government will set
incentives to insulate the nation’s 26 million homes.  “The Green Deal will be the biggest home improvement
program since the Second World War, shifting our outdated,
drafty homes from the past into the future, so it’s vital people
can trust it,” Climate Change Minister Greg Barker said in the
statement. “I have heard too many cases of shoddy workmanship
or dodgy technology from government schemes in the past, so from
day one there will be strict rules about standards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
