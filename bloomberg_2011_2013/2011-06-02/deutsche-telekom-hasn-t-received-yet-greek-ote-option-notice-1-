Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  said it hasn’t
yet received a notice from the Greek government to exercise the
country’s option to sell another 10 percent in  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO)  to the German company.  The final price Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom will have to
pay for the stake is therefore not decided yet, company
spokesman Andreas Leigers said via phone today. Greek newspaper
Imerisia reported today that Deutsche Telekom will pay the
country’s government 411 million euros ($593 million) and that
the transaction will be closed by the end of June.  Europe ’s largest phone company owns 30 percent in the Greek
operator, also known as OTE, consolidates it and determines its
chief executive officer. Greece’s Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  last week sent a letter to Deutsche Telekom to
initiate the “further privatization” of OTE, of which the
government owns 20 percent, to drive forward a 50 billion-euro
asset sale program and reduce the country’s budget deficit.  HSBC Holdings Plc calculates the price of the 10 percent
stake to be about 400 million euros, or 8 euros a share,
according to a note sent to clients today. The calculation uses
a formula, agreed between Deutsche Telekom and the Greek
government in 2008, of the average volume-weighted share price
of OTE shares over the past 20 trading days before the formal
notice, plus a 15 percent premium, the bank said.  OTE shares dropped 2 percent to 7.04 euros in Athen trading
as of 12:56 p.m. Deutsche Telekom declined 0.4 percent to 10.17
euros in  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
