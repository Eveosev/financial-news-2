U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after government data showed worker productivty grew more
than economists estimated and jobless claims decreased.  S&P 500 futures contracts expiring in June rose 0.3 percent
to 1,315.4 at 8:38 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures expiring the same month advanced 16 points, or
0.1 percent, to 12,290.         Worker productivity, the measure of employee output per
hour, increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate after a 2.9 percent
gain in the prior three months, revised figures from the Labor
Department showed. The median economist forecast was for 1.7
percent.  Jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 422,000 in the week ended
May 28, Labor Department figures showed. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a drop in claims to 417,000, according
to the median forecast. The number of people on unemployment
benefit rolls and those receiving extended payments decreased.  The  S&P 500  sank 2.3 percent yesterday, extending its
decline from an almost three-year high on April 29 to 3.6
percent, as slower growth in jobs and manufacturing fueled
concern that the economy is faltering. The Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index, which tracks the degree to which data beat or
missed forecasts, yesterday closed at its lowest level since
January 2009.  Jobs Report  Investors also awaited tomorrow’s monthly non-farm payrolls
data to assess the severity of the economic slowdown. Companies
added 38,000 workers to payrolls in May, according to figures
from ADP Employer Services reported yesterday, less than one-
quarter of the median forecast by economists. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index showed that U.S. manufacturing
expanded in May at the slowest pace since September 2009.  The reports sent the S&P 500 to a six-week low yesterday.
The index now trades at 13.2 times the estimated earnings of its
companies, according to Bloomberg data, the lowest valuation
since March 18.  The losses are creating a buying opportunity for investors
willing to withstand declines that may reach 10 percent,
according to Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien .  Yesterday’s decrease was the 126th decline of 2 percent or
more during bull markets since 1962, according to Kevin Pleines,
an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut .
Of those, 30 percent occurred within a month of the start of a
so-called correction, or 10 percent drop, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
