Gold may advance for a second day to
near a one-month high as data pointing to an economic slowdown
and prolonged debt turmoil in  Greece  spurred demand for the
metal as a store of value.  Immediate-delivery gold rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,543.55 an ounce before trading at $1,540.65 at 2:04 p.m. in
Singapore. The metal reached $1,550.20 an ounce yesterday, the
highest level since May 3. Cash silver strengthened as much as
1.2 percent to $37.295 an ounce.  Manufacturing growth from  China  to the euro region and the
U.S. slowed in May, adding to signs momentum is weakening in the
global economy. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index fell more than projected to 53.5 last month, the lowest
level since September 2009, U.S. data showed yesterday.  “Investors bought the safe-haven asset” after signs of
economic slowdown in the U.S.,  Mark Pervan , head of commodity
research with ANZ Banking Group Ltd., wrote in a note today.
Continued central-bank purchases of bullion also provided
“additional support and positive sentiment for gold.”  Bullion is extending its 10-year winning streak as retail
investors, pension funds and central bankers seek to protect
wealth against  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis, weaker currencies
and resurgent inflation.  Russia and  Mexico  in April added gold now valued at almost
$1 billion to their reserves. Russia bought 13.72 metric tons in
the month, raising holdings to 824.83 tons, according to data on
the International Monetary Fund’s website. Mexico’s assets rose
5.93 tons to 106.14 tons, the data showed this week.  Default Risk  Greece’s risk of default was raised to 50 percent by
Moody’s Investors Service as European officials rushed to put
together the second bailout plan in two years to stave off
renewed financial turmoil in the region.  Moody’s downgraded Greece to Caa1 from B1, putting it on a
par with Cuba, according to a report published late yesterday.
The move came after policy makers considered asking investors to
reinvest in new Greek debt when existing bonds mature.  “Slowing growth and increased uncertainty over the outlook
ahead may keep gold supported,” said Ong Yi Ling, a Singapore-
based analyst with Phillip Futures Pte.  An ounce of gold bought 41.5687 ounces of silver today
after the ratio jumped 4.8 percent yesterday, the most since May
16. The gold-to-silver ratio fell to as low as 31.7135 on April
28 and rebounded to as high as 44.3310 on May 16.  Spot palladium and platinum were little changed at $772.75
an ounce and $1,817.50 an ounce, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
