The U.S. Energy Department approved a
conditional $45.6 million loan guarantee for a Spanish company’s
plan to build a solar-energy project about 25 miles (40
kilometers) northeast of  Las Vegas .  The 20-megawatt project, sponsored by Fotowatio Renewable
Ventures Inc. of  Madrid , will create 250 jobs “at peak
construction,” the agency said today in a statement.  The Fotowatio PV project will have more than 90,000 solar
panels that will track the sun on a single axis and utility
Nevada Power Co will buy the power it produces.  The loan for the project, from John Hancock Financial
Services Inc., is backed by the Energy Department through its
Financial Institution Partnership Program.  Under the program, the Energy Department pays the credit
subsidy costs of loan guarantees and provides a guarantee for up
to 80 percent of a loan provided to a renewable energy
generation project by qualified financial institutions.  -- Editors: Will Wade, Reed Landberg  To contact the reporter on this story:
