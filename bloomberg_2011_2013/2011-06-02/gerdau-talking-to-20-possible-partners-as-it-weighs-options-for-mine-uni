Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, said it’s in talks with 20 companies including steel
and mining producers for a possible partnership to develop its
2.9 billion metric tons of iron-ore reserves.  The company, based in  Porto Alegre ,  Brazil , will decide as
early as the end of the year whether to seek a partner, sell
shares of the mining business or develop the deposits with its
own resources, Chief Executive Officer Andre Gerdau Johannpeter
said in an interview in Sao Paulo today.  “There are several alternatives: doing it ourselves, with
a steel partner, with a trading partner, a mining partner or an
IPO,” Johannpeter said. “The idea is to make a decision by the
end of the year.”  Gerdau is exploring strategic options for its iron-ore
assets as steelmakers look to capitalize on higher metal and
mineral prices. Chief Financial Officer Osvaldo Schirmer said
May 31 that Gerdau will appoint banks in coming weeks to assess
the mineral reserves and estimate how much surplus iron-ore it
will be able to produce after supplying its own steel plants.  Gerdau rose 6 centavos, or 0.4 percent, to 16.87 reais in
 Sao Paulo  trading today. It has fallen 26 percent this year,
more than a 7.3 percent loss for the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
