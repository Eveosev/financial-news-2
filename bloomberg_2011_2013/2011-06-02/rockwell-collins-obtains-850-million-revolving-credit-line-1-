Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL) , the Cedar
Rapids, Iowa-based maker of communication and aviation
electronics, obtained an $850 million revolving line of credit.  The company will use the revolver to make acquisitions,
repurchase stock and backstop commercial paper, according to a
filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Citigroup Inc., Bank of America
Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., UBS AG and Wells Fargo &
Co. helped arrange the loan, according to the filing.  “The five-year market had opened and pricing had come in
considerably making this a favorable time to renew,” said Dave
Gosch, a Rockwell Collins spokesman.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
