Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  had a spill of
“dissolved air flotation material” from an above-ground line
after an equipment failure at its Washington state refinery,
according to a report  filed  with the National Response Center.  U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
