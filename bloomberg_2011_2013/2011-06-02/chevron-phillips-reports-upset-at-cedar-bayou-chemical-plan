Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC
reported a unit upset at its Cedar Bayou chemical plant in
Baytown,  Texas , according to a filing with state regulators.  A compressor, which tripped and caused the upset, was
restarted, the company said in a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. Emissions associated with
the upset started at 10 p.m. local time yesterday and lasted 6
hours, the filing said.  A cracking furnace and an ethylene unit were included in
the listed sources of the emissions, according to the filing.  Steam crackers split oil products like naphtha and
liquefied petroleum gases through pressure and heat. Outages can
increase prices for ethylene and propylene as companies turn to
spot markets to help them meet supply contracts.  The company is a joint venture of  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and
 ConocoPhillips. (COP)  Steam crackers process natural gas liquids or
naphtha into basic petrochemicals used in plastics.  The Cedar Bayou plant is located about 32 miles (51
kilometers) east of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
