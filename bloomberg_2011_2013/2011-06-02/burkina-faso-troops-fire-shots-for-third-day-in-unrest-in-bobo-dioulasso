Soldiers in  Burkina Faso’s  second-
biggest city, Bobo Dioulasso, fired shots in the air during a
third day of unrest as shopkeepers protested the troops’ looting
of their stores.  The firing started overnight at a military base in the city
and continued today, said resident Karim Cisse in a phone
interview. A 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was issued for the city,
according to a statement read on state-owned television.  The conflict in Bobo Dioulasso comes amid a series of army
protests over delayed pay and allowances, including a mutiny in
the evening of April 14 that forced President Blaise Compaore to
flee the capital until the next morning.  Shopkeepers in the city, which is 360 kilometers (223
miles) from Ouagadougou, the capital, demonstrated against the
soldiers who they said looted their businesses.  The merchants are “dissatisfied because yesterday the
soldiers went out again and still plundered,” said Bruno
Dondasse, president of the city’s young storekeepers’
association, by phone today.  Burkina Faso  is  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer and one of
the continent’s poorest countries, with gross domestic product
per capita of $517, about half the average rate for the
continent, according to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
