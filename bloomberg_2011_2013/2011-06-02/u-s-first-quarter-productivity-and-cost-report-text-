The following is the text of the U.S.
productivity and costs report for the first quarter released
by the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a 2.8 percent
annual rate during the first quarter of 2010, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics  reported today, with output rising 4.0 percent and hours rising
1.1 percent. (All quarterly percent changes in this release are seasonally
adjusted annual rates.) From the first quarter of 2009 to the first
quarter of 2010, output increased 3.0 percent while hours fell 3.0
percent, yielding an increase in productivity of 6.1 percent (tables A,
and 2). This gain in productivity from the same quarter a year ago was the
largest since output per hour increased 6.1 percent over the four-quarter
period ending in the first quarter of 2002.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index
of real output by an index of hours of all persons, including employees,
proprietors, and unpaid family workers. The measures released today were
based on more recent source data than were available for the preliminary
report.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beginning with the Productivity and Costs news release scheduled for
August 10, 2010, the index series will be rebased from 1992=100 to
2005=100.  Also, the presentation of the data in tables 1-6 will be
reformatted. In the new format, the three panels in each table will be
rearranged. The first panel will present percent changes from the previous
quarter, the second will show percent changes from the corresponding
quarter of the previous year, and the third will show indexes. All data
will be presented in reverse chronological order, listing the most recent
data first.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses fell 1.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2010, as the 2.8 percent increase in productivity outpaced a
1.5 percent gain in hourly compensation. Unit labor costs fell 4.2 percent
over the last four quarters, as the 6.1 percent increase in output per
hour over that period outpaced a 1.6 percent rise in hourly compensation.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to  labor
productivity ; increases in hourly compensation tend to increase unit labor
costs and increases in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Manufacturing sector productivity grew 1.5 percent in the first quarter of
2010, as output rose 7.2 percent and hours worked increased 5.6 percent.
Gains in productivity, output, and hours were each larger in the durable
goods sector than in the nondurable goods sector.  Unit labor costs in manufacturing declined 1.5 percent in the first quarter
of 2010 and fell 5.1 percent over the last four quarters. The four-quarter
decline was the largest in the series, which begins in the first quarter of
1988.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of the manufacturing
output series differ from those used in preparing the business and nonfarm
business output series, and these measures are not directly comparable.
See Technical Notes for further information on data sources.  Nonfinancial corporate sector productivity increased 4.2 percent in the
first quarter of 2010 as output and hours rose 6.4 percent and 2.1
percent, respectively.  Revised measures  Table B presents previous and revised productivity and related measures
for the major sectors: business, nonfarm business, and manufacturing, for
the first quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009.  In the first quarter of 2010, nonfarm business productivity growth was
revised down to 2.8 percent from the 3.6 percent preliminary estimate,
reflecting a downward revision to output and an upward revision to hours.
Unit labor costs fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter, a slightly smaller
decline than reported May 6. In the manufacturing sector, productivity
growth in the first quarter was revised down to 1.5 percent from 2.5
percent. Unit labor costs declined 1.5 percent rather than falling 3.7
percent as previously reported.  In the fourth quarter of 2009, nonfarm business productivity was
unrevised, while a 2.3 percentage point downward revision to hourly
compensation resulted in a larger decline in unit labor costs (-7.8
percent) than was previously reported.  In the manufacturing sector,
fourth quarter productivity was unrevised, while an upward revision to
hourly compensation slowed the rate of decline in unit labor costs to 4.2
percent.  The preliminary Productivity and Costs press release for second-quarter
2010 is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, August 10, 2010 at 8:30 a.m.
(EDT).  ==============================================================================
