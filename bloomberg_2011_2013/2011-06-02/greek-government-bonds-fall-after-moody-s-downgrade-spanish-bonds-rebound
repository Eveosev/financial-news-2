Greek 10-year  government bonds  fell
for a second day after Moody’s Investors Service said there is a
50 percent chance that the nation will default.  German 10-year yields reached the lowest since January as
policy makers haggled over a second bailout for  Greece  in just
over a year. Bunds pared their advance after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said governments should
consider setting up a  finance ministry  for the 17-nation
currency region. Spanish debt rose after the nation auctioned 4
billion euros ($5.8 billion) of three- and four-year notes,
meeting the maximum target.  “The market’s focus is on when we will get the new bailout
package and what conditions will feature, and that’s continuing
to be the name of the game,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.  Greek 10-year yields rose 10 basis points to 16.25 percent
as of 4:55 p.m. in London. The 6.25 percent security due June
2020 slipped 0.28 or 2.80 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,443) face
amount, to 54.23.  Moody’s downgraded Greece to Caa1 from B1, the same level
as Cuba, late yesterday. The move came as policy makers narrowed
in on bond rollovers as a pillar of any new aid package.
Investors may be given preferred status, higher coupon payments
or collateral as incentives, according to two EU officials
familiar with the situation.  The debt-stricken nation, which faces a funding gap of 30
billion euros next year, has seen its 10-year yield surge more
than 340 basis points since the start of April.  Spanish Auction  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.99 percent,
after earlier sliding to 2.96 percent, the lowest level since
Jan. 12. The German two-year note yield advanced three basis
points to 1.64 percent.  Spain ’s bonds advanced as it sold 4 billion euros of three-
year and four-year securities, meeting the maximum target the
Treasury had set for the sale.  Investors bid for 2.49 times the amount of 2014 securities
on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.79 at an
auction in April, and 2.90 times the amount of securities due
2015, from 1.63 at a sale in September. The average yield on the
three-year note was 4.037 percent, while the four-year security
attracted an average yield of 4.23 percent.  Irish, Portuguese Debt  “It seems to have gone reasonably well, with the
authorities managing to get the upper end of their targeted
level away,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist
at RIA Capital Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Investors are clearly
demanding a higher  risk premium  on Spanish government bonds than
they have done previously, but the fact that they are able to
raise the upper end of their targeted level is reassuring.”  Spain’s 10-year yield slid three basis points to 5.29
percent, while the two-year yield declined five basis points to
3.43 percent. Portuguese debt also rose, with the 10-year yield
slipping eight basis points to 9.65 percent, while the yield on
similar-maturity Irish debt gained three basis points to 11.01
percent.  German government bonds have handed investors 0.2 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent and Spanish bonds 2.7
percent. Greek bonds have lost 12.5 percent so far this year and
Portuguese debt 14.5 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
