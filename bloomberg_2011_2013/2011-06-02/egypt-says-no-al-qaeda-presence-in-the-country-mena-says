There are no “al-Qaeda elements” in
 Egypt  and reports about the terror network’s presence in the
 Sinai Peninsula  are “groundless,” Assistant Interior Minister
Hamed Abdullah said, according to Egypt’s state-run Middle East
News Agency.  Abdullah’s comments came after the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz reported on May 30 that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said terrorist groups are increasing their presence in
Sinai due to the political turmoil in Egypt. Abdullah didn’t
mention specific reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
