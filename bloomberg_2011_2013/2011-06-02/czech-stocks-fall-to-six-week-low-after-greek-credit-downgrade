The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell the most in 1 1/2 weeks after a downgrade of  Greece ’s
debt rating and U.S. economic data drove appetite for riskier
assets worldwide.  The 15-member PX gauge declined 0.5 percent to 1,240 by
4:28 p.m. in Prague, its biggest one-day drop since May 23,
after earlier tumbling as much as 1.1 percent.  Erste Group Bank
AG (EBS)  led the fall, retreating 0.7 percent to 836.5 koruna.  European stocks dropped after Moody’s late yesterday cut
Greece to Caa1 from B1, putting it on par with Cuba, and raised
the country’s default risk to 50 percent. A bigger-than-expected
drop in U.S. factory orders added to concern the recovery in the
world’s largest economy is faltering.  “Thursday trading in European stock markets was affected
by a hefty reduction of Greece’s rating,” Miroslav Adamkovic,
an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a report to
clients today. “Pessimism prevailed among investors.”  New World Resources Plc fell to its lowest this year after
the biggest Czech coking-coal producer offered 6.1 percent of
its shares for sale. NWR dropped 4.9 percent to 252 koruna at
its  Prague  close, and traded down 5.1 percent at 919.5 pence at
3:50 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
