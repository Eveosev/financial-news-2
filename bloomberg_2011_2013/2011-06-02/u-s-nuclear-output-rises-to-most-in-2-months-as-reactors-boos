U.S. nuclear-power production rose
2.4 percent to the highest level in more than two months as
operators boosted reactors in  Pennsylvania  and four Southern
states, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported.  Power generation nationwide increased by 2,000 megawatts
from yesterday to 84,006 megawatts, or 83 percent of capacity,
the most since March 27, according to the NRC report today and
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sixteen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors
were offline.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  increased output at the 1,134-megawatt
Limerick 2 reactor in Pennsylvania to 20 percent of capacity
from 3 percent yesterday. It shut automatically on May 29
because of low pressure in the electro-hydraulic control and on
May 30 because two recirculation pumps tripped.  The unit returned to service April 23 from a refueling and
maintenance outage that began March 28. The plant is about 30
miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia. Another reactor
at the site, the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1, is operating at full
power.  The  Tennessee  Valley Authority raised power at the 1,115-
megawatt Browns Ferry 3 to 40 percent of capacity from 20
percent as the Alabama plant returns to service after storms
April 27 knocked out parts of the regional transmission grid.  The 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 and the 1,104-megawatt
Unit 2 are at full power at the site 84 miles north of
Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee line.  Watts Bar Boost  The TVA boosted the 1,123-megawatt Watts Bar 1 reactor in
Tennessee to 99 percent of capacity from 45 percent after the
unit automatically shut May 29 because a turbine tripped
offline. The unit, 55 miles southwest of Knoxville, was closed
for refueling April 4.  Southern Co. (SO)  raised at the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor in  Georgia  to 82 percent of capacity from 7 percent
after it was shut May 28. The 876-megawatt Hatch 1 is at full
power at the plant 74 miles west of Savannah.  Scana Corp. (SCG)  increased output from the 966-megawatt Virgil
C. Summer reactor in  South Carolina  to 80 percent of capacity
from 48 percent following a refueling outage. The plant is near
Jenkinsville, about 26 miles northwest of Columbia.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
