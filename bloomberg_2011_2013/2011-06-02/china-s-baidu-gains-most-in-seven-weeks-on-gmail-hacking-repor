Baidu Inc., the owner of  China ’s most
popular online search engine, jumped the most in seven weeks in
U.S. trading after Google Inc. said hackers attempted to steal
passwords from hundreds of Gmail users, targeting the accounts
of government officials in the U.S. and Asia.  Baidu rose as much as 4.3 percent, the most on an intraday
basis since April 11, to $138.20. Chinese Internet companies
Sina Corp. and  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  gained at least 3 percent.  The U.S. government was notified yesterday and is looking
into the allegations, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said.
The FBI is working with Google to review the matter, said Jenny
Shearer, a bureau spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
