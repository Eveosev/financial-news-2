Greek two-year notes snapped three
days of gains after the nation’s risk of default was raised to
50 percent by Moody’s Investors Service, damping optimism about
prospects for an international aid package.  The German bund yield reached the lowest since January amid
concern the global economic recovery is faltering. The U.S.
reports initial jobless claims today, following data yesterday
that showed U.S. employers hired fewer workers than forecast.
The Stoxx Europe 600 equity index fell 0.9 percent. Spanish debt
rebounded as the nation auctioned 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion)
of three- and four-year notes, meeting the maximum target.  “The market’s focus is on when we will get the new bailout
package and what conditions will feature, and that’s continuing
to be the name of the game,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “An important
driver for bunds has been the bad U.S. data, which lent support
to bunds, so today’s initial U.S. jobless claims will be
important.”  Greek two-year note yields rose six basis points to 24.60
percent at 10:22 a.m. in London. The yield yesterday fell to
24.53 percent, the least since May 17. The 4.6 percent security
due May 2013 slipped 0.015, or 15 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 71.66. The nation’s 10-year bond yield gained 13
basis points to 16.28 percent.  Moody’s downgraded  Greece  to Caa1 from B1, the same level
as Cuba, late yesterday. The move came as policy makers narrowed
in on bond rollovers as a pillar of any new aid package.
Investors may be given preferred status, higher coupon payments
or collateral as incentives, said two other EU officials
familiar with the situation.  Growth Concerns  The debt-stricken nation, which faces a funding gap of 30
billion euros of bonds next year, has seen its 10-year yield
surge over 340 basis points higher since the start of April.  The 10-year bund yield was unchanged at 2.99 percent after
earlier sliding to 2.96 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 12.
The yield on German two-year notes rose two basis points to 1.63
percent. It slumped to 1.56 percent on May 30, the least in 10
weeks.  U.S. employment increased by 38,000 last month, the
smallest increase since September, from a revised 177,000 in
April, according to figures from ADP Employer Services
yesterday. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
anticipated a 175,000 advance for May.  Initial jobless claims in the world’s largest economy fell
to 417,000 from 424,000 the prior week, according to the median
estimate of 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
today’s report.  Spanish Auction  The yield on the 10-year Spanish bond fell three basis
points to 5.29 percent after reaching as high as 5.35 percent
before the debt auction. The two-year yield slipped two basis
points to 3.46 percent after earlier reaching 3.52 percent.  Investors bid for 2.49 times the amount of 2014 securities
on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.79 at an
auction in April, and 2.90 times the amount of securities due
2015, from 1.63 at a sale in September. The average yield on the
three-year note was 4.037 percent, while the four-year security
attracted an average yield of 4.23 percent.  “It seems to have gone reasonably well,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Investors are clearly demanding a higher  risk
premium  on Spanish government bonds than they have done
previously, but the fact that they are able to raise the upper
end of their targeted level is reassuring.’  Irish, Portuguese Debt  Spain  faced “a subnormal secondary market liquidity
environment, and that’s somewhat of a challenge,” Schnautz said
before the auction. He said the nation’s target of between 3
billion and 4 billion euros was “not too aggressive compared to
their recent ranges.”  Irish debt fell, pushing the 10-year yield up three basis
points to 11 percent. The yield on similar-maturity Portuguese
debt dropped seven basis points to 9.67 percent.  German  government bonds  have handed investors 0.2 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent. Greek bonds have lost 12.5
percent so far this year and Portuguese debt 14.5 percent, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
