PBF Energy Co. LLC had an operational
upset at its refinery in Paulsboro,  New Jersey , according to
Michael Gayda, a company spokesman. The refinery wasn’t shut
down and is operating, he said.  A gas release and a 45-minute evacuation of a nearby high
school were reported today on NJ.com, a local news  website . An
“all clear” was given at 9:15 a.m. local time for students to
return to class, NJ.com said.  “We did have an operational upset in one of our units this
morning and we’re investigating if that was the source of the
odor,” Gayda, who is based at company headquarters in
Parsippany, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview today. He
declined to comment on operating rates.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The plant can process 185,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PBF, which was formed in 2008 to acquire U.S. refineries,
agreed in September to purchase Valero’s Paulsboro unit for
about $360 million and an estimated $275 million for crude
inventories and other expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
