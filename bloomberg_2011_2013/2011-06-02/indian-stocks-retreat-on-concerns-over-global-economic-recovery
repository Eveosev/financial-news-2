India’s benchmark stock index fell
for the first time in three days, tracking declines in other
Asian markets, as weak U.S. manufacturing and jobs data stoked
concern the global economic recovery will slow.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s second-largest lender, lost
3.1 percent, the most since May 23.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner
of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped to its lowest since Sep. 17. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.8 percent after reports showed
U.S. manufacturing expanded at the weakest pace in more than a
year and employers hired fewer workers than forecast.  Reliance
Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. and other
companies owned by Anil Ambani tumbled after CNBC TV-18 reported
that a court may rule on a plea to investigate the billionaire
today. It didn’t elaborate.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
112.80, or 0.6 percent, to 18,496.01, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge closed
yesterday at its highest level since May 2. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. dropped 0.7
percent to 5,550.35. Its June futures traded at 5,563. The BSE
200 Index declined 0.7 percent to 2,297.86.  To contact the reporter on this story:
