Hog prices fell for the second
straight day on signs of waning U.S. demand for pork. Cattle
futures slipped.  Wholesale pork fell 1.9 percent yesterday to 88.16 cents a
pound, the lowest since Jan. 27, government data show. U.S.
meatpackers processed 1.264 million hogs in the week through
today, up 2.3 percent from a year earlier, Department of
Agriculture figures show. Hogs in the  spot market  fell 3.7
percent in May, the first drop since October.  Meatpackers are “having trouble moving product,” said
Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC
in  Chicago . “That’s keeping a negative tone on prices.”  Hog futures for July settlement fell 1.175 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at 87.975 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price dropped 0.9 percent
yesterday. The commodity has gained 7.1 percent in the past
year.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.25 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1.03675 a pound. The price has gained 14
percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement were unchanged
at $1.23875 a pound.  Spot- steer  prices have declined 0.2 percent from a week
earlier.  Feedlots  bought 9.9 percent more cattle in April than a
year earlier, increasing the number of animals coming to
slaughter.  The market “still has large supplies to deal with,” said
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
