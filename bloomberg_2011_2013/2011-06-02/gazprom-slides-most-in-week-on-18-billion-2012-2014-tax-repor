OAO Gazprom slid the most in more
than a week after Kommersant reported the Russian gas export
monopoly may have to pay an additional $18 billion in tax in
2012 through 2014.  The shares dropped 1.2 percent to 201.36 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their biggest fall since May 23.  Gazprom may have to pay 150 billion rubles ($5.35 billion)
of additional taxes next year, 170 billion rubles in 2013 and
185 billion rubles in 2014, the Moscow-based newspaper said,
citing documents from a government meeting yesterday.  Gazprom’s higher-than-expected tax liability will “likely
have a negative impact” on its stock, Sergey Vakhrameev, an
equity analyst at Metropol IFC in Moscow, said in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
