CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH)  rose to a 4 1/2-
month high after  Daily Nation  reported Bill Lay, the former
chief executive of General Motors East Africa Ltd., will lead
the Kenyan car dealership.  The shares climbed 3.8 percent to 12.45 shillings at the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the strongest level since
Jan. 19.  Lay, who retired from General Motors East Africa this year,
joined CMC on May 1, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported. Lay
will replace Martin Forster who left the company as part of a
“normal restructuring” in March, Nairobi-based  Daily Nation 
reported today, without citing anyone.  CMC is Kenya’s fourth-biggest car dealer after  General
Motors East Africa ,  Toyota East Africa Ltd.  and  D.T. Dobie Ltd. ,
according to data from the  Kenya  Motor Industry Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
