Heating oil gained after an industry-
funded report showed distillate inventories fell last week and
as refinery outages tightened supply of transportation fuels.  Futures advanced as the  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday that distillate stockpiles declined 1.41 million
barrels last week. ConocoPhillips shut a crude unit after a fire
yesterday at its Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc was restarting units at its Deer Park,
Texas, plant following a steam loss.  “The API number was supportive of heating oil,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in New York.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 3.22 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.0409 a gallon at 10:15 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  “The refinery outages we’ve had are supportive for
products,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in  Chicago .  New York  Harbor is the delivery point for Nymex gasoline
and heating oil futures, so an outage at the 250,000-barrel-a-
day plant along the Arthur Kill typically affects prices on the
exchange.  “When Conoco had the fire, it impacts the amount of
gasoline and diesel fuel they produce for the New York area,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  Weaker Dollar  Futures also advanced as a weaker dollar increased the
investment appeal of commodities. The U.S. currency lost 0.8
percent against the euro as of 10:15 a.m. in New York.  Gasoline for July delivery added 1.13 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.9886 a gallon on the exchange.  API said gasoline inventories rose 1.49 million barrels
last week.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 11 a.m. today in  Washington , a day later than
usual because of the Memorial Day holiday.  Gasoline stockpiles probably increased 900,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 14 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. Supplies of diesel and heating oil were likely
down 250,000 barrels.  Regular gasoline at the pump rose 0.9 cent to $3.784 a
gallon, AAA said on its website. It was the first increase since
May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
