China ’s yuan fell for the first time
in four days as concern the global economic recovery is losing
momentum cooled demand for emerging-market assets.  U.S. manufacturing grew at the slowest rate in more than a
year and employers hired fewer workers than forecast, data
showed yesterday, adding to evidence of a global slowdown.
China’s manufacturing expanded in May at the weakest pace in
nine months, a separate report showed. The People’s Bank of
China lowered the currency’s reference rate 0.08 percent to
6.4886 per dollar today after setting it yesterday at the
strongest level since July 2005.  “Concern over the global slowdown is triggering  risk
aversion  and sending liquidity back to the  U.S. dollar ,” said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in
Hong Kong.  The yuan fell 0.09 percent to 6.4838 per dollar as of 10:50
a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest decline in more than a week,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency has appreciated 1.6 percent this year and reached
6.4777 yesterday, the strongest level since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. It isn’t
allowed to move more than 0.5 percent on either side of the
central bank’s daily fixing.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.14 percent to
6.3685, a 1.8 percent premium to the spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the
currency declined 0.08 percent to 6.4815.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
fell more than projected to 53.5 last month, the lowest level
since September 2009, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said.
Companies added 38,000 workers to payrolls, the fewest since
September, according to ADP Employer Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
