Theodor Weimer, head of  UniCredit
SpA (UCG) ’s German Hypovereinsbank unit, criticized the bank levy,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  “It is right that we pay a bank fee. It is not right that
we pay so much in comparison to Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank,”
the newspaper reported him as saying. The charge should be
proportionate to the size and underlying risk of the
institution, he told Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
