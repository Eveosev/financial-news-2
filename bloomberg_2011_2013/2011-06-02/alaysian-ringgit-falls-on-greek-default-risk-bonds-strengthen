Malaysia’s ringgit fell for the first
time in six days after Moody’s Investors Service slashed
 Greece ’s credit rating, bolstering demand for dollars and
deterring investment in emerging-market assets.  Currencies weakened across  Southeast Asia ’s five biggest
economies and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares dropped the
most in a week. Moody’s downgraded Greece to Caa1 from B1,
putting it on a par with Cuba, it said yesterday. The move came
after policy makers considered asking investors to reinvest in
new Greek debt when existing bonds mature.  The ringgit slid 0.5 percent to 3.0205 per dollar as of
4.33 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, after strengthening 1.8 percent in
the previous five trading days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Greece’s downgrade by Moody’s is prompting people to buy
the safe-haven dollar,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at
Bangkok Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit’s fall today is
just a temporary pullback. In the long-term, the currency will
rise given talk of a rate hike in July.”  The central bank raised its overnight policy rate to 3
percent from 2.75 percent on May 5 to tame inflation, which hit
a two-year high of 3.2 percent in April. The rate will be
boosted by at least a quarter of a percentage point in the next
three months, according to six of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The bank will next review borrowing costs on July 7.  Government bonds  rose, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield
to the lowest level since its issuance in January. The rate on
the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 fell two basis point, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.98 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia. The price increased 0.15 or 1.50 ringgit per 1,000
ringgit face amount to 101.45.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
