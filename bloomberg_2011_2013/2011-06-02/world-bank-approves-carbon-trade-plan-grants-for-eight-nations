     June 2 (Bloomberg News) -- The  World Bank  approved grants
for eight countries to help them analyze and design greenhouse-
gas trading programs.  Chile, China, Columbia,  Costa Rica , Indonesia, Mexico,
Thailand and Turkey each received an initial grant of $350,000,
the bank said today in a statement. The grants are the first
under the Partnership for Market Readiness, a World Bank
initiative started at the last United Nations climate summit in
Cancun, Mexico.  “These countries are taking a lead in building the
capacity foundation for a future global carbon market,” Andrew Steer, the World Bank’s Special Envoy for Climate Change, said
in the statement published during the Carbon Expo in Barcelona.  To contact the reporters on this story:
