Spain  sold 4 billion euros ($5.8
billion) of bonds, meeting the maximum target the Treasury set
for the sale and sending the nation's bonds higher.  The Treasury in Madrid said it sold 2.75 billion euros of
three-year bonds at an average yield of 4.037 percent, compared
with 3.568 percent the last time the securities were auctioned
on April 7 and 4.118 percent on the secondary market before the
sale. It also sold 1.2 billion euros of four-year debt at an
average yield of 4.23 percent.  Demand for the three-year bonds was 2.49 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.79 last month, and the bid-to-cover ratio
for the longer-maturity debt was 2.9.  “The auction went well as they usually do in Spain,” said
 Harvinder Sian , a senior bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in  London . “This week European buying has
been significant, given positive news of a possible bond
rollover as a pillar of a new aid package to  Greece .”  “There is also a domestic audience in Spain which tends to
participate in auctions to support bond prices,” Sian said.  Spain’s Socialist government is trying to shield the euro
region’s fourth-largest economy from the sovereign-debt crisis
as expectations of a Greek debt restructuring grow. Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded Greece’s sovereign-debt rating to
Caa1 from B1 yesterday and said the country’s risk of default
was 50 percent.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond fell after the
sale to 5.323 percent, narrowing the gap between Spanish and
German borrowing costs to 233 basis points compared with 238
before the sale. That compares with a euro-era record of 298
basis points on Nov. 30 and an average of 15 basis points in the
first decade of monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
