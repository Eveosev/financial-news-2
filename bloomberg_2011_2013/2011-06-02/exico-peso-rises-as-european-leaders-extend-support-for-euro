Mexico’s peso gained the most in two
weeks as European leaders expressed support for the euro and the
creation of a region-wide  finance ministry , pushing the dollar
down and boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso advanced 0.7 percent to 11.6320 per  U.S. dollar  at
5 p.m. New York time, from 11.7091 yesterday. Earlier, it gained
the most since May 19. The peso has strengthened 6.1 percent
this year, the second-best performer among the major Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after the Colombian
peso.  “Everyone is following the euro and European risk right
now,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base
Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey. “Germany has come out
saying they will support the euro, and France too.”  The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.4491 in New York. European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said today that he
favored a ministry of finance for euro nations and giving the
European Union veto power on budget measures of countries that
go “harmfully astray.” German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
“we don’t have a euro problem.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 rose 4
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.07 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.46 centavo to 125.42 centavos per peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
buying as much as $600 million through the options monthly since
March 2010, boosting foreign reserves and curbing the peso’s
gain.  Foreign reserves rose to a record $127.9 billion in the
week ending May 27, the central bank said this week in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
