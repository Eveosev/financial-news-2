The following companies had unusual

Colcap Index declined 0.1 percent to 1,752.74.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA (ETB CB), the
state-run phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, rose 4.6
percent to 707 pesos. Bogota’s mayor’s office will submit as
soon as June 10 a proposal that would allow the city to sell
part or all of its 86.6 percent stake in the company, Cristina
Plazas, who was appointed to handle the proposal, said
yesterday.  “The market sees there’s a concrete proposal and that the
process for a sale is moving forward,” said Santiago Melo,
analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores SA.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
rose 2.6 percent to 59.5 pesos on speculation of a possible sale
of the company and on “increasingly positive news” about a
pending trade agreement between Colombia and the U.S., Melo
said.  Mineros SA (MINEROS)  , Colombia’s largest gold producer,
fell the most in six months after gold futures declined as the
euro climbed, eroding demand for the precious metal as a haven
asset. The stock fell 3.5 percent to 6,330 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
