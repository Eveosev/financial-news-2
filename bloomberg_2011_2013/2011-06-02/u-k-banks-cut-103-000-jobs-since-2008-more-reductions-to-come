The U.K.’s five-largest banks
including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  have eliminated more than 103,000 jobs since 2008,
with more to come.  That’s about 11 percent of their combined global workforces
from the end of 2008 through 2010, according to Bloomberg data
based on company filings. At least 34,500 of the cuts were made
in Britain.  Banks have “aggressive” plans to control costs, “which
would suggest that some further headcount reduction is
required,” said  Andrew Gray , banking leader at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in London. “In many cases cost
savings will need to be made on their global businesses and will
be spread across their international cost base.”  British banks have cut jobs and sold assets, trimming their
balance sheets by 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.5 trillion) since the
2008 banking crisis as lenders reduce leverage and meet tougher
 capital requirements  from regulators. Financial companies plan
to cut 16,000 more jobs in the first half of 2011, according to
the  Confederation of British Industry , a lobbying group.  The biggest reductions have been at government-assisted RBS
and Lloyds. RBS, which is 83 percent owned by the government,
has cut 74,000 jobs in continued and discontinued units, with
most of the decline resulting from asset sales. Lloyds, 41
percent government owned, has eliminated about 18,100 jobs
including asset sales in the period following its acquisition of
HBOS Plc, the U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender. As part of the
integration, the bank last month said it had saved 1.6 billion
pounds a year in costs at the end of the first quarter and plans
to increase savings to 2 billion pounds by the end of the year.  Barclays, HSBC  “If each day massive groups of staff in processing
centers, bank branches and  call centers  across the country are
informed that their futures are uncertain, this is detrimental
for the U.K.’s chances of economic recovery,” David Fleming, a
Unite trade union’s national officer, said in a statement.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s reduced employee numbers by 5,300 since
2008.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s headcount declined by 17,000,
including about 6,000 in the U.S. after the bank closed its
consumer-finance subprime unit to new customers. Europe’s
biggest bank may eliminate jobs and close offices as part of its
plans to make as much as $3.5 billion of cost savings by 2013,
HSBC said last month. It’s reinvesting the savings in emerging
markets, the bank said.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , which employs 97 percent of its
workforce outside the U.K., added more than 11,400 people since
2008. Like HSBC, the bank has increased assets in the period,
though it is the only bank to have expanded staff, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment on the job
losses.  “The underlying trend is trying to make the back-office
business more efficient, lower and lower, and create the room
for client-facing staff so you can actually take market share,”
said  Mike Trippitt , an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
