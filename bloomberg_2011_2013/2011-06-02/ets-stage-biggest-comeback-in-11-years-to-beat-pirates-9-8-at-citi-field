Carlos Beltran  hit a home run and
drove in four runs as the  New York Mets  rallied from a seven-run
deficit for the first time in 11 years, beating the visiting
Pittsburgh Pirates 9-8 at Citi Field today.  Beltran hit a three-run homer, his ninth of the season, to
cut into Pittsburghâ€™s 7-0 lead in the third inning. The Mets
added four runs in the sixth inning, and broke a 7-7 tie in the
eighth on a sacrifice fly by second baseman Ruben Tejada, who
earlier had a two-run single. Beltran added a bases-loaded walk
in the eighth.  Mets starting pitcher Mike Pelfrey gave up seven earned
runs and 10 hits through the first five innings. Jason Isringhausen (1-0), the fourth New York pitcher, got the win.
 Francisco Rodriguez  gave up one run on two hits in the ninth,
recording his 16th save in his last 16 chances.  The Mets, who last came back from a seven-run deficit on
June 30, 2000, are 26-30 and in fourth place in the National
League East Division. The team hosts the  Atlanta Braves  for a
three-game series starting tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
