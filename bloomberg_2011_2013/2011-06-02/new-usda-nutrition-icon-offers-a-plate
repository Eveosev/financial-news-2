The food pyramid is out. The dinner
plate is in.  The icon -- a plate showing recommended proportions of
grains, fruits, vegetables and proteins, with dairy on the side
-- was unveiled today as the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
introduced its new  MyPlate nutrition initiative  to encourage
people to eat better. It replaces the food-pyramid design that’s
been in use since 2005.  “We wanted to make it easier for kids and their parents to
make choices that will help them lead healthier lives,” said
 Michelle Obama  during today’s ceremony in  Washington .  The program complements the first lady’s “Let’s Move”
campaign targeting childhood obesity, the rate of which almost
doubled from 1988 to 2006, according to a report last year in
the Journal of the  American Medical Association . A separate
study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found
that about 17 percent of children ages 2 to 19 were obese.  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the old
MyPyramid design wasn’t readily understood by consumers. Its
replacement, MyPlate, is “a simple, visual, research-based icon
that leaves an unmistakable message” about proper nutrition, he
said. A pyramid, in different forms, has been used as the USDA’s
healthy-eating symbol since 1992.  The new design is the visual representation of updated
nutritional guidelines introduced last year by the USDA and the
 Department of Health  and Human Services. Whole grains, fruits
and vegetables are emphasized, and consumers are advised to
avoid trans fats, sodium, sugars and heavily processed bread
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
