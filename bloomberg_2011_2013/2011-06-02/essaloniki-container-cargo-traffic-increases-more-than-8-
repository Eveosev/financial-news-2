Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH) , which
operates Greece’s second-biggest port, said it handled 7,550
more containers in the first four months of the year than in the
comparable period of 2010.  The number of containers rose 8.8 percent to 93,046, while
conventional cargo volumes increased 8.7 percent to 1.18 million
metric tons and the number of ships passing through the port
advanced 12.3 percent to 667, according to a  statement  on the
company’s website.  First-quarter profit rose to 2.3 million euros ($3.3
million) from 171,720 euros, the port operator said on May 31. A
week earlier, the government had said it plans to sell in the
second half all or part of its 75 percent stakes in Thessaloniki
Port and Piraeus Port,  Greece ’s biggest, as part of a drive to
raise 50 billion euros from sales of state assets by the end of
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
