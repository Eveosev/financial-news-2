Turkish companies are the most
confident about foreign trade among five European countries
surveyed by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The country scored 122 on HSBC’s foreign trade confidence
index, followed among European countries by  Poland  with a rating
of 109, HSBC said in a written statement distributed to
reporters in Istanbul today.  India  topped the global survey of
21 countries, with a rating of 140. The other European nations
included were the U.K., France and  Germany .  HSBC surveyed more than 300 Turkish companies with annual
sales of between $7 million and $120 million about the outlook
for foreign trade in the next six months, before publishing the
index for the first time. It plans to update it twice a year.  The results of the Turkish survey “show 89 percent of the
participants expect an increase in their trade volumes despite
inflationary pressure,” Virma Sokmen, assistant general manager
for corporate and business banking at HSBC’s Turkish unit, told
reporters.  Almost 40 percent of respondents cited  Turkey ’s trade
regulations and exchange rate fluctuations as the biggest
obstacles to expanding their global sales, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
