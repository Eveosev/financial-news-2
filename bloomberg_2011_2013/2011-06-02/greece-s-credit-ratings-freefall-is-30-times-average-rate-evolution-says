Greece ’s credit rating is tumbling at
almost 30 times the average speed after it was cut three levels
to Caa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, according to Evolution
Securities Ltd.  It typically takes 15,741 days for an issuer to follow the
downgrade path Greece has traversed since it was cut to A2 in
December 2009, the London-based broker said in a note today.
That compares with the 526 days it has taken the nation to make
the journey, Evolution said.  “Statistically, the faster the rating goes down, the more
likely the issuer is to default,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst
at Evolution in  London . “You don’t have to be a mathematician
to see the scale of the problems faced by Greece.”  Greece has a 50 percent chance of defaulting, Moody’s said
yesterday, citing the risk it will be unable to stabilize its
finances and have to restructure debt. Greece faces a funding
gap of about 30 billion euros ($43 billion) next year and is
shut out of the capital markets with yields on its 10-year bonds
of more than 16 percent.  Standard & Poor’s rates Greece B, two levels higher than
Moody’s, and has said it may cut the grade.  Fitch Ratings  is
also reviewing its B+ rating, a step higher than S&P, for a
possible downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
