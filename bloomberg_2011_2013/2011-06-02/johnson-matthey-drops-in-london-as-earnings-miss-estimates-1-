Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , the producer of
a third of all auto-catalysts, dropped the most in three weeks
in London trading after full-year earnings missed estimates.  Net income totaled 182.3 million pounds ($298 million) in
the 12 months through March, the London-based company said today
in a statement. That missed the 230.6 million-pound average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Johnson Matthey fell as much as 2.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since May 12, and traded down 2.6 percent at
2,027 pence as of 8:08 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
