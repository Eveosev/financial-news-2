Spain ’s registered unemployment
dropped in May for a second month as the tourism season began.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits fell
by 79,701 or 1.9 percent, from April, to 4.19 million, the  Labor
Ministry  in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement today.  Spain’s  unemployment rate  stood at 21 percent at the end of
March, the highest in Europe and three times the rate in
Germany. Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on
April 29 that the rate had probably peaked and employment data
would improve in the coming months, coinciding with Spain’s
tourist season, which runs to October.  The doubling of the unemployment rate since the collapse of
a decade-long property boom and the deepest budget cuts in at
least three decades have eroded support for Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialist government suffered its
worst local-election defeat in more than 30 years on May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
