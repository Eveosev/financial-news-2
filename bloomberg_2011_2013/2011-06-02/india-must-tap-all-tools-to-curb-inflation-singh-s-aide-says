India  must use all monetary and
fiscal tools to tame price gains, a top economic adviser to
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said, after inflation stayed above
8 percent in the past 16 months.  “We must remain committed to maintaining inflation at a
low level,” Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime
Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said in Mumbai today. “We
must use all of our policy instruments to bring down the current
inflation and re-anchor inflation expectations to the 4 percent
to 5 percent comfort zone.”  While inflation slowed to 8.66 percent in April from 9.02
percent in March, Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao on May 3 said the rate will probably remain elevated
until September. Subbarao increased the repurchase rate by half
a percentage point to 7.25 percent last month, the biggest move
since July 2008, and indicated he is ready to step up the battle
against prices even at the risk of sacrificing growth.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 fell three
basis points to 8.29 percent as of 10:25 a.m. The Bombay Stock
Exchange’s Sensitive Index fell 0.7 percent, and the rupee was
little changed at 44.90 per dollar.  Asia ’s third-largest economy grew 7.8 percent in the three
months through March, the slowest pace in five quarters, a
government report showed May 31.  “Despite the moderation in growth, the high level of
inflation is a key problem and doesn’t offer any comfort to the
 Reserve Bank  to change its policy stance,” said  Dharmakirti Joshi , a Mumbai-based economist at Crisil Ltd., the local unit
of  Standard & Poor’s .  Joshi expects the central bank to boost rates by as much as
75 basis points by the end of March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
