Ethanol futures gained for the first
time this week, following corn, which rose as planting lagged
behind seasonal norms.  The biofuel increased on concern that production costs will
rise if the corn crop is smaller than expected. Corn is used to
make ethanol in the U.S. The crop was 86 percent planted as of
May 29, below the five-year average of 95 percent.  “They are way behind in planting,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at PFGBest in  Chicago . “That’s just giving the market
legs right now.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.652 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have climbed 12 percent this year.  Corn futures for July delivery climbed 8 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.665 a bushel in Chicago. The grain has more than
doubled in the past year.  Ethanol output in the U.S. advanced 0.8 percent to 909,000
barrels a day last week, according to the Energy Department, the
highest since March 18.  Stockpiles slipped 2.7 percent to 20.2 million barrels from
a record 20.8 million, the department said in a report released
in  Washington , enough to supply the market for 22.9 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 1.7 percent to a record 5.1 million barrels a day.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
