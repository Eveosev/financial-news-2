Copper may fall on speculation demand
will slow as global economic growth falters, a survey showed.  Seven of 15 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 47 percent, said prices will fall next week. Six
predicted a rise and two forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was down 2.8 percent for this week at
$8,943.50 a metric ton by 4:52 p.m. yesterday on the London
Metal Exchange.  “I just find it hard to be bullish copper,” said  Michael Widmer , an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.
“You do have a lot of very poor macro data coming out in a lot
of countries.”  Orders placed with U.S. factories fell in April by the most
in almost a year as demand for aircraft waned and  Japan ’s
earthquake restrained auto-related supplies, a Commerce
Department report showed yesterday.  China ’s manufacturing growth
fell, with the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
saying on June 1 that its purchasing managers’ index dropped to
52 in May from 52.9 in April.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of May 27.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
68 of the past 139 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 7 Bullish: 6 Hold: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
