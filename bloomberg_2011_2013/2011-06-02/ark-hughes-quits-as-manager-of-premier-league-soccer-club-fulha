Mark Hughes  quit as Fulham manager
after just one season, the Premier League soccer club said in a
 statement  on its website.  Hughes, 47, was hired to replace Roy Hodgson in July 2010.
He gave notice, under terms of his contract, that he would leave
at the end of this month, the club said.  Fulham finished eighth in the Premier League last season
and earned a berth in the Europa League via the league’s Fair
Play spot.  The former Manchester United player has been linked in U.K.
media reports with the manager’s job as  Aston Villa . Gerard Houllier quit as Villa coach last night, two months after being
sidelined with a heart problem.  Hughes previously managed Premier League clubs  Manchester
City  and Blackburn, as well as the Wales national team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
