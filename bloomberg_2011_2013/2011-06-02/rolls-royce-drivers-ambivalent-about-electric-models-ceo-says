Rolls-Royce Motor Cars customers have
been ambivalent about potential electric versions of the luxury-
auto maker’s vehicles, and hybrid models may be a possibility,
Chief Executive Officer Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes said.  Rolls-Royce has been showing customers a one-of-a-kind
electric version of its Phantom sedan to gather opinions on
whether the automaker should produce such a vehicle. Buyers of
the $380,000 Phantom and $245,000 Ghost models often live on the
outskirts of major cities and may not accept an electric car’s
100-mile range, Mueller-Oetvoes said in an interview today.  “Let’s wait and see what our customers are telling us, but
hybrids have a certain capability to deliver both electric
driving combined with a normal combustion engine, and that might
be a solution,” he said in Bloomberg’s  Chicago  bureau.  No customers have approached the Goodwood, England-based
automaker to ask for electric versions of the cars, which now
feature 12-cylinder engines, Mueller-Oetvoes said.  The automaker, a unit of Munich-based  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) , is targeting record sales this year after the smaller
Ghost model helped to almost triple global deliveries to 2,711
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
