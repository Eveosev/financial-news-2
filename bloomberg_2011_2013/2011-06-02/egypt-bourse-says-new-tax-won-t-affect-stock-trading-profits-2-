The Egyptian government’s plan to
levy a capital-gains tax only applies to company dividend
distributions and not to profits from trading in stocks, the
 Egyptian Exchange  said today.  The bourse is studying the plan and will discuss it with
the business community and the markets regulator before advising
the government, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement.  The 10 percent tax “is still a proposed law that will be
discussed” with local business councils “to figure out how to
best implement it so as not to affect foreign investment in
Egypt,” bourse Chairman Mohamed Abdel Salam said in the
statement.  The North African country plans to levy the tax starting in
the next fiscal year on dividend payments, mergers and
acquisitions and asset revaluations, Finance Minister Samir
Radwan said yesterday. Egypt is trying to rein in a widening
budget deficit as it raises subsidy spending and salaries of
state employees to meet public demand for improving living
standards after a popular revolt ended 30 years of rule by
former President Hosni Mubarak in February.  The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  of stocks fell 2.7 percent, the
biggest decline since April 18, to 5,361.88 at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
