The  National Football League  and its
players concluded a new round of court-ordered negotiations
before heading to a St. Louis appeals court to decide if a 2
1/2-month-old lockout will continue.  The league and the NFL Players Association “were engaged
in confidential discussions before Chief Magistrate Judge
Boylan,” the sides said in a joint news release. It gave no
other details.  The negotiations, which included owners Jerry Jones of the
 Dallas Cowboys , Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots and
John Mara of the  New York Giants , took place over three days at
a site near Chicago, according to the Associated Press, citing
people who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meetings
were supposed to be secret.  A hearing is set for tomorrow before the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  in St. Louis on the NFL’s appeal of a ruling that
blocked its lockout of the players. The lockout is currently in
place until the appeal is decided.  The collective bargaining agreement between the league and
its players expired in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
