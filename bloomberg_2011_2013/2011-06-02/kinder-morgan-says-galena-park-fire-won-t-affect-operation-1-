Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  said
a fire at its Galena Park, Texas, facility was put out swiftly
and didn’t affect operations.  “It was a very small fire that was quickly extinguished,”
Emily Mir Thompson, a company spokeswoman based in Houston, said
in an e-mailed statement.  A composite dock hose caught fire at the terminal at about
10:20 a.m. yesterday,  Kinder Morgan  said in a state regulatory
filing. The flames were extinguished within about 20 minutes,
according to the report.  There were no injuries, Thompson said. The cause of the
fire is under investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
