Cash premiums for soybeans shipped in
June to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to Chicago
futures as demand from processors declined because of flooding
on the Missouri River. The corn basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 75 cents to 78 cents a bushel, down from 75 cents to
80 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The corn basis was 63 cents to 67 cents a bushel, according to
the USDA.  Floods are “moving from South Dakota down to Omaha, so
it’s going to be pretty bad,” said Troy Lust, a commercial
grain broker for INTL FCStone Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“We’re going to have several plants out of commission because
of that.”  Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 20.75 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $14.07 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after reaching $14.115, the highest for a most-active contract
since April 11. The oilseed has gained 51 percent in the past
year.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 8 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.665 a bushel on the CBOT. The commodity has more
than doubled in the past year.  Parts of  Iowa ,  Nebraska  and South Dakota are under flood
 warnings  as bouts of excess rainfall caused the Missouri River
to overspill its banks, according to the  National Weather
Service . The Missouri River is a tributary of the  Mississippi
River .  To contact the reporter on this story:
