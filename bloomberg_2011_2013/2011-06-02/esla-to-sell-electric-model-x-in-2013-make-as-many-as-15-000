Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , maker of electric
Roadster sports cars, plans to begin selling the Model X, a
rechargeable crossover utility vehicle, in late 2013 as it
expands its lineup of battery-powered autos.  The startup led by Elon Musk intends to sell Model X,
derived from its  Model S  sedan due next year, by 2013’s fourth
quarter, Palo Alto, California-based Tesla said today in a
regulatory filing. Production of the model at Tesla’s plant in
Fremont,  California , may be between 10,000 and 15,000 units a
year, the company said.  “We anticipate that we will make the Model X available
with three range variants, with pricing of each variant similar
to those of the Model S,” the company said. Tesla said in March
that electric Model S cars will cost between $57,400 and
$77,400, before a $7,500 federal tax credit.  The carmaker, whose shareholders include  Daimler AG (DAI) ,  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , last month said it’s selling
5.3 million new shares to help fund Model X development. Musk,
Tesla’s chief executive officer and biggest investor, is buying
1.4 million shares in a private placement as part of the
offering.  Shares of Tesla, named for inventor Nikola Tesla, rose 24
cents to $28.76 at 5:20 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares have gained 8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
