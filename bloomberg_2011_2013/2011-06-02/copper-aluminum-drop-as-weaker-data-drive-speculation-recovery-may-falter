Copper fell to a one-week low on
concern that the global economic recovery may be faltering as
manufacturing slows from  China  to the U.S., the world’s largest
metals buyers.  Manufacturing in the U.S. grew at the slowest pace in more
than a year last month, and more Americans than forecast filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week. China said
industrial production was the weakest since August. Copper
prices have dropped 12 percent from a record in February.  “The market is starting to take more seriously the
prospect of a meaningful slowdown in growth in the western
world, and potentially in China,” said  Daniel Brebner , an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London.  Copper futures for July delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $4.0845 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , after touching $4.0325, the lowest since May 25.
The metal reached an all-time high of $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  “The weak data has really started to weigh on the
market,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “We are going to see a little bit
of a struggle.”  Copper may fall to $3.85 by the end of this month,
Ilczyszyn said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $182, or 2 percent, to $8,920 a metric ton ($4.05 a
pound).  Aluminum, nickel, zinc, lead and tin also fell in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
