The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries may boost oil supply by as much as 1.5
million barrels a day to offset the loss of Libyan production,
 International Oil Daily  said, citing people it didn’t identify.  OPEC will discuss an increase of 500,000 to 1.5 million
barrels a day to add to the estimated 29 million its 12 members
currently produce, the newsletter reported. The group, which
pumps about 40 percent of the world’s crude, is scheduled to
meet June 8 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
