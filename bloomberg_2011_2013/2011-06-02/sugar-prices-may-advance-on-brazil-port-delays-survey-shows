Sugar may rise next week as port
congestion hampers supply from  Brazil , the world’s top producer.  Six of 12 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar prices in New York and
refined sweetener in  London  will likely advance. One forecast
little change, and five respondents said they would decline.  Before today, raw sugar for July delivery gained 2.3
percent this week to 23.52 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.,
while refined-sugar futures climbed 3.9 percent on London’s NYSE
Liffe.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener probably will
widen next week, according to four of 12 respondents. Three said
the spread will narrow, and five forecast little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
