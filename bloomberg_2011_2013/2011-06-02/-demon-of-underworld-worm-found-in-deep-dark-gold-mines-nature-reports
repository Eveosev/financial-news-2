Scientists found four species of
roundworms in South African gold mines in the first discovery of
multi-celled organisms in the deep, dark and hot areas,  Nature 
reported, citing Tullis Onstott, a geo-microbiologist at
 Princeton University  in  New Jersey .  One of the worms, found 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) below
the ground at  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) ’s Beatrix mine, was named
Halicephalobus mephisto in reference to the light-hating “demon
of the underworld,” the London-based journal said. The worms
feed on bacteria that grow on rock walls in biofilms that
resemble “snot layers of gelatinous goo,” it said.  Previously, only single-celled bacteria were thought to
have existed at that depth, where temperatures can rise to as
much as 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit), Nature said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
