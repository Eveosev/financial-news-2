Laidlaw Energy Group Inc. (LLEG) , a New
York-based power-plant developer, agreed to buy a 14-megawatt
biomass facility in California.  Laidlaw plans to invest about $20 million to upgrade the
Susanville plant over the next 12 months, the company said today
in a statement that did not disclose the price.  The seller is  Renegy Holdings Inc. (RGYH) , which is partly owned
by the French renewable energy company Hanalei Renewables. Both
companies will become equity holders in Laidlaw and will be
issued a new class of preferred shares. Laidlaw is negotiating a
20-year to 30-year power-purchase agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
