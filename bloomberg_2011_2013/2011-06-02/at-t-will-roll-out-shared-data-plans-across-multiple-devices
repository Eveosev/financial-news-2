AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless provider, said it will begin offering larger data plans
that can be applied across multiple devices.  The Dallas-based carrier will introduce the plans “soon,”
Ralph de la Vega, AT&T Mobility chief executive officer, said
today at a conference in  Rancho Palos Verdes , California. Such
plans would provide users a bucket of data to use as they wish
on smartphones, tablets or other devices.  De la Vega didn’t provide details about timing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
