Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s discovery of an attempt
to steal passwords from Gmail users, which may have originated
in China, is being reviewed by the U.S. State Department and
 Federal Bureau of Investigation .  The U.S. was notified this week and is looking into the
allegations, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said. The FBI is
working with Google to review the matter, said Jenny Shearer, a
bureau spokeswoman. The attacks likely targeted hundreds of
Gmail users, including U.S. government officials. China’s
foreign ministry said yesterday that any suggestion the
government is behind the attack would be a “fabrication.”  “We are obviously very concerned about Google’s
announcement about a campaign that the company believes
originated in  China ,” Clinton said yesterday at the State
Department. “These allegations are very serious. We take them
very seriously.”  The campaign against Gmail users, announced this week in a
 company blog post , is stirring up concerns about cyber security
and the role of China, home to the world’s largest Internet
market. Google’s challenges in China were highlighted last year,
when the company  said  it was the victim of attacks against its
systems that originated there, and decided it would no longer
censor results on its search engine, forcing it to shutter the
service.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , didn’t say who
was responsible for the latest cyber attacks. The company said
the effort appeared to have been based in Jinan, China.  The FBI is coordinating the U.S. investigation, White House
Press Secretary  Jay Carney  said yesterday. There is no evidence
that official government e-mail accounts were compromised, he
said.  China’s Response  Blaming China for the hacking of Google’s customer accounts
is “unacceptable,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.
The government “disapproves” of hacking activities, and
punishes them, he said.  Any suggestions that the Chinese government is behind the
hackings at Google are “a fabrication” and have “an ulterior
motive,” Hong said.  In January 2010, Google said it was targeted by “highly
sophisticated” attacks from inside China aimed at obtaining
proprietary information, as well as personal data belonging to
human-rights activists who use the Gmail service. The company
later decided to escape local censorship rules by pointing users
to its Hong Kong service. In March this year, the U.S. company
accused the Chinese government of blocking Gmail.  Phishing Scam  The hackers in the recent case probably used a so-called
phishing scam to collect passwords with the goal of monitoring
e-mail content, Eric Grosse, engineering director on the Google
Security Team, said in a blog post this week. The company said
it detected and disrupted the campaign, secured users’ accounts
and notified authorities.  “We believe that being open about these security issues
helps users better protect their information online,” Grosse
said on the  blog .  Google’s internal systems weren’t affected, and the
attempts didn’t involve a security problem with Gmail, Grosse
said.  Phishing scams typically involve tricking users into
sharing passwords that can then be used to obtain information.
While most of these kinds of attacks aren’t very targeted, these
“hijackings” went after senior U.S. government officials,
Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian
countries, military personnel and journalists.  “A lot of this goes on internationally,” said Christopher McNally, a fellow and political economist at the East-West
Center in Honolulu. “In most situations, it’s certain rogue
organizations or even individuals that are doing it for
profit.”  Users should protect themselves by adopting such safeguards
as multistep verifications for their accounts, strong passwords
and checking for suspicious forwarding addresses, Grosse said.  Google rose $2.46 to $528.06 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 11 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
