Sony Corp. (6758)  fully resumed its
PlayStation Network service today in the U.S. and Europe after a
hacker attack six weeks ago led operations to be suspended.  The company has restored the network in all markets except
Japan,  Hong Kong  and South Korea, Tokyo-based Sony said today.
Users of its Qriocity entertainment services will be able to
download music with the resumption, while video on demand will
remain suspended until further notice, the maker of PlayStation
game machines said.  Sony said May 31 that the services would be available
before June 5 except in the three regions. The company, which
estimates that the attack will cost about 14 billion yen ($173
million) this fiscal year, didnâ€™t say today when it expects to
restore the network in Hong Kong, Japan and  South Korea .  The company said it improved security after the intrusion,
which led to the theft of data on more than 100 million
accounts. Sony increased the number of firewalls between servers
and added software to monitor intrusions and system
vulnerabilities before resuming partial services such as online
gaming in the U.S. and Europe, it said May 15.  Sony fell 1.4 percent to 2,149 yen as of 2:18 p.m. in  Tokyo 
trading. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
