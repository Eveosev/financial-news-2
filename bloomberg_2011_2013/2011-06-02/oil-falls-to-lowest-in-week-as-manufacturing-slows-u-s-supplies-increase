Oil traded near its lowest in a week
in  New York  on concern that the global economic recovery is
faltering and fuel demand will decline.  Crude stockpiles climbed the most in more than a month,
according to the American Petroleum Institute. The Energy
Department will release its own data later today. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to keep
production levels steady when it meets next week, according to a
Bloomberg survey. An official at one of OPEC’s Middle East
members said output needs to be raised by as much 1 million
barrels a day.  “Global risk sentiment is dominating trading, with fears
for weakening energy demand overwhelming concerns about long-
term supply tightness,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at
VTB Capital in  London .  Crude for July delivery was at $100.21 a barrel at 1:30
p.m. London time in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , having lost as much as $1.04 to $99.25. The
contract yesterday declined $2.41, or 2.4 percent, to $100.29,
the biggest drop since May 11. Prices are up 38 percent in the
past year.  Brent crude  for July delivery was at $115.08 a barrel, up
55 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday fell $2.20, or 1.9 percent, to $114.53, the
lowest settlement since May 24.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$14.87 a barrel to U.S. futures. The difference between front-
month contracts in London and New York reached a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said U.S.
crude supplies rose 3.5 million barrels last week to 371.6
million. An Energy Department report at 11 a.m. in  Washington  is
forecast to show stockpiles declined 1.6 million barrels,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Gasoline inventories climbed 1.5 million barrels to 212.7
million, the API said. The Energy Department report may show a
900,000 barrel increase for the fuel, the survey shows.  API ‘Looked Negative’  “The American Petroleum Institute crude inventory data
looked negative, with a surprising rise in crude and gasoline
stockpiles,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today. If Energy Department data “confirms today’s
bearish numbers, prices could remain under pressure.”  Oil-supply totals from the API and the Energy Department
have moved in the same direction 72 percent of the time over the
past year. The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary
basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude
production increased for a second straight month in May, led by
gains from  Saudi Arabia  and  Nigeria , according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  Output rose 165,000 barrels, or 0.6 percent, to average
28.895 million barrels a day, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Saudi Arabia bolstered output
by 75,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to 8.925 million barrels a
day, the highest level since October 2008. Nigerian production
rose 75,000 barrels a day to 2.06 million last month.  The group won’t announce any supply increase and will keep
its formal quota unchanged for an eighth consecutive meeting at
its June 8 gathering, 27 of 30 analysts said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
