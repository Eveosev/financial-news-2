Canadian Western Bank (CWB)  and  Laurentian
Bank of Canada (LB)  raised their dividends by 8 percent each after
reporting higher second-quarter net income.  Canadian Western, the country’s eighth-biggest lender,
increased its payout by one cent to 14 cents a share after
posting its 92nd consecutive profitable quarter, the bank said
today in a statement. Profit for the period ended April 30 rose
17 percent to C$44.4 million ($45.4 million), or 53 cents a
share, from C$37.9 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier.  Laurentian Bank , the seventh-biggest lender, raised its
dividend by 3 cents to 42 cents a share, the Montreal-based bank
said in a statement. Profit rose to C$30.1 million, or C$1.13 a
share, from C$28.3 million, or C$1.06, a year earlier.  Canadian Western, based in Edmonton, Alberta, said it
earned 54 cents a share excluding items, beating the 52 cents
average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Laurentian’s results missed the C$1.18 a share average estimate
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, based on net income.  Canadian Western fell 8 cents to C$30.69 at 4 p.m. trading
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Laurentian declined C$2.09, or
4.1 percent, to C$49.56.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the country’s sixth-biggest
lender, and  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the No. 1 lender by assets,
also raised their dividends in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
