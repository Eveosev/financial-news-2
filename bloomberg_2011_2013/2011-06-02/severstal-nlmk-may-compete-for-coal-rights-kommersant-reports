OAO Severstal and OAO NLMK may
compete for rights to a coal field in northern Russia that holds
620 million metric tons of resources, Kommersant  said , citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn’t identify.  Severstal billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Alexei
Mordashov  wrote to Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  asking the
government to sell the rights to mine the Usinsk-1 deposit in
one lot, while NLMK owner  Vladimir Lisin  has lobbied to split it
in two for development with Severstal, Kommersant reported.  NLMK won a license in January for the neighboring Usinsk-3
deposit in the Komi region, where Severstal coal-mining
subsidiary Vorkutaugol operates, the newspaper said.  Natalia Ivanova, a spokeswoman for Severstal, wasn’t
immediately available for comment. NLMK’s press office declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
