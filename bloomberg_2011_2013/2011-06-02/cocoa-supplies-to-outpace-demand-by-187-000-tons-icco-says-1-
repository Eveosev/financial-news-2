Cocoa supplies will exceed demand by
187,000 metric tons in the 2010-11 season that started in
October, up from a previous estimate of 119,000 tons, according
to the  International Cocoa Organization .  The production estimate was increased to 4.025 million tons
from 3.938 million tons, the London-based ICCO said in a
statement today. World output will rise 11 percent from the
previous year, led by an increase in production from Ghana, the
world’s second-largest grower, the organization said in a
separate report e-mailed today.  Grindings were increased to 3.798 million tons from 3.78
million tons, the highest on record, it said. Cocoa processing
activity is expected to increase by almost 9 percent in  Asia  and
Oceania and 3 percent in  Europe , the ICCO said.  Ghana’s crop will be a record 960,000 tons, boosted by
“conducive weather conditions, new farms coming into
production, improved farm husbandry, increased fertilizer
application and boosted farmer incentives,” the ICCO said.  Output in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer, will
rise to 1.3 million tons, up from 1.242 million tons in the
previous season, following the country’s political crisis
earlier this year.  The size of the country’s mid-crop, the smaller of two
annual harvests, may be reduced by security and logistical
concerns, the ICCO said. The mid-crop was expected to be 300,000
tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
