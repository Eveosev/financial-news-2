Rising demand for white, or refined,
sugar in  Muslim countries  is helping lift prices for the raw
variety due to refiners’ demand, according to Castlestone
Management Ltd.  Muslim nations usually stock up on sugar ahead of Ramadan,
the Islamic month of fasting that starts around the beginning of
August.  Brazil  is scheduled to ship as much as 735,570 metric
tons of the raw sweetener between June 1 and July 15 to various
Muslim countries, data from shipping agency Williams Servicos
Maritimos Ltda showed.  “There is a large need for physical sugar to get to the
refineries,” Connor Noonan, an analyst with Castlestone
Management said in an e-mail today. “With more and more demand
for whites from Muslim countries we are seeing a spillover into
the raws.”  Al Khaleej , the world’s largest sugar refinery is
located in Dubai, UAE.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 3.9 percent to 23.35 cents
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  by 10:19 a.m. White, or
refined, sugar for August delivery climbed $22.50, or 3.4
percent, to $687.10 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  The white sugar premium over the raw variety climbed to
$173 a ton, the highest since June 17, according to data on
Bloomberg.  Brazil is scheduled to send about 239,830 tons of raw sugar
to Iran and 137,250 tons to Algeria, data from Williams Brasil
showed. Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the United Arab Emirates are also expected to receive raw
sweetener from the South American country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
