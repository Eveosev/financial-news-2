Mortgage rates  in the U.S. fell for a
seventh week, the longest decline since September, tracking a
drop in Treasury yields as signs of a slowing economy drove
demand for relatively safe investments.  The average rate for a 30-year loan slipped to 4.55 percent
in the week ended today from 4.60 percent, according to Freddie
Mac. That is the lowest since the week ended Dec. 2. The 15-year
rate fell to 3.74 percent from 3.78 percent a week ago, the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said.  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which are benchmarks for
some consumer loans, declined yesterday to the lowest level
since December, after reports showing hiring and manufacturing
growth cooled. Companies in the U.S. added 38,000 workers in
May, fewer than forecast and the smallest jump in since
September, ADP Employer Services said yesterday. Manufacturing
grew at the slowest pace in more than a year, according to the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index.  The housing market is struggling under pressure from 9
percent unemployment, strict lending standards and mounting
foreclosures. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in
20 cities dropped 3.6 percent in March from a year earlier, the
biggest year-over-year decline since November 2009, the group
said May 31. The index measuring contracts to buy
previously owned homes fell 12 percent in April, according to
the National Association of Realtors.  Mortgage applications decreased 4 percent in the week ended
May 27, the first drop in five weeks, according to the  Mortgage
Bankers Association . The Washington-based group’s measure of
refinancing fell 5.7 percent while its purchasing gauge was
unchanged.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it was 4.79 percent, according
to  Freddie Mac . It fell to a record 4.17 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
