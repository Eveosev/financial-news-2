The U.S.  Justice Department  scaled
back plans to create a unified financial management system after
delays and increased costs, according to a government report.  The original project, which was supposed to provide
standardized financial management and procurement, was expected
in 2002 to cost $357.2 million and take eight years to complete,
the department’s inspector general said in a  report  released
today. The department now plans to operate two financial
management systems and expects to spend $851 million, the report
said.  The scope of the plan “was significantly changed, with key
aspects of the project either eliminated or reduced,” according
to the report.  The department in 2001 sought to consolidate six financial
systems into one by adopting new computer software, hardware and
procedures. Financial management and the need for real-time
information has been a top challenge facing the department for
more than a decade, according to the report.  As of November 2010, the department spent $290.2 million
with only two of its components -- the Drug Enforcement
Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives -- fully implemented, according to the report.  The inspector general’s report “understates the value of
what has been accomplished and overstates the impact on the
project vision,” according to a Justice Department response
included with the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
