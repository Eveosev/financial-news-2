Rafineria Nafty Jedlicze SA , a Polish
refinery majority-owned by PKN Orlen SA, will halt a petroleum
solvents unit this month for repairs, a plant official said.  Maintenance will start in a few days and last about three
weeks, Bogdan Pawlicki, the company’s production manager, said
by phone from Jedlicze,  Poland . The plant produces about 50,000
tons of heating oil annually, Pawlicki said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
