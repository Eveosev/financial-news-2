Libya  sent Mosbah Ali Matoug, a
member of the management committee of Tripoli-based National Oil
Corp., to a one-day meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum
in Cairo.  Shokri Ghanem, the state-run company’s former chairman, was
supposed to have attended the meeting until he defected to the
side of Libyan rebels, an Egyptian oil ministry official said
earlier today. The official declined to be identified because of
government policy.  No representative from  Qatar , which has provided financial
and diplomatic support to the rebels, was present at the start
of the meeting.  The forum, an 11-nation group that controls two-thirds of
the world’s proven natural gas reserves, is gathered today in
the Egyptian capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
