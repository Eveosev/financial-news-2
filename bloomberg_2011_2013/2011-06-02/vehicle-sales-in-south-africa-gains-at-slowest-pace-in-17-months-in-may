South African vehicle sales rose at
the slowest pace in 17 months in May as a decline in imports of
car-parts after an earthquake in  Japan  reduced production, an
industry group said.  Sales gained 6.1 percent from the same month a year earlier
to 41,555 vehicles, the National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales growth slowed for three consecutive months.  “Our members told us there were constraints on
availability of components from Japan,” Naamsa Executive
Manager Norman Lamprecht said in a phone interview from Pretoria
today. “We anticipate for everything to get back to normal in
the coming months.”  Carmakers have benefited from an increase in consumer
spending after the  Reserve Bank  cut interest rates in Africa’s
biggest economy to the lowest in 30 years. Vehicle exports
should reach a record 300,000 this year, Lamprecht said.  “The higher sales of new cars over the past 17 months
reflected continued recovery on the consumption side of the
economy, largely driven by the 6 1/2 percent decline in  interest
rates  since end-2008,” Naamsa said in a statement.  Passenger car sales rose 12 percent from a year ago to
28,830 in May, while purchases of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, decreased 7.9 percent to
10,609, it said.  Exports slumped an annual 8.8 percent to 22,063 in May,
Naamsa said.  Toyota Motor Corp., the second-biggest auto seller in South
Africa after Volkswagen AG, wasn’t able to supply factories with
car components after a magnitude-9 earthquake  reduced
production in Japan, Lamprecht said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
