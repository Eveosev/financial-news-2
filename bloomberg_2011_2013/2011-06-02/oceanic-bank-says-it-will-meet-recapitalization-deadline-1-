Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , a
Nigerian lender bailed out two years ago, says it will meet the
central bank’s Sept. 30 deadline for completing its
recapitalization.  The lender has received “several expressions of
interest,” and is “confident that the bank will be
recapitalized by the said date,” Monye Mpho, a spokeswoman for
the lender, said by phone from Lagos today. Oceanic Bank will
choose the bidder that offers the “best value,” she said.  Nigeria’s rescued banks have until the end of September to
conclude recapitalization or merger deals with new investors or
face liquidation, Kingsley Moghalu, a deputy governor of the
 Central Bank of Nigeria , said on May 24.  Oceanic Bank is “currently exploring other
recapitalization options, including a sale to a credible,
strategic investor,” Oyinkan Adewale, Oceanic Bank’s Chief
Financial Officer said on May 9.  The central bank fired eight of the chief executives at
 Nigeria ’s 24 banks after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009
threatened the country’s banking industry with collapse. The
regulator bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira ($4
billion), with Oceanic Bank as one of the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
