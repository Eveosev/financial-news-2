LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,  South Korea ’s biggest
chemicals maker, said it plans to spend 491 billion won ($455
million) to build its first polysilicon plant to move into the
world’s “fast-growing” solar energy market.  The facility in Yeosu will be able to produce 5,000 metric
tons a year of polysilicon, used in solar cells, when
construction is completed by the end of 2013, the Seoul-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  LG Chem’s board approved the construction plan today,
according to the filing.  Chief Executive Officer Kim Bahn Suk told investors in
 Seoul  on April 19 the company was preparing to move into the
polysilicon market with its own technology as it was confident
it could compete with existing players at low cost.  In  Korea , OCI Co., Woongjin Polysilicon Co., Hankook
Silicon Co. and KCC Corp. are operating polysilicon plants.
Hanwha Chem Corp. announced a plan in April to build one.  LG Chem dropped 2.3 percent to 519,000 won in Seoul trading
today, paring its advance to 33 percent this year. Korea’s
benchmark Kospi stock index has risen about 3 percent during the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
