Peruvian presidential candidates
Keiko Fujimori and Ollanta Humala were tied in an Ipsos Apoyo
poll ahead of the June 5 election.  Fujimori, a congresswoman and daughter of jailed former
President  Alberto Fujimori , had 51.1 percent support, while
Humala had 48.9 percent, according to the poll by Lima-based
Ipsos Apoyo that was released to clients today. Fujimori had
50.5 percent support and Humala 49.5 percent in a May 29 poll.  Ipsos Apoyo contacted 3,000 people from May 28 to June 1 in
the national poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus
1.8 percentage points.  Votes cast by Peruvians overseas could boost Fujimori’s
share of the vote by 0.5 percentage point to 1 percentage point,
Ipsos Apoyo said. The survey doesn’t reflect the intentions of
this group, the company said. Humala, an ex-army officer and
leader of Peru’s Nationalist Party, may receive support from
voters in parts of the highlands and jungle that aren’t covered
by the survey, Ipsos Apoyo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
