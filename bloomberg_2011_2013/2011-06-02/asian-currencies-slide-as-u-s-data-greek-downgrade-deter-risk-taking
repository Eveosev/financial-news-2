Asian currencies weakened, led by
 South Korea ’s won, as signs economic growth in the world’s
largest economy is cooling and another credit downgrade for
Greece heightened  risk aversion .  The won, Malaysia’s ringgit and the  Singapore dollar 
snapped five-day winning streaks, while Thailand’s baht and the
Philippine peso retreated from two-week highs. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional stocks tumbled 1.8 percent after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares slumped yesterday by
the most since August. U.S. manufacturing expanded in May at the
slowest pace since September 2009 and employers hired less than
a quarter of the workers that economists had forecast.  “The U.S. economic slowdown raises concern about exports
and growth in  Asia ,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-
ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “Investors’ risk
appetite is deteriorating, leading to a sell-off in Asian
currencies.”  The won fell 0.6 percent to 1,080.85 per dollar as of the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ringgit and the Singapore dollar declined 0.5 percent to
3.0205 and S$1.2369, respectively. Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.3
percent to NT$28.785 and the peso slipped 0.3 percent to 43.26.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
fell last month to 53.5 from 60.4, less than the 57.1 median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Employers added
38,000 workers to payrolls, the least in eight months, according
to data released yesterday.  Greek Downgrade  Moody’s Investors Service cut  Greece ’s credit rating three
steps to Caa1 yesterday, putting it on a par with Cuba.
Investors demanded 2.93 percentage points in extra yields over
Treasuries to own emerging-market debt yesterday, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the highest  risk premium  since
August 2010.  Weaker data and the Greece downgrade “are prompting
investors to avoid buying riskier assets, weakening the won,”
said Cho Young Bok, a currency dealer at Daegu Bank in Seoul.
“Some exporters are trying to take profits after the won fell,
repatriating their income.”  Economic reports this week showed manufacturing growth in
China and Singapore eased in May, and gross domestic product
expanded last quarter at a slower pace in India and the
Philippines.  The yuan fell 0.07 percent to 6.4828 per dollar, after a
three-day rally to a 17-year high. The central bank fixed its
 reference rate  at 6.4886 today, the first time in seven days
that it had been set weaker.  Elsewhere, India’s rupee fell 0.2 percent to 44.9475 per
dollar and the baht weakened 0.1 percent to 30.31. Financial
markets in Indonesia were closed today for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
