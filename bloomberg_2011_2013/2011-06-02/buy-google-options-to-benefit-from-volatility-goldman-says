Buying options on  Google Inc. (GOOG)  will
allow investors to position for potential volatility around the
earnings report from the owner of the world’s most popular
search engine, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Investors should buy Google July $530 calls and the same
number of July $530 puts in a strategy known as a “straddle”
that profits from volatility in the share price, Katherine Fogertey and  John Marshall , equity-derivatives strategists at
Goldman, said in a note today. Three-month implied volatility is
near one-year lows, they wrote. Google shares rose 0.5 percent
to $528.06 at 4 p.m. in  New York .  “Buying options in early reporters tends to fare better
than later reporters, when we tend to see implied volatility
decline across the board,” the strategists wrote.  Shares of the  Mountain View , California-based company have
risen 7 percent in the past year, compared with a gain of 20
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Over the past eight
quarters, Google shares have moved an average of 6.1 percent
around the earnings releases, Goldman said.  The Goldman strategists said the expected July 14 earnings-
report day is an estimate, and that there’s a risk with the
straddle strategy if the profit announcement comes after the
July 15 options expiration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
