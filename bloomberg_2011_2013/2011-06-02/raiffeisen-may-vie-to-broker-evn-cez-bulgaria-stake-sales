Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  and
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are among 10 financial companies that bought
documents in a tender to broker Bulgaria’s 33 percent stake
sales in CEZ SA and  EVN AG (EVN)  units.  Other competitors that will probably submit bids by a May
16 deadline include United Bulgarian Bank, a unit of the
 National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) , Greece’s biggest lender, the Sofia-
based Privatization Agency said in an e-mail today.  The government plans to sell its minority stakes on the
Bulgarian Stock Exchange in all seven power distributors. The
majority stakes were sold in 2005 to Germany’s E.ON AG,  CEZ AS (CEZ) 
and EVN AG in the run-up to joining the European Union. The
units consist of two companies each in charge of sales and grid
operation.  Prague-based CEZ controls the power companies serving the
capital Sofia and the northern city of Pleven, which together
account for 41 percent of  Bulgaria ’s electricity consumers, or
more than 2 million clients. EVN, an Austrian utility, has 1.5
million customers in Plovdiv and Stara Zagora in southern
Bulgaria.  Eight companies, including Raiffeisen Bank International
and United Bulgarian Bank, placed bids to broker the sale of the
33 percent stake in the E.ON-operated electricity distributor in
the city of Varna on the Black Sea coast, the asset-selling
agency said on May 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
