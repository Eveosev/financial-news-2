The zloty declined for a second day
as Moody’s Investors Service cut  Greece ’s credit rating to a
level on par with Cuba.  The zloty depreciated 0.2 percent to 3.9725 per euro as of
10:41 a.m. in Warsaw. The Czech koruna weakened 0.1 percent to
24.546 against the European common currency.  Moody’s yesterday downgraded Greece to Caa1 from B1,
raising the risk of default for the country to 50 percent. The
move came after European officials considered asking investors
to reinvest in new Greek debt when existing bonds mature. A 110
billion-euro ($158 billion) rescue in 2010 failed to prevent an
investor exodus from Greece, and the country now faces a funding
gap of 30 billion euros of bonds next year with its 10-year
borrowing cost above 16 percent.  “Moody’s decision to cut Greece’s rating will continue to
weigh negatively on the sentiment,” Bank BPH SA economists
wrote in an e-mailed note to customers. “We expect the zloty to
stay on weak levels until there is a breakthrough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
