Cosan SA Industria & Comercio rose
the most in a week after it transferring $3.3 billion in debt to
a joint venture with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , more than previously
announced.  Cosan rose 93 Brazilian centavos, or 4 percent, to 24.06
reais at 4:34 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, the most since May 25.
Shell’s Class A shares fell 1.7 percent in  London  to close at
2,122 pence.  Cosan shifted about 5.24 billion reais ($3.3 billion) in
net debt to the Raizen venture, the Barra Bonita, Brazil-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That’s more than the
$2.8 billion in debt it said in August that would transfer to
the new company, which was formally created today.  By transferring the liabilities to Raizen, Cosan’s net debt
dropped 69 percent to 1.63 billion reais, compared with 5.3
billion reais as of Dec. 31, 2010, the latest available figure.  “Cosan is contributing more debt as it is including debt
from the Zanin mill acquisition,” chief financial officer
Marcelo Martins said on a call with analysts today. “Cosan will
become lighter and have an improved  capital structure .”  Cosan bought in February assets from Usina Zanin Acucar &
Alcool Ltda in  Brazil  for 142 million reais in cash and agreed
to take on 236 million reais of debt.  Largest Cane Processor  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil company by market value, and
Cosan combined their their sugar, ethanol and fuel-distribution
assets in Brazil to form Raizen, the world’s largest sugar-cane
processor. Cosan contributed 23 mills, 1,730 gas stations and
other assets, and Shell put up as much as $1.6 billion in cash
and assets, including 2,740 stations.  As part of the agreement, The Hague-based Shell transferred
a 15.7 percent stake in enzyme producer  Codexis Inc. (CDXS)  to Raizen,
which is now its largest shareholder, Codexis said today.  The deal also includes part of Shell’s interest in Iogen
Energy, a 50-50 joint venture with Ottawa-based enzyme producer
Iogen Corp. that is developing cellulosic ethanol technology,
Shell said today.  Brazilian billionaire Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello, who
controls Cosan, will be chairman of Raizen and will have an
annual compensation of about 13 million reais, Cosan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
