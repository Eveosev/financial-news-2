Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  was in the
process of starting a unit at its Scotford upgrader in  Alberta 
yesterday, according to a message left on a community hotline.  Upgraders refine heavy oil, or bitumen, into synthetic
crudes, which are sent to refineries for additional processing
into fuels such as gasoline or diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
