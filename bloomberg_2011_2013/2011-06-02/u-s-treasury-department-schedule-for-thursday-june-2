The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  On Thursday morning, Secretary Geithner will meet with
European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services  Michel
Barnier  at Treasury. Secretary Geithner will discuss the United
States’ intense focus on making certain that all key financial
centers live up to the G-20’s commitments on central clearing
and trading of derivatives.  In addition, he will underscore the U.S.’s continued
commitment to implementing our Basel agreements rigorously and
on the agreed timelines, and our firm expectation that others do
the same.  He will also emphasize that the fundamental objective of
the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) work on compensation is
focused on reducing incentives towards excessive risk taking, an
approach the United States believes to be most effective to
maintaining financial stability, rather than prescribing
particular designs or levels of individual compensation. This
meeting is closed press.  In the afternoon, the Secretary will attend the President’s
meeting with the House Democratic Caucus at the White House.
This meeting is closed press.  Later in the afternoon, Secretary Geithner will meet with
freshman members of the  House of Representatives  on  Capitol Hill 
to discuss the debt limit. This meeting is closed press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
