The  Vancouver  Canucks’ win over the
 Boston Bruins  in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final drew the
highest preliminary television ratings for equivalent National
Hockey League games since 1999.  Last night’s contest, which Vancouver won 1-0 on a Raffi Torres goal with 19 seconds remaining in regulation, was seen on
NBC in an average of 3.2 percent of households in the top 56
U.S. television markets, the  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  network said in a
news release.  The rating was the highest since Game 1 of the 1999 meeting
between the Buffalo Sabres and Dallas Stars, which drew a 3.7,
and a 14 percent increase over the first contest in last year’s
matchup between the Philadelphia Flyers and Chicago Blackhawks.
Last year’s final opened on a Saturday night.  Boston was the top-rated market with an average of 25.5
percent of households, besting the rating that the National
Basketball Association’s Boston Celtics drew last year when they
faced the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals (19.1),
NBC Sports Group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
