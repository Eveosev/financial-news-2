German  government bonds  fell as
optimism that a solution may be reached to stop the spread of
 Europe ’s debt crisis outweighed concern Greece will default
after Moody’s Investors Service lowered its debt rating.  The German bund yield rebounded from the lowest since
January after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said governments should consider setting up a  finance
ministry  for the 17-nation currency region. Spanish debt rose
after the nation auctioned 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of
three- and four-year notes, meeting the maximum target.  “We are moving towards some sort of temporary resolution
on the Greek situation and the Spanish bond auction went fairly
well and that provided some relief in the market,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “With
the 10-year bund yield at 3 percent, it can’t go down that much
more given that the ECB is still likely to hike” rates.  The 10-year bund yield gained one basis point to 3 percent,
after earlier sliding to 2.96 percent, the lowest since Jan. 12.
The 3.25 percent security due July 2021 slipped 0.085, or 85
euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.160. The yield on
German two-year notes rose two basis points to 1.63 percent. It
slumped to 1.56 percent on May 30, the least in 10 weeks.  Greek 10-year bond yields were 10 basis points higher at
16.26 percent. Moody’s yesterday downgraded  Greece ’s rating to
Caa1 from B1, putting it on a par with Cuba, and said the
nation’s default risk was raised to 50 percent.  Greek Aid Measures  The move came as policy makers narrowed in on bond
rollovers as a pillar of any new aid package. Investors may be
given preferred status, higher coupon payments or collateral as
incentives, said two European Union officials familiar with the
situation.  The debt-stricken nation, which faces a funding gap of 30
billion euros of bonds next year, has seen its 10-year yield
surge more than 340 basis points since the start of April.  Spain ’s bonds advanced as it sold 4 billion euros of three-
year and four-year securities, meeting the maximum target the
Treasury had set for the sale.  Investors bid for 2.49 times the amount of 2014 securities
on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.79 at an
auction in April, and 2.90 times the amount of securities due
2015, from 1.63 at a sale in September. The average yield on the
three-year note was 4.037 percent, while the four-year security
attracted an average yield of 4.23 percent.  Irish, Portuguese Debt  “It seems to have gone reasonably well with the
authorities managing to get the upper end of their targeted
level away,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist
at RIA Capital Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Investors are clearly
demanding a higher  risk premium  on Spanish government bonds than
they have done previously but the fact that they are able to
raise the upper end of their targeted level is reassuring.”  Spain’s 10-year yield slid three basis points to 5.29
percent, while the two-year yield declined six basis points to
3.43 percent. Portuguese debt also rose with the 10-year yield
slipping one basis point to 9.72 percent, while the yield on
similar maturity Irish debt gained two basis points to 11
percent.  Bunds earlier advanced amid concern that data today will
show jobs growth in the U.S. is struggling to gain momentum.  Jobless Claims  Initial jobless claims fell to 417,000 from 424 the prior
week, according to the median estimate of 50 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before today’s report. U.S. employment
increased by 38,000 last month, the smallest increase since
September, from a revised 177,000 in April, according to figures
from ADP Employer Services yesterday. The median estimate in the
Bloomberg News survey anticipated a 175,000 advance for May.  “An important driver for bunds has been the bad U.S. data,
which lent support to bunds, so today’s initial U.S. jobless
claims will be important,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London .  German government bonds have handed investors 0.2 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 3.2 percent. Greek bonds have lost 12.5
percent so far this year and Portuguese debt 14.5 percent, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
