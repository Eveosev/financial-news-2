Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest auto exporter, will stop production at an unprofitable
U.S. joint venture with  Ford Motor Co. (F) , Japanese broadcaster NHK
said.  Mazda will transfer production of Mazda6 vehicles to
Yamaguchi prefecture in Japan from the factory in Flat Rock,
Michigan, as early as 2013, NHK said, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The yen’s 13 percent gain against the  U.S. dollar  in the
past year has reduced Mazda’s profit from overseas sales.
Mazda’s U.S. deliveries in May fell 21 percent from a year
earlier. Kiyoshi Ozaki, chief financial officer of the
Hiroshima-based company, said in February the company will
announce plans for U.S. production by the middle of this year.  Jeremy Barnes, a spokesman for the carmaker’s North
American unit, declined to comment on the NHK report.  “The company has been discussing future plans for our U.S.
factory with Ford,” Ken Haruki, a spokeman for Mazda in  Tokyo ,
“but we have nothing to announce at this time. We do not
comment on speculation.”  Todd Nissen, a spokesman for Ford, also declined via e-mail
to comment on the report, calling it “speculation.”  Mazda remained unchanged at 201 yen at the 11 a.m. trading
break in Tokyo, compared with the 0.3 percent drop in the Nikkei
225 Stock Average.  The Michigan plant produced about 54,000 vehicles last year,
Ozaki said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
