KKR & Co., the private-equity firm
managed by  Henry Kravis  and George Roberts, plans to enter Latin
American markets, Kravis said today.  “We will get here in the next few years,” Kravis told a
conference in Santiago, Chile. “We like the demographics of
 Latin America , each country is different. Some countries’ prices
are still frothy. We don’t know how long they will be frothy,
and that is why we are preparing to enter.”  Kravis said he is “fairly sanguine” about the  U.S.
economy , which probably will avoid a second recession and grow
about 2 percent this year. KKR has “a terrific long-term view”
of private equity, Kravis said, adding that an average holding
of seven years means it probably takes a longer view than other
firms.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  agreed to buy KKR-backed Hilcorp
Resources Holdings LP’s assets for $3.5 billion, the Houston-
based producer said yesterday in a statement. The deal values
KKR’s 40 percent stake in the partnership at $1.13 billion, the
New York-based firm said in a separate statement.  KKR is willing to take minority positions in companies,
Kravis said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
