Israel’s 10-year government bond rose
and the shekel strengthened as stocks tumbled worldwide on
concern a cooling of U.S. economic growth will impede the global
recovery, boosting demand for safer assets.  The yield on the benchmark securities dropped to the lowest
in more than three months after reports yesterday showed U.S.
companies added fewer jobs in May than economists forecast and
manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year.
Israeli bond yields closely track those in the U.S., one of its
largest trading partners. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index fell 0.6 percent
to to the lowest level in almost a week. Israel’s TA-25 Index
lost 1.4 percent.  “Yields are following U.S. Treasuries on concern about a
slowdown in the economy,” Shraga Stern, a trader at Union Bank
of Israel Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone. Investors are
“increasing bets the  Federal Reserve  will keep  interest rates 
low for longer and increasing their demand for safety,” he
said.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.05 percent, at 12:43 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest
level since Feb. 28. The shekel strengthened for a sixth day,
gaining 0.5 percent against the dollar to 3.4120.  To contact the reporter on this story:
