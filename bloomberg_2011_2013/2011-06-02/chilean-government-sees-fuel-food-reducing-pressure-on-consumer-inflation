Chile ’s inflation outlook has
improved on easing food and fuel price pressures and higher
lending costs, said Finance Minister Felipe Larrain.  The government’s fuel stabilization measures are working as
pump prices decline this week while planned government budget
cuts are also helping bring down estimates for consumer price
rises, Larrain told reporters today in Santiago.  “Today we see a better scenario for inflation,” he said.
“Inflation expectations are reflecting this and are falling.”  Chile’s central bank raised the benchmark rate at 11 of its
last 12 monthly meetings to 5 percent in May as inflation
expectations accelerated. The annual inflation rate fell to 3.2
percent in April from 3.4 percent in March.  One-year breakeven inflation, which reflects the view of
average price increases, declined to 3.39 percent yesterday from
4.56 percent on March 1. Chile’s peso was little changed at
468.13 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:35 a.m. New York time today.  While Chile’s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in the
three months through April, salaried workers saw a 0.4 percent
decline, according to a government report released May 31. That
means the data is unlikely to place additional pressure on
consumer prices, said Juan Pablo Castro, an economist at  Banco
Santander  in Santiago.  The central bank may slow the rate of increases or pause,
bank President Jose De Gregorio said May 20. The central bank’s
next rate decision is expected June 14.  -- Editors: James Attwood, Richard Jarvie  To contact the reporter on this story:
