Fiserv Inc. (FISV) , the manager of check-
processing and cash machines, will have to defend itself again
in a patent-infringement lawsuit brought by  Advanced Software
Design Corp.  after an appeals court revived the case.  A trial judge erred in her reasoning when she said
Brookfield, Wisconsin-based Fiserv wasn’t infringing an Advanced
Software patent, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal
Circuit in  Washington  said in an  opinion  on its website today.
The case was remanded to the lower court for review.  The patent covers a way to encrypt and decrypt checks to
prevent fraud. Closely held Advanced Software, based in Richmond
Hill, Ontario, filed the lawsuit after licensing negotiations
failed, according to the opinion. The companies offer competing
products that encrypt selected information on a check that can
be matched with visible data.  The three-judge panel of the court also said the trial
judge erred in her interpretation of a key term describing the
invention. It dismissed Fiserv’s appeal of a ruling that
rejected challenges to the validity of the patent, saying that
issue hadn’t been fully resolved by the lower court and so
wasn’t subject to appellate review.  The case is Advanced Software Design Corp. v. Fiserv Inc.,
2009-1585 and 2010-1011, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Advanced
Software Design Corp. v. Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis ,
07cv185, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Missouri  (St.
Louis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
