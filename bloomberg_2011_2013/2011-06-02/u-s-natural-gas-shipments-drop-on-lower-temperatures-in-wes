Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for the first time in five
days as meteorologists forecast cooler weather in the West that
may limit air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 6.2 percent to 19.1
million dekatherms (18.6 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in Arizona
fell 12 percent after gaining 16 percent yesterday.  Cooling demand in San Francisco and  Los Angeles  will be
less than 7 percent of normal until at least June 9, according
to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. Power
plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  “The West should mostly still lean to the cooler side,”
according to MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The
high in Burbank, California, was forecast to reach 77 degrees
Fahrenheit (23 Celsius) today, 3 below normal, before falling to
71 on June 5, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 18 percent to
23.2 million dekatherms after a 5 percent drop yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to the Southern California Gas Co., rose 1.63 cents,
or 0.36 percent, to $4.5559 per million British thermal units on
the Intercontinental Exchange as of 1:19 p.m. New York time.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 1.46 cents, or 0.32 percent, to $4.6385 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
