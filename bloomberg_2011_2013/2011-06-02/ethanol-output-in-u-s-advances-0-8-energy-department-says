Ethanol output in the U.S. advanced
0.8 percent to 909,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department. Output was the highest since March 18.  Stockpiles slipped 2.7 percent to 20.2 million barrels from
a record 20.8 million, the department said in  Washington , enough
to supply the market for 22.9 days.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 1.7 percent to a record 5.1 million barrels a day.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 0.3 cent to $2.645
a gallon at 11:23 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have climbed 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
