Australian retail sales rose in April
by the most in 17 months as the economy recovered from its worst
quarterly contraction in two decades, sending the nation’s
currency higher.  Sales advanced 1.1 percent from a month earlier, when they
declined a revised 0.3 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in
Sydney today. That was the biggest jump since November 2009 and
almost three times more than the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 25 economists for a 0.4 percent increase.  The report boosted the local dollar as the surge in retail
sales supported the central bank’s forecast for the economy to
accelerate after floods caused a 1.2 percent first-quarter
contraction.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens
convenes a meeting June 7 to weigh an increase in the benchmark
interest rate of 4.75 percent, the highest in the developed
world.  “This is a strong report,” said  Adam Carr , a senior
economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “The case for a
hike next week was already overwhelming. Today’s pick-up in the
monthly sales, combined with upward revisions, should leave no
room for doubt.”  The Australian dollar advanced to $1.0623 at 12:39 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0627 before the data were released. Futures
traders bet there is a 12 percent chance Stevens will raise the
overnight cash-rate target to 5 percent when the RBA meets next
week, a 32 percent chance of an increase in July and 50 percent
in August.  Department Stores  Spending at department stores rose 3.6 percent, while
clothing and footwear spending increased 1.2 percent, today’s
report showed. Consumers spent 0.3 percent less in April at
cafes and restaurants, it showed.  Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) , Australia’s biggest retailer, said in
April that third-quarter sales rose 5.1 percent on higher demand
at its supermarkets. Sales gained to A$13.6 billion in the
period from A$12.9 billion a year ago, Sydney-based Woolworths
said in an April 18 statement, helped by higher selling prices
for fruit and vegetables after the floods and cyclones in key
growing areas in Queensland.  In a  statement  after its May 3 policy decision, the RBA
said it left rates unchanged as households continue to show
caution in spending and borrowing, and are saving more.  Higher Savings  Yesterday’s report on gross domestic product showed
Australia’s household savings ratio climbed to 11.5 percent in
the three months through March from 9.7 percent in the previous
quarter, the highest level since 2009.  A separate report today showed  Australia ’s trade surplus
narrowed in April as imported civil aircraft outpaced rising
exports of metal ores and minerals.  The excess of exports over imports was A$1.6 billion ($1.7
billion), from a revised A$1.69 billion surplus in March, the
Bureau of Statistics said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 25 economists was for a surplus of A$2 billion.  Imports rose 1 percent to A$23.7 billion, led by civil
aircraft, the report showed. Exports advanced 1 percent to
A$25.3 billion on a 4 percent gain in metal ores and minerals.  Stevens’ 175 basis points of rate increases from October
2009 to November last year helped spur the currency, which
gained more than 26 percent in the past year and last month
touched the highest level since it was freely floated in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
