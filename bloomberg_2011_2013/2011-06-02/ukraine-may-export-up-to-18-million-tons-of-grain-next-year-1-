Ukraine may ship between 15 million
and 18 million metric tons of cereals in the year starting July
1, up from around 12 million tons in the year-earlier period,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  The former Soviet state, once the world’s biggest barley
exporter, may export up to 8 million tons of grains between July
and January, Prysyazhnyuk said today at a press conference in
the capital Kiev. Grain sales this month may total about 900,000
tons and stockpiles are expected to reach 5.8 million tons as of
July 1, he said.  Ukraine’s government last month lifted grain export quotas,
which were introduced in October because dry weather damaged
crops last summer.  The corn quota was lifted May 5 and since then the country
shipped 800,000 tons of it, Prysyazhnyuk said. Export quotas on
the rest of the grains were removed on May 25.  The weather has been hot and dry in the country and the
next 15 days will be crucial for this year’s harvest,
Prysyazhnyuk said.  The weather has not damaged crops yet, said First Deputy
Agriculture Minister Mykola Bezuhlyi at a separate press
conference in Kiev. He said he sees the wheat harvest rising to
about 20 million tons, compared with 16.8 million tons last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
