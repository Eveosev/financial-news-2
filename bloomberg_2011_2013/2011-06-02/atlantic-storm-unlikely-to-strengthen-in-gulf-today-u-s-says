A storm system off the northeastern
coast of  Florida  is unlikely to strengthen today when it reaches
the  Gulf of Mexico , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  There is a 10 percent chance of the storm becoming a
tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours as “environmental
conditions are not particularly conducive” for strengthening as
of 8 p.m. New York time yesterday, the Miami-based agency said
in a bulletin  posted on its website . The low-pressure system is
expected to move west-southwestward at 25 mph into the Northern
Gulf, according to the agency.  A second disturbance in the west-central Caribbean, east of
 Nicaragua , has a 10 percent chance of strengthening into a
tropical system over the next two days, according to the weather
service. “Conditions are forecast to become more favorable for
development after that time,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
