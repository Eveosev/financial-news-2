Some nations are now “no go” for
 carbon capture  and storage plants as governments grapple with
regulations and environmental groups challenge construction
projects, said an executive from  RWE AG. (RWE)   Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark are among nations that
need to provide more clarity for project developers in order to
win investment, John McElroy, director for policy at RWE Npower,
said today at the Carbon Expo conference in Barcelona.  “Certain member states are no-go areas,” McElroy told
delegates. “It’s disappointing we haven’t got to grips with
that even though we’ve been discussing it for 10 years.”  A project in Italy challenged by organizations including
environmental group WWF makes that market difficult, while
 Germany  needs to sort out its laws governing capture and
transport of carbon dioxide, the executive said.  WWF challenged the Italian project because it was a
conversion to coal from oil, not because the group was against
so-called CCS, said Eric Drosin, a Brussels-based spokesman for
the Zero Emissions Program, a lobby whose members include  Enel
SpA (ENEL)  and BP Plc.  “Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear more rapidly
increases its need and urgency to allow CCS to develop,” Drosin
said today in an interview in Barcelona.  To contact the reporters on this story:
