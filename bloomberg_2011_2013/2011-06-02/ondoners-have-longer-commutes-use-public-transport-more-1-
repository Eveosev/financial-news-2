Londoners have longer commutes and
rely more on public transport to get to work than people
employed elsewhere in the U.K., according to the  Office for
National Statistics .  Four out of five people living outside the capital get to
work in half an hour or less compared with about two in five
employed in the city, the ONS said in an e-mailed statement
today. In London 16 percent of people spend more than an hour
travelling to work, five times as many as those working
elsewhere.  Slightly more than 70 percent of people employed in the
U.K. drive to work, double the percentage of those who work in
London. About 50 percent of those working in London use  public
transport , mainly trains or the subway. Only 9 percent use
public transport outside London.  Londoners who take an hour or more to reach work from home
earn almost twice as much as those whose journey takes less than
15 minutes. Median earnings in  London  for those taking at least
60 minutes to get to work are 18.80 pounds ($30.77) an hour,
compared with 9.60 pounds an hour for workers with short
journeys, the ONS reported.  Outside London people with long commutes earn 72 percent
more than people with short journeys to work, or 14.30 pounds an
hour compared with 8.30 pounds an hour.  Long commutes are also more associated with professional
and managerial jobs than low-skilled ones, the ONS said.  The survey was carried out in the fourth quarter of 2009,
the last time data on travel to work was collected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
