Raffi Torres scored with 19 seconds
remaining in the third period to give the  Vancouver  Canucks a 1-
0 victory against the  Boston Bruins  in the opening game of the
 National Hockey League ’s Stanley Cup Final.  Torres’s shot was the only one of 70 to find the net at
Rogers Arena in Vancouver last night. Before he scored, the
closest anyone came to a goal was when Vancouver’s Alexander Edler struck the crossbar with a 40-foot shot with 5:39 to play.  “I thought we were going to play all night the way it was
going,” Vancouver goalie Roberto Luongo told reporters. “It
was an exciting way to start the series. It was such a close
game. It could’ve gone either way, a flip of the coin.”  Luongo made 36 saves for his third shutout of the
postseason for the Canucks. Tim Thomas stopped 33 shots for the
Bruins.  The best-of-seven series resumes in Vancouver on June 4
before the teams head to  Boston  for two games.  The top-seeded Canucks are the 1-2 favorite at Las Vegas
Sports Consultants to win the title for the first time after
losing in their previous trips to the championship series in
1982 and 1994.  The Bruins have lost five times in the Stanley Cup Final,
most recently in 1990, since they collected the last of their
five NHL titles in 1972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
