Singapore â€™s stockpiles of gasoil
surged to the highest in two months, data from a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed. Residue, or  fuel oil ,
supplies dropped for a second week.  Middle distillate inventories, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose for a second week, gaining 5.8 percent to 12.6
million barrels in the seven days to June 1,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies were at the highest since the week ended March 30 when
they reached 13.4 million barrels.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 7.1 percent
to 20.2 million barrels. Supplies of light distillates such as
naphtha, reformate and gasoline climbed 6.7 percent to 10.4
million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
