Cabot SuperMetals KK, Exotech Inc.
and H.C. Starck GmbH are the first to have tantalum they smelt
certified “conflict-free” by industry groups trying to ensure
sales of minerals used in electronic devices don’t fund war.  The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and Global e-
Sustainability Initiative, backed by companies including Apple
Inc. and  Intel Corp ., will also compile lists of tin, tungsten
and gold smelters, the groups said in a  statement  yesterday.  The voluntary program was set up before the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission introduces rules on trading tantalum,
tin ore, tungsten and gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo
and its neighbors. Eastern Congo has suffered more than 15 years
of armed conflict, fueled by illicit trade in natural resources.  Tin ore sales from Congo’s North Kivu province slumped by
90 percent in April after smelters stopped purchasing minerals
from the region to comply with the EICC/GeSI program.  Congo is working with industry groups, the  United Nations 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to
maintain sales of minerals, while helping to break the link
between the trade and funding for combatants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
