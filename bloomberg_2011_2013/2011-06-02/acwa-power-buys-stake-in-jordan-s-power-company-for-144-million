ACWA Power International bought
 Jordan  Dubai Capital’s stake in Jordan’s largest power company
for $144 million, said Mohammed Abunayyan, chairman of the Saudi
Arabian company that develops electricity and water projects.  ACWA Power now owns 51 percent of Central Electricity
Generating Co., Abunayyan said today in Amman.  “We are investing in Jordan because of the increasing
demand for power there and the huge spending on  fuel oil  by the
government,” Abunayyan said. “It is a very strategic and
feasible decision for us to invest in the kingdom.”  Central Electricity Generating currently has  capacity  of
about 1,700 megawatts from a mix of fuels with annual output of
51 percent to 60 percent of Jordan’s total power, he said.  ACWA Power plans to replace and add new equipment to the
seven generation sites of the Jordanian company in order to
increase production, Chief Executive Officer Paddy Padmanathan
said today in an interview in Amman.  “The idea is to optimize the use of equipment and generate
more power with the same amounts of fuel used currently,” he
said.  Jordan Dubai Capital is an Amman-based  investment company 
With Dubai International Capital LLC and Jordan’s Social
Security Corp. among its shareholders. It was advised on the
transaction by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Allen & Overy
LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
