Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that emerged from bankruptcy, fell for a second day
after it resumed trading in Nairobi following a five-year
suspension.  The shares slumped 8.8 percent to 11.40 shillings at the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, after dropping 14 percent on
May 31.  Kenya ’s market was closed for a public holiday
yesterday.  The company went into receivership in June 2006 with debts
of 2.2 billion shillings ($26 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended on March 4, 2010, after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  “Investors who had been impaired now have an opportunity
to cut some losses,” Victor Odendo, an investment manager at
Nairobi-based CIC Asset Management Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
