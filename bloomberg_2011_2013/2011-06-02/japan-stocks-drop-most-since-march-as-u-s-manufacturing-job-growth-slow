Japan ’s stocks fell the most since
April after U.S.　manufacturing growth slowed and as investors
awaited the results of a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister
Naoto Kan.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., the automakers
hardest hit by the March earthquake disaster, lost at least
2.4 percent after leading a drop in U.S. car sales last month.
 Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of industrial robots, sank
2.6 percent. Kan survived the vote minutes after markets closed
by appeasing dissidents in his own party with an offer to resign
once Japan emerges from its worst crisis since World War II.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 1.7 percent to
9,555.04 at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , the steepest decline
since April 12, after a gauge of U.S. manufacturing fell to its
lowest level in more than year, signaling the global recovery
may be slowing. A separate report showed American companies
hired workers last month at the slowest pace since September.  “The recovery has hit a soft patch,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ　Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84 billion.
“In the aftermath of the quake, a shakeup in government is
definitely not a good thing, but the administration has lost
credibility.”  March 11  The Topix lost 1.6 percent to 825.76. The index has tumbled
11 percent since the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March
11 that left almost 24,000 people dead or missing, disabled a
nuclear power plant and disrupting supply chains at companies
from Toyota to  Canon Inc. (7751)   The Diet’s lower house rejected the no-confidence motion
against Kan 293-152, as opposition lawmakers failed to attract
enough support from ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan. Former DPJ
premier  Yukio Hatoyama  called for party unity in rejecting the
bill after Kan said he would step down once the disaster is
contained.  Speaking in a nationally televised meeting of DPJ lawmakers
ahead of the vote, Kan said he would “like to pass on my
responsibility to a younger generation once we reach a certain
stage in tackling the disaster and I’ve fulfilled my role.”  Carmakers were the biggest drag on the Topix. Toyota lost
3.6 percent to 3,270 yen, while Honda dropped 2.4 percent to
3,045 yen. The two companies led a drop in U.S. car sales last
month as part shortages stemming from the quake crimped supply
of some models. Sales fell 33 percent for Toyota and 23 percent
for Honda.  Fanuc, Kyocera  Maker of electronics also declined. Fanuc sank 2.6 percent
to 12,340 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese electronics maker that
gets more than half of its sales abroad, fell 1.8 percent to
8,350 yen.  The yen gained against its most-traded counterparts as weak
data from the U.S. increased concern the global recovery is
slowing, boosting demand for haven assets.  The currency appreciated to as high as 80.68 against the
dollar last night in Tokyo, compared with 81.30 at the close of
 stock trading  yesterday. Against the euro, the yen strengthened
to 115.77 from 117.39. A stronger home currency cuts the value
of overseas earnings for Japan’s exporters.  Oil-related companies plunged the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after crude prices declined 2.4 percent in New
York yesterday, the biggest drop since May 11.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the
nation’s largest oil explorer, retreated 2.9 percent to 575,000
yen and its closest rival  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) 
slumped 3.1 percent to 3,815 yen.  -- With assistance from Satoshi Kawano in Tokyo. Editors: Jason
