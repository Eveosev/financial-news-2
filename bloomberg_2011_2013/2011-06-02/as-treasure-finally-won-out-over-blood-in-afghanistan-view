A much-discussed May 30  story  in The
Washington Post reported, as if news, that “cost” (meaning
financial cost) is now the limiting factor in the Afghanistan
war. Or at least this is the view of “many of the president’s
civilian advisors,” none of whom allowed themselves to be
quoted by name.  We just can’t afford to keep it up at the current pace of
$113 billion a year.(A total of about $420 billion so far, plus
another $800 billion for Iraq).  Well, we know that wars are costly, in blood and treasure,
and Americans decided that this one is worth it. During the 2008
campaign, candidate  Barack Obama  argued that Afghanistan was the
right war and  Iraq  was the wrong one.  What’s disturbing (if these anonymous staffers can be
believed) is that we -- for the administration in some measure
represents us -- have apparently reached our limit in treasure
before we reached our limit in blood. This is the blood of young
Americans -- more than 1,600 so far -- not to mention thousands
of dead Afghan civilians.  Economists like to talk about “revealed preferences”:
what consumer behavior tells us about how much people value one
thing over another, as opposed to what consumers may say in a
survey. Have some of the people responsible for guiding our
foreign policy now revealed a preference for money over lives?
Freedom and democracy for  Afghanistan  are well and good, but not
if they cost us any more than about half a trillion dollars. If
there is a similar limit on how many lives these goals are
worth, we seemingly haven’t yet hit it.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
