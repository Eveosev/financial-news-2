Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) ’s incoming
Chief Executive Officer for its 3 U.K. unit said he will pay a
“fair price” in the upcoming auction of mobile-phone
frequencies if the government continues to promote competition.  “What we’re looking for is to make sure that the auction
design is fair, does promote competition and doesn’t put 3 in a
position where other people can take advantage,” David Dyson,
who will succeed Kevin Russell as CEO in July, said in an
interview today. “We will pay a fair price. We’re not looking
for any favors here.”  U.K. regulator Ofcom said in March it wanted to maintain at
least four national operators in the market. Hutchison’s 3 unit,
the smallest of the four operators, said previously it may be
forced out if it fails to win enough spectrum.  The auction, scheduled for the first quarter of 2012, will
sell frequencies equivalent to three-quarters of the spectrum
currently being used by operators. Carriers need the bandwidth
to cope with surging data demand as users watch films and surf
the Web on smartphones including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and
handsets using Google Inc.’s Android system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
