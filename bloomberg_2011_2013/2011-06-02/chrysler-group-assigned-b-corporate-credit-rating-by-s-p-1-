Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) , was assigned a B+ rating by
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services as the business risks remain
“high” because of its dependence on light truck sales.  S&P assigned a BB rating to Chrysler’s senior bank loans
and a B to its second-lien notes. The B+ corporate credit
rating, four levels below investment grade, is one level below
that of General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. The rating outlook
is stable, S&P said.  Fiat’s 46 percent ownership of Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
Chrysler is a “ratings positive,” S&P said. Fiat, based in
Turin,  Italy , is negotiating to buy the U.S. Treasury’s
6 percent stake in Chrysler, which would increase its ownership
to about 52 percent.  “The operational benefits to Chrysler from Fiat’s
oversight and management and product integration could become
even more significant over time,” S&P said in the statement.
“We view this strategy as a work in progress, albeit with some
early signs of success.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
