Russian stocks dropped for a second
day week after falling metals prices and oil’s biggest retreat
yesterday in almost a month dragged producers lower.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks slid 0.2 percent to 1,646.64
at 5:20 p.m. in Moscow, paring an earlier loss of as much as 1.4
percent. OAO Rosneft, the nation’s biggest oil producer, slipped
1.1 percent and OAO Gazprom, the gas export monopoly, lost 1.3
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index decreased 0.1 percent
to 1,874.36.  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, traded 0.2 percent
higher at $110.44 barrel in New York, after falling 2.4 percent
yesterday, the biggest single-session drop since May 11. Copper,
nickel and aluminum fell in London for a second day on mounting
concern that the global economic recovery may be faltering as
manufacturing slows from China to the U.S.  A manufacturing index in  China  showed the slowest pace of
expansion in nine months, official data showed yesterday, while
the equivalent measure for the euro area fell to a seven-month
low. The U.S. gauge of factory growth was at its weakest in a
year, Russia’s index signaled “near stagnation,” and reports
from Poland to  Hungary  also showed a loss of manufacturing
momentum.  “Investors are reacting to the worse-than-expected
manufacturing surveys released in China and the U.S.,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Financial Corp., said in an
e-mailed report today.
