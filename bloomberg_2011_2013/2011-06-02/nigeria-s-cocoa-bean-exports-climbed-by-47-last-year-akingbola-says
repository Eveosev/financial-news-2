Exports of cocoa products from
 Nigeria , the fourth-largest producer of the beans, rose 47
percent to $822.8 million in 2010, according to Olakunle
Akingbola, business development manager of Cobalt International
Services, an inspection company.  This represented about 35 percent of $2.32 billion earnings
from non-oil exports last year for Nigeria, Africa’s leading oil
producer, Akingbola said by phone today from Akure in western
Nigeria.  “We expect to raise earnings from cocoa to 40 percent of
non-oil revenue this year,” said Akingbola, whose company
inspects all Nigerian non-oil products at ports before export.  Cocoa is Nigeria’s second-biggest foreign-exchange earner
after crude oil, according to figures published by the Nigerian
government. The  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Indonesia  produce
more cocoa, according to the  International Cocoa Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
