Gold futures fell the most in two
weeks as the euro climbed, eroding demand for the precious metal
as a haven asset. Silver also tumbled.  The euro rose as much as 1.3 percent against the dollar to
a three-week high after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she
is committed to the common currency. Last month, gold fell 1.3
percent after reaching a record $1,557.40 an ounce on May 2.  “With the euro stable, you’re losing the flight-to-quality
bid in gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at
Chicago broker Lind-Waldock.  Gold futures for August delivery fell $10.50, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,532.70 at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop since May 17. The metal still has gained
25 percent in the past year.  The dollar declined as much as 0.6 percent against a basket
of major currencies as bearish reports on the economy spurred
concern that the recovery is waning.  “A decrease in economic growth takes away the argument
from the inflation camp to buy gold,” Klopfenstein said.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and pledged to
buy $600 billion in Treasuries through the end of June to help
revive the economy.  Copper dropped as much as 1.8 percent, and U.S. equities
slumped for the second straight day.  “Traders are out of risk assets,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “Demand for gold
and metals is going to suffer.”  Silver futures for July delivery declined $1.492, or 4
percent, to $36.202 an ounce on the Comex, marking the biggest
slide since May 11. The price has fallen 27 percent from a 31-
year high of $49.845 on April 25.  Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $8.70, or
1.1 percent, to $770.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery declined $6.10, or 0.3
percent, to $1,817.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
