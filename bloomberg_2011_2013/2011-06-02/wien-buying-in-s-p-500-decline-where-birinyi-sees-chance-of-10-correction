The biggest retreat in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index since August is creating a buying opportunity
for investors willing to withstand declines that may reach 10
percent, according to Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien .  The benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks tumbled 2.3 percent to
1,314.55 yesterday after manufacturing expanded at the slowest
pace in more than a year and employers hired fewer workers than
forecast. The decrease was the 126th decline of 2 percent or
more during bull markets since 1962, according to Kevin Pleines,
an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut .
Of those, 30 percent occurred within a month of the start of a
so-called correction, or 10 percent drop, he said.  More than $578 billion has been erased from American equity
markets since the S&P 500 peaked at 1,363.61 on April 29,
pushing the index’s valuation to 13.3 times estimated profit for
2011 from 13.8 times. Wien, who estimates earnings for companies
in the gauge will climb about 12 percent in 2011, says shares
will prove a bargain and the index will rally.  “Investors should be looking for buying opportunities,”
said Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners,
whose parent, New York-based Blackstone Group LP, is the world’s
largest private-equity firm. “The economy is not as bad as it
looks right now. Corporate profits will be good, very good.
People are asking me, ‘Do you still think the market can get to
1,500 by the end of the year?’ I do.”  Called Bottom  The  S&P 500  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,314.82 at 10:16
a.m. in New York today. It would have to fall to 1,227.25 to
complete a 10 percent correction from its April 29 peak. Laszlo Birinyi, the founder and president of Birinyi Associates and an
equity trader for Salomon Brothers Inc. in the 1980s, advised
clients against trying to predict such fluctuations.  “In our experience forecasting 10 percent moves in the
stock market is right up there with predicting the winner of
next year’s  Super Bowl  and the winning score as well,” he wrote
in a May 25 note.  Wien, who called the stock-market bottom in March 2009
before the S&P 500 doubled, is more optimistic than the 13 Wall
Street strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. His year-end
prediction of 1,500 for the S&P 500 is 6 percent higher than the
median forecast of 1,415.  Still Bullish  The 78-year-old strategist said in a telephone interview
that he’s bullish after the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent between
April 29, when it rallied to the highest level since 2008, and
yesterday. Equities slumped as reports showed business activity
cooled more than forecast, sales of existing homes unexpectedly
declined and growth in industrial production stopped.  Stocks also fell amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening and crude oil near $100 a barrel will reduce  consumer
spending . S&P and Moody’s Investors Service cut  Greece ’s credit
rating in the past month, and European officials are negotiating
the country’s second bailout in two years.  Birinyi said last week the S&P 500 “well might” fall into
a correction of 10 percent or more, though it is impossible to
know when or if it may happen.  “It is our contention that our clients are investors, not
traders, and do not have the time, inclination or desire to
respond to every squiggle or turn of the stock market,” he
wrote. “Our view is that the  bull market  is intact and our goal
remains to make you 10 percent to 15 percent for the year.”  Equity Volatility  Yesterday’s decline spurred the biggest one-day increase in
the benchmark measure of U.S. equity volatility since March 16.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index climbed 18
percent to 18.30, the highest level since May 6.  The S&P 500 rallied 30 percent between Aug. 27, when
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled he might begin
a second round of asset purchases to stimulate the economy, and
April 29. Wien said yesterday that he was surprised by the rally
because it coincided with greater investor optimism.  “There was a general positive mood,” he said. “That
doesn’t mean that the market can’t go up, and it did, but it
does mean that you’ve got to keep your eye out for a
correction.”  Wien favors companies most-tied to economic growth,
including energy, industrial and technology companies. Those S&P
500 groups have fallen 6.8 percent, 6.1 percent and 4 percent,
respectively, since the end of April.  ‘Beaten Up’  “Some sectors already got beaten up mercilessly,” Wien
said. “That’s where the opportunities are going to be.”  Investors withdrew $3.16 billion last week from mutual
funds that buy U.S. stocks, the highest amount in more than
seven months, according to data compiled by the Washington-based
 Investment Company Institute .  A net $18.5 billion was added
during the first four months of the year, ICI data show.  “The market does best when investors’ sentiment is
negative and it’s converted to positive,” Wien said. “During
the next few weeks or months, the optimism at the beginning of
the year will be converted to pessimism, the fundamentals of the
economy will improve and that combination will make for a better
fourth quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
