OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia â€™s largest
gold producer, climbed to its highest intraday level since
December as the metal rose to an almost six-month high.  The shares added 1.4 percent to 1,970.90 rubles by 12:47
p.m. in Moscow, their strongest intraday level since Dec. 8.  Immediate-delivery gold increased as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,543.55 an ounce. The metal reached $1,550.20 an ounce
yesterday, the highest level since May 3, as data pointing to a
global economic slowdown spurred demand for the metal as a store
of value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
