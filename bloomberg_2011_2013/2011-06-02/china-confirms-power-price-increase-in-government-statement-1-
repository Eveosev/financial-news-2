China confirmed that it raised
electricity prices for non-residential users in 15 provinces
from yesterday, according to the nation’s top economic planner.  Residential power prices will remain unchanged, the
National Development and Reform Commission said today in a
statement on its  website .  The country increased retail power prices for the first
time in more than a year to curb electricity demand and spur
production as the nation battles with a supply shortage.  China also increased on-grid power tariffs, or prices grids
pay electricity producers, in some provinces on Jan. 1, 2010; 12
provinces on April 10; and the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi and
Anhui yesterday, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
