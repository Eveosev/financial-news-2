Kenya  plans to increase spending by
16 percent to 1.16 trillion shillings ($13.3 billion) in the
fiscal year through June 2012 as investment on roads and power
expands, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  Expenditure on infrastructure in the budget will jump about
35 percent to 221 billion shillings from a year earlier,
Kenyatta told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. The
 budget  will also set out spending to implement a constitution
enacted in August, and prepare for presidential and
parliamentary elections in 2012, he said.  “We intend to spend substantial resources on the key
social sectors of education, water provision, youth empowerment
and  food security  to lessen the burden of rising inflation,”
Kenyatta said.  Budget spending in the East African nation’s fiscal year
through June is  estimated  at 998.3 billion shillings, Planning
Minister Wycliffe Oparanya said on May 17. Growth in East
Africa’s biggest economy is projected to slow this year as dry
weather curbs agricultural production, an industry that accounts
for a quarter of the economy, and Kenyan household spending
eases due to higher inflation.  The World Bank today reduced its growth projection for
Kenya in 2011 to 4.8 percent from 5.3 percent while the
 International Monetary Fund  said on May 24 the economy will
expand between 5 percent and 5.4 percent. Growth was 5.6 percent
in 2010.  Inflation  accelerated to a 25-month high of 13 percent
in May.  Budget Speech  The government will pledge 544 billion shillings for the
recurrent budget, a measure of operating expenditure that
includes salaries, in the 2011-12 fiscal year, down a fifth from
the year earlier, Kenyatta said. It will increase development
expenditure by 30 percent to 398 billion shillings, Kenyatta
said.  Kenyatta will give his annual budget speech in parliament
on June 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
