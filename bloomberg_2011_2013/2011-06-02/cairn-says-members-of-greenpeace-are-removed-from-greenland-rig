Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the Scottish oil
company drilling wells in  Greenland , said that island
authorities removed Greenpeace protesters from the  Leiv
Eiriksson  rig.  The semi-submersible drilling vessel, owned by Ocean Rig
UDW Inc., is exploring for oil and gas off the coast, Cairn said
in an e-mailed statement today. The explorer is also using the
 Ocean Rig Corcovado  in this year’s drilling campaign.  “The Greenland Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum has
established some of the most stringent operating regulations
anywhere globally,” Cairn said. “The authorities in Greenland
took the action to ensure the safety of those involved in and
around the drilling operations.”  The activists climbed the rig last week to protest
exploration west of Greenland’s coast. Cairn’s drilling
operations in the area were also disrupted by  Greenpeace  last
year. The company plans to drill four wells in the region at a
cost of about $600 million.  Cairn later said it has started legal proceedings in the
Netherlands to obtain an injunction against Greenpeace to halt
any further disruption to its drilling operations offshore
Greenland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
