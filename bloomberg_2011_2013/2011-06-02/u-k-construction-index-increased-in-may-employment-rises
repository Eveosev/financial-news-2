U.K. construction growth accelerated
more than economists forecast in May and employment rose for the
first time since June 2010, a survey showed.  A gauge of building activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers increased to 54 from 53.3 in April, Markit
Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said today in an e-mailed report in London. The median
forecast of nine economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reading of 53.5. A measure above 50 indicates expansion. An
index of new business also rose.  Commercial construction and homebuilding expanded in May,
while civil engineering shrank for the first time in five
months. The overall index remained below its average for the
first quarter, Markit said, and civil engineering may continue
to struggle as the government cuts spending in the biggest
fiscal tightening since World War II.  “The millstone of public-spending cuts can be seen clearly
in this month’s purchasing managers’ index,” CIPS Chief
Executive Officer  David Noble  said. “Aside from the
unsurprising decline in civil engineering activity, the overall
figures are not quite so foreboding.”  The survey also recorded a “considerable” increase in
input costs and respondents said that inflation remained at a
“historically elevated” level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
