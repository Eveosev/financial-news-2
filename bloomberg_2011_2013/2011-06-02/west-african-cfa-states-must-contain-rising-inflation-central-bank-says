The eight nations in the West African
monetary union must boost agricultural production, manage public
finances better and improve their business environments in order
to contain inflation, the union’s central bank said.  The Dakar-based central bank expects inflation in the
countries that share the CFA franc to accelerate to 3.9 percent
by the end of June, from 3.7 percent in March, according to a
statement e-mailed yesterday. Inflation will be driven by
increases in global rates for food and fuel, it said.  “In the medium term, the projections for inflation are in
line with the goal of  price stability  in the union,” the
central bank said. Inflation may ease as trade resumes between
the region’s landlocked countries -- Niger,  Burkina Faso , Mali -
- and its principal port nation,  Ivory Coast , which is still
recovering from its post-election conflict, it said.  “The end of the political crisis in Ivory Coast, and the
support of the international community for the reconstruction of
the country significantly improves the macroeconomic forecast
for the region, notably beginning around 2012,” it said.  The West African CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro, is
used in Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory
Coast, Niger, and  Senegal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
