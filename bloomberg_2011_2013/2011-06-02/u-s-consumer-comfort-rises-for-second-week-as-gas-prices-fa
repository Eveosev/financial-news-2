Press Release  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index Was Minus 47.1 in the
Period to May 29  New York --  Consumer confidence  in the U.S. rose for a second
week as gasoline prices receded. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index improved to minus 47.1 in the week ended May 29 from minus
48.4 in the prior period. The 2.3-point gain over the past two
weeks has yet to make up for the 6.8-point month long slide that
propelled the gauge to a nine-month low two weeks ago.  “Falling gasoline prices have provided some much-needed
breathing space for beleaguered consumers,” said  Joseph
Brusuelas , a senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York . Even
so, Americans face “considerable economic headwinds, including a
difficult labor market.”  For full CCI results, see:  http://www.bloomberg.com/cci   Gasoline costs that have dropped by about 20 cents a gallon in
the past month from an almost three-year high may continue to
support sentiment. At the same time, falling  home prices  and
slowing job growth may cause households to limit spending, which
accounts for about 70 percent of the world’s largest economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed today after
sinking 2.3 percent yesterday. The gauge rose 0.1 percent to
1,315.69 at 9:40 a.m. in New York.  Treasury securities  dropped,
since the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to 2.99 percent
from 2.94 percent late yesterday.  The rise in the comfort gauge over the past two weeks has been
within the survey’s margin of error of 3 percentage points.  While the gain “isn’t that statistically significant, the shift
in direction, nonetheless, is a welcome one,”  Gary Langer ,
president of Langer Research Associates LLC in New York, which
compiles the index for Bloomberg, said in a statement.  Each of the three components of the Bloomberg comfort index
gained last week, the figures showed.  The personal-finances gauge rose to minus 13.4 from minus 13.7
the previous week. A 3.1 percentage-point increase in the last
two weeks failed to make up for ground lost over the prior four
weeks. It was the 13th consecutive week in which a minority of
Americans rated their own finances positively.  The buying-climate index increased to minus 53.1 from minus 55.8
the previous week. It’s still close to the minus 57.4 reached
March 13 that was the lowest since October 2009.  A gauge of Americans’ views of the economy was minus 74.6
compared with minus 75.7 the prior week.  “Gas has stopped rising; consumer confidence has stopped
falling,” said Langer. “Life sometimes is that simple.”  The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline nationally
dropped to $3.79 on May 29, down from $3.84 a week earlier,
according to AAA, the nation’s largest auto club. It reached
$3.99 on May 4, the highest since July 2008.  “It’s still a challenging market and consumers remain price-
sensitive, particularly with rising fuel costs,”  Peter Lynch ,
chairman and president of Jacksonville, Florida-based grocery
chain Winn-Dixie Stores Inc., said on a May 17 conference call.
“But consumers are slowly starting to return to more traditional
buying patterns.”  The comfort index was minus 6.3 among people with household
incomes exceeding $100,000 a year, negative for a third week and
below its 2010 and 2011 averages. The 1.4 percent drop in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in May, the biggest monthly decrease
in shares since August, may be starting to concern people at the
higher income brackets, Langer said.  Confidence among women has soured after climbing during April,
the report showed. The gender gap widened to more than 10 points
for the first time in eight weeks, with men at minus 41.5 and
women at minus 52.2.  After adding 768,000 workers to payrolls in the first four
months of the year, hiring may be about to cool as companies try
to compensate for rising commodity costs.  Job gains in May are forecast at 170,000, down from 244,000 in
April, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before tomorrow’s payrolls report. Unemployment is
forecast to fall to 8.9 percent from 9 percent.  Jobless claims decreased less than forecast last week,
indicating the labor market is struggling to pick up.
Applications dropped by 6,000 to 422,000 in the week ended May
28, according to Labor Department figures released today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
predicted a drop to 417,000.  A housing market struggling to stabilize is also weighing on
consumers’ spirits as home values fall.  Property values in 20 U.S. cities dropped in March to the lowest
level since 2003, showing housing remains mired in a slump
almost two years into the economic recovery. The S&P/Case-
Shiller index fell 3.6 percent from March 2010, the biggest
year-over-year decline since November 2009, the group said this
week.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses to
telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers
aged 18 and over. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their
views on the economy, personal finances and buying climate; the
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  Field work for the index is done by SSRS/Social Science Research
Solutions in Media,  Pennsylvania .  Contact for Bloomberg:  Meghan Womack, +1 212-617-8514,  mwomack4@bloomberg.net   #<580028.7293861.2.1.77.31389.2660>#
