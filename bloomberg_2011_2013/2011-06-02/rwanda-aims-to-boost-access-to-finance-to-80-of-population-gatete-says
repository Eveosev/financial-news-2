Rwanda  plans to boost the number of
people with access to finance to 80 percent of the population by
2017 from 21 percent currently, central bank Governor Claver Gatete said.  The government is encouraging commercial banks outside of
the country to begin operations in Rwanda, while working with
local lenders to expand the number of branches and automated
teller machines, Gatete said in an interview in the capital,
Kigali, today.  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest lender by market value,
won a license this year to operate in Rwanda and is preparing to
start lending, the governor said. Equity Bank plans to open five
branches in Rwanda and three in Tanzania, Chief Executive
Officer James Mwangi said on March 30.  “It is the one that goes to the very last person in the
rural areas,” Gatete said. “They are very aggressive.”  Rwanda’s economy, which expanded 7.5 percent in 2010, has
doubled in size since 2001, according to the  World Bank . A 1994
genocide led to the deaths of 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus in a 100-day massacre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
