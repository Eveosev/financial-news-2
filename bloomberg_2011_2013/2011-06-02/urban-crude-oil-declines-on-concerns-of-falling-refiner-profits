Murban crude oil, produced by Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co., fell against its benchmark amid concern
falling refiner profits are damping demand.  Murban for August loading dropped 7 cents to a premium of
16 cents a barrel against its official selling price, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refiners are balking at paying higher premiums for the
grade as an increase in  fuel oil  has limited the amount of
profit they make from upgrading the residue into higher value
products such as diesel. The black-white spread, or the price
difference between fuel oil and diesel, narrowed to $24.27 a
barrel today, a drop of 28 percent since May 2.  Murban yields between 36 percent and 37 percent fuel oil
after basic processing, according to data from Energy
Intelligence Group. That residue has lost value as the black-
white spread narrowed.  Oman crude for immediate loading decreased $1.46, or 1.3
percent, to $108.95 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August fell 1.3 percent to
$108.47. Murban dropped 1.3 percent to $113.32.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July narrowed 3
cents to $6.45 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for
August widened 5 cents to $6.23 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery rose 66 cents to $109.36 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:13 p.m. Singapore
time, with 832 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$108.33 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
