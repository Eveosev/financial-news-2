Gasoline futures fell, giving up
earlier gains, after the U.S. Energy Department reported a
larger-than-expected increase in inventories.  Stockpiles of gasoline rose 2.55 million barrels to 212.3
million, the report showed. The median forecast of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an increase of 900,000
barrels.  Gasoline demand rose 4.5 percent to 9.43 million barrels.
The four-week average rose 1.4 percent to 9.08 million.  Gasoline for July delivery fell 1.36 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.9637 a gallon at 11:03 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $2.9773, was
$2.9822 before the report was released at 11 a.m. in  Washington ,
a day later than usual because of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
