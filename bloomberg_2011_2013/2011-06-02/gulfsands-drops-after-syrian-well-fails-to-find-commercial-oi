Gulfsands Petroleum Plc (GPX)  fell the most
in more than two years after saying it suspended work at an
exploration well in Syria, which failed to find commercial
quantities of oil.  Gulfsands slumped 30.25 pence, or 11 percent, to 234.75
pence in  London . That was the biggest intraday drop since Oct.
15, 2008.  Works were halted at the Abu Ghazal-1 after testing showed
“sub-commercial quantities of heavy oil,” the company said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
