Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ’s controlling
shareholder, Telco SpA, hired Lazard Ltd. as adviser to give a
“fairness opinion” on the stock price,  Il Corriere della Sera 
reported without saying where it got the information.  Lazard, which will complete the analysis by the end of
June, may evaluate the stock at a lower price than the one
booked by Telco, the Italian newspaper said. Telecom Italia’s
shares have a book value of 2.2 euros each in Telco’s balance
sheet, compared with a market value lower than 1 euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
