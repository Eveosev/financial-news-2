At least two people died, with many
more feared dead among about 270 people who went missing after a
fishing boat carrying migrants to  Italy  from Libya broke down
off Tunisia,  Agence Tunis Afrique Presse  said.  About 570 people were rescued, the state-run  news agency 
said. The passengers are migrants from Africa and  Asia  who
planned to enter Italy illegally, the Tunisian agency said.
Seven people were injured, it said.  Many are likely to have drowned after falling into the sea
as they surged toward a rescue boat during bad weather, the
agency said. Some of those rescued were taken to a refugee camp,
it said.  Refugees have fled Libya amid more than three months of
fighting between troops loyal to Muammar Qaddafi and opponents
of his four-decade rule. The conflict has prompted an air
campaign by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against pro-
government forces and left thousands dead. The unrest in  Libya 
erupted after revolts unseated the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia.  At least 16 people were confirmed dead among as many as 600
migrants heading to Italy who went missing when their ship sank
soon after leaving the Libyan capital, Tripoli, last month,
according to the United Nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
