Serbia  approved loan guarantees
totaling 200 million euros ($288 million) for  Fiat SpA (F)  car-
making projects in the Balkan country, the government said in an
e-mail today.  The guarantees refer to loan agreements between Serbia and
the  European Investment Bank  and two projects worth 150 million
euros and 50 million euros for the development of an existing
car factory in Kragujevac, the government said in the statement.  The European Investment Bank said on May 16 that Fiat SpA’s
venture in Serbia will get 500 million euros to finance its
investments in “modernization and expansion of production
capacity of an automotive plant in Kragujevac.”  The financing is expected to increase the production
capacity, contribute to “rising FDI in Serbia, developing the
local automotive industry” and contribute to Serbian exports
and its economic development.  Fiat is the biggest industrial investment in Serbia in more
than two decades, when the former Yugoslav federation broke
apart in conflicts and Belgrade authorities were considered
responsible for a series of wars in the Balkans.  The Fiat project in Serbia was put on hold during 2009 and
2010 due to the global recession and the government of Prime
Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  pins hopes on the Italian carmaker and
its plans to produce at least 200,000 cars in Serbia and export
most of its output for future growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
