Creditors of Freescale Semiconductor
Holdings are growing more confident the target of the largest
semiconductor buyout will avoid default after its initial public
offering gave bondholders a $4.4 billion equity cushion.  Credit-default swaps on the company, which two months ago
priced in a 46 percent chance of default, now imply 35 percent,
after the largest supplier of chips to the U.S. automotive
industry sold $783 million of equity on May 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Freescale’s most active bonds trade
above face value.  Freescale, taken private in 2006 by Blackstone Group LP,
TPG Capital,  Carlyle Group  and Permira Advisers LLP for $17.6
billion, raised 25 percent less in its share offering than the
maximum initially sought. Proceeds will be used to help chip
away at $7.6 billion of outstanding debt at the Austin, Texas-
based company, which now has a market value of $4.4 billion.  “In the IPO, every dollar of that went to the company for
debt reduction,” said Phelps Hoyt, the  Des Moines , Iowa-based
head of high yield research for Principal Global Investors,
which manages $235 billion and owns Freescale’s senior secured
debt. “That was a dollar-for-dollar increase in the equity
cushion, so we view that as favorable.”  Bank Loans  As credit markets eased and investor appetite for high-
yield, high-risk securities improved, Freescale has sought to
repay bank loans and extend maturities. The company trimmed
borrowings by $2.1 billion since 2008 and extended due dates on
$5.1 billion of securities to 2016 and later, according to a May
26 regulatory filing.  Freescale’s bonds yield 489 basis points more than
Treasuries on average, compared with 491 basis points on May 24,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That’s
less than the average B rated bond, which pays a 539 basis-point
spread.  The semiconductor maker sold 43.5 million shares at $18
each in the IPO, according to a company statement, after
lowering the range to $18 to $20 from $22 to $24. It said it
planned to raise about $1.15 billion in an IPO on Feb. 11.  The company’s shares rose 4 cents to $18.24 as of 11:26
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Proceeds will be used with cash to pay back about $888
million of outstanding debt, Freescale said in the May 26
filing. The company will retain about $742 million after fees,
and underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase an additional
6.53 million shares, which would raise as much as $112 million,
according to the filing.  Credit Swaps  The proceeds will also be used to terminate so-called
management agreements with the company’s sponsors and affiliates
for $68 million, with $33.6 million going to Blackstone
Management Partners V LLC, according to the filing. Those cost
about $39 million overall in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  Swaps on the company protecting against a default for five
years soared as high as 6,379.8 basis points on March 3, 2009,
according to data provider CMA, a unit of CME Group Inc. That
implied a 99.6 percent chance of default, based on the
expectation investors would recover 40 percent of face value of
the bonds if it failed to meet its obligations, CMA data show.  Freescale swaps ended yesterday at 522 basis points before
rising to 524.9 basis points as of 11:22 a.m. today,  New York- 
based CMA said.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Robert Hatley, a spokesman for company, declined to
comment.  ‘Positive Event’  Standard & Poor’s raised Freescale’s  credit rating  to B
from B- on May 31, projecting a decline in the ratio of debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to “the low” six times at year-end from 6.8 times in March,
according to a note that day.  “I don’t think downsizing from $1 billion to $750 million
materially changes the credit profile,” said Steven Ruh, a vice
president and analyst in leveraged finance at Neuberger Berman
Holdings LLC in  Chicago , which oversees more than $12 billion of
 junk bonds  including Freescale debt. “You’re going from
decreasing leverage by a full turn to decreasing leverage by
three-quarters of a turn, so from a bondholder perspective, this
is still a positive event for us.”  Bonds from Freescale tumbled to below 20 cents on the
dollar in the two years following the leveraged buyout as the
global economy slowed and credit markets froze, causing
investors to flee riskier assets.  Bond Prices  “When bonds trade at that level, it’s fair to assume that
some participants in the market thought Freescale would, at some
point, need to restructure,” Ruh said. “Things began to turn
around for Freescale in late 2009, similar to the global
economy.”  Freescale’s $764.3 million of 10.125 percent bonds due in
December 2016 rose to 107.9 cents on the dollar to yield 4.42
percent yesterday from 107.4 cents on May 24, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The securities traded as low as 13.3 cents
in March 2009.  The company’s $254.8 million of 9.125 percent pay-in-kind
toggle notes due December 2014 rose to 105 cents on the dollar
yesterday from 104.3 cents on May 18, Trace data show. Those
tumbled to 6.5 cents in February 2009.  Moody’s Investors Service grades the company B3, one step
lower than S&P, and Fitch Ratings assigns Freescale a CCC,
Bloomberg data show.  ‘Out of the Woods’  “The market is trading these things as if they’re already
a notch or two from where the agencies have them,” Hoyt said.
“A single B rating is in my opinion mostly out of the woods.
There’s only a relatively small probability Freescale runs into
a problem, but single B credits do have exposure to unforeseen
economic events.”  Freescale posted a net loss of $1.05 billion last year,
following a gain of $748 million in 2009, Bloomberg data show.  “The company will be very challenged to generate
sufficient  cash flow  to meet upcoming debt maturities over the
longer term, and in order for them to do so, they would need to
meaningfully outgrow the market and meaningfully improve free
cash flow margins,” said Jason Pompeii, a senior director with
Fitch in Chicago. “To us, it remains a revenue growth
situation.”  The company needs annual sales of about $4 billion to
break even, Chief Executive Officer Richard Beyer said in a
telephone interview on May 26.  Managing Debt  Even if its revenue falls below the current level of about
$4.8 billion, Freescale will still be able to manage debt and
invest in its business, he said. Sales last year were $4.46
billion, Bloomberg data show.  Freescale’s bonds were raised to “overweight” from
“market weight,” by CreditSights Inc. The New York-based
research firm cited improved leverage from the IPO and
“continued EBITDA improvements,” in a May 27 note.  “It has been established” that there’s more than $4
billion of equity value underneath the bonds, Neuberger Berman’s
Ruh said. “It gives you more confidence in the value of the
business as a bondholder.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
