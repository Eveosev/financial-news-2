Colombia ’s peso advanced to the
strongest level in almost a month as European leaders expressed
support for the euro and as demand for the nation’s assets rose
after Moody’s Investors Service raised the country’s rating to
investment grade.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 1,784.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:49 p.m.  New York  time, from 1,790.75 yesterday. It earlier
touched 1,780.60, the strongest level since May 9. The currency
has gained 6.9 percent this year against the dollar, the best
performer among the major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Moody’s increased Colombia’s rating on May 31 to Baa3, the
lowest level for investment grade, from Ba1, placing the nation
on the same level as  Brazil , Peru and Panama.  Standard & Poor’s 
increased the nation’s rating to BBB- on March 16.  “The boost to investment grade is playing an important
role,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Correval SA. “The comments by Trichet for one
ministry and Merkel’s support for the euro also explain the
move.”  The dollar lost ground against 13 of the world’s 16 major
currencies. The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.4483 in New York.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said today
that he favored a ministry of finance for euro nations and
giving the European Union veto power on budget measures of
countries that go “harmfully astray.” German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today that “we don’t have a euro problem.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.05 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.194 centavo to 115.384 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
