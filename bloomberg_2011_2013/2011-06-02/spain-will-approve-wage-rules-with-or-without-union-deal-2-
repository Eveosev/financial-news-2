Spain  will approve an overhaul of
wage-bargaining rules next week with or without an accord
between unions and employers, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said.  “I fervently want them to reach an agreement but if that
is not the case the government will approve the wage-bargaining
reform next Friday the 10th,” Zapatero said in an interview
with state broadcaster RNE today in Madrid.  Three months of talks between the Spanish Confederation of
Business Organizations and the country’s biggest unions, UGT and
Comisiones Obreras, broke down today, Juan Rosell, chairman of
Spain’s CEOE business lobby, told a televised news conference
today in Madrid.  Rules on hiring and firing are too complicated and rigid in
Spain, Rosell said, adding that unions blocked an accord.
“Everyone agreed about the need to be flexible but when it came
to putting it in black and white, we couldn’t come to an
agreement,” he said.  Spain’s Socialist government is overhauling labor rules to
make it easier for Spanish companies to compete abroad. In
January, Zapatero set a March 18 deadline for unions and
employers to reach a deal. That deadline has been repeatedly
extended as the two sides clashed over business demands for the
link between pay and inflation to be severed.  Spanish labor costs have risen an average 4.2 percent a
year since the start of the euro currency and wages continued to
increase even as the country slid into the deepest recession in
six decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
