NorthWestern Corp. (NWE) , a South Dakota
utility owner, is seeking approval from the  Montana  Public
Service Commission to buy and operate a planned 40-megawatt wind
farm.  The $86.1 million project in central Montana would be
developed by Denver-based Compass Wind LLC, Sioux Falls-based
NorthWestern said today in an statement. Construction may begin
after NorthWestern receives approval, and the project is
expected to go into operation by the end of 2012 with a
levelized electricity price of $53.8 a megawatt-hour over a 25-
year period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
