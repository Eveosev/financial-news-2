Oil output in  Russia , the world’s
largest oil producer, climbed 1.2 percent in May from a year
earlier, to the highest since October’s post-Soviet record.  Production rose to 10.26 million barrels a day, according
to preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.
That compares with 10.23 million barrels a day in April.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has tasked the oil industry,
Russia’s largest source of  tax revenue , to keep output at more
than 10 million barrels a day for at least the next decade.
Production has exceeded the level since September 2009 and
reached 10.27 million barrels a day in October last year. Russia
peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in 1987, according to BP
Plc data.  Gains by state-run OAO Gazprom, OAO Rosneft, the country’s
largest producer, and OAO Bashneft, controlled by billionaire
 Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s AFK Sistema, helped raise output
compared with the same month last year.  Russian natural gas output fell to 1.86 billion cubic
meters a day in May from 1.91 billion cubic meters a day the
previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
