The Namibian Competition Commission
said it appealed against a ruling that declared conditions it
imposed on the takeover by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  of  Massmart
Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  as invalid.  The appeal was lodged yesterday in the Supreme Court, the
Windhoek-based regulator said in a faxed statement today. Wal-
Mart this week won the approval of South Africa’s Competition
Tribunal to buy a controlling stake in Johannesburg-based
Massmart with conditions. It needs the same approval in Namibia
for the transaction to come into effect in the southern African
country.  Namibia’s Competition Commission recommended the
transaction be approved in that country on condition it
guarantee jobs won’t be cut and that it offers shares to black
citizens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
