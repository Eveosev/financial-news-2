ConocoPhillips (COP)  is operating a crude
unit at the Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, at reduced
rates after the equipment was struck by a fire yesterday,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  Operations resumed after the unit was shut following the
fire yesterday, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  Rich Johnson , a ConocoPhillips spokesman, said he didn’t
have any fresh information on the unit. Earlier today he said
the equipment was still shut for assessment and repair and that
the rest of the refinery was operating at reduced rates.  Crude units, also known as pipestills, separate oil into
components according to their boiling points. The plant has a
capacity of 250,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
