News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Broadcasting became
the first U.S. television network to complete advance sales of
prime-time advertising for the season that starts in September.  The network, which has led U.S. television ratings for
seven years in the 18-49 age group sought by advertisers,
received commitments for almost $2 billion in sales, said a
person with knowledge of the situation.  Prices rose 10 percent to 11 percent and Fox sold about 80
percent of its inventory, said the person, who wasn’t authorized
to speak publicly. Networks typically hold a portion of their
available advertising time to sell closer to air time.  Fox attributed the result to the strength of its schedule,
which is anchored by television’s top-rated show, “ American
Idol ,” and the new series “The X Factor,” which will make its
U.S. debut in September. The company sold about $1.9 billion
worth of ads ahead of last season, a person familiar with the
process said then.  Fox generated “growth in both volume and pricing,
consistent with our position as the No. 1 network,” the company
said today in an e-mailed statement.  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , fell 7 cents to $17.58 today in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. Class A shares of the New York-based
company have added 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
