Group Lotus Plc, the British sports-
car maker, is cutting almost 100 workers at its Norfolk, eastern
 England , headquarters, where it has about 1,200 staff, Sky News
reported, citing the company.  In April, the company failed to win a 27.5 million-pound
($45 million) loan from the U.K.â€™s Regional Growth Fund it
planned to use to fund an expansion to its Hethel, Norfolk,
manufacturing plant, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
