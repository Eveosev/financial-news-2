Iron ore inventories  in  China , the
biggest user of the steelmaking ingredient, dropped to the
lowest levels in two years as higher demand pushed up prices.  Stockpiles held at China’s major ports dropped 3.3 percent
to 71.32 million metric tons as of Dec. 21, the lowest since
Sept. 10, 2010, according to weekly data from researcher Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. The inventories, owned
mostly by mills and traders, have dropped for eight straight
weeks. Weekly inventories dropped to 73.81 million tons as of
Dec. 21, researcher Mysteel.com said on its website.  Iron ore prices  traded near a five-month high as China’s
factory output and retail sales have accelerated for the last
three months, signaling an economic recovery is accelerating.
 Ore imports  reached 65.78 million tons in November, the second-
highest level after a record 68.97 million tons in January 2011,
according to customs data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was unchanged at $135.40 a dry ton yesterday,
after reaching $135.50 on Dec. 19, the most expensive since July
10, according to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. Prices
have climbed 56 percent since Sept. 5.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
