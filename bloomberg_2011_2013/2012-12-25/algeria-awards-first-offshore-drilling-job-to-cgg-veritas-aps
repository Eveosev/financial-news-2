France ’s CGG-Veritas will carry out
the first offshore drilling for oil in  Algeria , the state-run
APS news agency reported, citing the chief executive officer of
the state-run Sonatrach.  “The first offshore drilling contract was awarded Sunday
to the French CGC Veritas,” Abdelhamid Zerguine was cited as
saying by APS today, adding that the French group would also
carry out seismic studies.  Sonatrach had said in November it would undertake the
offshore project alone if it could not find a suitable and
experienced partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
