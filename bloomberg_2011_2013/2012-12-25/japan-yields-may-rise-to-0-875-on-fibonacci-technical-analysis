Yields on  Japan ’s 10-year government
bonds may rise to 0.875 percent by the end of March, the highest
since June, according to  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. , which
cited trading patterns.  The benchmark rate reached a 2012 high of 1.06 percent on
March 15, and declined to 0.685 percent on Dec. 6, the lowest
level this year. Yesterday’s close was 0.765 percent, according
to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest inter-dealer
debt broker. On Fibonacci charts, 0.872 percent is the 50
percent retracement of the decline from the March high to the
low in December.  Yields rose to 0.88 percent on June 8, and hit 0.86 percent
on Aug. 16 and 17.  “The rates will test these levels again in the first
quarter, and may rise as high as 1.25 percent in the latter half
of the next year,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at the
unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
largest bank by market value.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentage levels include 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8 and 76.4.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
