Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
rose, pushing the yield to a record low, and the shekel weakened
after the central bank unexpectedly cut its base lending rate to
counter slowing economic growth.  The yield on the 5.5 percent government notes due January
2022 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.65 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the lowest
since the notes started trading in April 2011. The shekel
depreciated 0.1 percent to 3.7471 a dollar, trimming the monthly
gain to 1.8 percent.  Governor  Stanley Fischer  said today the central bank
lowered the lending rate by a quarter-point to 1.75 percent, the
lowest in more than two years, to encourage demand. The bank
lowered its 2013 economic growth outlook to 2.8 percent from 3
percent, excluding gas output. Only nine of the 23 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg had forecast a rate reduction.  “The Bank of Israel continues with its expansionary
monetary policy as it sees the weakness of the local economy, in
tandem with muted inflationary pressures,” Modi Shafrir, chief
economist at Tel Aviv-based I.L.S. Brokers, said by phone. “For
now, we believe the central bank will hold its rate unchanged in
the coming rate decision, although we still see a chance for
another rate cut in the first quarter of 2013.”  Gradual Reduction  The  Bank of Israel  has gradually reduced the borrowing rate
from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shield the economy
from the  European debt crisis . Economic growth may slow to 3.3
percent this year from 4.6 percent in 2011, according to the
central bank. Inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in November, the
lowest since July and within the government’s 1 percent to 3
percent target range.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, have fallen 10 basis
points this month to 1.72 percent. The country’s three-month
central bank bills rose, sending the yield on the Makam notes
down 13 basis points today to 1.83 percent. All of the nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg today expect borrowing costs to
remain unchanged at the next central bank meeting on Jan. 28.  The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds advanced for a
third day, increasing 0.2 percent to 280.42. The two-year break-
even rate, the yield difference between the inflation-linked
bonds and fixed-rate government debt of similar maturity, fell
for the first time since Dec. 18, declining one basis point to
221. That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.21
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
