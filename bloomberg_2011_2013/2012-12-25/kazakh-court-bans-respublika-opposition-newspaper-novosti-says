A Kazakh court banned publication of
a newspaper and websites controlled by the opposition Respublika
group, Novosti-Kazakhstan reported today.  The defendants can appeal the ruling of the Medeu district
court in Almaty in 15 days, the news service  said . The newspaper
has been produced in Moscow after Kazakh printing shops refused
to, the news service said.  Kazakh courts had banned the  Alga  party and closed Vzglyad
newspaper,  K+  television channel and  Stan.tv  portal after a
request from prosecutors in November, according to Novosti-
Kazakhstan.  -- Editor: Torrey Clark  To contact the reporter on this story:
