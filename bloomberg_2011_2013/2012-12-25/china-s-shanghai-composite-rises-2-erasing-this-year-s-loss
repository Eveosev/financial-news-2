China ’s stocks rallied, with the
Shanghai Composite Index poised to erase this year’s losses, on
speculation an improving economic outlook will boost earnings.  The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 2 percent to 2,203.19
at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break, adding to a 0.2 percent gain
for this year. The index has risen 12 percent since reaching
this year’s closing low of 1,959.77 on Dec. 3 as the nation’s
new leaders said they would promote urban development as part of
economic reforms.  “There are growing expectations that new leaders will take
measures to reform the economy and the financial system will
find China new growth drivers,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based
chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co.,
which manages $120 million. “That’s why you see all these big-
caps rallying today. The ongoing economic recovery is spurring
the rebound as well.”  The CSI 300 Index climbed 2.5 percent to 2.439.68 today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
