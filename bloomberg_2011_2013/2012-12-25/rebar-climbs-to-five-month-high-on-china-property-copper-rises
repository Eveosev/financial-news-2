Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced to the highest level in more than five months
on speculation that construction in  China  will pick up as the
real-estate market recovers. Copper climbed to a one-week high.  Rebar for delivery in May gained 2.2 percent to 3,873 yuan
($621) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest close for the most-active contract since July 16,
trimming this year’s decline to 8 percent.  China’s property development investment will probably grow
17.1 percent next year as average property prices may increase
7.8 percent, Soufun Holdings Ltd., the country’s biggest real
estate website owner, said Dec. 21. New home prices climbed in
53 of the 70 cities in November, compared with 35 in October,
data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Dec. 18.  “Given rising home prices in the last couple of months,
the market consensus is that the  property market  can only be
better next year,” Wang Yangqi, an analyst at Nanhua Futures
Co., said by phone from Hangzhou. “Steel traders have been
stockpiling on expectation that demand will turn better.”  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,609
yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $135.40 a dry
ton yesterday, data compiled by The Steel  Index (SHPROP)  Ltd showed.  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index closed 4.1
percent higher to 3,542.71, the highest since July 2011, driving
the Shanghai Composite Index to close 2.5 percent higher at
2,213.61, erasing a yearly loss.  Copper for April delivery, the most-active contract, closed
0.5 percent higher at 57,120  yuan  a ton. The London Metal
Exchange and Comex are closed today for Christmas.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
