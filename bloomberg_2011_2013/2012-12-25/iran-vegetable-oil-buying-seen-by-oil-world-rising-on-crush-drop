Iran ’s vegetable-oil imports are
forecast to jump in the fourth quarter of 2012 as lower
purchases of soybeans curb domestic crush, reducing local oil
and meal production, industry researcher Oil World said.  Soybean oil imports are forecast to climb to 160,000 to
170,000 metric tons in the three months through December from
42,000 tons in the year-earlier period, the Hamburg-based
researcher wrote in an e-mailed report.  Argentina  is the main
supplier for the three months this year, it said.  Iran’s imports of vegetable oils and soybean meal picked up
since June as the effects of a financial embargo on the
country’s trade subsided, Oil World reported in July. Combined
imports of soybean oil and sunflower seed oil are expected to be
the highest in five years, the researcher said.  “Iran is sharply stepping up imports of vegetable oils in
the last quarter,” Oil World wrote. “Larger vegetable oil
import requirements were partly due to a sharp decline of
Iranian soybean imports, which are virtually cut in half.”  Fourth-quarter sunflower seed oil imports are forecast to
be 50,000 to 60,000 tons, compared with 42,000 tons a year ago,
with Ukraine the main supplier, it said.  For all of 2012, soybean oil purchases are expected to
climb to 529,000 tons from 429,000 tons last year, while imports
of sunflower seed oil may more than double to 314,000 tons from
142,000 tons, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
