National Industrialization Co. (NIC) 
advanced the most since April after the Saudi Arabian holding
company known as Tasnee recommended a full-year dividend that
exceeded expectations.  Shares of Tasnee jumped 6.1 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since April 17, to 28 riyals at 12:56 p.m. in  Riyadh . About
5.3  million shares  were traded so far today, more than five
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Tasnee helped push the Tadawul All Share Index up
less than 0.1 percent and was the  second-most traded  stock by
volume. The company recommended a  full-year dividend  of 2 riyals
a share and appointed Saleh al-Nuzha as  managing director  after
Moayyed al-Qurtas’ resigned.  Tasnee “announced a dividend which was a positive surprise
for investors, who were expecting 1.3 to 1.5 riyals only,” said
Samer Darwiche, Dubai-based analyst at Gulfmena Investments Ltd.
The company’s results so far in 2012 have been weak, “which
explains the under-performance of the stock.”  Tasnee said last year it would give a dividend of 1.5
riyals a share for 2011. The company has a 12-month dividend
yield of 4.5 percent, compared with a dividend yield of 3.6
times for the  Tadawul All Share Index. (SASEIDX)   The company posted declines in profit for each  quarter this
year , with a drop of 42 percent to 417.3 million riyals ($111
million) for the three months ended Sept. 30. The company’s
shares have decreased 18 percent in 2012, compared with a gain
of 7.2 percent for the Tadawul.  Nine analysts  recommend investors buy the shares of Tasnee
while three have a hold rating on the stock, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
