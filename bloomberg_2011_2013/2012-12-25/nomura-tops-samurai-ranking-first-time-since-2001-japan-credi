Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  leapt to the
top spot for underwriting Samurai bonds this year, the first
time since 2001, as  Japan ’s biggest brokerage brought the most
new issuers to market.  The bank managed 385.1 billion yen ($4.5 billion) of yen
note sales by overseas borrowers, or 19.3 percent of the market,
followed by  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  with 19.1 percent and
 Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ’s 14.6 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Nomura, which arranged five debut deals
this year, was fourth in 2011, after Daiwa, Mizuho and
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., the data show.  Japanese investors are seeking premiums offered by overseas
issuers as the average yield on benchmark government debt in
2012 slid to the lowest since at least 1986. Sales of yen-
denominated bonds by foreigners climbed to the highest since
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average yield
paid by Samurai issuers this year was 1.35 percent, almost twice
the rate offered by Japanese companies and less than half of
what corporates pay worldwide, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show.  “The overseas borrowers are in a position to offer more
attractive spreads compared with similarly-rated domestic debt,
creating a good match between investor and issuer needs,”
Shohei Takahashi, joint-head of international debt capital
markets at Nomura, said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
questions. “This environment will probably continue next
year.”  Samurai Newcomers  Nomura helped arrange debut bond sales of Nordea Bank AB,
the third-biggest issuer of Samurai this year, as well as DNB
Bank ASA, Societe Generale SA, BPCE SA and  Qatar Petroleum ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Offerings of Samurai bonds this year, combined with yen
notes listed on the  Tokyo  Pro- Bond Market  that started in April,
totaled 2.22 trillion yen, versus 2.14 trillion yen in 2011 and
2.06 trillion yen in the previous year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since 2008 when
companies including Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
and Citigroup Inc. sold a total 2.31 trillion yen of Samurai
bonds, the data show.  Japanese companies raised 8.2 trillion yen in bond
offerings this year, 1 percent less than in the same period in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corporate Pipeline  JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the fourth-largest Samurai
underwriter, managing 13.9 percent of deals, the data showed.
That’s the highest ranking for the  U.S. bank  since 2007 and
compares with the seventh position last year, the data show.  “The fact that we are such a big bank globally helps us
with overseas relationships,” Chris Abbott, vice president at
the lender’s cross-border yen syndication, said in a telephone
interview Dec. 19. “We hope to prove to the world that we are a
powerhouse not just in the global bond market, but in yen as
well.”  Elsewhere in the domestic credit markets, Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust Bank Ltd. hired Daiwa, Nomura and SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. for a sale of five-year bonds next month, Daiwa said in a
statement yesterday. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. announced
plans to price 10-year subordinated bonds for individual
investors on Jan. 11 in a filing with Japan’s  Finance Ministry .  The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 1/2 basis point to
0.77 percent as of 9:16 a.m. in Tokyo. The yen traded at 85.14
against the dollar, weakening past 85 for the first time since
April 2011.  Corporate bonds in Japan have returned 1.4 percent this
year, compared with the 2 percent gain for the nation’s
sovereign debt and 4.8 percent for Samurais, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Company notes worldwide have
returned 10.5 percent.  “Next year should bring an increase in issuance as many
overseas borrowers see untapped capital potential in Japan,”
said Takao Okubo, head of global capital markets promotion
department at Mizuho Securities Co. “The appeal of Japanese
investors is in their stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
