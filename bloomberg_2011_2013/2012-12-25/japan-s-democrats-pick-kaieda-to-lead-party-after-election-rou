The  Democratic Party  of Japan picked
former trade and industry minister  Banri Kaieda  as its leader
following a Dec. 16 election rout that saw the group lose three
quarters of its seats in the lower house.  Kaieda, 63, defeated former transport minister  Sumio
Mabuchi  today to take the post vacated by Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda . Kaieda helped oversee Japan’s response to last
year’s nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant.  Kaieda faces the task of trying to revive support for the
DPJ before July elections in the upper house, where the party
holds 87 of 242 seats. The DPJ’s lawmakers in the more powerful
lower house, which choses the prime minister, fell to 57 from
230 after the Dec. 16 national vote.  The DPJ swept to power for the first time just over three
years ago with vows to wrest control of the country from
bureaucrats, cut waste and devote more resources to social
welfare. Instead, its approval rating slumped as it struggled to
revive the economy after last year’s earthquake and atomic
disaster and backed down on a pledge to move a U.S. military
base off the southern island prefecture of Okinawa.  Incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said this month’s
landslide victory reflected deep dissatisfaction with the
Democrats, rather than faith in his own  Liberal Democratic
Party .  To contact the reporters on this story:
