South Africa’s former leader  Nelson Mandela  is “doing much better” as he spends an 18th day in a
Pretoria hospital, President  Jacob Zuma  said.  Doctors treating Mandela, 94, for a recurring lung
infection and gallstones are “happy with the progress he is
making,” Zuma said in an e-mailed statement. Mandela was in
“good spirits,” said Zuma, who visited the ex-president today.  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the African National Congress won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. He spent 27 years in prison before that
for his opposition to white-minority rule. This is the second
time he has been hospitalized this year after undergoing
abdominal surgery in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
