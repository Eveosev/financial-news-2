Obesity rates fell among U.S.
preschool-age children in 2010, reversing a trend of the past
decade, according to the first national study to spot a decline
in the condition among young kids.  The rate of obese 2- to 4-year-olds from low-income
families dropped 1.8 percent in 2010 from 2003, while it fell
6.8 percent for those who were extremely obese, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported in a research letter
published yesterday in the  Journal of the American Medical
Association .  Researchers attributed the decline to greater awareness of
health problems caused by obesity as well as an increase in
breastfeeding, which studies have shown can reduce the risk.
Obesity even at such a young age can set up children for
diabetes,  heart disease  and even premature death, said Heidi
Blanck, a study author.  “We’ve flipped from going up to really now showing a
decrease,” Blanck, acting director of the Division of
Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity at the Atlanta-based
CDC, said in a Dec. 21 telephone interview. “It’s a modest
decrease but at least we’ve changed the direction. We’re
optimistic that with recent investments and recent initiatives
we’ll continue to see these numbers decline.”  Previous studies had shown that obesity levels may have
reached a plateau in various age groups, she said.  Pediatric Surveillance  Researchers used data from the  Pediatric Nutrition
Surveillance System , which includes about 50 percent of children
eligible for U.S.-funded maternal and child health and nutrition
programs. The study included 27.5 million 2- to 4-year-olds from
30 states and the  District of Columbia .  The children were considered obese if their  body mass
index , a measure of height and weight, was at or above the 95th
percentile for kids of the same age and gender, while extreme
obesity was defined as having a body mass index at or above 120
percent of the 95th percentile. That means, a 3-year-old boy of
average height who weighs 37 pounds or more would be considered
obese, while a 3-year-old boy of average height who weighs 44
pounds or more would be extremely obese.  The prevalence of obesity dropped to 14.94 percent in 2010
from 15.21 percent in 2003, according to the report. It was
still higher than 13.05 percent in 1998. While the percentage of
preschoolers with extreme obesity declined to 2.07 percent in
2010 from 2.22 percent in 2003, it was still higher than 1.75
percent in 1998.  Of the 2.4 million included in the study in 2010, there
were 359,222 obese and 49,772 extremely obese U.S. preschoolers,
Blanck said.  More Breastfeeding  During the time the children in this study would have been
 breastfeeding , the number of low-income infants nursing jumped
more than 10 percent, she said.  “The trends of obesity and extreme obesity among U.S. low-
income, preschool-aged children changed around 2003,” Blanck
said. “I am optimistic that continued efforts to support
nursing mothers and improved obesity prevention resources for
parents and the nation’s childcare centers and early education
setting will help keep this downward trend a reality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
