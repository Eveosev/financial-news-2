Russia’s wider Volga region may lose
20 percent to 30 percent of winter grains due to frost and snow,
Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said.  Losses have been reported in Orenburg, Saratov, Penza and
Ulyanovsk, as well as in Volgograd in the Southern Federal
District, Dvorkovich said at a government meeting yesterday,
according to the government’s  website . Grains’ loss is because
of frosts and thin snow layer, he said.  Dvorkovich ordered the allocation of additional funds for
re-seeding where needed in the spring, according to the
statement. Nationwide, winter grain loss is estimated at about 8
percent of 9 percent, which is about average, Dvorkovich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
