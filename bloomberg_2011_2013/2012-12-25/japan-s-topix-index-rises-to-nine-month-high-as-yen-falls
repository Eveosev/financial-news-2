Japanese stocks rose, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  headed for its biggest monthly gain since February, as a
weaker yen buoyed exporters amid optimism incoming Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will increase pressure on the central bank
to do more to end deflation.  Honda Motor Co. gained 1 percent after the yen touched a
20-month low versus the dollar. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. added 1.8 percent, leading  Japan ’s biggest banks higher.
Nippon Express Co. jumped 4.3 percent after the freight company
said it will buy back shares.  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  sank 4.3
percent after the electronics maker said it may pay a penalty
for overcharging on some contracts.  The Topix rose 0.6 percent to close at 838.01 in  Tokyo ,
poised for a 7.2 percent advance this month, its biggest monthly
increase since an 11 percent gain in February. About three
stocks gained for every two that fell on the measure. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average increased 1.4 percent to 10,080.12. Japan’s
stock markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  “Stocks are holding up on optimism for a weaker yen and
more monetary easing after Abe said he’ll consider revising the
law governing the Bank of Japan unless they adopt a higher
inflation target,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at
Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees about $6.3 billion.
“Financial shares are rising on monetary easing and reflation
optimism. For instance banks are rising on optimism monetary
easing will boost borrowing.”  The Topix is set for a 15 percent increase this year, its
biggest yearly gain since 2005, when the index surged 44
percent. The measure traded at 1 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can
be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Inflation Target  Liberal  Democratic Party  leader Abe said on Fuji Television
on Dec. 23 that he will consider revising the law governing the
 Bank of Japan  if it fails to set an inflation target of 2
percent at its January meeting.  The LDP chief is poised to become prime minister in a
special session of the lower house of parliament tomorrow after
his party’s coalition secured a majority in this month’s
elections, sweeping the Democratic Party of Japan from power.  Exporters gained after the yen declined against all 16 of
its major counterparts yesterday, touching 84.96 per dollar, the
weakest since April 11, 2011.  Honda Motor Co., which counts  North America  as its biggest
market for sales, gained 1 percent to 3,030 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, increased 2.1 percent to 3,375
yen.  Financials Gain  “The yen has extended losses on the back of Abe’s
comments,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc. “Exporters, especially auto and high-tech
shares, are going to be bought as investors expect better
currency margins. With conditions improving, financial shares
are likely to keep playing catch-up and we will see a rally
across the board.”  Financial shares also advanced on optimism that an end to
deflation will increase loan demand. Mitsubishi UFJ, the
country’s biggest bank, gained 1.8 percent to 446 yen, the
biggest boost on the Topix. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. rose 1.4
percent to 149 yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s biggest
brokerage, gained 6.3 percent to 458 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 3.5 percent
to 20.99, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Among other stocks that rose, Nippon Express jumped 4.3
percent to 337 yen. The company may spend as much as 20 billion
yen ($236 million) to buy back 7.67 percent of its shares
between Jan. 4 and Oct. 31, the company said in a statement on
Dec. 21.  Mitsubishi Electric sank 4 percent to 714 yen. The company
cut its net-income forecast by 58 percent to 50 billion yen
after saying it may pay a penalty after it overcharged Japan’s
 Defense Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
