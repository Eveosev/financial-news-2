Taiwan ’s government bonds were
little changed, with the 10-year yield approaching the highest
level in almost three months, after the country said it will
increase debt sales next quarter. The local dollar gained.  Issuance will rise to NT$275 billion ($9.5 billion) in the
next three months, 22.2 percent more than the same period of
2012, according to a statement from the Ministry of Finance Dec.
22. The offerings will include 15-year securities, the first of
that maturity since 2005. The central bank left  interest rates 
unchanged at 1.875 percent on Dec. 19 and governor Perng Fai-nan
said economic growth will be “steady and slow” next year as
exports and private investment recover.  “The market is still reacting on more sales and the rare
15-year bond auction in 2013,” said Samon Tu, a Taipei-based
 fund manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp., which
oversees $700 million. “Lingering concern over the prospect of
economic growth will stop the yields from rising too much.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was
little changed at 1.159 percent as of 9:29 a.m. local time,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched 1.16 percent
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 2. Borrowing costs on
benchmark 10-year bonds dropped 13 basis points in 2012.  Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to NT$29.049 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The
currency has appreciated 4.3 percent this year, poised for a
fourth annual gain. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell
five basis points to 2.95 percent. It was 6.30 percent at the
end of 2011.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
