  BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese carmaker
partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., agreed
with the government of Yulin to develop a 500-megawatt solar
power plant in the city in China’s northwestern province of
Shaanxi.  The project will be completed in three phases, the company
said today in an e-mailed statement. The first phase of 200
megawatts is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2013. The
investment amount wasn’t disclosed.  The plan is the latest by the Shenzhen-based company to
expand its renewable energy business. BYD said it supplied 110
megawatts of solar modules to South Africa last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
