Thailand ’s baht touched a two-week
low as the year-end deadline approached in a budget-deficit
showdown in the U.S., raising concern a recession in the world’s
biggest economy may reduce demand for riskier assets.  The currency is set to rise this quarter, after a 3 percent
gain in the previous three months. President  Barack Obama  and
Republicans try to reach an agreement to avert more than $600
billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to
begin in January. House Speaker John Boehner scrapped a plan
last week to allow higher tax rates on incomes above $1 million,
and lawmakers left  Washington  for the Christmas holiday.  “Fiscal cliff has been the market’s main concern, and
Asian currencies will continue to react on this development,”
said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based fund manager at Uni-President
Assets Management Corp., which oversees $700 million. “It’s
Christmas and volumes are exceptionally low in the market.”  The baht was little changed at 30.63 against the greenback
as of 3:02 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 30.69 earlier, the weakest level since
Dec. 12. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at
3.92 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent government bonds due June
2023 fell one basis point to 3.54 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
