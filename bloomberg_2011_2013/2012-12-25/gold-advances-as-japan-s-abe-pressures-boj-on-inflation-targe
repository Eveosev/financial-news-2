Gold futures climbed in  Tokyo  for
the first time in four days as incoming Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe pressured the central bank to raise its inflation
target, boosting demand for bullion as a safe haven.  Bullion for delivery in October advanced 1.2 percent to
close at 4,517 yen per gram ($1,657 an ounce) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent
to $1,663.15 an ounce. Markets in the U.S. and U.K. are closed
for Christmas Day.  Abe of Japan’s  Liberal Democratic Party  said over the
weekend he may amend the law governing the  Bank of Japan  if it
fails to set a higher inflation target, driving the yen down 0.8
percent yesterday. The yen touched 84.96 per dollar, the weakest
since April 2011. Gold has increased 6.4 percent this year,
heading for a 12th straight annual gain.  “Gold was partly supported by Japan’s inflation target
news,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research
at IDO Securities Co. In Japan, the weaker yen also lent support
to Tocom futures, he said.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.6 percent to $30.08 an
ounce. Spot platinum was up 0.2 percent at $1,536.90 and
palladium was unchanged at $685.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
