Iran ’s naval forces will conduct a
military exercise this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a
chokepoint for 20 percent of the world’s traded oil, Iranian
Navy Commander Habibollah Sayari said.  The six-day exercise, which will starts on Dec. 28, will
also be held in the Sea of Oman and in the north of the  Indian
Ocean , Sayari said today, according to the state-run  Fars  news
agency. The drill will involve testing defensive and missile
systems, combat vessels and submarines, and is aimed at
“identifying and combating threats,” he was cited as saying
without elaborating.  Iran regularly announces progress in its domestically built
military equipment and routinely holds military exercises to
display its readiness in the face of perceived threats by the
U.S. and  Israel . Iranian military officials announced in Sept.
plans to hold a military exercise in the country’s southern
waters before the end of the Iranian calendar year on March 20,
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
