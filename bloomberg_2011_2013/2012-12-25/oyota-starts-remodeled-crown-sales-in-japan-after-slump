Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  began selling a
redesigned Crown, its oldest sedan still in production, today in
 Japan  in a bid to boost sales that have tumbled more than 75
percent in the past two decades.  The 14th-generation Crown starts at 3.53 million yen
($41,600), the company, Asia’s  biggest carmaker , said in a
statement today. The sedan has a 2.5-liter hybrid engine,
compared with a 3.5-liter hybrid engine for the current model.  Toyota targets deliveries of 4,000 of the sedans a month in
Japan, according to the statement, compared with sales averaging
17,000 a month in 1990. The model is known in the country for
its use as a company limousine and for police and government
officials.  “To attract people to the car today, we had to redesign
it,” President  Akio Toyoda  told reporters today in Tokyo.  The Crown remained Toyota’s flagship luxury car in Japan
after it introduced the  Lexus  in the U.S. in 1989 to compete
with Daimler AG’s Mercedes and Bayerische Motoren Werke Ag.
Toyota brought Lexus to Japan in 2005. The make was the top-
selling luxury car brand in the U.S. for 11 years until it was
unseated by BMW last year.  Toyota fell 0.1 percent, paring its gain this year to 47
percent, to 3,780 yen in Tokyo trading today. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.4 percent, bringing its
advance this year to 19 percent.  “Among Japanese seniors, the Crown still symbolizes
luxury, and still carries the image as the CEO’s car,” said
 Toshihiro Nagahama , chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Insurance
Research Institute.  To contact the reporters on this story:
