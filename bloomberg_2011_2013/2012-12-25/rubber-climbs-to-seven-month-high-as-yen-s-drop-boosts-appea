Rubber advanced to the highest level
since May as a weak Japanese currency boosted the appeal of yen-
based contracts, and a rally in Chinese stocks raised optimism
the world’s second-largest economy will pick up.  Rubber for delivery in June, the most-active by volume,
gained 1.6 percent to settle at 292.1 yen a kilogram ($3,445 a
metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the highest since
May 10. Futures have advanced 11 percent this year.  The yen fell to 84.96 per dollar, the weakest since April
2011, after incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will
consider changing the law governing the  Bank of Japan  unless it
boosts its inflation target next month. Chinese equities rose,
with a benchmark gauge wiping out losses this year.  “A weak yen gave the biggest support,” Takaki Shigemoto,
an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone
today. “Optimism about China’s economic expansion is also
bolstering the futures.”  China is due to release figures this week on November
profit for industrial companies, following an over 20 percent
surge for earnings in October. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
rallied 2.5 percent today.  Abe agreed with a coalition ally on a policy package that
includes “bold monetary easing” to reach inflation of 2
percent. Abe is poised to become prime minister tomorrow after
his  Liberal Democratic Party ’s coalition won a majority in
parliamentary lower house elections on Dec. 16.  Rubber for May delivery gained 0.7 percent to close at
25,250  yuan  ($4,051) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Natural-rubber inventories gained 1,770 tons to 97,697 ton, the
highest since March 2010, based on a survey of nine warehouses
in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the bourse
said Dec. 21.  Thai rubber free-on-board advanced 0.3 percent to 96.60
baht ($3.15) a kilogram, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
