Asiacell Communications PJSC, the
Iraqi telecom operator majority-owned by  Qatar Telecom (QTEL)  QSC,
plans to raise 1.49 trillion dinars ($1.3 billion) in the  Middle
East ’s biggest initial public offering in more than four years.  Some of Asiacell’s founding shareholders will offer 67.503
billion shares, or 25 percent of its equity, at a minimum of 22
dinars a share, the Sulaymaniyah-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The offer opens on Jan. 3 and closes on
Feb. 2 and is open to all individuals and institutions with a
trading account in Iraq, according to the statement.  Asiacell’s Baghdad IPO will be the biggest in the Middle
East and North Africa since Saudi Arabian Mining Co., or Maaden,
raised $2.5 billion in  Riyadh  in June 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Asiacell obtained a 15-year mobile
telecommunications license in 2007 and had 43 percent market
share by revenue at the end of September with 9.9 million
individual and corporate subscribers, it said in the statement.  “Based on our estimates, the stock will IPO at roughly 9.7
times 2012 earnings,” Geoffrey Batt, who manages the $39
million Euphrates Iraq Fund, said in an e-mail from  New York 
today. “It’s not cheap enough to keep people up at night, and
the sellers probably think they’re leaving money on the table.”  Doha-based  Qatar Telecom , known as Qtel, agreed this year
to double its stake in the Iraqi mobile-telephone operator to 60
percent for $1.47 billion. Qtel, which owns stakes in companies
from  Tunisia to Indonesia , has sought to grow outside its home
market, where it faces competition from  Vodafone Qatar. (VFQS)   ‘Growing Business’  Asiacell, which mainly offers prepaid mobile phone
services, had net income of 474 billion dinars in the nine
months through September compared with 505 billion dinars in
2011, according to the statement. Revenue was 1.56 trillion
dinars compared to 1.84 trillion dinars, respectively.  “We’ve built a stable and growing business across Iraq,”
Faruk Rasool, Asiacell’s managing director, said in the
statement. “Iraq’s mobile industry continues to grow and we
look forward to welcoming a new set of investors in 2013.”  The 22-dinar offer price translates to a price-earnings
multiple of about 11.8 based on the company’s 2011 earnings,
according to Bloomberg calculations. Parent Qatar Telecom trades
at a multiple of 9.74 to its 2011 earnings.  Asiacell shares will list on the  Iraq  Stock Exchange on
Feb. 3, according to the statement. Rabee Securities, a local
brokerage, is the sole distributor of the offer, while Melak
Iraq is the financial adviser to Asiacell on the sale.  Mideast IPOs  The MENA region’s IPO pipeline may be improving after Saudi
companies helped the region more than double sales this year to
$2 billion, Ernst & Young International said Dec. 23. Share
sales in the region gained from $844 million in 2011 “hinting
that the markets are inching towards better results,” it said.  “Asiacell, arguably, is the best of the three Iraqi mobile
telecoms, and local money could view it as a prize asset,” Batt
said. “If regional demand supplements local buying, then I’d
wager there’s a good chance the IPO is fully subscribed by the
end of January.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
